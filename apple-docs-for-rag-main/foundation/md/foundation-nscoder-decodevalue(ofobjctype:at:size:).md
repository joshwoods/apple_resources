Instance Method

# decodeValue(ofObjCType:at:size:)

Decodes a single value of a known type from the specified data buffer.

iOS 11.0+iPadOS 11.0+Mac Catalyst 13.1+macOS 10.13+tvOS 11.0+visionOS 1.0+watchOS 4.0+

``` source
func decodeValue(
    ofObjCType type: UnsafePointer,
    at data: UnsafeMutableRawPointer,
    size: Int
)
```

## Parameters 

`type`  

The Objective-C type to decode.

`data`  

The data buffer to decode from.

`size`  

The size of the data buffer.

## Discussion

The `type` parameter must contain exactly one type code, and the buffer specified by `data` must be large enough to hold the value corresponding to that type code. For information on creating an Objective-C type code suitable for `type`, see Type Encodings.

Subclasses must override this method and provide an implementation to decode the value. In your overriding implementation, decode the value into the buffer beginning at data.

This method matches an encodeValue(ofObjCType:at:) message used during encoding.
