WEBVTT

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome product line manager,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.010
server software, Apple computer,
Eric Zelenkka.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.910
Good afternoon.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.520
Welcome to session 801.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.130
My name is Eric Zelenka.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.430
I work in the product
marketing group at Apple and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.200
responsible for server software.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.140
It's good to see a nice turnout here.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.800
How many of you were able to attend
the keynote session this morning?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.600
After the keynote, we gave out this.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.420
Mac OS X Server, Jaguar,
the developer preview.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.010
We're really pleased to
get this into your hands.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.980
What we're here today to talk
about is the Jaguar server,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.100
and specifically some of the new
features and technologies that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.800
are included in the Jaguar server,
and really what Apple's long-term

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.330
direction for server software is,
and some of the benefits of

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.220
our technology and how you can
take advantage of it and build

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.360
applications for Mac OS X Server.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.260
So again, we'll be discussing
Apple's server strategy,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.600
some of the new features
in Jaguar server.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.120
We'll have some demos
of some of the features.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.200
will discuss how Mac OS X Server is
different from Mac OS X,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.900
specifically Jaguar Server and Jaguar,
and, again, the developer opportunities,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.640
and leave plenty of time at the
end for question and answer.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.760
So let's look back at the schedule.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.510
Where has Apple come?

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.500
Really, where is Apple going, too?

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.870
It was only a year ago,
here at this conference,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.350
2001 Developer Conference,
that we released

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.550
Mac OS X Server version 10.0.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.790
Since then, we've been pretty busy.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.700
In September,
we came out with the 10.1 version,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.150
and really focused on
improving the performance,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.260
the reliability,
and the scalability of the product.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.600
Today, we've released into your
hands the developer preview

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.760
version of Jaguar Server,
and later this summer,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.820
we're planning to ship Jaguar
Server to our customers.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.240
Well, where is Apple going with servers?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.850
When you think of Apple Computer,
you don't normally think of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.730
Apple as a server company.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.020
Apple's goal with servers
is to deliver innovative,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.660
scalable server solutions.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.460
We would really like our
products to be the premier,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.030
high-performance,
easy-to-use server for both the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.960
networking and internet solutions.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.620
We also think that we can use servers
to improve the user experience.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.550
Let me talk about this for a second.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.910
If you think about it,
servers play a really

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.730
critical role in a network.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.100
You use servers for, you know,
storing your email,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.560
maybe home directories,
sharing files with other people,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.400
watching a video broadcast.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.830
Servers are accessing directory services.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.210
Servers really play a key role
in the computing experience that

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.680
we have on the Macintosh today.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.690
And it's Apple's philosophy that
we can use servers to continue to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.180
improve the computing experience.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.940
For Macintosh users.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.770
So a lot of the features that
we've delivered in Jaguar

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.650
Server are meant to do just that.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.380
To continue to improve the desktop,
the computing experience

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.940
for Macintosh users.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.940
Before setting out to
build Jaguar Server,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.600
we came up with a couple goals.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.300
Number one goal is we wanted to use the
server to make it easy to deploy and

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.620
manage lots and lots of Mac OS X systems.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.900
We wanted to use the server to enable,
you know, the perfect workgroup,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.510
as it were.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.860
Again, I mentioned we wanted to improve
the computing experience,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.820
specifically for Macintosh users.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.440
We also wanted to integrate well
with existing enterprise networks,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.450
and at the same time,
continue to deliver the best-of-breed

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.180
internet and networking services.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.300
So what's new?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.000
Let me ask you a question.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.030
Who here has had a chance to
install Jaguar Server at lunchtime?

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.130
No one?

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.670
Okay.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.300
Well, if you would have
installed Jaguar Server,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.470
you would have noticed right up front
some of the new features in the product,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.820
and we'll be talking about these today.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.680
First of all, we continue to optimize the
server operating system.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.270
We've really placed a lot of importance
on the network file services,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.320
specifically read and write performance.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.910
This is a key area
that we're focusing on.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.780
Greater multiprocessor scalability
for dual-processor systems.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.700
We want to more efficiently
take advantage of both of the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.340
processors that are there.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.020
And we also want to provide
faster gigabit Ethernet support.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.340
In the keynote this morning,
Steve mentioned that we are including

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.540
a version of the Java virtual machine
that's customized for server use.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.340
So this is useful if you're
building WebObjects applications

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.150
that you're hosting on the server,
or you're deploying Java servlets or

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.940
Java server pages with Mac OS X Server.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.040
The enhancements and the performance
increases that we've done here

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.390
will make it much faster for you to
host Java server-side applications.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.840
Apple File Services are a
core feature of the server,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.080
and again, we've continued to improve the
performance and the scalability

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.100
of the Apple File Services.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.170
Jaguar Server includes enhanced
support for AFP home directories.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.600
We also introduced a new
version of the protocol,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.090
version 3.1.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.390
The 3.1 protocol has a
number of features to it,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.500
one of which we call Auto Reconnect.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.400
Auto Reconnect is a really great feature.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.720
If you are from a Jaguar client,
if you mount a volume

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.580
from a Jaguar server,
that volume is there on your desktop.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.560
And even if you don't interact
with that volume very often,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.030
or you sleep your PowerBook and
you wake your PowerBook back up,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.290
that volume is there.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.210
It's still there.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.240
You don't get the disconnect messages.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.340
after long periods of inactivity.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.570
We've also added secure file
sharing support to our server,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.180
allowing Macintosh clients,
Jaguar clients,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.610
to securely connect to Jaguar servers.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.860
And this is an encrypted connection
that we actually tunnel through SSH.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.680
We've had a lot of customer requests
to make it possible to reshare

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.340
NFS mounts using the server.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.860
So one of the other new features
that we provide is NFS resharing.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.360
This has a number of...
NFS resharing via AFP.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.530
This has a number of benefits
to users on a network.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.010
Not only can you use the
AFP authentication services to provide

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.860
stronger authentication for NFS,
but you can also make NFS volumes

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.620
available to other clients,
such as Mac OS 9 clients,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.340
who don't have an NFS client
built into the operating system.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.860
and to support enterprise networks,
enterprise networks that

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.290
have deployed Kerberos,
we support Kerberos

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.060
version 5 authentication.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.330
As you know,
Mac OS X Server today provides

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:48.490
print services for Macintosh,
Windows, Unix, and Linux clients.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.100
We, again,
continue to improve these print services.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.510
Jaguar Server has support
for AppleTalk sharing,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.930
so we can now share these print
queues via the AppleTalk protocol.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.040
So if you're on a Mac OS X machine,
you can print to the

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.750
server using AppleTalk.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.160
Also, if you're on a Mac OS 9 machine,
the print queues show up in the chooser,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.320
and you can just print in the
LaserWriter 8 driver there in the

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.970
chooser directly to the server.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.060
We also added support for print quotas.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:22.610
These are quotas that can be set up
on a per-user or a per-printer basis.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:35.770
Mac OS X Server version 10.1, a year ago,
was the very first operating system

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.660
we released that really had a unified
directory services architecture.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:47.610
And directory services are really
a way for storing and managing lots

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.490
of different types of information.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.540
We use it for storing users, groups,
information,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.630
and also computer information.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.820
You could think of a directory
service as a database of shared

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.340
information that lives on a server,
or is even mirrored

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.690
between multiple servers.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.540
Today we've announced Open Directory.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.440
So Steve mentioned it
briefly during the keynote,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.200
but let's discuss it a little bit more.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:20.440
Open Directory is Apple's standards-based
directory service architecture.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.430
It's an extensible architecture,
and it allows for easy integration

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.570
with enterprise directory services.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:34.350
Open Directory uses standards such as
LDAP and the SASL for authentication,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.280
and it also has a wide variety
of authentication methods,

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.840
some of which are NT Land Manager,
CRAM MD5, and SHA-1,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.970
but there's a number of other
authentication methods we support.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.020
And with Open Directory,
you can have a shared name and

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.730
password that lives on the network
and allows you to go to a wide

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.820
variety of computers on your network,
log in against a central system,

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.890
and access your resources,
whether it be your home directory

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.660
or file services or something
else that's on the network.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.340
So today we're happy to announce
that Apple is open sourcing,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.920
or making it available to
the open source community,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.580
Open Directory.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:21.140
Today we've posted the current
implementation of Open Directory,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.740
the directory services,
the LDAP version 2 plugin,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.680
NetInfo plugin,
and our search policy plugin

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.350
on the Darwin website.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.220
And when Jaguar releases,
we're planning to open source a number of

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.920
additional components of Open Directory,
including our LDAP v3 read-write plugin,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.980
a BSD configuration file plugin for read
access to files that are in slash Etsy,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.220
and also a number of
service discovery plugins.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.640
So this is kind of an
architectural diagram of what

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.330
Open Directory looks like.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.260
There's a couple different
parts to Open Directory.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.680
One is what we call
Open Directory Access.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:08.760
And Open Directory Access is really
a mechanism for applications,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.740
maybe they're applications
that run on the desktop,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.220
or server-side applications,
to call and access, via single API,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.240
call and access data that
lives on other directories,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.680
whether it be an LDAP directory,
a NetInfo directory,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.770
or some other directory
that you have a plug-in for.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.950
Thank you.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.160
Then there's the Open Directory Server.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.370
The Open Directory Server is
something that's included in

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.090
Mac OS X Server or Jaguar Server,
and it provides support for

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.020
LDAP and NetInfo clients,
so via both the LDAP and

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.640
NetInfo protocol,
you can access data that's

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.920
in the Open Directory.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:53.010
And Open Directory has a shared database,
so whether you're accessing, again,

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.590
via NetInfo or the LDAP protocols,
both requests are talking

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.080
to the same database.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.080
So you can use an LDAP tool to modify
data in the directory or a NetInfo

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.120
tool to modify data in the directory.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.610
It's all coming out of
the same shared database.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.640
Another component of
Open Directory is the password server.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.160
The password server provides
secure password authentication

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.030
and policy enforcement.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.680
So you may want,
as a network administrator,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.800
you may want to set up
various password policies,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.000
force users to change
password at the next login,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.600
disable user accounts,
enforce minimum password links,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.750
and maybe if there's users
that are on your network that

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.510
haven't logged in for a while,
maybe you want to disable them as well.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.830
We support all these things
in the password server.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.270
As I mentioned earlier,
we want Mac OS X Server to enable

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.410
the perfect Mac OS X workgroup.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.080
Well, how are we doing this?

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.920
One of the ways is with something
we call the Workgroup Manager.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.410
Workgroup Manager makes it easy
to set up and manage users,

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.660
groups, and computers.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.860
It allows you as a network administrator
to control access to certain

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.780
software and hardware features.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.910
And we've really designed this
for both desktops and portables,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.580
so it's very flexible for deploying.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.430
Workgroup Manager allows for,
when you set up a

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.650
workgroup on the server,
we actually create a groups directory,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.280
and your workgroup is part
of this group's directory.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.940
And when you log into Mac OS X or Jaguar,
it'll come up and ask you,

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.200
which group do you want to be in?

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.420
And you as a user have the option to say,
I'm in this group.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.840
And it'll log you into that group,
and you'll get all those preferences

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.530
and permissions of that group.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.150
You could even use the workgroup manager
to impose disk quotas on the server,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:03.510
controlling how much storage
a user has on the server.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.810
So what types of things can you
control with the Workgroup Manager?

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.980
Again, I mentioned that the Workgroup
Manager allows you to control users,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.240
groups, and computer lists.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.880
So those are the three data types
that I can assign things to.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:24.800
And to each of these groups,
each of these types, I can impose access

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:31.840
policies for applications,
which applications can a user launch.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.480
I can control which system
preferences are displayed.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.700
I have full access and full control
over the classic system preferences.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.700
I can control media access.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.010
Can a user plug in a USB drive?

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.550
Can they plug in a FireWire drive?

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:51.590
Should it mount?

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.820
What happens if a user puts a CD in?

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.700
Do I allow them to burn?

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.100
Do I allow them to mount the CD?

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.330
I can even prevent them
from ejecting a CD.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.800
I can control the display of the dock.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.890
Should it be on the right?

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:06.580
Should it be on the left?

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.350
Should it be on the bottom?

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.270
What size should it be?

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:10.970
What items should be in the dock?

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.300
This is actually a really cool feature.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.780
You have a workgroup,
and you want to say,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.120
everyone inside this workgroup
has the same items in the dock.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.260
Oops.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.540
And I can put both applications
and documents in the doc.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.740
I can have network control
over finder preferences,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.380
finder commands, internet preferences,
login items.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.180
Login items is a nice thing.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.150
You may have a group,
and every time a user

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.540
logs into this group,
you may want to have certain

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.710
applications automatically launched.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.190
We can even control printers.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.290
Which printers are automatically
assigned to computers?

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.900
You can have a bunch of printers.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.220
Which printer is the default printer?

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.210
I can control printing.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.220
Which printers can a user print to?

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.860
Which can't they print to?

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.390
And I can even require a level
of administrator access to

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.660
print to some types of printers.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.180
So if you have a very expensive printer,
a color printer,

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.450
or an image setter printer,
you may want to control who

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.440
can access which printers.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.780
Thank you.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.330
So to make all this stuff possible,
we've built a couple

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.600
different applications.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.240
One we call Server Manager,
and it provides management

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.630
and administration tools.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.200
I'll show you a little
bit more in a second.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.830
and also a server status application for
remote monitoring of the server activity.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.500
And that server status will be
demonstrated a little bit more

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.190
in the following presentation.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.390
And then the Workgroup Manager portion
allows you to control workgroup

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.000
preferences and policies and permissions.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.130
So let's have a demo.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.390
of Server Manager and some
of the workgroup management

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.650
tools that we provide.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:02.650
Let's go to demo machine number two.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.900
So this application here that
I have launched is Server Manager.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:12.900
And if you notice this application here,
I have control over accounts.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.260
So this is users' accounts,
group accounts, and computer accounts.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.750
So if I click users, I can click groups.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.110
I can see various groups that
are assigned to the server,

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.130
even computers that you
want the server to manage.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.610
The key point here is that the
data I'm administering from this

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.240
application lives in the directory.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.940
So the directory could
be a NetInfo server,

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.840
it could be an LDAP server,
it could be our open

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.540
directory LDAP server,
it could be an iPlanet server,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.480
it could be an open LDAP server.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.940
It doesn't matter what the directory is.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.370
As long as we support it,
and I have right access

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.570
into that directory,
I can use these tools to manage my data.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.620
the data in that directory.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.250
So the first thing I'm going
to do here is I'm going to

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.080
create a new user account.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.760
And I'm just going to call this Austin,
because that's my son's name.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.790
It's a good name.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.920
So I've set up a new user on the server,
and I'm going to go into

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.400
a couple of these tabs,
and I'm going to say,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.920
when this user logs in,
don't show the workgroups.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.540
I can give this user a login shell.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.430
I can...

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:38.190
I can specify whether I want this
user to get its password policies from

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.190
the open directory password server.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.900
I can pick which groups
this user should be in.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.150
Should they be in a math group?

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.480
Should they be in an English group?

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.000
Should they be in the sales group,
or the marketing group,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.080
or the engineering group?

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.400
I can set up where their
home directory lives.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.400
I pick local,
it's gonna mean it's a local,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.020
a home directory local to this server,
and I'm gonna specify which directory

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.770
their home directory will be created in.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.400
I can even use this interface to impose
a disk quota on how much data the user

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.990
can store in their home directory.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.870
And because I want to manage this user,
I'm going to show you

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.090
this in a little bit.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.040
I'm going to say that I want to put the
user's preferences in the directory,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.510
and I'm going to control some of
these preferences about the user.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.290
Let's go ahead and save this.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.820
And the next thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to go over

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.600
to this Preferences button,
and with Austin still clicked,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.370
I'm going to set up some preferences.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.330
I'm going to go to the Dock,
and let's go to Dock Items,

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:41.060
and I want to control what items appear
in the user's dock when they log in.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.580
So I'm going to set
these to Manage Always.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:50.400
I'm going to add Calculator and
let's make this a little bigger.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.760
TextEdit and Mail and Internet.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.320
Add a couple of applications here.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.800
So I'll apply those.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:04.780
And let's go back and let's
put the dock on the right.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:13.000
Now, when this user logs in,
I want to have an application

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.320
automatically launched.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.700
So I can go to this Login Items here,
and I'm going to assign a

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.410
certain application to launch.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.050
Let's just pick TextEdit, for example.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.920
We'll apply that, and I'll click Done.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.490
I have a number of other
features within this interface,

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.620
some of which are implemented in
this version of Jaguar Server,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.670
some of which are not.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.660
But I can control which
applications the user can launch,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.130
which applications they can access.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.540
I can even control, I don't know if you
can see this down here,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.460
whether they can launch applications
at a local volume or not,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.630
or whether one application can
sub-launch another application.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.880
I can also control which system
preferences this user sees when

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.080
they log into the computer.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.600
So there may be certain system
preferences I don't want them to

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.620
be able to administer themselves.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.400
And I also have control
over media access.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.440
Again, I mentioned this earlier.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.940
What happens when they insert
some form of removable media,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.270
whether it be a CD or a DVD or
a USB drive or a FireWire drive,

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.690
that type of thing?

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.460
Okay, so let's,
now that we have this done,

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.800
make sure my settings are right here.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:42.660
Okay, now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go to Demo 1 Machine.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.590
On Demo 1 Machine.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.630
Here we go.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.230
So,
at the login window on Demo 1 Machine,

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:57.280
I see this user account called Austin,
and I'm going to log in to that user.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.740
So again, this is a Jaguar,
Jaguar desktop connecting

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.630
to Jaguar server,
and the user's home directory

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.850
lives on the server.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.510
So this is the first time this
machine's ever connected to the server.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.780
And it's automatically gone
and created a home directory.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.470
So this is the home directory
for the user on the server,

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.180
and you'll notice that those applications
that we specified are in the doc,

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.550
and I have text edit
automatically launching.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.950
So that's very cool.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.100
So again,
Workgroup Manager is all about creating

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.900
the perfect Mac OS X workgroup and
allowing system administrators to

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.110
impose some level of restrictions
and control on what the user can do.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.450
One of the challenges
for us here is that,

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.970
as a network administrator,
you may want to impose control

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.450
and restrictions upon users so
they don't screw up a machine.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.460
But at the same time,
you want the user not to know that those

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.770
restrictions are being imposed upon them.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.120
So you want to make a very
smooth experience for them.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.310
So these are all challenges
that we've had to deal with,

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.940
but I think it works
really well in the product.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.600
We're also announcing that Jaguar
Server will support Netboot for Mac OS X.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.120
Netboot... Thank you.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.070
Netboot allows you to really
simplify the administration

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.120
and reduce your support costs.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.000
With NetBoot, you can take an image and
place it on the server.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.520
And this image contains the operating
system and all the other configurations

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.450
that a machine needs to boot.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.040
Think of it as the operating
system for a machine.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.280
It lives on the server.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.980
And when you want to up...
And all the machines on your

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.070
network can boot off that image,
that NetBoot image that

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.360
lives on the server.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.420
So this is really nice because it
allows you to standardize the deployment

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.430
of machines across your network.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.440
When you want to update all
the machines in your network,

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.560
you don't have to go to each
individual computer and update them.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.950
You can do them at one place.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.820
You update the image
that lives on the server,

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.200
and then simply restart
each of the computers,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.100
and they'll restart and load the
brand-new version of the operating system

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.060
or the new updates off the network.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.500
Some of the new things that
we've done with Netboot,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.800
we now allow the server
to host multiple images.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.720
The server can have multiple
images on the server.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.910
And these images are actually now in,
like, disk copy format.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.200
So it's very easy to get in there and
change the configurations if you need to.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.860
Thank you.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.020
Netboot is primarily used
for desktop computers.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:50.240
Because you are booting your
operating system across the wire,

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.690
it's primarily useful
for desktop situations.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.290
But portable users can also use Netboot.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.440
You can, as a network administrator,
build a Netboot image that lives on

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:11.220
the network that maybe includes disk
diagnostics tools and repair utilities.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.640
And when clients have problems,
even if they're an iBook

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.920
or a PowerBook user,
they can simply plug in an

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:22.900
Ethernet cable into the computer,
restart off this Netboot image

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.360
that lives on the network,
and now they can repair their local

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.230
machine without modifying any of
the data on their local machine.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.540
So Netboot is a very useful tool.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.980
It's something that we think
businesses and education environments

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.060
should take a greater look at
and start using and deploying.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.210
on their networks.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.810
NetBoot, again,
has a number of other benefits.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.010
You don't have to worry
about a machine changing.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.530
Let's say a user maybe installed
a virus on the machine or is

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.000
launching additional processes
that are running on the machine.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.480
You don't have to worry about that.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.300
To get that machine back
to a pristine state,

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.520
you simply go to the
machine and restart it,

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.860
and it'll get the fresh,
pristine image off the server.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.360
The next new service that
we're introducing in Jaguar

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.930
Server is called Network Install,
or Net Install.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.260
And thank you.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.860
Network install is an automated
network software installation service,

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.380
and it's great for installing or
restoring or upgrading computers

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.380
that live on your network.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.240
This is almost the perfect
tool for OS migrations,

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.100
for people moving from one OS to another.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.940
Basically,
it works in a similar fashion to Netboot.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.980
Actually, the base functionality
is based upon Netboot.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.000
You actually do boot off an
image that lives on the network.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.220
But instead of booting into the
finder or booting into login window,

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.700
Network Install boots
you into an installer.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.540
And the installer is
the Mac OS X installer

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.540
that we have in Jaguar.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:08.730
And the installer can be configured
for manual or automated installations.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.730
Basically, it works like this.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:15.990
You have an XML file that contains
all the answers to all the questions

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.240
the installer is going to ask.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.280
Hopefully.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.280
And when you do the install,
the installer reads the XML file,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:29.870
and it says, "Okay, I agree, I agree,
I agree, I agree."

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.040
And at any point in there,
it can come up and stop and

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.460
require user interaction.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.900
So maybe it stops and says, okay,
pick which disk you want

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.340
to be installed onto.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.860
Or whatever, at any point in there.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.070
And then it'll continue on and
finish with the installation.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.320
And it actually runs
through the installer,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.860
and it takes the Mac OS X packages
and installs them onto the local disk.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.960
But what's great about NetInstall is
that you can take your own packages,

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.920
your own packages that you've built,
and add to this image.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.680
And when it runs,
it will install your packages

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.420
on the local machine,
too.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.160
You could take your own custom scripts,
you know, scripts that you have

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.220
that customize a machine.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.150
And you could build them into one
of these packages that you place

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.860
in this network install image,
and place that on your network.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.960
And again, because it's based on Netboot,
you can have multiple images

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.400
that live on your network.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.600
So you can have one image for marketing,
one image for sales, one image for,

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.130
you know, a certain lab,
one image for a certain group.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.790
You can also use NetInstall
to deploy software updates.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.180
Again, these images don't have to
include the operating system.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.180
They can be just packages that
you want to deploy internally.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.890
Could be a copy of Final Cut Pro,
or it could be a software update.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.060
And by placing a software
update as one of these images,

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.410
now you can control which
software updates get applied

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:00.010
throughout your environment.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.350
These could be Apple software updates.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.380
They could be your own
software updates as well.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:09.120
But again, the purpose of NetInstall is
to make it easy to set up,

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.600
administer, and manage lots and lots
of Mac OS X machines.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:18.490
And again, the images are flexible,
so you can customize them at will.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.740
Mac OS X Server includes Apache.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:38.280
The current version 10.1 today
includes a version of Apache 1.3.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:42.780
We've again focused on system-wide
performance throughout Jaguar Server,

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:48.280
and we're roughly 4,800 connections
per second using the WebBench 3 test.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.600
So that's pretty fast.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:56.720
That's enough performance to saturate
about three or four T3 connections.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.250
In this release of Jaguar Server,
in Jaguar Server,

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.720
we're not planning to do
administration of Apache 2.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.470
We are going to include Apache 2 on disk,
but because Apache 2 is relatively new,

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.030
we weren't able to build
administration tools for it.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.980
So we're going to be focusing
on administration of Apache 1.3,

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.550
and including Apache 2.0 on disk.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.210
We've had a lot of customer
requests to improve the

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.260
capabilities of our mail server,
and this is something

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.380
that we continue to do.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.920
We've been making it more
reliable and more robust.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:40.100
We've been focusing
on relay restrictions,

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.790
SMTP relay restrictions,
to prevent junk mail or spam mail.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.040
In Jaguar Server,
we're introducing SSL IMAP support,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.550
so you can actually encrypt
the connections that are going

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.930
between the client and the server,
so no one can run a packet

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.140
analyzer on your network and see
the data going back and forth

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.800
between the client and the server.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.060
We also have added support
for storage quotas,

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.990
so you can say that this
user can only store a certain

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.960
amount of mail on the server.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.500
We'll be introducing a webmail
service with Jaguar Server.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.470
It's a standards-based
webmail that's written in PHP,

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.540
supports the IMAP and SMTP protocols.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:29.480
I think one of the greatest things
about it is it's pure HTML 4.0,

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.290
so there's no JavaScript,
so it has maximum compatibility with

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.810
all the browsers that are out there.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.300
You can access it with a
browser or portable PDA,

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.580
and includes rich MIME support,
address books, folder manipulation.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:55.200
One of the things that we try to do
with Mac OS X Server is provide a

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.600
number of high-availability services.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.200
And as you know,
with the current version of the product,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.440
we have some high-availability
services that are designed to

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.070
really maximize the server uptime.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.330
One of the new features that
we're introducing in Jaguar

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.350
Server is what we call IP Failover.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:18.850
This allows you to have two servers,
one IP address on one machine and

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.360
one IP address on the second machine.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.040
And when one server fails,
if it were to fail,

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.170
the other computer will
take over its IP address.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.920
And then when the server comes back up,
it'll gracefully hand

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.960
the IP address back.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.880
So we support one-way failover
and also two-way failover.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.370
This is a really interesting service.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.880
Today, we really recommend it for
read-only services that have

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.400
minimal replication needs.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.450
It can be a challenge sometimes to get
the back-end data store to synchronize.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.030
And also, another thing,
we do support e-mail notifications of

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.160
the entire failover and failback process,
so you can get notifications on

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.720
a pager or sent out to e-mail
that a certain computer went down

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.060
and that it's now come back up,
or that one server has taken over the

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.680
IP address for another on your network.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.380
Again, this is great for read-only data,
such as DNS servers or

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.200
caching proxy servers,
static websites,

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.560
quick-time streaming servers
that are broadcasting data,

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:26.360
or other services where replication
in the back-end storage isn't key.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.800
I mentioned earlier that
I wanted to spend some time

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.820
discussing the differences
between Jaguar Server and Jaguar,

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.270
just to make it clear what we're doing.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.480
Because at the heart,
we have one operating system,

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.720
but we really have two different
versions of the operating system.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.150
And we're trying to design
Mac OS X Server to be just that,

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.340
a great server.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.560
So, here's just some of the differences.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.380
We don't, you know,
focus on classic support.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.700
That's something that we
just don't do in the server.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.510
And, again,
in this slide shows we've really

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:11.380
optimized the core operating system,
the Java VM and the core

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.740
operating system for server use.

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:19.830
We include high-availability
services that the desktop doesn't.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:25.280
Again, designed for, you know,
highest availability of your servers.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.620
So we have hardware reboot,
auto-service restart

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.230
with the Watchdog Daemon,
and now IP failover.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.350
Thank you.

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:39.240
In the server, we also focus on remote
administration and monitoring.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.610
You want to remotely, from your,
you know, your desktop computer, um,

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.510
look at the server,
see what the state of it is, um,

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.940
get a status information, how,
how are the services doing,

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.740
how much load is my server taking.

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.300
Um, the server does log archiving.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.900
We do compression and
moving of logs periodically.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.460
Um, we're also doing, uh,
drive space monitoring.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.500
So when the drive gets too full, uh,
we can send out notifications

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.940
to the administrator,
letting them know of that.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.040
As you saw in the demo,
the server really focuses

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.020
on account management.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.700
So we manage user accounts,
group accounts, computer lists,

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.950
long names, long passwords,
home directory administration, quotas.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.870
These are all things that
are unique to the server.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.500
and directory and
authentication services.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.460
Jaguar server includes
the open directory server.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:36.170
We have the password server
for password policies.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.560
And both Jaguar and
Jaguar server include,

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:46.030
you know, L.V3 clients, NetInfo clients,
and can read data from BSD configuration

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.590
files that are stored in slash Etsy.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.960
So let's talk a little bit about
developing for Mac OS X Server.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.000
It's great that Apple has all
these features in the product,

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:06.050
but how do you as a developer
build a product and take

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.710
advantage of Mac OS X Server and
ultimately make money?

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.790
Well, first of all,
why would I build a product for

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.520
Mac OS X Server versus Mac OS X?

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.870
Well, you design your product for
Mac OS X Server if your product is

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.460
designed to be a network resource.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:27.040
You need absolute maximum reliability,
and it's not really an

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.720
end-user application.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.520
It can be something that
lives on the server.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.820
Maybe, you know, clients access it,
but it's really designed to be, you know,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.900
something that lives on a server.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.440
So it doesn't have to
run without a login user.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.000
It might be a BSD process, for example.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.010
You would also develop for
Mac OS X Server if your products

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.860
can take advantage of some of
the other services of the server,

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.960
maybe some of the network file services,
or you need to take advantage

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.280
of some of the high-availability
features that we have with,

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.590
you know,
the Watchdog and the IP Failover.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.440
So why develop for Mac OS X Server?

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.040
Apple is committed to servers.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.050
This wasn't always true in the past.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.630
If many of you have been in the
Apple community for several years,

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.570
you look at the statement,
"Apple is committed to

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.800
servers," and you're like,
"Okay, I don't really believe it."

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.500
Apple's been down the server road before.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.930
Apple's had server products and
never really gone anywhere with them.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.470
I think things are changing.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.980
You can see that with
Mac OS X Server today.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.780
You can see that with the release of
Jaguar Server to you in your hands today.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.800
Also,
the announcement at the keynote today

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.800
about the future of our server hardware.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.270
So Apple is truly committed to servers.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.780
We feel that servers can be used to,
again, build the perfect workgroups.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.850
Servers are used to help us
integrate with enterprise networks.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.330
And we are using servers
as infrastructure to

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:05.080
make it easier to manage,
minister, deploy Mac OS X systems.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.640
Again,
Mac OS X Server is specifically designed

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.670
to be a server operating system.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.690
Again, we have one operating system,
two different versions, Mac OS X,

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.770
Mac OS X Server.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.050
So this is a growing market.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.320
Apple's getting into the
server market more and more.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.580
And we have this motto, 5% down,
95% to go.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.330
And we really believe that.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:34.640
We believe that we can grow this market,
and going down the server path

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.150
is one way that we can do that.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.860
So this is a growth market for us,
and we recommend that you as a

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.740
developer come on board and build
products for Mac OS X Server.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.060
And as Steve mentioned at
the keynote earlier today,

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.970
Apple is or will become the
largest distributor of Unix.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.290
So we are out there.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:57.480
We are shipping more systems with
Unix on them than any other vendor.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.800
So what are some developer
opportunities for you?

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.950
Well, let's break them down.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:09.500
In the server management
and administrative category,

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.300
there's a lot of opportunities.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.300
There's log analysis, reporting,
and history.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.500
There's a lot of services
in Mac OS X Server,

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:21.400
and it would be great if a third party
such as yourself were to build log

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.870
analysis applications to parse through
that data and provide good reports.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.540
In the server monitoring
administration area,

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.920
we also have SNMP support,
so you could build an

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.020
MIB for the product,
and that would work as well.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.980
and Backup and Restore.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.380
Backup,
we've got a number of third parties

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.980
that have come to the platform
providing backup solutions,

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.220
but we want even more.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.700
As a developer,
you could build a middleware application.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.810
It could be a patching module,
a web service that you host,

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.820
web objects applications.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.110
Anyone who's doing
development with web objects,

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.880
you should take advantage of the server
to deploy those server-side applications.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.240
Also, database access,
accessing databases.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.500
There's room for additional
network file services.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.390
There's network file
services that we do not do,

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.870
and also local file services.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.410
The sessions this week talk
about the great file system

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.010
architecture that we have,
and how you can build your

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.600
own custom file services.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.200
Do things like journaling and
software RAID and that type.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:36.320
Also, logical volume management,
replication between disks.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:36.320
There's a lot of opportunities.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.870
You build a high-end
professional print solution,

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:47.080
a RIP that you send a job off to,
and it rips it out to a printer,

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.880
or does color separations.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.060
Print job accounting.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:55.350
There's also a really growing
market for Apple is in SciTech,

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.220
with distributed computing.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.290
Computational clusters, render forms,
these are all great areas for

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.720
you to come to the platform
and bring your products over.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.990
Eric Zelenk

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.850
In the Open Directory category,
you could build an

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.790
Open Directory access plugin.

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:19.570
You could build a plugin for
NIS and NIS+. Novell eDirectory

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.000
has a number of LDAP v3 extensions.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.970
You could build a plugin for that.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.620
You could build an
Open Directory access plugin that

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.950
does on-the-fly schema translation.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.880
Or it may be a custom directory
that you have deployed at your site.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.080
You might build a site-specific
directory service plugin.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:44.160
And again, you could build an open
directory administration tool,

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.390
something that calls into open directory,
that administers data

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.980
that lives in a directory.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.040
We're doing that with our
server manager application.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.760
You could build a similar application.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.360
I'll tell you a quick story for a second.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:01.630
I was able to take WebObjects
5.1 today with no code,

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.700
point it at an LDAP server,
and WebObjects, on the fly,

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.900
built me an entire user interface of
the data that lived in this LDAP server.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.330
And I had full access,
because I had write access into it,

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:18.050
I had full ability to create new records,
edit records, delete records,

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:19.520
and that's with no code.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:25.000
So, as a developer, writing code,
it's amazing all the tools that you'll

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.020
be able to build with this technology.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:33.380
Also,
there's some server hardware solutions,

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.020
RAID, storage arrays, UPS,
and backup devices.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.630
These are things that can be, you know,
across the platform.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.440
So, the rest of the week,
there's a number of sessions

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.960
that I really encourage you
to attend if you're interested

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.100
in finding more out about what
we're doing with Mac OS X Server.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.760
Following this session here, 801,
in this same room,

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.230
we'll have a session called
Mac OS X Server in Depth.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:07.090
and engineers will be up here,
and they'll be talking in great detail

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:11.240
about some of the new capabilities
that we provide in Jaguar Server.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.840
On Thursday, there'll be a session called
NetBoot and Network Install.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.840
If you're interested in finding
out how you can configure or

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:24.260
take advantage of these services,
please attend that session.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.020
Also, if you have an application,
and your application,

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.400
you'd like to support NetBoot
with your application,

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.420
that would be a good session to attend.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:35.990
Thursday, 8:13, Directory Services.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.730
Find out more about Open Directory,
how to build an

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:40.360
Open Directory access plugin.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:44.800
Also, find out more about the
Open Directory Server.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.120
Session 8.14,
Kerberos and Mac OS X on Thursday.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.420
Talk more about what we're doing
with Kerberos on the platform.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:59.400
Also, some of the new Kerberos features
that we have in Jaguar Server.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.990
Friday, 8:15,
Developing for the Managed Desktop.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:11.750
This is where you can find out how to
build a product that takes advantage

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.600
of Workgroup Manager and how to make
sure your product is compatible with

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.850
that so you don't have any conflicts.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.530
And then, of course, we have the server
feedback session on Friday.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.740
So if you have information,
if you have questions and are

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.980
wondering who to contact at
Apple for more information,

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.750
Tom Weier, he's in Developer Relations,
Networking Communications Evangelist,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.590
or you can contact myself.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.030
And there's our email addresses.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.940
There's the server feedback
session again on Friday.

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:52.630
And there's an email address that we
have called server-feedback at apple.com.

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:54.880
So if there's feedback
that you want to get,

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.280
you know, send to us about the server,
and you're not able to attend

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.260
the feedback session on Friday,
please send it to that email address.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.880
We have some more information
about Mac OS X Server,

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.560
specifically Jaguar Server.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.960
Let's see here.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:23.540
If you have your copy of Jaguar Server,
there's two CDs inside here.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.950
On the second CD is entitled Admin Tools,
and there's a very large

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.620
PDF in there that is the,
you know, it's a beta or draft version

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.900
of the documentation that
we're planning to provide with

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.740
Jaguar Server when it releases.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.240
So if you have questions about
some of the services or how to

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:45.000
set them up and how to deploy
them or you need more information,

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:49.260
take a look at the PDF that's
included on the Admin Tools CD.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.180
Also take a look at the
Mac OS X Server website.

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.640
There's a lot of documentation up there,
information about NetInfo, LDAP support,

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.320
and integrating with Active Directory.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:04.980
And also take a look at the
open source website for Darwin,

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.840
Darwin Server, and Open Directory.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.400
So that concludes the presentation.
