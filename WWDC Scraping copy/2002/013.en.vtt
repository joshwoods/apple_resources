WEBVTT

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.630
Well, welcome to the last session of the
day and the last session of this week,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.150
I think.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.140
I think we're the last on the calendar.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.320
I mean, there are lots of other
sessions running at this time,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.200
but this is the last one in this hall.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.420
And this session is really
important in many ways,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.850
primarily because Speech Recognition
and Synthesis plays such a key part

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.210
in the universal access component
of the next release of Mac OS X,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720
Jaguar, known as Jaguar.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.570
And your application can build on the
speech technologies that are in Jaguar

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.690
and gets a lot of stuff for free,
and we're going to explain

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.720
what those things are,
and then can do a lot of extra stuff

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.460
to make your speech synthesis or
recognition work even better and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.680
get better performance out of that.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.410
So speech is a really important component
in terms of our universal access.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.560
It's also a really important component
in terms of providing a full,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.780
complete user experience
on Mac OS X because the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.780
technology is really great.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.950
So to go more in-depth on this stuff,
I'd like to introduce Kim Silverman,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.240
who runs the
Speech Technologies Group at Apple.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.190
Thanks, John.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.410
Thanks.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.770
Hi.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.660
First of all,
I'd like to thank you all for

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.700
staying till the end of a very long
and very exhausting conference.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.480
You know,
I think four out of the last five WWDCs,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.420
Speech has been the last
session of the conference,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.660
and we've learned that one advantage of
that is that only the people who really

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.110
want to know about Speech are there.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.580
So thanks for being here.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.550
Can I ask,
since it's a little sparse in here,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.540
that you come forward.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.640
Move forward.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.580
I know you're probably tired
and sitting and comfortable,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.800
but if you can find it
within your legs to move,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.530
come on forward so that we can
have a more intimate session here.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.770
Thanks.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.560
Yeah, come on up, come on up.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.600
There are plenty of seats down the front.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.220
You'll enjoy yourselves more.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.020
Okay.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.320
So what we're going to talk
about today is a little bit

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.510
about why to adopt Speech,
but we're not going to spend much

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.230
time on that because we think
it will become obvious as you

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.030
come through the presentation.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.340
Then we'll talk mainly about introducing
what's new in Jaguar and then take you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.480
through some scenarios as developers
of what should you adopt first and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.530
we'll describe what we would consider
to be a good adoption of speech,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.280
a better adoption of speech and
then the best adoption of speech.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.200
So this is me.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.510
Okay, to start off,
I know that there are a bunch

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.820
of people here who are familiar
with the Speech that we've

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.060
been shipping for a while,
and there are also people here

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.390
who are new to the platform.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.530
I know there are a whole lot of
people who've come over from Unix

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.740
and people coming over from Windows.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.910
So I'd like to first of all
bring everybody up to speed.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.100
Those of you who are already
familiar with the Mac,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.160
please bear with me.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.830
I'm going to talk through briefly
what we have been shipping in

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.730
the previous version of OS X.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120
Is this microphone on?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.470
Great.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.260
I'd like demo machine number three,
please.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.900
Great.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.900
Okay.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.890
You turn on Speech from the
Speech Preferences panel.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.740
Under the Speech Recognition tab,
there's an On switch.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.560
Let's get it to say a few things and
then we'll talk about how it works.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.000
It dynamically adapts itself
to the acoustic environment

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.300
in which it's finding itself.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.270
So I have to now give it a chance
to adapt itself to me being up here

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.510
speaking into a large auditorium with
echoes of whatever the wavelength of

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.800
this room is and through a PA system.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.800
So bear with me for a moment.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.790
What time is it?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.050
What time is it?

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.700
It's 5:03.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.060
What day is it?

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.400
It's Friday, May 10th.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.040
Usually it takes between
one and three sentences.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.490
If you're using it,
and you've been using it successfully in

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.370
one room and then you shift to another,
expect maybe the first

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.040
one or two utterances,
it will act like it's not hearing you.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.040
That's when the adaptation happens.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.040
Okay.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.080
Just a moment while we...

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.500
[Transcript missing]

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.560
Okay, let's see.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.010
Quit this application.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.900
Quit this application.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.660
Get my mail.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.520
Open my browser.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.840
Open my browser.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.910
Hide this application.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.530
Open my browser.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.530
Let's scroll this page down a bit.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.580
Actually, I can do this by speech.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.880
Move page down.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.210
We'll select some text here.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.350
Copy this to the clipboard.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.400
Switch to Mail.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.140
Reply to this message.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.950
Reply to sender.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.750
I'm glad that happened.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.200
We'll refer to that,
what just happened in a moment.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.200
Paste the clipboard here.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.610
Send this message.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.610
Send this message.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.460
"I'm going to quit this application.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.340
Alright, let's try switch to chess."

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:09.940
Pawn D2 to D4 Oh boy,
I'm thinking on my feet here.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.680
Knight B1 to C3

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.070
That made it think.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.510
Look at that.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.780
Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.780
He's going to bring his bishop out.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.520
This lets me do something that my
13-year-old son will never let me

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.980
do when I'm playing chess with him.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.100
It lets me say, take back move.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.300
Okay, let's talk a little bit
about how this works.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:44.480
We have a Speech Recognition
engine which has a well-documented,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.480
mature API,
and applications can call this engine.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.990
We ship some applications that call it,
and some of you guys do,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.630
and we hope after today more of you will.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.080
The Speech Recognition
Engine itself has a number of

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.890
characteristics that are important.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.780
First of all, it's speaker independent.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.520
You don't have to train it to your voice.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.450
You just open it up and turn
it straight on and use it.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.300
For example,
I had trashed the preferences

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.670
just before we came up,
so what you've seen me do here

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.800
is straight out of the OS X CD.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.070
There's no adaptation to your voice.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:25.460
Secondly,
it's a continuous speech engine.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.460
You don't have to pause between words,
which is a great relief.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.040
It's a continuous speech engine
and it has a large vocabulary.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.060
We have 120,000 words in the dictionary.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.500
If a word is not in the dictionary,
then we decompose it linguistically.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.610
We know about known endings and
word components and look up its

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.060
stems in the dictionary and then
reconstruct its pronunciation.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.100
If that doesn't work,
then we fall through to statistically

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.180
trained letter-to-sound rules,
trained with classification

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.020
and regression trees,
and we have different sets of rules

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.820
for names and for the rest of English.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.470
So it's a large vocabulary engine.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.100
And we use it for command and control.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.640
The way we do this is driving
it by a finite state grammar.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.320
That means to call the engine,
you tell it what to listen for.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.940
You express that as,
in the simplest case,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.870
a flat list of commands,
or you can give it a full grammar,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:17.610
such as set up a meeting
with name at time,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.300
where within the grammar,
name would then expand to, say,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.820
all of the names in your address book.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.880
Okay,
so what I've been showing you here has

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.550
been a combination of a couple of things.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.400
First of all, the chess application,
since it's in front of us,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.500
is an application that's a
front end to GNU Chess and

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.600
that calls the API directly.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.370
The rest of what I was doing,
which I turned on from

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.060
the speech preferences,
is an application called Speakable Items.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.910
From the Speech Preferences,
you turn that on under the On/Off tab

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.740
of the Speech Recognition tab.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.100
Now,
Speakable Items is a very simple idea.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.910
When you first turn it on,
we create a folder in your home directory

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.320
called the Speakable Items folder.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.280
Open the Speakable Items folder.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.570
Anything that's in this folder
can be launched by speaking it,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.100
and it's just the same
as double-clicking on it.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.150
So anything that you can
launch by double-clicking,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.860
you can launch by speech.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.550
Applications, documents, folders,
anything that you can double-click on.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.040
We pre-populate that Speakable
Items folder with a kind of

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.750
a starter kit of a few basic
commands that can get you going.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.140
The ones I've been saying
today are all there.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.540
What day is it?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.450
What time is it?

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.500
But the real power of this is that
you can add your own items to it,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.490
and thereby customize the
Speech Recognition for the way you work.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.060
All right.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.270
Let's talk about the structure of
the user interface for a little bit.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.900
This is our Speech Feedback Window.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.300
It has a number of components.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:30.290
Speech Feedback Window:
The Speech Feedback Window,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.290
as we have found over the years
with using Speech Recognition,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.290
gives users the minimum amount of
information they need to help have

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.290
a successful experience with Speech.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.620
If I turn it on, it should come back up.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.080
Okay.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.580
You can see that it
says ESC in the middle.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.650
Is the screen large enough?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.200
Can you see that?

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.810
Who can't see the ESC?

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.720
I don't see any hands,
so I guess you can see it.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.280
Good.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.050
That means that by default,
the push-to-talk key is the escape key.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.170
That means when the
escape key is pressed,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.950
it's listening,
and when the escape key is not pressed,

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.620
such as now, it's not listening.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.560
Good thing.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.410
Otherwise,
it would be trying to recognize

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.710
me while I'm talking to you.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.420
And there's an important point there.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.470
If you put Speech Recognition into
your products and you're demoing it,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.120
demo it in push-to-talk mode,
because while you're demoing,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.340
you'll be talking about it.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.810
Across the industry,
Speech Recognition technology is good

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.920
at recognizing what you say to it,
but it's not good at knowing

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.910
when you're not talking to it.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.380
When I press the push-to-talk key,
the escape key,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:24.170
the ESC disappears and the
microphone stops being grayed out.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.790
You see that?

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.160
That shows me that the
application is not wedged,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.530
it's running,
and I've got the right push-to-talk key.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.270
And then there are some lines,
colored lines down the bottom.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.840
You see blue, green and red?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.600
They are a VU meter.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.000
They're just like the VU meters
or the LEDs on your home stereo.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.640
And they tell you that the
microphone is connected,

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.320
it's working.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.340
They also give you a measure
of the background noise and

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.610
of how loud you're speaking.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.880
If I press it now and don't say anything,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.360
You see there's about
one line of blue there?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.290
That's measuring,
although we may not notice it,

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.350
but there's quite a lot of
background noise up here.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.530
The buildings, air conditioning,
the noise coming from next door,

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:12.010
or the hums from a... Oh gosh,
far more computers here

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:12.010
than I would like to own.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.890
When you're using it,
we can cope with one,

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.130
maybe two lines of noise.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.350
Above that,
performance starts to degrade.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.240
So if you try it on the train,
in the subway, you might find that

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.200
there's too much noise.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.050
As I speak,
if I get too close to the microphone,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.100
I see lots of red.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.200
That means it's clipping.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.070
If you speak to it and
it doesn't recognize you,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.200
don't yell,
because that also will make it clip.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.730
You don't want there to be any red.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.770
While I speak,
you can see that there are some black

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.740
triangles moving towards the microphone.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.290
See them up there?

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.760
They kind of look like angelfish.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.010
That shows that the Speech Recognition
search is happening.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.120
So whenever you see those,
you know it's trying to recognize me.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.720
One of the user interface issues
with Speech is knowing what to say.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.940
We'll have more interesting
things to say about that later,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.900
but let me just show you the current
user interface for dealing with that.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.130
Open the Speech Commands window.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.260
Whenever any application
runs the Speech Recognition

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.780
Engine and calls the API,
it gets these two pieces

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.620
of user interface for free:
the Speech Feedback Window and

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.200
the Speech Commands Window.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:25.060
The Speech Commands Window is
a nice Cocoa application.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.740
Love Cocoa.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.860
It's divided into two parts.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.230
The top part shows you what has just
been recognized and if it spoke back

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.490
to you it shows you what it said.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.460
The bottom part is broken
into different sections.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.150
This one called Speakable Items
with a disclosure triangle shows

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.280
us what's in the top level of
the Speakable Items folder.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.270
For example, well,
cancel last command is up there.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.590
That's one of the items in
the Speakable Items folder.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.690
In OS X, unlike in OS 9,
we keep track of all the

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.900
applications that you ever
run while Speech is running.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.400
Now let me talk a little bit
about user interface issues here

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.080
and be a little controversial,
perhaps even with my own management.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:13.320
The Aqua user interface is designed
to be uncluttered and very elegant.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.900
And I think it succeeds in doing that.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.920
There's not much clutter on the screen
and the dock lets you very quickly

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.890
get to those things that you've
put there that you run most often.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.240
The problem though is that there are some
things that are more difficult to get to

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.000
because of this uncluttered interface.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.010
So with Speech Recognition running
it means that you can go directly to

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.000
any application that you've ever run.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.720
If I open this out we'll see,
this is just what I have

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.100
running on my desk,
this is my development machine actually,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.000
and you can see there's
lots of stuff in there.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.960
And so I can say any of these commands
and it will switch to that application.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:54.120
Let me try just say switch
to Internet Explorer.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.140
And there it is,
it comes to the foreground.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.960
And that leads me to the next thing
to show you about Speakable Items.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.260
Open the Speakable Items folder.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.930
In the Speakable Items folder,

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.300
There is a folder called
Applications Speakable Items.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.760
That folder contains folders
that are named by applications.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.020
The items in those folders
are only speakable when that

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.990
application is in the foreground.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.790
So for example,
when I said switch to Internet Explorer,

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.090
you may have noticed another
section appeared here.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:30.950
Here it says finder.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.920
The finder is in the foreground and
there are a bunch of commands here

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.140
that are in the finder specific
application speakable items and so

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.860
are only speakable at the moment.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.900
If I switch applications, you watch,
you'll see that the recognizer's

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.120
language model dynamically changes.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.030
Switch to Internet Explorer.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.520
Switch to the Finder.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.430
You see it changing there?

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.670
Switch to Internet Explorer.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.710
Close the Speech Commands window.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.470
Get Apple's stock price.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.660
Check it up,
I actually don't know what it is.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.300
Move page down.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.980
Looks too far.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.300
Oh, our stock's doing pretty well,
look at that.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.190
Okay, what did I just do there?

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.330
You can make web pages speakable.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:36.100
[Transcript missing]

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.980
All right.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.770
Within the application-specific Speakable
items that we ship for Internet Explorer,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.910
there's one that's called
Make This Page Speakable.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.400
This is really cool.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.710
What's your favorite web page?

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.000
You, what's your favorite web page?

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:56.140
Yes, you, in the gray top.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.090
I'm sorry?

00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.090
ZMAC.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.090
How do I spell that?

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.410
Zed, loud voice, nice clear voice, Zed.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:12.640
M-A-G dot.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:27.800
[Transcript missing]

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.480
and it will make a guess as to
what I would like to call it by

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.090
looking at the content of the page.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.800
I can just go with that
or I can change it.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:49.640
Let's call this go to the Znet

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.520
And that's it.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.860
So let's see, I'll go to another page so
we know we're not cheating.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.100
Go back.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.100
Go back.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:10.260
All right.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.060
Go to the Znet page.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.890
There we go.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.000
Thanks.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.330
So the way that that happened was
the application-specific item for

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.740
Internet Explorer that we ship,
called Make This Page Speakable,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.310
took a copy of the URL for
that page and put it into the

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.220
Internet Explorer application-specific
folder.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.490
And there it is, right there.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:45.010
We find our buddies at Apple that
use this generally have 10 to 30,

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.840
sometimes 50,
webpages speakable by voice.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.210
Okay, so that's a brief walk through
the structure and architecture

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.120
of what we've been shipping.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.720
Now let's talk about...

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.200
Let's talk about what's new in Jaguar.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.950
We've improved the Speech Recognition,
we've improved the Speech Synthesis,

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.740
we've improved the User Experience,
and we've improved the

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.920
Developer Experience.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Let's talk about the
Speech Recognition first.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.000
We've improved the accuracy,
we've been working a lot on that.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.130
We've increased the robustness
against background noise.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.990
If you were up here,
you would hear how loud it is.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.260
We've continued to work closely and
painfully hard with the hardware groups

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:33.560
to make sure that the microphones that
ship in our hardware are optimized

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.990
to work with Speech Recognition.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.970
This is important.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.000
This is an advantage that Apple has.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.180
Since we own the hardware and the
audio layers and the operating

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.440
system and the Speech Recognition,
we can make them all work

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.890
together in a way that's very
hard for other developers.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.750
and we have, you'll be glad to know,
improved the compatibility with

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.950
third-party USB microphones.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.500
Let's talk about the
Speech Recognition accuracy,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.100
its performance for a moment.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:05.060
Now, Speech Recognition performance is
notoriously difficult to measure.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:12.580
The way we measure it is, traditionally,
we take a recording of several

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.160
hundred spoken commands,
spoken by six different people,

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.200
three female and three male,
at different volumes,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.640
and we play these several hundred
commands over and over again,

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:27.900
overnight, from a loudspeaker in front
of the Mac we are testing,

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.100
at the volume of a normal person.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.100
We take a couple of measures.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.230
First of all,
you may have noticed while we

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.540
were working up here and while
you were working at your desk,

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.100
sometimes there will be noises in
your office that are not speech.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.900
Door slams, telephone rings, coughs,
paper shuffling.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.170
We have to make sure that we don't
try to search those in the speech,

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.430
against the speech grammar,
and so we have models for

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.100
lots of sounds like that.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.100
The first thing that happens when
Speech comes into the Recognizer is we

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.320
test it against those models of noise.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.080
And if it matches one of those
better than it matches Speech,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.580
then we reject it as
being background noise.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.590
Now we have tuned up the
Speech Recognizer to prefer to

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.280
reject than to make a wrong choice.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.900
And so it turns out that this rejection
performance is the most sensitive

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.900
measure of the performance of a
microphone and of the Recognizer.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.460
When we started work on
this back in the OS 8,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:30.900
OS 9 timeframe, the percentage of times
that it falsely rejected,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.360
that is,
that it heard Speech and thought, no,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.180
I'm not confident enough,
I'll class that as noise,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:44.320
was 22.5%. Then when we released OS 10.1,
we managed to halve that down to about

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.580
10%. And now currently in Jaguar,
our latest measurements on an iMac,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:55.850
we've halved it again
down to 5%. Thank you.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.920
Now what's really important is
if it thinks something is speech,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.760
it tries to recognize it,
it had better make the right decision.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.010
You don't want to say,
open my browser and

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.500
have it empty the trash.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.740
So the next thing we measure is,
of those spoken commands that

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.480
it accepted as being speech,
how accurate is it?

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.450
Well, back in the OS 8, OS 9 time frame,
the error rate was 4.5%.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:25.000
When we got to OS 10.1,
we'd reduce that by a factor of 3,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.760
down to 1.5%. And in our current
measurements with Jaguar,

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.550
we've currently reduced that
again by another factor of 3,

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:39.580
it's down to 0.5%. Devang, he's the man,
Devang.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.140
Dr.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:40.960
Nike.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.370
Okay,
we've been working on Speech Synthesis.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.500
In the engine itself,
we've been working on the

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.900
quality to make it sound more
natural and easier to understand.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.900
We've been improving the
voice signal processing.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.940
We've put a lot of work
into the intonation,

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.620
the tune, the rhythm, the pitch.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.360
Now that's important for you to
be able to follow the meaning

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.060
and for it to sound more natural.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.560
We've reduced the number of
pronunciation errors and we have

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.090
actually modelled intonation now unlike,
I think, just about any other

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.080
synthesiser that I know.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.200
Not at the level of the sentence,
but at the level of the paragraph.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.220
Now let me talk about this for a moment.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.940
We're working hard on the synthesis.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.700
We have put more work into
Speech Recognition than into

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.450
Speech Synthesis over the last
few years because that's where

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.150
the greatest market need has been.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.820
And now we're correcting that balance.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.610
So we've been working
hard on the synthesis.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.530
We continue to work
hard on it for Jaguar.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.100
What I'm going to show you
now is a work in progress.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.220
Can we switch back to
demo machine number... No,

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.880
no, I'm right here.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.590
I have the stuff right here.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.210
What am I talking about?

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.830
Okay,
so one thing we've added is paragraph

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.820
intonation and topic tracking.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.330
Let me be clear about what we mean here.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.480
As we read out a paragraph,
we build up a model of the listener's

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.970
internal representation of the
concepts introduced in that paragraph.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.500
And we annotate that in the intonation.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.160
So I'll show you this paragraph for you.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.730
This is a paragraph that I pulled
out of the Mac OS X edition of

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.120
the World Book Encyclopedia.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.220
It's a great application.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.220
Check it out.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.220
I'll play this in two versions.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:25.380
First version is passing that
text to the speech synthesis in

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.220
the shipping version of OS X.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.190
And then the current work
in progress with Jaguar.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.650
So here's the shipping version first.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:38.420
As computers have grown more powerful
and their functions more various,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.900
the size of computer programs
has grown dramatically.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.550
Because of their large size,
many modern programs are

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.850
distributed on CDROMS.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.440
Okay, let's see how we do now.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.400
See if you can hear a difference.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.160
As computers have grown more powerful
and their functions more various,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.400
the size of computer programs
has grown dramatically.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:08.080
Because of their large size,
many modern programs are

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.180
distributed on CD-ROMs.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.610
"Hold your applause, hold your applause.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.160
Okay, there have been some
discontinuities in the signal.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.630
We've been working on those.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.530
Here's an example of a
rather strange sentence.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:33.950
You'll hear this on OS 10.1
and then in the Jaguar version.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.950
First, 10.1."

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.100
Without these problems,
go at those targets, get the news.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.100
And now in Jaguar.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.100
Without these problems,
go at those targets, get the news.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.100
Hear a difference?

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.100
No, hold your applause,
hold your applause.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.160
We've worked on word pronunciation
because although the dictionary is large,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.100
some words have been mispronounced.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.070
So here's,
I've gathered together a few examples

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.100
of things that we've got wrong.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.090
Listen to this.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.100
This is first of all
what's shipping in 10.1.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:10.110
May zillions and deathy a potions
with al-al-he-amers get a remail

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.100
with that look via pee-pee-poey.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.400
I've got to do that again,
that's so much fun.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.200
Listen to this.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.100
Those of you, has anybody been playing
with a synthesis?

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.080
Are these problems representative
of what you've been hearing?

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.640
Yes, yes.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.950
Okay,
let's just listen to that one again.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.440
Maze Aliens and Ethia Potions
with Al-Al-Hiamers get a remail

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.640
with that look via PP Poey.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.980
Alright, I love that PP Poey.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.130
Ha ha ha.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:42.900
Alright,
here's the current version of Jaguar.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:42.900
Brazilians and Ethiopians
with Alzheimer's get their

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:42.900
email with Outlook via PPPoE.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.150
Thanks.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:46.800
No, no, hold your applause.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.630
Hold your applause.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.400
A big problem for word pronunciation is
no matter how extensive your dictionary,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.730
people create words on the fly.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.980
It's one of the wonderful,
rich things about language,

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.860
particularly Germanic languages where
we concatenate items together in text.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.760
So here's a bunch of examples of
things that we tend to encounter,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.680
and if I added all of
these to the dictionary,

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.120
it wouldn't give me any help
because next time I have some text,

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.260
there'll be more of them.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.440
I have these in increasing difficulty.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.540
We'll just read them out
with the OS X version.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.730
I'm sorry, the Jaguar version.

George Bush for President.info
SummonAccreditedUniversity.edu/phonen

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.390
umbers.html Okay,
now you can applaud.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.060
As I said, this is a work in progress.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.020
This is a little bit further
ahead from what you have on

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:58.720
the Jaguar CDs that you've got,
but we hope that you'll track

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.170
this and we're having a great time
finally folding into the code base

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.130
research advances that we've been
making over the last few years.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.690
Alright, we've made some improvements
to the user experience.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.580
One, as you may have seen already,
is that there's a screen

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.950
reader built in for free.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.240
For free for you.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.280
That means that you with your
applications will get the benefit of it.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.440
It reads any text on the screen,
including any selected text.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.920
Users can navigate the entire system.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.850
Menus and front windows, controls,
all of the buttons and so on

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.790
can be spoken by the system
and can be spoken by the user.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.430
And we have talking notifications,
so applications that need your

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.800
attention can do more than just
jump up and down in the dock.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800
They can talk to you.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.770
Let's demo some of those improvements.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.880
Could I have demo machine number four,
please?

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.540
Okay.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:59.430
Okay, once again I'm going to have to let
this machine adapt to my voice as it

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.350
sounds in this acoustic environment.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:04.900
What time is it?

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.000
It's 17:29.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.370
What day is it?

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:10.960
It's Friday, May 10.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:12.600
Okay, I think we're there.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.070
Alright, we have added a tab

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.220
at the top level of the
Speech Preferences called

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.980
Spoken User Interface.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.040
This tab controls how the
computer speaks to you.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:32.550
For those of you who remember from OS 9,
Talking Alerts is back.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:32.550
Thank you.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.070
So you can have any time an
alert or a sheet comes up,

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.340
you can have it spoken to you.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.600
Now the aim of this is that
you should never hear it.

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.200
That is, alerts or sheets should
come up on the screen,

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.780
you read them, you think about them,
you respond to them, they go away.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.080
There shouldn't be any speech.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:54.000
But if your attention is away from
the machine and you're staring out

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.580
the window or crawling around on
the floor plugging in cables and

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.540
you don't respond after a while,
the machine can then

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.200
get your attention back,
not just by going beep,

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.830
but by reading out the
content of the alert.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.640
Because of that delay,
we ship it with a delay between the time

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.050
the alert appears and it gets spoken.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.000
By default, that delay is 10 seconds.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:18.080
I will move it back to zero for
now so that we don't have to wait.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.970
For those of you who
remember Talking Alerts,

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.590
you can now give it a different
voice from the rest of

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.490
speech output in the system.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.100
The voice of the messenger
already contains some information

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.000
for the listener about the
identity of the message.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.080
Let's do a demonstration.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.280
Alert.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:39.200
This is a demonstration of
your Talking Alert settings.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:44.200
Use these settings to customize
how your alerts are spoken.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.010
Okay.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.680
Now there's some other
Speech output as well.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.050
One is that we can get the computer
to talk to us when an application in

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.000
the background requires our attention.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.480
Let me give you an example.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:57.840
I'll turn that on.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.430
And let's switch to Internet Explorer.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.380
and I'll open up a new page here.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:13.630
So let's try going to a web
page that doesn't exist.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.760
Let's go to some-nonsense.com.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:34.200
[Transcript missing]

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.610
Excuse me,
Internet Explorer needs your attention.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.040
There it goes.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.680
Okay.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:47.990
I can see it saying "meep, meep." Okay.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:59.790
You can use a hotkey to speak any
selected text in any application.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.860
We ask you to define
what the key would be.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.520
For example, I'll make it Command F11.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.860
Now this is useful for
people with disabilities,

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.180
but we think it's also
got general usefulness.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.620
For example,
you'd like your email read out by the

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.230
computer while you stare out the window,
while you shuffle papers on your desk.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.480
Rather like hearing your
voicemail over a speakerphone.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:27.290
Or perhaps, here's an example,
you're looking at a spreadsheet.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.770
You've just typed in your
budget and you want to make sure

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.360
you've got the figures right.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.310
Well checking them against
the paper and the screen,

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.220
who's done that?

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.330
It kind of gets a bit tedious, right?

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:44.360
So now you can select the numbers
that you've typed in and just hit

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.690
that hotkey and they'll be spoken.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:33:05.900
[Transcript missing]

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:12.520
Now there are already two important
messages for you developers.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:19.120
One is every dialogue, every alert,
every sheet that you have in your

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.400
application can now be spoken.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.650
So test with that and
make sure they sound okay.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.780
You might want to reword some of them.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.110
The second message is every piece
of text that's selectable in your

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:33.900
application can now be spoken.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.430
So test with that to make sure
it works the way you want it to.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.200
The next thing we've done is
allow you to speak the text

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.680
that's actually under the mouse.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.300
[Transcript missing]

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:58.840
The message here is:
Even if text is not selectable

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.620
in your application,
it's likely to be spoken anyway.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:08.290
So test with that so that you
as an application developer

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:08.290
don't get embarrassed when
your application sounds stupid.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:16.960
Notify when an application
requires your attention.

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:17.010
Okay.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.230
So far we've been talking about
the computer talking to you,

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.980
but it's also possible now for
you to talk to the computer.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.550
That is, anything that can be spoken
by the computer to you,

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:28.600
you can speak back.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.540
We have two extra controls.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.010
There's an extra tab under
Speech Recognition called Commands,

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:39.010
and that lets you turn on and off
different sections of speakable items.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.240
Do you remember on the
Speech Commands window,

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.090
there are different sections
such as the Speakable Items tab,

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.810
the Application Switching tab?

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:49.720
Well, each of those can be
independently switched on and off,

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.460
and we've added a couple.

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:56.560
One is Menu Bar Navigation,
the other one is Front Window Controls.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.160
Let me demonstrate that one for you.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.200
I'll turn it on.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.620
I'll try speaking those check boxes.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:12.190
System-wide Specific Icon.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.190
Whoops.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.190
It got me right anyway.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.190
Good.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.200
The recognizer is a little forgiving,
and that's usually a good thing.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:29.300
[Transcript missing]

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:33.710
You can see things are changing over in
the Speech Commands window as I say this.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.020
And the front window controls appear
in the Speech Commands window so

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.720
again users can know what to say.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:43.330
So we've seen check boxes are working,
let's try some tabs.

Buttons work.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:02.020
Demonstrate current settings.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.100
It's not my fault.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.800
This is a demonstration of
your talking alert settings.

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.960
Okay, okay, okay.

Front window controls.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.100
There we go.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.140
Okay, cool.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.000
Let me just say something
about the acoustics up here.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.510
We're always a little nervous about
demonstrating Speech Recognition

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.040
for the following reason.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:50.210
We have designed it to work in
the acoustic environments in which

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.760
people usually use their computers.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:56.000
That is in homes, in offices,
where there's a kind of background

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.000
noise and echo structure of
rooms of about that size.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.590
Up here the noise is quite
different and the echo structure,

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.040
particularly with a PA system,
is quite different.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.950
And as you can see,
it didn't misrecognise.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.070
Did it mis- no, not once.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.700
It didn't once misrecognise.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:12.700
It again, it preferred to a couple of
times ask me to repeat myself.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.070
We think that's the right thing to do.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:24.360
Oh, that was that demo.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:24.360
Okay, we have improvements for you,
developers.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:24.360
The first one,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.080
Oh, could we go back to the
main slide machine please?

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:30.760
Thank you.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.300
We have improvements for you guys.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.640
The first one you've been requesting for
years and we finally released it for you.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.450
We're calling it Tune Format.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.020
We'll go into that in a moment.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.720
Another developer request has
been output to an audio file.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:47.180
People keep asking us,
how do I get text-to-speech into a file?

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.010
Well, you can do it now.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:48.670
We'll show you.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.890
We allow you to embed speakable items
into your own application so you

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.680
don't have to worry about installing
them in the speakable items folder.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:57.450
And we have some Cocoa classes.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.070
Let's first of all
talk about Tune Format.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.740
Those of you who have been coming
to WWDC for a while might remember

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.960
this as being called Repeat After Me.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.220
Here's the problem.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.580
When you send text to text-to-speech,
we try to make some rough guesses as

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.570
to how you might like it pronounced
and how you might like it intoned.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.180
Which words you might like to emphasize,
where you might like it to pause,

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.230
where you might like
it to raise its voice,

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.680
where you might like
it to lower its voice.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.200
Those guesses may not be what you intend.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.160
You can use a lot of controls to embed
in the text to give the synthesizer

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.900
hints and move that pronunciation around,
that intonation, I'm sorry,

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.780
that intonation around.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.600
However,
you may get frustrated that I don't quite

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.800
know how to use these to get what I want.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.040
Well, wouldn't it be great if you could
just take a recording of you or

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.020
your favorite voice talent saying
something the way you want it spoken

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.910
and then have the computer copy it?

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.020
Well, that's what this does.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.010
You specify the exact
tune and timing details,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.110
bypassing the front end of
the synthesizer and sending

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.020
them straight to the back end.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.510
Let me give you an example.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:11.010
What we have here is an
internal data visualization

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.920
tool that we use in development.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.950
The author was a little unsure whether
we should show this to you because it has

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.790
not been beautified to his standards yet.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:26.530
I will play you... Well,
let's play the demo first.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:32.670
I'll play you a sentence where
the synthesizer makes the wrong

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:32.670
choice about the intonation.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.140
First of all,
we'll pass the text directly to the

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.810
Jaguar version of Speech Synthesis.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:40:05.600
[Transcript missing]

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.930
I like the good old
nuts and bolts approach.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.200
And here she is copying me.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.590
I like the good old
nuts and bolts approach.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.080
So here's how it works.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.040
Here's a plot of the relevant
internal parameters in the

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.180
synthesizer for that sentence.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.080
The horizontal axis is time going
through that spoken sentence.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.060
The vertical axis is the pitch,
the difference between R and R.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.880
This line represents the pitch
contour that's been generated

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.690
by the synthesizer's rules
throughout that spoken sentence.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.340
Can you see vertical striations
of light and dark grey?

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.900
They represent the boundaries
between the different speech sounds.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.410
If you squint,
you might see that it says "I" there,

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.960
and then there's an "L" and then there's
an "I" and then a "K" So that's "I like".

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:05.490
Now, these little X's are mathematically
fitted key anchor points

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.060
to represent that contour.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:12.340
We generate this contour and
then fit these to it and output

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:18.860
for you a text format where
there's one line per phoneme.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.480
Here, for example, is the I,
here's the all, here's the I.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:43:22.400
[Transcript missing]

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.770
I want to show you a couple of
interesting things that you can

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:33.040
do with this because I think
this tool itself produces lots

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.430
of opportunities for developers.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:40.020
One of them, of course, is

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:42.670
Yep, here we go, good.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.700
It's customizing the Speech output
so that within your applications,

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.880
if there are any strings that
are going to be spoken that you

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:51.910
know are going to be spoken,
you can use this tool to have

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:55.190
them spoken according to the
personality of your favorite voice

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.900
talent and therefore associate a
personality with your application.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.650
And they'll be spoken in
the same synthesis voice,

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.200
but with that personality
as you just heard.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.450
And so the voice is consistent
with any other synthesis that

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.180
occurs in your application.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:14.720
But there are other things
that you can do with this.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.390
I thought about applying
this to lip syncing.

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:20.180
Lip-syncing is a large problem
in the animation industry,

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.480
as I'm sure some of you painfully know.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.350
You have recordings,
you have animated characters,

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.580
you want to sync them together.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.330
There are a few tools available that
make rough guesses just by things

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.040
like the amplitude of the signal.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.540
Well, it seemed to me that just
like this Speech Recognizer,

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.120
this special one,
can find the phonemes in the

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:41.130
signal to control this tune format,
similarly it could find the phonemes

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:43.310
in the signal to control lip-syncing.

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:47.370
When I looked at this,
I didn't have a talking head

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:48.850
that I could test this on.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:53.600
So I tested it actually what
turns out to be a more rigorous,

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.020
stricter way, and that is by listening.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.790
When you're doing animation,
there is some...

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.790
and other users have some forgiveness
in the lip-syncing being slightly

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.210
out of sync with the Speech,
but our ear is not that forgiving.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.300
Here's an example.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:13.990
This is a recording sent to
me by our buddies over in

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:15.970
Not Borland.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.820
Oh, I'm sorry,
I've forgotten the name of the company.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.590
Big company that makes lots
of multimedia applications.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.900
From an application that
they were working on,

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:29.830
and their problem was that they wanted
to do lip-syncing and automate it.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:29.830
So...

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:31.490
Here we go.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:36.590
The sentence is, well,
I'll let you see if you can

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.850
figure out what the sentence is,
but what I'm going to do here at the

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:44.010
moment is play you out of one speaker
their recording and at the same time

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:48.680
you'll hear the speech synthesis saying
the same sentence with the durations of

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.990
each of the phonemes generated by the
speech synthesizer itself to let you

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.970
know what the wrong answer sounds like.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.120
These guys are not in
sync with each other.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.160
Do be careful as you make
your way up the paths.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.520
Do you hear that they're different?

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.680
Do be careful as you make
your way up the paths.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.440
Do you hear that they're
out of sync with each other?

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:10.750
A few nods, no?

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:12.800
Yep, alright, alright.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:18.200
So, I passed this through that tool
and without touching the data,

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:22.110
just got back what that Speech Recognizer
did and told the Speech Synthesizer

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:26.270
to use those durations that it found
in that recording that they sent me.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.990
Now it sounds like this.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:32.890
Do be careful as you make
your way up the path.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.480
Do you hear that now?

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.370
They're now more aligned.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.720
But it still seems to me that there's
a little bit of misalignment there.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.480
Do you hear it?

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.280
I'll play it again.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.050
Do be careful as you make
your way up the path.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.300
So I thought,
well maybe the Speech Recognizer

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.540
wasn't quite accurate on
where it found those phonemes.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.180
Or, maybe,
what I'm thinking is differences

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.140
in alignment are really
differences in the pitch.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:57.140
So using this tool, again,
without touching the data myself,

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:00.150
I took the pitch from their recording
and put that onto the synthesizer.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.170
Now, it sounds like this.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:05.860
Do be careful as you make
your way up the path.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:06.920
Now they're aligned.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.500
Thank you.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.510
I'd show you this because
I think this tool is giving

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.890
you guys some opportunities to
really make some money here.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:25.350
Now, this tool lets you customize the
way a particular string sounds,

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.850
a particular sentence.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.480
That's fine if you know ahead
of time what that sentence is,

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.310
but then if you have to
synthesize something else

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.750
that you haven't seen before,
you can't take advantage of that.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.670
Well,
it seemed to me we ought to be able to

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:43.440
generalize from what we have seen to
other sentences if they have a similar

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.750
syntactic structure and are used
for a similar communication purpose.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.870
We should be able to generalize
from a few spoken examples.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:56.400
So, I worked with CompuServe when they
were making a telephone access,

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:01.720
a service for telephone access
to information over the internet.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.670
You get a PIN number from them,
you call a special phone number,

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:05.980
type in your PIN number.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.350
And then you can get your email read out,
you can hear the news,

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:09.380
you can hear the weather.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.360
The important thing is,
by typing in your PIN number,

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.070
they know who you are,
and so they want to greet you by name.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.690
And they wanted to sound
cheery and friendly.

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:24.470
So they, in their eagerness but naivety,
recorded their voice talent saying

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:30.290
greetings to about 5,000 names
in the hope that 5,000 would

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:33.010
give them some kind of coverage.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.660
How many names, Kevin,
do you think you need

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:35.760
to have 80% coverage?

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.250
You'd probably know about 40,000?

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.950
Oh, way more, maybe 90,000 I'd say.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:44.160
90,000 names to give you 80% coverage.

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.240
So they have a problem here.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.870
So they thought, oh, that's okay.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:51.310
What we'll do is we'll use our recordings
from our voice talent if somebody

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:53.780
whose name we recognize calls up,
one of those 5,000.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.800
And if you happen to
be not in that 5,000,

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:57.080
we'll use the Speech Synthesis.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.420
But it didn't sound the way
they wanted it to sound.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.090
And that's when they
came to me for some help.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:08.480
I tell you this because this is what
we're making available for you guys now.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.560
Okay, so the first thing I did was
use RepeatAfterMe to take some

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.480
of their recordings and get the
synthesizer to copy their recordings.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.220
So what I'll play you first is the
greetings from their voice talent,

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.440
but this is not by their voice talent,
this is by the Victoria Voice with

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:31.320
its input controlled by the
output of this RepeatAfterMe,

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.030
this tune format tool.

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:38.360
Hi Lenny, good afternoon Bolin,
good morning Greg, hi Jim, hi Tom,

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.100
good morning George.

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.340
Okay, so that is synthesis and that,
I think that sounds,

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:47.080
I can hear in that the personality
that they're trying to convey.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.940
The problem is, if somebody calls up
with a different name,

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.840
then they have to use synthesis.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.330
Here I have typed in greetings,
and I've got a

00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:12.400
[Transcript missing]

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:15.880
M-O-B?

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.560
M-O-V, yeah, we'll try that.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.820
See if we can trick it.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:22.700
Yes, I'm sure.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.620
Okay, well, imagine bad synthesis.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:48.950
So I took names that had very different
length and very different syllabic

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.060
structure from the names that they
sent so that I knew I wasn't cheating.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.830
Then, when I just synthesized those,
they didn't sound anything

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.090
like that same personality.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:05.110
But then I generalized from the
recordings we have using a combination

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.400
of the output in that tune format
with modifying the intonation of

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.840
the new text by a simple linear
transform from what came out of

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.560
the synthesizer when it saw that text.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.070
This is what it sounds like.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:22.500
Now, this is totally new strings that
the synthesizer has not seen before.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.550
Hi, Kevin.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.820
Good afternoon, Dominic.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.990
Good morning, Dr.

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.560
Scott.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.440
Hi, Jean.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.100
Hi, Jean.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.420
Good morning, Lewis.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.670
Good afternoon, Dr.

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:32.580
Livingstone.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.990
So I've spent a bit of time talking
about that tool and this tune format.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:44.420
May I have the main projector again,
please?

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.470
Because we're pretty excited about
it and we're delighted that at last,

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.560
after a few years,
we can move towards making

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.440
it available for you.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.590
This tune format is not yet working in
the version of the CD that you guys have,

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.980
but it will be soon.

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:03.110
Okay,
we can now do output to an audio file.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.720
And you can do this a number of ways,
but one way that's particularly

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.910
easy is through AppleScript.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.930
May I have demo machine number four,
please?

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.700
Okay, so let's run Script Editor.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:25.690
Who has not used Script Editor?

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.630
Okay, do you know what AppleScript is?

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.750
AppleScript is a scripting language
that Apple makes available for

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:36.700
controlling applications across
the whole operating system.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:41.700
One of its characteristics is that it's
very easy to read an AppleScript program

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:47.300
and understand it because the
language looks sort of like English.

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:53.100
We have added a command to that,
we added this a little while ago,

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.980
called the SAY command.

00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:00.110
And that lets you pass a string
into Apple Script and have it

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.380
spoken by Speech Synthesis.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:14.800
[Transcript missing]

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.910
If I run that, we should hear it.

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:23.760
Hello, everybody.

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:24.200
Okay.

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:33.300
We have now added to that saving as,
and then you put in a file name.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:45.100
and whatever you say here
will be recorded into that

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.380
file rather than spoken.

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:51.340
Let's not do something as simple as
"Hello everybody." Let me go to the web

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:54.380
and we'll grab a piece of text from here.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.760
Let's talk about a paragraph here.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:06.160
Something that would
take a while to speak.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.500
Copy this to the clipboard.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.640
Switch to Script Editor.

Run it again.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.870
Sorry, I've got a close quote there.

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:43.980
We have a close quote there.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:45.100
I've got an open quote there.

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.850
Mac OS is helping out.

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:46.600
What am I doing wrong?

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.310
There's new lines.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:49.160
Oh, oh.

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:50.900
Got to watch that.

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.960
Now, is there one there?

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:01.920
And is there one there?

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:05.600
Let's try that again.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:09.230
Alright, let's try something smaller.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.390
Let us try something shorter for now.

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:16.630
I don't want to go
searching for these things.

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:18.610
Alright, let's try that.

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:36.440
Let's retype that.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:37.580
Say, "Will it work this time?" It's
been working for me for weeks.

May I have the main machine again?

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:25.010
You could take people's email and
read each email message into an audio

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:28.690
file and then download that onto
a person's iPod so that as they're

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.750
cycling to work in the morning they
could be listening to their email.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:35.080
We think there's an opportunity
here for you developers.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.480
Okay,
so we've talked about the tune format,

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.500
we've talked about output to audio files.

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.890
Let's talk for a moment about
embedded speakable commands.

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:47.170
I mentioned that there are
application-specific folders that

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:51.330
can contain commands only speakable
in those applications while that

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.520
application is in the foreground.

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.800
Several of you have already
been using that by shipping

00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.160
with your applications speakable
commands for those applications,

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:02.410
and it's sometimes
tricky to install them.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.530
You install them in the speakable
items folder if the user has one,

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.300
if the user doesn't have one,
it's a little unclear.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.640
So now,
you don't have to install them at all.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.940
You just bundle them into your
application package in a folder,

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.070
and we will find them.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.190
and we'd like... Well, thank you.

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.680
Obviously somebody's been doing this.

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:27.490
And we've got Cocoa classes at last.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:27.490
There's been a lot of rumours on the net.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:27.490
Thank you.

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:35.450
This has been requested by lots of
developers and we've tried to make these

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:39.800
simple to adopt and simple to code and
do them in such a way that we prepare

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.220
for the future because in the format that
it should be pretty straightforward to

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:45.260
incorporate these into Interface Builder.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.830
But at the moment,
they're just available as classes.

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:49.090
They're not in Interface Builder.

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:52.750
There are two main classes,
Speech Synthesis and Speech Recognition.

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:57.520
The Speech Synthesis is a
single class and it can speak

00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:59.180
any string synchronously.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.010
It's really easy.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.210
It's one line.

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.670
If you need asynchronous speech, that is,
you want to animate the screen

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:09.940
or do something else in your
application while it's speaking,

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.760
or you want more control,
such as highlighting words while

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:20.850
they're spoken or doing lip syncing,
then you can set up a delegate for

00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:22.610
notification and there's a lot more
control like that that you can get.

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.880
For Speech Recognition, again,
there's one class to

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.460
use in the simple case.

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.880
You get a shared instance of that class,
you specify which commands

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.700
you want to listen to,
and then you just begin listening.

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:37.940
This takes, does in three lines,
what in the Carbon API would

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:42.700
take somewhere between three
and five pages of code.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:47.530
Is that fair, Tom?

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.600
So we think we've made it easier for you.

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.100
If you want to do something
more sophisticated,

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:57.930
such as having the recognizer
parse the spoken string and give

00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:00.940
you back the parsed version,
or make some things that people

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:04.590
speak optional so that the
recognizer can recognize fragments,

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:08.430
then there's a handful of classes
available to build a language

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:10.530
model and deal with those cases.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.890
So we've tried to set this up to
be very quick and easy to adopt,

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:16.270
just a couple of lines
for the simple case,

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.370
but all the power of the original
API there if you need to do the

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:22.960
things that we have found developers
need to do for more sophisticated

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.860
uses of the speech technology.

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:29.040
and we've improved the user experience.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:30.600
I've already shown you
some of the accessibility

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.120
features we've done for users.

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:34.870
In addition,
we have some new speakable items and we

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:37.560
have something called Semantic Inference.

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:40.520
To demonstrate the speakable items,
I'd like to invite Dr.

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:43.770
Tom Bonura up onto the stage.

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:43.770
Tom.

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.800
Thank you.

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.840
Hi.

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:54.040
I'm going to try to whip through this.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:59.280
There are a number of interesting
new speakable items in Jaguar,

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:05.270
and I'm just going to show you one that
I think is particularly interesting.

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:09.570
So let's just go right into it.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.060
Could I have, okay,
we have the right machine.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.860
Hide this application.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.160
Switch to TextEdit.

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:38.550
The first thing I'd like to show you
is something that's actually in PUMA,

01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:43.800
or in the released version
of Speech Recognition.

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.320
Define a keyboard command.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:54.030
And the idea here is that you
should be able to define your own

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.820
spoken commands by simply saying,
"define a keyboard command."

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.550
And so this is just a way of
defining a keyboard shortcut.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:11.040
So I'm going to say Command-A is
going to be represented as Select All.

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:15.820
Which it usually is in
applications and I'll say,

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:21.990
well, in TextEdit only we'll refer
to select all as Command-A.

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:26.770
So now we have created an
application-specific speakable item

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:33.010
and I just did it on the fly and
I can just simply say select all.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.340
and it did.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.380
Okay, well that's cool and it means that
all of your users can now define

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.610
their own commands if there's a
keyboard equivalent for a menu item,

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:45.670
which is a good thing.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.330
So let's go a little further.

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:52.890
And let's say I'm interested in
this piece of text and I'd like

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:54.900
to use it over and over again.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:00.680
Make this speakable.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:00.680
Make this speakable.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.620
Make this speakable.

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:10.970
Okay, so this little bit of
functionality says when I say,

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:14.850
now I'm going to type the
phrase that I'm interested in.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.100
[Transcript missing]

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:25.200
In any application context,
it's going to insert

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.680
that little bit of text.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:35.900
[Transcript missing]

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.240
Insert my work address.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.730
Okay, so it did the right thing.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:48.970
Now, let's go a little further.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.060
And here I have a picture that
I took last year in Hawaii.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.090
Make this speakable.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:10.200
[Transcript missing]

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.790
Let's save it away.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:24.130
So now, if I want to use that in the
context of an application,

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:24.130
switch to mail, switch to mail,

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.030
Insert my great golf picture.

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.800
It does the right thing.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.000
So, there's--

01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:36.980
There's a lot of fun stuff like this.

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.280
Shh, quiet.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:45.900
There's a lot of fun
stuff like this in Jaguar,

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:50.740
and we think that users will be able
to build a whole lot of very compelling

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:55.080
and very useful little speakable macros,
if you will,

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.860
using this kind of functionality.

01:03:56.910 --> 01:04:01.540
Let me go back and turn
things over to Kim.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.140
I'll be back.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.420
Thanks Tom.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.600
Okay,
so let's talk about semantic inference.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.200
We are so excited about this.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.790
Here's the problem.

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:20.890
Back when we were less confident
about our Speech Recognizer

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:25.580
and it was less robust,
we only shipped about 20, 30 commands.

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:29.230
Users would only have about 50
commands of things that were speakable.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.300
That's all the Recognizer
could reliably handle.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.460
And that was fine.

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.880
It was easy to remember
the set of commands.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.100
But now that the Recognizer
is so much stronger,

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.560
we're finding we and others
have hundreds of commands.

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:46.320
The burden is now on the user to remember
the exact wording of those commands.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.910
And if you get it wrong,
you're out of luck.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.280
Here's why.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.240
The way the Recognizer works is that
you load it up with a language model,

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:57.390
which is a list of what
it's supposed to listen for.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.270
Then if it hears something
that's in that language model,

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:01.280
it'll listen for it.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.770
Then if it hears something
that's in that language model,

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:04.870
such as, what time is it,
that goes into the search,

01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:07.950
and the search finds which path
through the language model most

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.910
closely matches that utterance.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.700
Associated with that path
is a speakable action,

01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:15.250
such as, in this case, speaking the time.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.630
The problem is, what happens if the
person accidentally says,

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.000
what is the time?

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:24.360
Now you can feed that into the search,
and you know what'll happen?

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.560
Nothing.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.980
Because there's no path through
the grammar to match that.

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:31.280
So,
our solution is to use the Recognizer.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.010
Thank you all.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.340
That was not talking alerts.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.450
Okay, we're about on time.

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:02.780
We're doing okay here.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:07.510
So the solution is we take out that
whole approach to language modeling.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.760
and replace that language model with a
more flexible extended language model.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.390
The details of which we'll be happy
to talk about in the question time

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:15.550
or afterwards if you want to know.

01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:18.680
Now,
when we pass what is the time in there,

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:22.600
we do get a string of words that
comes out of the recognizer.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.600
But now we have the problem.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.160
Since it's not a string
of words that we've seen,

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.590
necessarily seen before,
how do we map it to the speakable action

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:34.600
that was associated with what time is it?

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:38.310
Well, basically, a miracle occurs.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.300
And because of that miracle,
we can indeed still map

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:43.690
it to Speak the time.

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:46.130
The truth is,
it's not actually a miracle.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:48.980
It's a technology called
Latent Semantic Mapping,

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:51.150
and it was introduced in the keynote.

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:54.270
This is the technology that we
gave to the mail group to use

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:56.310
for the junk mail detection.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.930
In the case of junk mail detection,
we are looking for two categories:

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:02.400
junk or not junk.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.310
Here, we can map any string by looking
at a statistical representation

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:09.770
of the components of its meaning,
map any string to a set of

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.440
categories which are defined
as being the speakable actions.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:17.390
Do we have time for Tom to demo this?

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:23.430
You want that?

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.430
Alright, applaud Tom.

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:34.480
We're going to really skate
on a little thin ice here.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.350
We are really going to push things.

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.930
This is brand new.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.900
This is very exciting technology.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:42.900
This is...

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.880
I'm going to appear in Jaguar.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:52.040
I don't know if this actually
is part of your release,

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:57.270
but it's very exciting and it's...

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.200
It's very, very... how shall I put it?

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:04.980
This is somewhat more taxing on
our Speech Recognition engine.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.190
And so, because of the room acoustics,
I'm going to change my strategy a little

01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:16.890
bit and rather than use the in-built mic,
I'm going to try this

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.190
with a closed talking mic,
which none of us actually likes to use.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:27.900
[Transcript missing]

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:37.140
is something that we're referring
to right now in this control panel

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.600
as allow command name variations.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.740
So the idea, as Kim said,
is a lot of times you

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:46.080
know what you want to do,
but you don't quite

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.500
remember how to say it.

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:53.950
And we want to provide a mechanism
that allows the user to do,

01:08:53.950 --> 01:09:00.560
to be very forgiving or to be
forgiven by the recognition system.

01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:05.860
So let's turn this on
and see how far we get.

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.660
Let me just test it a little bit.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.600
What time is it?

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.970
By the way, we also can adjust the
gain on these microphones.

01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:35.060
What time is it?

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.070
What time is it?

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.200
What time is it?

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.300
What time is it?

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:45.290
Quit this application.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.860
Quit this application.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.200
Quit this application.

01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:52.660
What time is it?

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:58.800
Well, we may be having some problems.

01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:00.620
What time is it?

01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:12.010
Okay, I'm going to really go on thin ice
and I'm going to try the built-in mic.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:21.980
What time is it?

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:21.980
What time is it?

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:21.980
What time is it?

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:21.980
Now, I'm going to try the built-in mic.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.860
What time is it?

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.300
What time is it?

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.590
It's 18:10.

01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:39.680
What time is it?

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.940
It's 18:10.

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:44.140
Well, we'll see how far we get.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:53.260
Switch to Finder.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:53.260
Switch to Finder.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:53.260
Switch to Finder.

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:59.640
Kim, I think I'm going to punt on this
because we're really short on time

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.150
and I don't want to push it too much.

01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:09.110
The normalization started moving
towards the head-mounted microphone

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.340
and then when he was moving it back,
it started moving back.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.200
If we persevere with it,
we've done some tests.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:19.140
Somewhere in this case, in this room,
it takes up to 20 repetitions of some

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:22.410
commands before the normalization
has reached the right space and

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.070
then it seems to perform fine.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.170
We won't keep you with that.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.630
Tim, let me just try one more thing.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.790
I'm going to start it once again
and if it doesn't do anything,

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:34.200
then we'll punt.

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.750
What time is it?

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.700
What time is it?

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.330
No.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.650
Let's not go with it.

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:45.550
We won't text you guys.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.450
Here's the message for
you developers about this.

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:55.020
This is a change in the overall concept
of how speech recognition works.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.920
We're not trying to recognize the words.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.340
We're trying to recognize the meaning
by a technology that's actually been

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:05.860
quite well proven now in the way
that it works for classifying word

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.730
strings according to their meaning,
and the recognizer is capable

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.940
of catching those word strings.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.980
We'll encourage you to try it out.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:18.280
Is this in the Jaguar WWDC CD?

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.280
This is not.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.520
Look for subsequent seeds.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:27.380
The way this works is the standard
approach to dealing with this

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.580
problem is to sit down ahead of
time and try to imagine every way

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.080
that people might say every command.

01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:36.200
Right, exactly.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.490
You end up with this huge list,
and the next person who comes along says

01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:42.000
something that you didn't anticipate.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.580
Instead,
you gather examples of the different

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.750
ways that people might say each of the
spoken commands for your application.

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.570
Then you train what we
call a latent semantic map,

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.880
which can generalize from those and
look at other strings and see that

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.980
they are similar in structure to those
examples by looking at word pairs,

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:06.120
word triples, and co-occurrences of words
statistically represented.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:12.500
We're not making the API available
to developers in Jaguar because we

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:15.610
want to iterate on that API ourselves
a little bit and get more experience

01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:18.190
with the technology and understand
the constraints in using it.

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.000
But you can start thinking
about it because our intention

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.640
is indeed to make it available.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.760
And the way to start thinking about it
is to start gathering alternative ways

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.240
to say the commands in your applications.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:35.260
Don't go crazy and try to get as
creative and as imaginative as you can.

01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:38.120
We know you're a very
imaginative bunch of folk.

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:45.630
But look at what a naive user is likely
to say if they know what can be done by

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.810
speech but don't remember how to say it.

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:51.900
And start building up those lists so
that you're ready for us by the time

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:54.430
we're ready to release this to you.

01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:59.230
So what we've done, let me summarize,
is talked through a whole bunch

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.840
of things that are new in Jaguar.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.450
We're working on Speech Synthesis.

01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:03.990
You've seen a work in progress.

01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:05.590
Expect that work to keep going.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:11.480
You've seen widespread incorporation
of speech into the user interface,

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.270
which means that your
applications are speakable,

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.970
whether you do anything about it or not.

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:20.070
What you can do about it is make
sure that they work well by making

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:24.470
sure that your texts and strings
sound okay when they're spoken,

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.720
by using standard sheets,
standard alerts, and standard controls,

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:31.240
because that's what will be spoken.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.510
If you really want to
use a custom control,

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.000
then you can associate an
alternative string with that control,

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.380
which is,
we will see and we will speak that

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:41.840
string if people select that control.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.140
And test that when people say
these controls themselves,

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.470
that the speech recognition works.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.500
We've shown you that people can
navigate the user interface by voice,

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.280
and we've shown you semantic inference,
and Cocoa classes.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.280
We have some more information
here about how to use these,

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.190
but I think you guys can
figure it out for yourselves.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.600
Let's end up the main session now,
and we'll hang around here and

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.270
outside to talk about this further.

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.280
Once again,
I want to thank you for staying so late.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.090
Thank you.
