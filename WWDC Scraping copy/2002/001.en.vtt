00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.090
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
User Experience Evangelist,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.690
John Geleynse.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.860
Well, good morning.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.200
Welcome to session one and
to the second day of WWDC.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.240
I hope you had a great day yesterday.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.620
Today we're going to begin the
day with two sessions focused

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.650
on user experience for MacÂ OSÂ X.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.880
And the first one is going
to focus on the principles,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.440
the human interface design principles
that we employ at Apple as we put

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.960
together the operating system,
as we put together some of the

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.700
applications that we produce.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.850
And the focus of this session
is around these principles,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150
and really the content for this
session is chapter one from the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.440
Aqua Human Interface Guidelines book.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.680
And then we're going to follow
that up with part two at 10:30,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.200
which is focusing
specifically on adopting Aqua.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.910
But to talk you through the principles,
I want to introduce Stan Taylor,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.690
a member of the human
interface design team at Apple.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.690
Stan?

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.640
Good morning.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.990
This morning we're going to talk about
human interface design principles.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.010
Human interface design principles
are basically statements of

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.080
policy about designing interface
that work most of the time,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.620
and that's gained from
concrete experience.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.880
But as I was thinking about how to
gel the concept of HI principles down,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.800
I thought I'd illustrate
it with a riddle.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.080
This riddle is about three salespeople
in your organization who are on a

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.800
trip trying to sell your software.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.470
And they get done with their
job late at night and they

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.790
have to check into a hotel.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.150
Turns out it's a very inexpensive hotel,
but they have to get up early

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.800
the next morning for a flight.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.980
So as they're preparing,
as they're on their way up to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.800
the room with the bell person,
they ask him, "How much is the room?"

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.400
And he tells them,
"It's $30." I told you

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.800
the room was cheap.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.800
So that meant that they each
gave him $10 for the room.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.640
Well,
the bell person takes the money back

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.110
down to the clerk and the clerk says,
"The room is only $25.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.150
You've overcharged them by $5."

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.870
So the clerk on the way back,
the bell person on the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.700
way back up is thinking,
"I don't know how to split

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.550
$5 evenly three ways."

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.260
He gives them back one dollar per person
and puts two dollars in his pocket.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.000
So let's see what we've got so far.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.540
They each paid $9 to the room,
that's $27.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.740
The bell person kept $2, that's $29.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.780
Where did the other dollar go?

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.420
Now it's early in the morning hopefully
and at least some of you aren't

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.940
quite sure where that dollar went.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.430
And the reason that you're not thinking
about this problem right is I created

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.090
an expectation in you by telling
you something that wasn't true.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.200
I told you that each person
paid $9 for the room,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.320
and that was $27.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.560
And in doing that,
I created an expectation in you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.640
that led you to think about the
problem in a particular way.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.200
As a matter of fact,
each person paid $8.3 for the room,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.510
$2/3 for the tip, that's $27,
they each got back $1, that's $30.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.810
But by mismanaging your expectations,
I cause confusion in you.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.960
When we create interfaces,
we don't intend to confuse people,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.200
but we may.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.580
And so, HI principles are about setting
and managing expectations that

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.200
help the user use the software.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.200
And that's what we're going
to talk about this morning.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.200
Why are they important?

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.790
Well, first of all, the user benefits.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.480
Applying these principles will
make your software more usable,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.440
and that turns out to be one of
the top predictors of satisfaction.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.060
So of course you want satisfied users,
applying these principles

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.540
will help you get there.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.200
In addition,
think what happens when they can't

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.320
use a particular piece of software.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.730
What do they do?

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.600
After they've exhausted
the manual and help,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.650
if they go there at all,
what they're going to do next is go find

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.600
someone else in their organization that
they think knows how to use the software.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.710
And that person is going to sit
down with them and they're both

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.300
going to start working to figure
out how to solve the problem.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.680
At that point in time you have two
people who aren't doing their job.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.010
Turns out that that costs a lot of
money and lost productivity each year.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.350
So you want to set the right
set of expectations so that

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.740
users can learn the product,
they can work well with it and get their

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.570
work done without losing productivity.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.700
And what's that mean for you?

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.530
That means that you're
going to spend less money.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.380
It's going to reduce your support costs.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.000
It's going to simplify and, therefore,
reduce the amount of documentation

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.400
that you have to produce.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.500
And in addition,
you're going to produce less UI.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.670
As we go through the principles,
you're going to see that an application

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.040
with less UI is actually a better one.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.820
And that, of course,
is going to lead to revenue.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.350
So this is a win-win situation.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.200
Now there are a lot of principles.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.350
Don't memorize this chart.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.520
This is just to give you an idea
of the ones that we're going to

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.980
spend a little bit of time on today.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.920
There's one that's very big and
we'll spend particular time on

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.140
that one to get things started.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.210
But these principles are documented in
the Aqua Human Interface Guidelines.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.700
They are available on the web.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.090
If you don't have a copy, download it.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.980
It's free.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.030
And the early part of that will deal
with the human interface principles,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.650
and the rest of the document
shows how we've extended those

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.250
principles and actually created a UI,
and it tells you how to use them.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.890
And a lot of that will be the topic
of what will be in the next session.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.090
So the first principle
is know your users.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.560
And if you haven't heard it before,
you are not your user.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.410
You have to find out who they
are and what they can do.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.300
and you have to find out what they're
doing because uh... they come in

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.520
all sorts of different flavors and

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.790
What you learn about them will
help you create a user interface

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.380
that meets their expectations.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.550
And kind of a rule of thumb that we use,
and you can adapt it however you want,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.140
is pick your favorite victim.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.000
Could my niece, my nephew, my mom,
my dad, my kid, and my favorite one,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.500
the irritating neighbor,
for those of you from California,

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.000
if you've seen the Pac Bell commercials,
you know about the guy next door

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.590
that comes over to borrow your DSL,
could that guy use your interface?

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.700
One way to identify who your
users are and what they can do

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.760
is to create a usage scenario.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.840
Simply set down in writing
or in a document by examining

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.380
your users who they are.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.680
For example, is it a child in school
using their first computer?

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.880
Is it an ex-Windows user?

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.460
Is it a person creating
a professional movie?

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.620
All of them come to the interface
with different expectations.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.620
And what are they doing?

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.540
Are they creating a website?

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.160
Are they creating a family tree?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.490
Are they creating a movie,
as I suggested?

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.020
Again,
this will determine what they think

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.690
about when they approach the interface.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.810
And their background and what they
have to do will also determine how they

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.850
approach the task and the interface.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.320
So the time you spend getting
to know them will allow you to

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.500
adapt the interface to their
particular skills and expectations.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.660
And when you do that,
keep in mind that what you're going

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.360
to be doing is taking their job,
what they want to do,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.960
and making it easier for them to do that.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.740
So you're not just going to go and say,
"They do this, then this, then this,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.920
then this," and mimic
it in the interface.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.430
You want to find out what they're doing,
think about how can you make

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.310
them get their work done better,
and then that's what you'll do.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.600
We tend to think of users
as falling on a dimension.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.700
On one end we have what
we call the low end users.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.040
Typical of that would be the person
who has a new mini-DV camera and says,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.300
"I really like that iMovie.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.620
I want to use it." And they go out
and buy their very first computer.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.260
They would be a relatively low skilled
group in terms of using a computer.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.220
Another example might be the children in
school that are handed an iBook and said,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.930
"This is what you're going
to do your homework on."

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.400
On the other end of the spectrum we
have what we sometimes call power users.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.500
These are the very
sophisticated scientists,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.560
professional designers, IT professionals,
the ones that tend to use what we

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.810
sometimes call the high-end apps.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:37.490
But keep in mind that that new user,
the so-called newbie,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.920
is going to learn over time
and become more proficient

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.450
in performing certain tasks,
particularly the tasks that are

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.970
involved in getting their work done.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:54.230
And the high end user, the power user,
they really become masters at

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.780
the applications that are used
in getting their work done.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.340
But when they use a
new piece of software,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.120
even though they may bring more
sophisticated approaches to using it,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.300
they're still novices
at that point in time.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.010
Both of these groups are going to
be very frustrated if they can't

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:19.590
get their work done because yours
or our software gets in their way.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.700
So, know your users.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.270
Fundamental basis for all
the rest of the principles.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.650
The next principle is kind of the
basis for graphical user interface.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.300
We're calling it C and point.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.000
Basically it says that everything a
user can do is visible in the interface.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.200
And in particular,
there's a model that says,

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.440
first I pick an object,
and then I pick a verb

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.140
to act on that object.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.350
And that's the basic model
of graphical user interface.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.820
They can pick the action
in a couple of ways.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.540
And we'll discuss direct
manipulation in a minute.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.410
But the most classic way
is to select an object,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.360
as you see here, selecting the folder,
and then selecting an action

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.890
to perform on that object.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.470
And the idea is that the user
doesn't have to know any syntax.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.000
They don't have to know,
they don't have to memorize any commands.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.150
It's all visible to
them in the interface.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.810
We mention this because we still
see some applications that don't

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.080
quite get the principle right.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.360
For example, they might ask someone
to pick a property,

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.220
then pick an object,
and then pick something else that causes

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.280
the property to be applied to the object.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.030
And it gets complicated
and confuses the users.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.400
So that's a basic fundamental principle,
C and point.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.530
Metaphors is another one.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.520
You can take real world objects and use
them as a metaphor in the interface.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.860
For example,
menus are something that people

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.750
are familiar with in restaurants.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.240
They know they can pick
items from a menu to,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.790
in the case of a restaurant, choose food.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.970
We can take that,
put it in the interface,

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.580
and help them out by
something that's familiar.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.400
They know how to manage files
and folders and coordinate them.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.940
So we can use that knowledge and
build folders into the interface.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.220
They know that they can use a
trash can to throw things away.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:11.240
So we know that we can create
a metaphor on the computer as

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.960
a way of getting things off the
computer or throwing it away.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:24.280
So metaphors allow us to take real world,
familiar objects and take advantage

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.750
of what the users already know about
those objects in getting work done.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:13:02.200
[Transcript missing]

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.610
But in the early days when
people created their work,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.610
saved it on a diskette,
they weren't very comfortable

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.800
about taking that diskette then
and putting it in the trash can.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.010
You know,
I don't want to throw my work away.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.460
And you'll notice, by the way,
in MacÂ OSÂ X now,

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.660
I don't think many of you
use diskettes anymore,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:25.580
but if you drag a CD around
or a zip disk around,

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.060
you'll see that the trash can
turns into an icon of the eject

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.460
button to help people who have
trouble with that metaphor.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.100
So metaphors, use them,
but put some thought behind how

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.640
you use them in the interface.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.700
The next principle is
Direct Manipulation.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.260
Whenever possible,
let the user act on the object the

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.640
way they would in the real world.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.600
It saves them having to scan
the menus to find something.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.060
In this case, for example,
what's illustrated is taking

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.200
a file and dragging it and
dropping it into a folder.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.580
In fact,
drag and drop is probably the most

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.120
common form of direct manipulation.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.400
And when you use drag and drop,
try to use it, you know,

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.800
wherever you use copy and paste,
use it for dragging files around,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.910
but use it for other things as well.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:23.190
Like if a user selects text,
let them drag the text around.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.320
In general,
you want to use direct manipulation

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.220
wherever it's expected.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.980
And users actually expect it more
than just moving things around.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.280
So support it whenever they use it.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:39.670
In this example, we have a text document
and we have the color

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.760
A little chip from the color
picker is being dragged around.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.640
The chip knows something about its color,
maybe the color space it came from.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.570
The text document knows that it can
take information from that chip,

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.630
that is the color that it wants,
and change the text to that color.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:01.790
Another example would be if you
used a name and an address book

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.510
that contains phone numbers,
email addresses, all sorts of things,

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.980
but you could drag it into
some other application,

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.560
and that application would know
that it could take from what

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.750
was being dragged information
that it needed about the user.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.510
Not all of the information,
just the pieces that

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.860
apply to that application.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.430
The best way to see what users
expect is to observe them.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.520
The next principle is Flexibility.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:36.500
Let different users at different
times do things in different ways.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.950
I've listed seven possible
ways of selecting a verb,

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.410
for example, here.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.320
Now,
we're not suggesting that every single

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.230
case you use all seven of these.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.800
That would be horrible.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.810
But for example,
if there's a very frequently

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:56.560
accessed menu command,
give it a keyboard shortcut.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.090
Don't give all of your
commands keyboard shortcuts.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.600
That overwhelms the user,
and they never remember them anyway.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.830
But if it's frequently done,
give it a keyboard shortcut.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.540
And for those things that are very,
very commonly done,

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.850
you can put them in a toolbar.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:16.080
Here we show our View Switcher widget,
which is in the Finder toolbar,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.500
that allows the user to switch views.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.240
We know that's done frequently,
and putting it in the toolbar makes

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.740
it even more accessible to the
user and requires even less memory.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.160
Again, we're relying on recognition
memory as opposed to recall,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.600
but you can save them the need to go
to the menu bar to find the action.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:56.690
Contextual Menu is another example
of something that you could do.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:56.690
You can provide very frequently
used commands in a contextual menu

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:56.690
on your files or folders or objects
and again support the user and

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:56.690
different user styles in interacting.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:56.690
So try to keep the interface flexible.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.580
At this point in time,
I'd like to invite Pat Coleman to come up

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.680
and give you a demo of how C and Point,
Metaphors, Direct Manipulation,

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.080
and Flexibility have
been applied in MacÂ OSÂ X.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.920
Pat?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.770
Thanks, Stan.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:18.330
In order to show these principles
that Stan has been telling you about,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:23.990
we decided to pick one of the finder
elements that was added in MacÂ OSÂ X,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:29.120
Favorites,
and demonstrate these principles,

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.280
not because you won't
know anything about this,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.260
you probably use this all the time,
but the point is to analyze

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.260
this particular feature
against these principles.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:46.260
The first folder,
I want to add this to my favorites.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:52.560
The typical activity would be to
go through the menus and find the

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.260
command that would let me do that.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.250
It's in the file menu, of course.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.250
Here it is, add to favorites.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.400
In order to find out,
did it really get there?

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:13.680
I can scan the menus
and find the favorites.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.190
The favorite menu, and again,
looking at what we're doing so far,

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.760
the menus of course is the metaphor that
Stan was talking about that you could,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.140
that everybody could utilize
because it's so familiar to people.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.040
And the words are there and
people can make that connection.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:37.710
So here in the hierarchical menu,
we have listed the fact that best

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:43.160
of web folder has been added there,
but we could actually go there

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.420
and make sure it is indeed there.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:47.420
So,

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.400
That's the first method.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:54.890
So what we're talking about here, okay,
we want to add more flexibility to this.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:00.170
The second folder we could add to
favorites by using the command keys.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:11.560
Now, as you all noticed here,
Command-T is indicated in the menu,

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:11.560
but if I use that off the keyboard,

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:18.280
And then use Command-Shift-F

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:24.210
To go there, I'm not sure why the two
commands are different letters,

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.380
but we could talk about that later.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:31.990
When you get there, you see indeed,
Movies and Birthdays has been added.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:39.110
So, this is the power user element,
and we've added that

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:46.610
So if you analyze and say, "Okay,
here the flexibility has

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:51.130
been utilized and more,
instead of just using the menu,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.100
somebody that's a power user
can remember the command keys,

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.890
can actually do this quite quickly."

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:04.510
The last method, of course,
is Direct Manipulation.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.190
You pick the folder and
you drag it to favorites.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.730
It's in the toolbar.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.730
The heart is familiar.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:21.480
It's used for things that
you really like or love.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.330
And in this case,
we've used it as the icon to

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.400
represent favorites in the toolbar.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.970
Clicking on favorites

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:37.500
This session teaches the basic
human interface design principles

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.350
that make the Macintosh what it is.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:46.160
Learn to implement Modelessness,
Direct Manipulation, User Control,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.210
Forgiveness, Feedback and Dialog,
and other interface design

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.210
principles to create applications
that users find intuitive,

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.210
friendly, and powerful.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.210
Stan Taylor, Robert Kondrk, John Geleynse

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.810
Basically what we're trying to show
here is that a familiar thing in the

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.600
Finder is actually using the principles
that Stan has been talking about.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.040
And I'll send it back to Stan.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.470
You can hear about some more.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.600
Thank you, Pat.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.080
Okay, the next principle is
called User Control.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.530
Basically,
the user should drive the computer,

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.170
the computer should not drive the user.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.790
So you want to make sure that the

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.100
You're providing an environment where
the user feels that they have control

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.540
over what's happening in the computer.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.840
One way to do that is make sure
you don't send them down a path.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.340
For example,
a calendar application might say,

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.580
allow the user complete control
on when to pick the people,

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:52.900
the place, the time,
and there was another aspect of the

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.410
calendar which I'm forgetting right now,
but the point is, rather than say,

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.700
do this, then this, then this,
it allows the user to do

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.340
it in any order they want.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.420
Now, sometimes...

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.220
You do want to assist the user by
providing them a sequence of steps.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.040
We do that with assistance.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.950
But always we allow the user to
change the things that they're setting

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.240
up in the assistant in other ways.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.800
So the user needs to be in control.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.240
Now one way of doing that,
because there are times when there

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.760
are things that they can't do at
the interface in a particular time,

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.980
is to show,
to enable or disable UI in order to tell

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.280
them that something isn't available.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.630
But it's not gone.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:35.990
It's still there.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.200
So that's an example.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:42.920
The other way is provide
a warning or an alert,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.910
particularly if the user is
about to do something horrible.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.400
If they want to, for example,
trash their hard disk,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.570
that's their right.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.460
Give them a warning, but let them do it.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.220
And then the other thing is
to provide a working context,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.240
such as a set of tool palettes
that are appropriate to the

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.520
task being done at the time,
so the user doesn't

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.530
have to hunt for them.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.670
They feel they're in control
of the system because the tools

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.070
they need are always present
at the time they need them.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.630
Toolbars is an example.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.390
These are favorite things that the
user wants to access frequently,

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.600
and we can sit here and decide
for the user what those are,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.390
but better is letting the user decide
what they are and be able to tailor the

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:31.130
menu bar in terms of the actions that
they're going to do most frequently.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:37.190
The next principle, Consistency,
is sometimes overemphasized,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.700
but please don't underestimate
how important this principle is.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.500
This is probably the fundamental
principle that allows users to build

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.700
up an expectation of how a system
works or how an application works.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:57.410
In this example behind you, or behind me,
we were showing an example where

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.800
if you drag an icon from the dock,
we show a little poof icon.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.720
And the user learns that that means
that the item is gone from the dock,

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.110
but not gone from the system.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.800
Well, to build on that experience
and to be consistent,

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.480
we do the same thing
in toolbars elsewhere.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.880
Here in the System Preferences,
for example, if you drag the icon off the

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.760
toolbar in System Preferences,
you see the poof.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:25.140
And by consistently doing that,
consistently using that metaphor,

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.800
the user learns that this is
how -- this is what it means.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.070
It means the item's gone
from wherever I took it from,

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.070
but it's not gone from the system.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.680
Consistency is a difficult one,
so when you think about it,

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.300
consider whether or not you
need to be consistent with,

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.930
for example, your application itself.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.810
Now, that's, I think,
is actually a fairly important one.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:55.220
It's often the case that we can
identify the timeline of development

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.130
of a major application or the
organizational structure of a large

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.400
company that produces applications
just by looking at how differently

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.290
things are done in different places.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.820
This allows everybody to be creative,
but it also confuses users.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.970
Users are then not sure,
how do I accomplish this goal

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.500
here when in another place
it's done in another way.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.340
Another element to consider is
if you're building an application

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.540
that's based on some concept
or model from the real world,

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.590
either in terms of the real world
or something that you did in a

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.440
previous version of your application,
or applications that are

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.600
similar to yours do it,
at least consider whether you want

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.610
to break that expectation that the
user has by being inconsistent.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.690
Because if you are,
you may make it difficult

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:47.450
for them to use your product.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.910
And finally,
this is going to keep coming up,

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.890
the Aqua Human Interface Guidelines.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.820
It's very important to be
consistent with what you see in the

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.640
guidelines that are provided in the
Aqua Human Interface Guidelines.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:06.070
The reason is the user is going
to build up expectations based on

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.840
their interaction with the operating
system and other applications

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.700
that have followed the guidelines.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.450
If you don't follow the guidelines,
then not only will users have

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:19.050
difficulty using your application,
but this will break down their

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.380
expectations that they've built
up from the operating system and

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:29.490
other applications and will lead
to possibly confusion in general.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.890
What you see is what you get.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.980
Very well known principle, WYSIWYG.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.030
It has two aspects.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.630
And in terms of output,
I wanted to point out that it

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.020
was originally talked about
primarily in terms of printing.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.390
But we're now creating all sorts of
different media that we then send to

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.980
some other--we create something on the
computer and send it to other media.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.570
For example, we create movies now.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.860
We put them on DV or QuickTime.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:01.900
We create music and it goes on
iPods or in games or other places.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.050
And pictures that go on albums.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.120
In all cases,
what the user sees or hears or

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:13.360
possibly sometime in the future smells,
what's on the computer should be the

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.520
same thing that they experience in
the final media that it's taken to.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.960
The other aspect of what you
see is what you get has to

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.470
do with the interface itself.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.800
What the user needs to get the task
done should be visible to the user.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:37.510
They should always be able to find
all the functionality of your product.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.340
Now you don't necessarily want to show
all the functionality at the same time,

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.040
but always make it obvious
to the user how to get to

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.030
the additional functionality.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.670
And now I'm going to ask
Pat to demo User Control,

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.640
Consistency,
and What You See is What You Get.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:55.640
Pat?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:03.320
Okay, we're going to use mail to
talk about user control and

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.190
to talk about consistency.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:15.800
[Transcript missing]

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.970
And in the main mail window,
you have a toolbar.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:26.370
And the way you operate on
the toolbar to customize it

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.500
is the same in both.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:35.040
So not only are you talking here about
the user having complete control over

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.140
how they want their toolbar to be,

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.210
In both cases,
it's the consistent interface

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.560
that they're interacting with.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.710
So how does this work?

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.500
Well, you know,
maybe you want attachments

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.610
to be at the end,
or maybe you want separators

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.000
to organize things for you.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.590
Maybe you don't really like color,
so you want to get rid of that,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.110
and that could be your compose window.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.300
In the mail window,
maybe you want the mailbox to

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.200
be at the end instead of delete.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.150
You know, whatever the, but the user has
complete control of this,

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:21.660
and that's the whole idea behind
the idea of a toolbar that isn't

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.200
determined by the developer,
by us at Apple.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.970
It's determined by the user themselves.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.190
I'll bring this back to sort of a
default state here in both cases.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.360
and, um,

00:29:40.300 --> 00:30:05.400
[Transcript missing]

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:14.200
You can go through all the options
that you have for your toolbar.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.500
So what you see is what you get here.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.790
Maybe you don't need to have
labels underneath the icons

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.220
to tell you what to do.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.000
In this case,
maybe you want them to be there,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.020
maybe you want the icons to be larger.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:33.820
It's under the complete
control of the user.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:38.400
It can also go away completely if
you don't want to see it at all.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:44.320
It's at your and the
user's determination.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.690
So keep those things in mind.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.310
We've gone through about six principles
now and there's more to come,

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:54.800
so I'll hand it back to Stan and
we'll keep moving along.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.750
Thank you, Pat.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.820
The next principle I want to talk
about is Feedback and Communication.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:10.780
This is essentially the computer
gives information to the user,

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.500
the user makes requests of the computer.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.660
And there's various ways to do that,
but the one I want to emphasize

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:22.420
now is to use your main window,
the primary interface,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.300
as much as you can.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:24.300
Don't

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.130
Users don't like to have to
go off to dialogues or other

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.550
places to get things done.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.170
So in this example here,
I have a mail window and I made a

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.910
request in the mail window to see all
the mail that has in the body of its

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.620
text the word "special." And I made
the request in the primary interface.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.710
I didn't have to go to a dialogue
to say that's what I want.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.660
In addition,
the mail app is giving me back the

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.040
results in the primary interface.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.690
Again, I don't have to go someplace
else to see what the results are.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.080
So here we see the number of hits
and they're ranked in terms of

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.500
likelihood of being what I was
looking for based on that word.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.440
So it's using the primary interface.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:09.960
That's what I want to emphasize
as much as possible as opposed to

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.560
sending the user somewhere else.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.810
And the users want to
know what's going on.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.480
So always provide status and progress.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.730
The worst thing in the world is when the
user just hits a key and then sits there,

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.940
"What's happening now?

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.340
I don't know." There are times
when you may want to get the user's

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.450
attention in the application,
and if you're not the

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.980
frontmost application,
use our notification system because

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:42.580
we will gently and subtly get the
user's attention by bouncing the icon

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.440
When you do have to tell the user there's
something wrong or get their attention

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.190
when you are the frontmost application,
use a good error message,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.200
and I'll talk about that in a second.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.200
The other thing I wanted to say is
don't bury the user in dialogues.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.260
Again, the worst thing is when a user
gets a modal dialogue to do this,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.260
and then the next thing they have
to do is get another modal dialogue,

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.180
and then another modal dialogue,
and then they have to back

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:10.200
all the way out again.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.200
So try to keep that as flat as possible.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.840
I would say never more than two levels,
and the best is one or none.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.860
When you write an alert,
use our standard alert.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:26.240
You need to provide your
application's icon because we

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.470
have a new window layering model,
and they have to be able to keep

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.400
track of what application is
telling them that there's a problem.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.190
In addition, if you use a standard alert,
you'll have a place where you use

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:43.880
the large system font to kind of
summarize briefly the condition or error

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.460
that you need to alert the user to,
and then in small system font,

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.300
you can give them a fuller description,
the consequences of the condition,

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.980
and how to get out of it.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.770
And then finally,
providing them meaningful push

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:02.980
buttons where it's very clear exactly
what to do to correct the situation.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.300
So, we all know this one, forgiveness.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.120
The worst thing in the world is when
the user does something that they didn't

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.820
intend to do or they do something and the
result is not what they intended to do.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.510
And they're sitting there saying,
"Now what?

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.570
I'm in trouble." The principle of
forgiveness says you're going to give

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.460
them a way to deal with the problem.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.750
One way to do that is to
track the steps visually,

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.340
and I'd like to call attention
to one of my favorites.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.490
I think it's a very good
example of user forgiveness,

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:36.530
and that's the history
palette in Photoshop where

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:44.240
you can undo an awful lot of,
in my case, terribly egregious mistakes.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.310
So, and in other cases,
let the user exit a sequence

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.220
of steps to is another way.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.640
But if you can't do anything about it,
if you know they're about to do

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.480
something that you simply can't fix,
warn them.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.080
Again, user control says let them do it.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.880
But as this example shows where the
person's about to erase the hard disk,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:02.880
you can't do anything about it.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.720
Again, user control says let them do it.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.450
But as this example shows where the
person's about to erase the hard disk,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.480
tell them, "If you do this,
we can't fix it for

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.250
you." But when you can,
provide a way for the user to fix it.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.250
Undo and redo is the simplest way.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:20.250
So after a user performs an action,
have an undo choice that allows

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.030
them to undo that action.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.820
And then of course there's the,
"I did this.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.110
No, I didn't really want to do this.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.800
Yes,
I do want to do it." So there's redo,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.830
which is an undo of an undo.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.240
When you need to, provide alerts.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.980
And we showed you a good alert.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.590
But if you see that you're
providing a lot of alerts,

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.150
revisit your interface because you're
probably doing something that's

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.100
making it more difficult for the user.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:53.530
Alerts are provided when needed,
but you shouldn't see a lot of them.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.180
Modelessness.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.690
In general,
don't trap the user into a particular

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.000
mode or way of doing things.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.850
And that's a general rule to follow.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.340
And the first thing
people are going to say,

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.000
well, there are times when I have to.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:10.390
And yes, it makes sense.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:14.040
If, for example,
in the real world metaphor

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.680
that you're copying,
the user would be in a mode.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.780
Let's say in a paint program,
you pick a brush.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.650
Well, you're in a brush mode now.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.450
But make it visible to the user
how to get out of that mode.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.000
And into the next mode.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:31.420
Generally speaking,
you would like the user to be able

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.660
to do whatever they want at any time.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.760
There are ways to improve the
modelessness of your application.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.210
And I've listed several here
and we'll go through them.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.480
One of them is modeless dialogs.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.510
For example, when you're setting
preferences or settings,

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.880
put them in a modeless dialog.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.250
That way the user can interact
with the--your application

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.580
or other applications.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.470
And the other advantage
of a modeless dialog,

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:01.720
such as this utility palette,
is that it allows the user to

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:06.390
see the results of the settings
that they're making immediately.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.380
Another way that's new
in MacÂ OSÂ X is Sheets.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.650
They've been around for a while now,
but it may be curious to put that

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.240
as a way of modelessness since
they're essentially modal dialogs.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.670
The point is they're modal
only to the document or window

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.480
that they're attached to.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.270
And while they're up,
it allows the user to go to other

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.950
places in your application or other
places in the system and do things.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:34.660
So, use sheets as a way of
promoting modelessness.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.040
Another is drawers.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.350
Drawers take possibly big chunks
of the interface that might always

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:46.660
be in the user's face and allows
the user to display them or not.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.990
So, they're not stuck in the
mode of always seeing it.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:53.230
They can choose whether
or not they want to be,

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:55.420
to have those things present.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.940
So, it increases the modelessness
of your application.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:06.160
And now we'll let Pat Demo feedback,
forgiveness, and modelessness.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.200
Pat?

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.090
Thanks, Stan.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:16.820
We sort of prepared a number
of documents here that

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:24.950
I'm going to use to show
you these principles.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.270
I also need the font picker.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:42.700
[Transcript missing]

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:48.200
It's okay, we can make some more.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.380
Let's just have maybe a couple choices.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:57.870
All right,
so what I want to show in this is

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:02.390
One of the things that Stan talked about,
and that is if you change

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:07.020
something in your document,
for example here, if I want to change

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:11.420
this from Helvetica to,
well, let's use the system font,

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:18.320
Lucida Grande, and let's make it bigger,
really big.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:24.250
And the reason for the
color picker is because,

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:28.320
let's try changing that.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.000
Ooh, ugly.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.730
But, so if I really don't
like what I see here,

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.270
instead of having to go back
through all the operations

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:42.710
Stan pointed out in the undo,
redo,

00:39:43.200 --> 00:40:01.300
[Transcript missing]

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:10.590
Feedback to the user,
forgiveness to the user,

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.900
always available so they're not stuck
and they don't get mad because somehow

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:21.440
you've put them down a road that they
can't get out of and they haven't got

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.980
any way of figuring out how to do that.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:30.620
To demonstrate modelessness,
I want to bring down a sheet,

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.640
a printing sheet here.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.400
We actually hooked up a printer,
so I hope this works.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.070
And this document is huge.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.640
So here we have a print
dialog and here we have,

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.190
I guess I dismissed it,
or I sent it to the printer too soon.

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:02.390
I can print this document
or I can print this one.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.480
It's not,
so it's modal to the actual document,

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.710
it's not something the
application is working on.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:15.360
So that's kind of important
because it's great for users to be,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.360
to have that control.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:24.030
We're going back to a principle
we talked about previously,

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.590
but user control is essential.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.990
I'm going to send this to
the printer again just to

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.900
show you if you can see that.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.920
I guess it's still trying to...

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.180
It must be either done or crashed.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:50.370
Anyway, what I wanted to talk about is,
in feedback, you have the opportunity to

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:55.640
add to your icon some kind of
badging or some kind of animation.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.410
You've all printed,
so you know that there are

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.790
sheets that come through,
and if you have a USB printer that's

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.780
directly hooked up to the CPU,
you'll get numbers that

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.560
appear on the pages.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.810
Like this document was 12 pages,
so you could,

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:15.680
just by looking at the icon,
figure out where you were

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.600
in the process of printing.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.800
That kind of communication
with the user is vital,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:29.020
something you should think about when
you're developing your application.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:34.000
I'll send it back to Stan so we
can move on to the next... Oh,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.710
well,
let me just try one more thing here.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720
If I can... Everything crashed.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.610
Oh, there we go.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:54.820
The perfect dialogue.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.510
Writing alert messages is very difficult
because you really do want to communicate

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.480
to the user what the problem is.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:09.600
And of course,
this is something that you really

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:15.490
want to warn the user about if
they're going to lose their data.

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:20.500
So I guess that's also in the guidelines.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.100
So this is another plug
for the guidelines.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.750
Thanks, Stan.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.040
Back to you.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.100
Thank you, Pat.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:36.840
The next principle is
Aesthetic Integrity.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.510
This is one where I think
Aqua has raised the bar very high,

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.300
and happily so.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:47.010
You can think of it as the quality
that allows the user to sense

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:50.860
eloquence and beauty in the interface.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.740
To do that, of course,
you have to have the

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.210
highest quality imagery,
highest quality icons,

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:01.940
follow the layout guidelines,
because this is going to produce

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:06.880
an interface that engages the user,
and is something that the user

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.260
feels very good about using.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.790
It's not just its appearance, though.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.170
But to get the appearance right,
make sure that you use

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:16.860
our Aqua System widgets.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.760
If you don't,
you won't be getting the ones that

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.610
we spend a lot of time designing
to make sure that they do have the

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.580
highest level of aesthetic integrity.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.190
And follow the layout guidelines.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.190
In a minute,
we'll talk about why the layout

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.510
guidelines are so important.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:39.960
So again, it's not just the beauty,
it's the composition of the interface.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:45.690
The layout guidelines,
combined with our Aqua widgets, provide,

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.220
you know,
they support the control hierarchy,

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.820
they support the, you know,
what's important,

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.510
and help the user to see what's
important in the interface.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.790
They eliminate clutter.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.620
You know,
if you have really great features,

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:01.580
that's nice, but if it's buried in
a bunch of other stuff,

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.980
the user might not see it.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:07.750
So the judicious use of white space,
which is documented very well in

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.970
the Aqua interface guidelines,
will help you there.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.970
And basically,
it's a business of trying to

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:17.440
keep the interface simple.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:21.690
Taking stuff out of the interface that's
only going to be noise to the user and

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.770
distracts the user from their task.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.740
It's going to provide balance.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.380
So, and the user can see where, you know,
where everything fits and they can

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.940
find what they need when they need it.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:37.140
To do that, you're going to have to apply
these guidelines consistently and

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:42.810
you're going to have to attend to
a great level of visual detail.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.300
So aesthetic integrity, and again,
I think this is probably the one

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.150
thing that stands out most about Aqua.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.680
in designing your icons.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.610
Look at this particular set of
icons that represent applications.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.170
They represent many different
kinds of applications.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:03.240
The one on the left is for creating
documents with text in them.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.330
The one in the middle, preview,
is for looking at images.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.420
The one on the right
is the new iChat icon.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.970
They all look -- have a general
principle that you can see,

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.410
though,
that there's a certain orientation

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:19.140
in the background object,
and then there's a tool

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.570
located in the lower right.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:25.480
The tool in iChat, I guess,
is the person who's conducting the chat.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:30.300
But you can see that even though
the one on the right is --

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:34.900
and others have provided a number of
examples of how to implement the basic

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.400
human interface design principles.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:37.400
They are all highly detailed.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.600
In addition, to support this level
of aesthetic integrity,

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:47.370
there will be interactive
graphics that you want to provide.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.380
Here is an example of some
that we have provided:

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:56.160
the view switcher, the toolbar icons,
and the back and forward buttons.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:03.530
Again, providing very lush, high-level,
high-quality graphics will support

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.140
your users in performing their task.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.120
I mentioned these two.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.280
In addition, in your own product,
don't forget your splash screens,

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:13.640
documentation, screen grabs,
wherever you use those.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.520
Make sure they are of
the highest quality.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.400
The next principle is Simplicity.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.700
Again,
if the user is trying to get something

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.970
done and they can't figure out how to
do it because there's so much garbage

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.500
on the interface that they can't find
the thing that they need to work on,

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:36.060
that's going to cause them to not
be able to get their work done.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:37.770
They're not going to be very happy.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:42.170
So make sure that the basic
features are immediately apparent.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:46.000
That way the user can focus on
the task that they're performing.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.200
Basically, reduce clutter.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.350
Now, in saying that you should
keep the interface simple,

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.970
you're going to say, "Well,
I've got a lot of advanced

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.420
features I want to give them,
too." Well, you can do that.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.200
We did it here.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:00.510
This is the simple save dialog that shows
them how--provides a place for a name,

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.010
a pop-up for recent and favorite places,
and the button.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:09.870
It also has a disclosure button
that allows the user to access

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:15.270
the more advanced view of the
entire file hierarchy so they can

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.020
save the document someplace other
than the places that are provided.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.020
And that pop-up menu.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.010
This is called progressive disclosure.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:26.880
And progressive disclosure allows
the user at their own pace to

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.020
discover the advanced features.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.020
It's not that the features
are hidden from them.

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.940
If you do progressive
disclosure correctly,

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.730
you will make sure that there's
always something visible to the

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.010
user that tells them where to
go to get the advanced function.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.310
But it says,
"I'm not going to put it all in

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:45.970
your face at the same time." You can
progressively discover it as you

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:47.760
mature in using the application.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.120
Thank you.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:55.500
And the final principle that
I want to mention is Accessibility.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.700
Users don't all have the same abilities.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.570
As you see the list here,
visual impairments, hearing impairments,

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:05.660
difficulty in performing
fine motor movements,

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.970
those three alone account for
roughly one out of five users.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.620
Twenty percent of users,
or would-be users,

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.460
have difficulty in one of those areas.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.980
And in addition, there are people with
learning impairments.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.340
You can support them in large part
by following the guidelines because

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.900
a well-organized interface will help
people who have learning difficulties.

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:26.750
There are 52 million people in the U.S.

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:27.980
with disabilities.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.800
Now, in a minute,
we're going to demonstrate

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.170
some of the built-in features,
which if you went to the keynote,

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.640
you may have seen some of those as well.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.750
But as you design your interface,
keep in mind that we didn't

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:41.520
do everything for you.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.260
You have to think about the fact that
users don't all have the same abilities.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.460
So, for example,
if you provide-- Is there

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.230
something that you can hear?

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:55.000
Is there something that you can see
that provides the same information?

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.180
If you use color,
what happens if a person can't see color?

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.800
Can they use the interface?

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.650
And so we've built a lot
of things into the system.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.960
And the other thing
I would like to mention,

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:14.090
there's a session on Thursday that
will tell you also how you can

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:17.940
make your application able to
use the new-- The new system.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:24.700
--assistive APIs that will provide the
ability for assistive technologies to--

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:45.100
[Transcript missing]

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:54.960
We've chosen System Preferences to talk
a little bit about aesthetic integrity.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:00.160
One reason is because it's one of
the places where there's a large

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.270
collection of icons that we've

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:41.800
[Transcript missing]

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:46.240
To separate these things,
although we've used separators here to

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:52.200
draw attention to the various categories,
it still is

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:58.140
Using a lot of space on
either side of that separator.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:02.060
If I go into an actual

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:18.420
In the account section of
preferences where you actually

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:22.360
establish the various accounts,
I wanted to point out

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:27.080
individual pains and how we've
actually set those things up.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.480
One of the things that we've
done is we've been clustering

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:37.320
everything toward the center,
aligning the labels to the right

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:43.180
and the content to the left,
so it sort of creates these axes

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.900
that the user can be drawn to.

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:51.440
It's sort of the center of focus idea.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.370
One thing that seems to be
somewhat confusing to developers,

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:58.600
we've gotten a lot of questions about it,
is that there's this idea of

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.440
centering everything within the space.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.660
What we're really talking about
here is once you've established

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:10.020
the layout of your content,
it's equalizing it within the pain

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.440
that you have available for your use.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.000
This is being established, this size,
by all the pains that are here.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000
We've constrained ourselves a little bit,
but for the most part,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.820
it works out pretty well.

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:34.000
If we go to the accounts,
this is utilizing that whole

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.240
idea of progressive disclosure,
something that's very simple.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.880
We're just showing what the accounts are,
but if you want to go in

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:45.680
there and start editing them,
then you get something that's very

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:49.020
similar to the My Account layout.

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.730
How to change your picture,
how to change your password

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.270
is available there.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.960
If you're a new user,
you also get a lot of

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.960
information about this.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:02.470
The next thing that we're going to talk
about is the layout of the content.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.410
We're going to talk about
the layout of the content.

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:09.490
We're going to talk about
the layout of the content.

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:10.960
We're going to talk about
the layout of the content.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.800
We're going to talk about
the layout of the content.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.960
We're going to talk about
the layout of the content.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.950
We're going to talk about
the layout of the content.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:23.570
We're going to talk So I'll
leave that to you to go in and

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:25.730
investigate what those actually are.

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:34.120
I'm going to go to the general
controls pane because one of the

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:39.580
things that Stan mentioned is this idea
of possibly color not being something

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:43.480
that everybody would be able to see.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.170
We've created two different appearances.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.440
One is blue.

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:53.010
And when you are in the blue mode,
the title bar controls are the red,

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:54.870
yellow, and green.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:59.060
In this case,
the zoom isn't available because

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.980
this isn't available to be zoomed.

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.670
But if you change to graphite,
the color goes away,

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:08.180
but the glyphs are still there.

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:11.000
So the rollover effect is still present.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.420
So we can't really...

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.200
The reliance on color is
something that you should avoid,

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:22.200
basically.

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.460
The last thing I want to talk
about is something that gets

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:37.300
into this idea of accessibility,
and that is keyboard navigation that

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:44.420
we've added in the system that you can
take advantage of in your applications.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:44.420
So, if I just go ahead and show
you the keyboard navigation.

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:50.880
Let's see.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.360
I'll make sure it's turned on here.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.800
It is not.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.930
Okay.

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.520
Now that it is,
and all controls can be navigated to,

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:10.960
go back to the main pane and
you'll see that it's there.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:17.080
And through the arrow keys,
can you see how it's focusing around

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:25.450
the icon of the controls up there?

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:37.200
Well, actually I wanted to stay on the
general controls thing so we can...

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
How do I get into the actual pane, Stan?

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
I think you have a demo effect going on.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.750
Oh, there we are.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.110
So, now I can use the arrow
keys to pop the menu,

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:08.710
and if I wanted to...

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.840
Select blue again.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.700
It does that.

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:20.080
Highlight color if I wanted to pop
the menu for that and then navigate

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.840
through the different colors.

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:30.890
I can change the highlight color
by hitting the space bar and

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:31.840
continuing on through the...whoops.

00:57:35.100 --> 00:58:04.200
[Transcript missing]

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:14.000
I'm going to demo some of the built-in
features that allow people with

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.780
disabilities to use the computer.

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:21.060
I'm not going to demonstrate all of them,
but one of them is mouse keys,

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:26.250
which simply allows the user
to use the numeric keypad to

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:41.400
[Transcript missing]

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.430
Again, we paid attention to all of our
principles when we designed that,

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:47.260
so we built some aesthetic
integrity into this as well.

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:50.970
If the user, for example,
presses a command key,

00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:54.810
A little glyph appears that
shows that the command key has

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:58.260
been pressed and all the keys,
let me move this aside so you

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:01.890
can get a good view of this,
all the keys can show up and then as

00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:03.960
soon as they hit a key that's not,

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:07.260
The key is a key that
is not a modifier key,

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:09.520
then those glyphs go away.

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:14.360
So we provided some aesthetic
integrity in terms of some engaging

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:18.080
feedback for the user who wants it.

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:22.250
Slow keys, I'm not going to demonstrate,
but that allows a user who has to have a

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:27.790
delay between the time a key is pressed
and when the key actually registers.

00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:32.050
For hearing impaired people,
they need to have something that shows

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:35.060
them when there's been a system beep.

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:38.190
And the problem is we've always
used a flashing menu bar,

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:40.960
and with screens getting
larger and larger,

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.040
it's sometimes difficult to see that.

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:47.300
So we've come up with a new
way of showing the system beep.

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.340
The screen simply has a little flash.

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.480
And so if a user does something
that would cause a system beep,

00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:57.210
they get the flash.

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:03.180
Finally,
for users who need to enlarge the screen,

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:09.170
we have a new zooming feature,
and this allows the user to use the

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:11.920
numeric keypad to zoom in and out.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.500
And one of the nice things they can
do with this is they can say -- let's

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.290
say a user needs to zoom into here
to be able to see the interface,

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.360
and they can't see anything
when it's zoomed out here,

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:26.420
but they can maybe navigate a bit
if it were zoomed not quite so far.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.540
Then we allow them to do that,
so now with that set,

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.960
I can zoom right in,
and then I zoom out to

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.410
that intermediate position,
zoom back in, zoom back out,

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:38.180
and if I want to keep zooming out,
I just hold the button,

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:42.270
and it zooms all the way out.

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:42.290
So that's --

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:44.350
And then finally,
there are users who have

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.660
difficulty with screens.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:53.570
They can't tolerate bright environments,
and so we allow them to...

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.630
To see the display in
an inversed grayscale.

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:03.170
So those are some of the
built-in accessibility.

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:08.250
There's also a kind of a low-level
screen reader that's been built into

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.390
the system to get people started.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.580
Professional screen readers will be
built based on that application API.

01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:19.770
So a lot has been done for you,
but keep in mind as you develop your

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:24.530
applications that there are people who
have difficulties using the computer.

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:31.030
We've been talking about the
operating system and the applications

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:34.140
related to the operating system,
but Apple also designs

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:36.370
other solution applications.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.530
How are our principles applied there?

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.850
Well, to tell us,
we're inviting the Senior Manager of

01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:44.590
Application Software Design and
Production,

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.500
Robert Kondrk.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.490
And I'll give you this.

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:54.160
Thanks, Stan.

01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:59.390
My name's Robert Kondrk,
and my team creates the visual design

01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:06.390
and content interfaces for many,
many of Apple's applications.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.650
These applications run from
iPhoto to Final Cut Pro to the

01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:16.090
new Webmail application that
was just launched for iTools.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.350
The technologies that these
applications use include

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:24.460
Cocoa and Carbon and WebObjects.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.790
And of course as we're designing we
think about what those underlying

01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:32.780
technologies are and their capabilities
are as we work on the design.

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.780
Pat and Stan just spent a lot of
time going through the different

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:43.200
principles with examples of good
best practice user interface design.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:47.460
What I'd like to do is spend a few
minutes and just kind of zoom out,

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.670
if you will, and remind us all of
design's little secrets.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:17.400
[Transcript missing]

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.400
[Transcript missing]

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.600
Know your user and know your application.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:33.440
From the first date,
otherwise known as the first launch,

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.510
to a happy marriage, otherwise known as,
"I cannot live without this

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.700
application," user interface matters.

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:48.120
Good interface designs the
user and the application.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.100
So you need to know and remember
who your user is and what

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.500
the application is built for.

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:57.530
Is your user a casual user?

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:03.300
A dad creating an iMovie on
the weekend of his daughter?

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.250
Or is your user a pro user?

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.550
Someone using Final Cut Pro whose
livelihood depends on the

01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:11.970
use of that application?

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:19.040
Is the application meant to
be and designed to be very,

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.590
very easy to use?

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:26.600
Or is the fact that you need to
be a power user and have many,

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:31.090
many features available to you and many,
many options more important?

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:37.550
Know your user, know your application,
choose your user and your

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:42.250
application design targets,
and then design with conviction.

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:49.540
Think about the user
using your application.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.870
Use cases are important.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.720
User profiles are important.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.740
Workflow is important.

01:04:58.850 --> 01:05:02.980
Just take the time to go through
and again focus on the user,

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.770
focus on that use case,
what are they actually

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.160
doing with the application,
and run through it.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:12.440
And as Stan said,
and I can't remind you enough,

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.500
you're not the user for your application.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.700
Few applications are islands.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.260
So think about your application
in relation to other

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.700
applications and data types.

01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:29.700
What does the application
need to interact with?

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:31.890
Think about the metadata
around the content.

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:33.330
Can you retain it?

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:38.170
Can you easily do workflow from
one application to another?

01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:43.870
An application that doesn't munch
other people's data is a good,

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:45.380
good thing.

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:50.390
Simplify.

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:52.240
Then simplify again.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.390
And less is more.

01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:59.880
These statements are so terribly true,
and it's one thing that Apple does very,

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.090
very, very well.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:08.270
Clutter confuses the casual
user and annoys the pro user.

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:13.020
Force yourself to
simplify until it hurts.

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:17.330
When it hurts, you know you've probably
got to the right place.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.200
The best tools are ones that
you don't remember you're using.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.850
We all need to strive for this.

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:34.260
It's not about your tool,
it's about the work that

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.030
could be done with the tool.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.400
And if we remember this one thing,
I think we'll all design much,

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.890
much more useful applications.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.800
We all want to thank you for your time,
and I'd like to ask

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:51.700
John Geleynsse to come back up,
wherever you are, John.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.190
And he's going to take you
through the rest of the session.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.780
Thanks.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.600
Okay.

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:09.440
So first of all,
who do you contact about this stuff

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:13.670
if you have questions related to
how do you-- related to implementing

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:16.330
this material or the stuff that
we covered in this session?

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:17.740
That's me.

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:21.230
My role at Apple is to help you
create really great applications

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:22.910
in the world of MacÂ OSÂ X.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.850
And so if you have questions about
the content in this session or you

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:28.980
want to talk specifically about
your product or you have issues with

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:32.540
some of the APIs that we provide
that enable you to implement some

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:35.280
of these principles or whatever,
feel free to send me an email and

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.690
let's correspond after the show.

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:42.440
The roadmap for sessions related to
user experience is essentially this.

01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:45.130
The most important one, in a sense,
is the follow-up session

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:46.450
in about 15 minutes.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:50.480
I'll be presenting the follow-up
to this material and we'll talk

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.930
specifically about adopting Aqua and
what are the detailed steps that

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:59.460
you need to undertake to implement a
really great application on MacÂ OSÂ X.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:04.200
We'll also be presenting the follow-up
to this material and we'll talk

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.950
specifically about adopting Aqua and
what are the detailed steps that

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:14.170
you need to undertake to implement a
really great application on MacÂ OSÂ X.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.940
There's the Address Book Framework
that wasn't referenced

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:19.520
specifically in this session,
but I'll be talking about it in

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:22.890
detail in mine in session two,
coming up in a few minutes.

01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:26.010
There's Speech Technologies as well,
so there's a whole set of sessions

01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:29.940
here at the conference that
relate to delivering a great

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:33.710
user experience with your product,
and that's what this roadmap is about.
