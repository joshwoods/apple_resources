00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.760
Good afternoon.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.550
Welcome to session 603,
Media Integration with QuickTime.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.330
I'm Eric Blanpied.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.780
I work on interactivity
on the QuickTime team.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.740
We're going to have a lot
of interesting topics today,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.660
talking about QuickTime's interactive
features and mixing media together.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.540
We're going to concentrate on these
things from a content point of view,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.350
looking at a lot of demos and
movies and showing something about

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.160
doing some content authoring.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.250
And that will fit well with the
session which follows this one,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.320
when Tim Monroe will tell you a
lot about the API work involved in

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.680
making tools that do that stuff.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.720
We'll also spend a bit of time
talking about third-party components,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.330
talking about a lot of
opportunities for developers there,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.180
and some new things that will be coming
in QuickTime 6 for interactivity.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.720
The basic layout of the
session is going to be,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.700
we'll start by talking a bit about linear
media and how to mix that media and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.710
what features QuickTime has for that.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.660
We'll get into a lot of the interactive
technologies that are in QuickTime,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.280
the various media types
and other features.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.390
And we'll talk a bit about server
communication between movies and servers.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.410
And sprinkled throughout there,
we'll have some things about

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.420
some of the new features.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.250
and throughout it there'll
be lots of demos and we'll

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.520
be building various things.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.840
Helping me out with a lot
of this will be Ben Bandt,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.340
who will help right now.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.470
Thanks, Eric.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.240
To start off,
I'd like to explain a little how

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.370
QuickTime can help in the digital
multimedia production workflow,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.100
even if you don't intend to ever
deliver your content via QuickTime.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.220
Could I get actually demo two on AV,
please?

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.240
When talking about the other media
technologies available for your use,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.340
one might characterize them, say,
Reel or Windows Media,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.190
as a player application or as a file
format or as an ad insertion mechanism.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.480
But it would really be doing
QuickTime an injustice to characterize

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.840
it only as a .mov or only as
QuickTime player because .movs are

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.950
only one of hundreds of file formats
that QuickTime can understand and open.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.280
And QuickTime player is only
one of maybe hundreds or even

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.060
thousands of applications that
you folks have written that rely

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.110
on the extensive QuickTime APIs to
open all these file formats.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.270
So, let's open a few files, shall we?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.440
So let's say you were making a cartoon.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.520
You might start out by hand
drawing the animation and scanning

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.300
it into your Mac or your PC,
and you'd end up with a Photoshop file.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.890
Now while a Photoshop file
is not the most ideal way to

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.350
present an image on the web,
QuickTime does understand

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.700
Photoshop files.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.690
So what we can do

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.060
is drop that into IE, and there's a full,
maybe five-meg Photoshop file

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.540
displayed in IE.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.370
IE doesn't know how to
understand Photoshop files,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.540
but the QuickTime plugin does.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.210
With QuickTime 6 on Mac OS X,
we also are able to understand PDFs.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.830
which is just an amazing
vector format for images.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.240
So you might take that Photoshop file,
trace it in Illustrator,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.140
another professional vector
authoring application,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.160
and QuickTime can understand the
media at every step of the way.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:41.820
And with Illustrator 10 on Mac OS X,
Illustrator files are now PDF compatible.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.060
So QuickTime can understand
Illustrator files as well,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.800
and so can all of the applications
that you have written that

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.550
rely on the QuickTime APIs.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.300
So say BBEdit.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.370
can open and understand QuickTime files.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.180
Now BBEdit is opening
Illustrator files for free.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.060
Now, you may be complaining that you
don't get to charge for an upgrade,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.950
but neither do we.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.420
So, back to Eric.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.960
ERIC BLAINPIED: Okay.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.080
Get the slides, please.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.030
So we've got an idea
about what QuickTime is.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.200
We spent some time talking about
it in a number of sessions today,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.360
particularly a fair amount
about audio and video,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.090
which we're all used to.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.520
We've gone over that
there's a ton of formats,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.990
still image formats and whatnot,
and various audio formats.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.670
But what we haven't spent much
time talking about is the ways

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.960
that you can combine these things,
and the compositing you can do,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.360
and the kind of really dynamic movies
you can make that have a lot more than

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.660
just a little bit of stuff in them.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.910
How this works, we've got the basic
container being a movie.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.670
I could really use a whiteboard for this.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.290
Ben, do you have anything?

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.050
Yeah, I have a whiteboard.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.880
Could I get a demo 2 again?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.900
Yeah, that'll work.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.880
Let's see.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.760
Yeah, that's great.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.900
Okay.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.900
Great.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.890
I got a whiteboard.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.820
I got some pens.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.400
So, the basic item, the basic unit of a
QuickTime movie is the movie.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.620
And now a movie can either be a file
or it can just be a movie in memory.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.140
It doesn't really matter.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.570
But most of the we think of
it as being a movie file.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.730
Then a movie is made up of tracks.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.140
One or more tracks,
theoretically an unlimited

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.120
number of tracks,
such as a video track, a maybe,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.670
Audio Track if we're going to
make a typical linear movie here.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:14.400
[Transcript missing]

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.200
A media sample,
it's the smaller unit within a track.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.740
You have one track per
media type in a movie,

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.990
or a minimum of one track.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.200
A particular track, like a video track,
can have multiple samples of different

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.160
durations drawn by different codecs.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.800
But you need at least one track
for each kind of media you have.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.860
Like maybe we'd add a text track
to this movie for captions,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.630
so it would be...

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:50.240
Another type of track with samples
that might be of a rather different

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:59.710
duration than what else is going
on with the text data in it.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:12.300
Now the media used by a movie can
be stored within the movie file or

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.250
stored externally in other files such
as other movie files or any kind of

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:24.920
media file that QuickTime can handle,
like the audio track

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.890
here might be in a...

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.080
And as long as the files stick together,
then that's going to work out fine.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:38.330
But a lot of times to be more portable,
you want to flatten them together,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.510
or do what we call flattening.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.530
It's also in the UI,
it's save as self-contained.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.480
But that allows you to pull all the
data in and have QuickTime lay it

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.420
out in a logical fashion so that
the file is much more portable.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.440
So a good tool for picking
apart a movie and looking at how

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.960
it's made is QuickTime Player.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.590
So let's go and have a look at that.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.180
Thanks, Eric.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.460
So let's just quickly
pick some kind of a movie.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.500
Let's have a look at, what the heck,
how about the whiteboard movie?

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.660
So a lot of you probably know this,
but the basic ideas in QuickTime Player,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.750
you can have a look at what's in
your movie with get movie properties.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:35.240
You get a nice little pop-up here with
data about the movie at its top level,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.160
like its size, what files it references,
and so on.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:45.000
And then you get an item for each track,
which would tell you things

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.390
like what file it came from,
the format of the track.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.050
All sorts of useful things.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.250
We can change the layering and
graphics modes and whatnot.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.150
And we'll look at this
sort of thing more.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.050
But QuickTime Player we
need to look at as,

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.090
or QuickTime Player Pro at least,
as sort of the first level

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.120
QuickTime authoring tool.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.700
You can do quite a lot of things in it,
and we'll mess around some here

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.090
over the course of the session
and show you some of that.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.090
So let's get back to the slides, please.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.690
All right, so,
so far we've talked a little bit.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:28.220
We've got a number of different types
of linear media that we think of.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.480
Such as your standard linear video.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.680
You may remember CinePack if
you've been around for a while.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.780
Something from the golden
age of digital video.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:22.050
The first thing you need to
do is to create a new video.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:22.050
You can use the "Band"
option to create a new video.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.860
Well, that's a charming bit of video,
but it could really use to be presented

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.520
or enhanced in some kind of a way.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.310
And as we get going in the session,
we'll try and give it a little

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.770
bit of a punch and give it
a little custom approach.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.820
Other sorts of things that you could do
would be to leave CinePack behind and

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.460
use something like the new MPEG-4 codecs,
which you've seen plenty of so far,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.210
I believe.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.840
There's live streaming and canned
streaming for various kinds of broadcast.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.640
And all those still image formats.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.540
We've got music tracks, giving you MIDI.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.780
QuickTime's got a big
sample library from Roland.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.440
We've got effects,
and you've seen a bit of

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.080
that in some sessions.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.080
Things like video filters, transitions,
and whatnot.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.870
And tween tracks are a linear thing
that we'll wind up using in a couple

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.720
of ways that allow you to change
properties of a movie over time in

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.000
a smoothly interpolated fashion.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.960
As far as making interactive
QuickTime movies go,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.450
I right now am sort of thinking
of the new MPEG stuff as

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.600
being good and interesting
codecs to have at our disposal.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.490
And one of the things that I really
like is that for good-sized movies,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.240
the CPU requirements for a
really good-looking MPEG-4 video

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.140
seem to be a little lower than
for what we were using before,

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.190
like Sorensen 3,
making it a lot better for combining with

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.300
movies that may have a lot of other stuff
going on that needs some processor time,

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.680
too.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:25.200
[Transcript missing]

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.570
Alright, so here we have an MPEG-4 video
with Flash layered on top.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.610
The Flash is interactive,
allows us to have some actions

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.960
which start and stop it.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.000
It's composited on top
with a nice alpha blend.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.800
And if you try doing this
with a lot of other codecs,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.610
it's just going to bog on you,
but this is playing at

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.000
a very nice smooth rate.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.540
And the Flash scaled as
nicely as the MPEG-4 did.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.950
Compositing.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:11.170
So the tracks in a QuickTime movie
are layered up from front to back,

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:16.660
and they can have any number of
different graphics modes each.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.440
Some types, like a text track,
can actually have a keyed setting

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.080
to make it possible to composite
the text over what's below.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.990
And all of this is
handled by the raw codec,

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.200
well, a lot of things,
but changes in QuickTime 6 to the raw

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.850
codec and the ICM will make some of
this stuff come out in a smoother,

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.890
more accurate fashion.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.500
You've heard something about media skins,
but, and again,

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.790
media skins often come into play when
we think about interactive movies.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.070
They allow you to really customize
the presentation experience of

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:01.180
the content like nothing else,
even though they're just a simple mask.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.030
By combining that with the various
types of tracks that you can layer

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.560
up to make a strong interface,
you can create something which

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.700
travels with the content.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.370
Every place that QuickTimes plays,
whichever OS you're on,

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.320
it's going to open up and have the look
that that movie's supposed to have,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.670
as opposed to something where
you've skinned a player and

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.380
you have no idea what kind of
interface is going to pop up.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.160
And the authoring that we provide for
it can be done with very simple XML.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.590
So we'll switch to demo two.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:41.910
So let's see if we can't
make a simple skin quickly.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.580
The simple and quick and dirty
method is just create a two-color

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.400
pic or gif or basically any image
format that QuickTime can understand,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.730
export that, then you have

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:07.400
Then you have your video file,
or your VR file, or your Flash file,

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.960
or your image file,
anything that you want to skin.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:13.960
Keep that around.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:23.280
You combine these things very simply
with a straightforward XML file.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.840
And QuickTime knows how to understand
this XML file format right here.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.060
Basically, it has a movie.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:45.690
The QuickTime project is a very simple
project that is very easy to implement.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:45.690
It is a very

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.990
To only be able to drag
the edge of the movie,

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.370
you might use that as your drag region.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.240
Let's open this in player.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:01.580
All we have to do is
change it to a dot move.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.400
And there she is.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.770
So let's switch to demo one
and we'll do a little more

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.300
advanced compositing and skins.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.340
Skins don't always have
to be simple shapes.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.270
In fact, we encourage you to go wild.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.460
It seems like most of the rest of
Apple wants to have you standardize on

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:38.610
a particular UI or make things easier
for the user through standardization.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:38.620
Eric Blaznpied,
Ben Bandt-Horn Skins don't

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:38.620
always have to be simple shapes.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:38.620
In fact, we encourage you to go wild.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:38.620
It seems like most of the rest of
Apple wants to have you standardize on

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:38.640
a particular UI or make things easier
for the user through standardization.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:38.640
Eric Blaznpied,
Ben Bandt-Horn Skins don't

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:38.640
always have to be simple shapes.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:38.640
In fact, we encourage you to go wild.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:38.640
It seems like most of the rest of
Apple wants to have you standardize on

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:38.740
a particular UI or make things easier
for the user through standardization.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.630
But we think that as far
as media goes on the web,

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:47.780
one of the strongest,
one of the most important things you have

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:54.010
to accomplish is to keep and hold these
web surfers' attention spans because

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.900
they're going through ten pages a minute.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.430
And the most important thing you can
do is give them something interesting,

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.540
a visual feast,
and encourage them to explore.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.070
So let's do that.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.560
Drag the monkey's head
around different chakras.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.840
We're just playing
different MPEG-4 files,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.280
MPEG-4 audio,
using a simple script to fade in and out.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.360
So let's take a look inside this movie,
shall we?

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.790
We have the annotation data.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.350
The monkey was drawn
by my roommate Brody.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.400
And we have a number of tracks.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.630
We'll get more into this later,
but we have movie tracks that

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.080
have an independent timeline.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.960
One of the specific fields that
are important as far as compositing

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.590
is concerned is its layer.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.940
It disappeared.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.200
And it's graphics mode.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.820
There's straight dither copy.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
and other interesting effects.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.050
Probably not transparent
is what we want there.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.460
Let's see.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:46.690
And we can take each of these
tracks and paste or add scale from

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.190
separate QuickTime windows and do
some essential compositing right

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.810
within QuickTime Player itself.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.380
For more advanced compositing,
there are a number of tools out there.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.800
Probably the most popular
comprehensive one is TotallyHips

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:10.360
Live Stage Pro for more of a UI as far
as layering and timelines and whatnot.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.930
But you can pretty much do most of
the essential compositing techniques

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.190
right within QuickTime Player.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:36.100
[Transcript missing]

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.640
First off, there's the sprite track.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.680
Sprite tracks allow you to
do animation using a pool of

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.070
images over and over again,
and we've got a lot of wiring

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.090
that you can do with those.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:51.080
Got Flash,
including Flash 5 support in QuickTime 6.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.890
We've got text tracks,
which we can do all sorts

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:54.640
of interesting things with.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.960
You'll see a lot of those today.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.160
QuickTime VR, always a favorite.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.690
The movie media track,
which Ben mentioned briefly,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.760
or movies in movies, allow all sorts of
interesting opportunities.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.410
And then all the linear media
that we've talked about and you've

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.510
heard about in other sessions,
it all comes to the party in this stuff.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.990
To talk a little more about sprites,
the basic idea of a sprite

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.510
track is sprites are images
that are animated over time.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.410
When the sprite track loads up,
it's got all of its

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.160
images at the beginning,
a pool of images,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.130
which can be shared by as
many sprites as you like.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.980
And those can be animated by tweens,
like I mentioned,

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:39.160
or difference frames to change their
position or other characteristics,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.840
like graphics mode and all,
at different points in time.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.540
And they can be drawn by any codec
that's available in QuickTime.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.600
Another very interesting thing about
sprites is that they allow hit testing,

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.600
so you can do mouse movement
and things like that.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:02.800
We use wired actions to provide
a large amount of interactivity,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.350
a lot of manipulation over
the sprites themselves,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.450
and over a lot of the different kinds
of media that are in a QuickTime movie.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.680
They also can have their image driven,
what we call an override,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.010
they can have their image drawn from
any other track within the movie.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.760
So you can do a lot of neat composite
things just within that sprite track.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:29.990
And new in QuickTime 6 is the ability to
load an external image of any type that

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:36.100
QuickTime knows how to handle into that
pool of images by using a wired action.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.490
So you can do that anytime you like,
and then you've got more

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.300
images to deal with there.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:47.330
So we'll do a sprite demo
now on demo 2 please.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:59.540
So here is an old friend,
a basic linear sprite movie.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:06.230
The fish has a number of different
poses and positions which are

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.920
just being changed over time,
which sprite is being used at what time

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.570
is changing and where it is changing.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:19.660
And over the top of it we have a sprite
which is being drawn by the Ripple

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.430
codec and that is taking mouse actions
to give us the mouse click stuff.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:29.580
I think the Ripple codec
got shown earlier as well.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:45.840
As an example of the overrides,
we have a movie here

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:50.360
made by Francis Georges,
who is a really...

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.510
is a really talented
QuickTime movie author.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.840
There's a simple movie here
with a single video track.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.280
It's being used as an override for a
whole bunch of sprites which are tracking

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.590
the mouse and getting scaled and having
their graphics modes changed over time.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.320
To make a really fun sort of thing,
I think this was an award-winning

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.670
movie in one of Totally Hip's contests.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:21.220
Then let's look at Charlie Tuna again.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.990
What's going on with that?

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.290
We're not online.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:34.790
So let's have a look at...

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.700
All right,
so we'll just make a new project.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.650
Oh wait, there we go,
we opened it without that.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.840
We don't need that anyway.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.750
So, um...

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:05.290
Here we've got, I've made a sprite track.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.160
And in that sprite track,

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.100
We've got the pool of images I mentioned.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:15.290
The background,
a number of different knobs.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.880
The background image, you'll notice,
has its codec set to

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.500
use animation and alpha.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.910
This is a picked file
with an alpha channel.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.630
So we've got a number of
sprites that come from those.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.560
If we look at the stage,
we'll see there's that sprite.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:39.320
And then also, we've brought in the
Charlie Tuna video track.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.060
and audio.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.130
And that's laid there on stage as well.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.880
And we don't see it right now because
it's being overlaid by the sprite track,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.980
but the sprite track
will show it through.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.980
And then we've got a skin track in there.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.940
And the skin authoring process
here is a drag and drop your

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.770
images into the window process.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.780
So let's have a look at this guy.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:09.310
So here it is.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.350
Oh, that's not going to skin it, is it?

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:23.780
So here we have the same sort of a thing,
but...

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:24.870
A little bit of control.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.330
We can start and stop.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.040
The frame is there.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.630
And the whole thing just gives
you a little something more to

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.890
your 20-year-old Cinepac movie.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:36.990
Or 30, is it?

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.580
40.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.600
1961.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.270
Who knew Cinepac was then?

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.740
And then we can get further,
we can get really fancy with the

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.690
scripting and do things like add
features that we don't really see

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.800
much anymore like vertical hold knobs,
which I really do miss in

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.520
this era of digital video.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.600
And that's the sort of thing
that I don't really see in

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.740
other people's players either.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:08.360
Finally, there's the new image stuff
that we've talked about.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.740
This is an extremely simple movie.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.420
I've got a text track up
here that I can type in.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.530
I've got a little button here
which takes whatever URL,

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.620
a relative or absolute URL I put
in there and loads that

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.860
into the sprite right there.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:34.890
And we can go ahead and do something like
open up one of these JPEG 2000 images.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:53.100
[Transcript missing]

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:07.170
Text can't really do a lot with making
custom interfaces and highly interactive

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.640
multimedia pieces without text.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.820
And luckily we can do all kinds
of things with text in QuickTime.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.200
Text, as you just saw,
can be editable right there in place.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.150
It can also be displayed anti-aliased.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.220
It can be keyed over other things.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.410
You also can superimpose it
over things using the various

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.170
graphic modes we've got.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.070
You can specify hotspots
in certain ranges of text,

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.090
which can then have wired actions
attached to them to do all of

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.220
the sorts of things that we've
seen in these movies so far.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:42.640
We have something called an href
track that we can make where

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:48.800
the text is full of samples with
descriptions of URLs and times on them.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.790
And as a movie plays,
that makes the entire movie a

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.740
clickable thing that goes to the
URL that's present at the time.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:02.040
We also have,
can use tracks as chapter tracks,

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:08.110
which give you an index to a movie
and allow you to jump around in time.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.790
And then, like I said,
we got the wired actions that can

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:16.820
be used either triggered from them
or we can use wired actions to edit

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:20.970
and manipulate the text in a field
and do all sorts of things with it.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:27.230
QuickTime VR is another one of the major
interactive media types in QuickTime.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.160
It's image-based virtual reality,
meaning that rather than

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.900
doing real-time 3D stuff,
you're doing it from photographs or

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.590
photorealistically rendered images,
which gives you an image quality

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.080
that's really impossible with
a real-time 3D kind of VR.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.830
They can consist of panoramas,
which allow you to explore a scene,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.280
or objects,
which allow you to examine a thing.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.810
And these different types can be
linked together to make multi-node

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.140
scenes with hotspots that allow
you to travel from one to another

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.730
or pick up an object that's inside
of a scene or things like that.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.500
And again, you can wire up those hotspots
with QuickTime's wired actions and

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.990
trigger all sorts of interactivity
in the QuickTime VR movie or in other

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.390
tracks that are in the same movie.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.680
And there are wired actions to
manipulate the VR from the other tracks.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.790
So we'll look at a couple
of VR movies just quickly.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:30.550
Here's a pretty nice cubic VR panorama
in Grand Central Station in New York.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.210
As you see,
we can look all the way up here,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.790
and this is a pretty high-res movie,
so we can really check out the details.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:52.400
[Transcript missing]

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.580
That's a cubic movie.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.680
And the other thing is that by combining
them with other types of things,

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.810
we can get into stuff
like doing spatial audio,

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:07.420
where the movie in this really nice
panorama by Janie Fitzgerald has got

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.010
a sprite track and some audio tracks.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:16.820
The sprite track is monitoring
the pan angle and manipulating the

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.140
volume of the audio track as you go.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.260
Movie in Movie.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:32.360
One of the giant things about
importing a movie into another movie

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.160
and using it as a track is that
you get an independent time base,

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.940
or you get the option of
an independent time base,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:43.130
which makes a lot of things possible
that you previously had to do in some

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.380
kind of a dedicated multimedia runtime.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.970
You can also load anything.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.640
It doesn't have to be our format.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.690
It can be anything that
QuickTime knows how to play.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:59.390
And you can swap this content around
dynamically by using wired actions.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:07.200
So we'll go back again to demo
two and look at a bit of movie

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.920
and movie stuff in GoLive,
which has a very capable

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.920
QuickTime editor built right in.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.240
So we'll switch to the
QuickTime authoring palette here.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:22.960
And we will create a new QuickTime movie.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:29.610
And I want to make that 400 by 133.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:31.820
There's my movie.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.840
You'll notice that they've got the
controller right on there right away.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.610
They've got a dual tab setup where you've
got the preview and the layout exactly

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.240
the way they present their HTML editor.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.370
And we can click this here, though,
and get the timeline up,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.770
which is most useful
for what we need to do.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:56.940
So I'm going to start by bringing
in a bit of linear video.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.870
Drag a video track from there,
and it asks me to go and get the thing.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.600
Where do we put those?

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.430
On here?

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.300
All right,
so we're going to bring in just

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.640
something to have there in the timeline.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.600
Whether we're in preview or layout,
we can see it right away.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.680
It's just a little bit of staticky stuff.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.640
Let's get rid of this color track
that they put in there by default.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:40.720
And we'll look at the
movie and make it loop.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.410
Keep the standard controller.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:48.790
So this guy is going to just loop
around with a bunch of static.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.920
I guess not in the authoring environment.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.260
So now I want to bring in a movie track.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:03.100
And that guy needs to have, um...

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.060
I need to set what piece of
content it's going to reference.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:11.430
And that's going to be-- actually,
let me save this first.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:41.000
[Transcript missing]

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.640
We'll use that inspirational title.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.620
All right, so there's that.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.540
So the movie track needs its data.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.650
We'll click the sample down here.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:03.020
And we'll type in the name, which is--

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:11.400
[Transcript missing]

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.600
showing us that sprite track there.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.890
And it's set-- what are the
settings on the movie track?

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.460
It's, we've got time, it's slaved,
it's off, autoplay is on,

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.890
we want to loop it though so
we can keep seeing the motion

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.780
and understand what's going on.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.880
Notice that the playback
head is not moving,

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.050
but the animation is continuing.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:39.510
Now, let's change the layering.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:45.070
And we'll take the video
track and we will change it

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:50.280
to some other graphics mode,
like how about...

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.400
Something really garish.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.050
And now we'll start this playing.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:04.340
We've got two tracks that have
independent time bases here.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.780
Now, if we want to change what the
movie is referring to over time,

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.000
we can add something else.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.540
Let's go back to the QuickTime.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.520
I'll add a sprite track.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:17.520
You might notice the icon
used for sprite track.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:25.790
This sprite track needs some images,
so we will import something.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.140
And when you import it, like I said,
you can use any codec

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.540
you like for your sprite,
so we get to choose here.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.140
I'm going to try Animation Alpha.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.260
Let's see if we have an alpha
channel around we could use.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.740
And then the sprite that's
being used here is being drawn

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.080
with a default sprite they add,
and I would rather use

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.240
the one I just imported,
so I select my sprite,

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.170
and I'll say image should be the dot.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:58.050
Go into Layout and change
where it is on stage.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:58.970
And let's...

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:07.160
The QuickTime app is a great
way to create a new video,

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:11.100
and you can use it to create a new video.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:42.700
[Transcript missing]

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.350
and I have a question for you.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:38:01.950
I'm going to ask you to
add another action and have

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.300
this one be LoadChildMovie.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:03.300
That's the URL.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:03.300
It already knows what the
URL I was setting it to was.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:03.300
And hopefully this is
going to work when we

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.600
Save it and... Oh, wait,
we've got to set the track to

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.360
be something we can see through.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:18.120
So the sprite track gets set also to
transparent with a black key color.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.770
There we go.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:24.560
So that thing is rolling,
the static's rolling,

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.430
we can scrub it all we want,
and then when we click the button,

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:32.250
we've loaded a different
movie into the background,

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:37.080
which has a rather different duration
than the other things we've had.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:41.260
But still, it has a different time base,
so it doesn't matter,

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.300
it just keeps rolling on us.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:47.630
So that's your basic overview
of movies and movies.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:14.430
Flash 5 now.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.430
We've had Flash support
in QuickTime for a while.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.430
In Flash 4 we had Flash--QuickTime 4
we had Flash 3 support.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.430
QuickTime 5 we had Flash 5 support.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.430
And now, since we're at 6,
obviously we have to

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.430
have Flash 5 support.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.510
The Flash support has always been
really useful to give us a really

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.580
compact media type for doing all
sorts of interesting interface work

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.770
and animation and things like that.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.300
The vectors just work very
nicely and they scale nicely.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.960
They composite really well
with other kinds of QuickTime.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.560
You just set that track to alpha and you
get all of the alpha compositing that's

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:36.360
going on in Flash is nicely composited
on top of the other QuickTime elements.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:39.920
The authoring is popular.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.840
People are very fond of their tool,
so this provides a really

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.430
nice authoring tool to make
interactive QuickTime movies,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.420
because you can bring in your
QuickTime movies into Flash and add

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.100
interactive elements with Flash and spit
the thing back out as a QuickTime movie.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:19.850
Eric Blaz: We've added a variety of wired
actions that we can use to

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:19.850
manipulate Flash elements,
set Flash variables,

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:19.850
trigger Flash buttons,
and we can also attach our wired

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:19.850
actions to the Flash buttons
themselves in another author tool

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:19.850
like Live Stage or something.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:22.200
Oh yeah, we're still on slides.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.630
Right.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:25.830
So, um...

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.670
New with Flash 5,
we get some of the Flash 5 features.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.210
One of the things that's in there
that people like is HTML text,

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.670
allowing you to do a certain
amount of styling your text,

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:41.420
and XML handling, allowing you to import
XML files with that,

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.770
and you can use the
style tags within there,

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:50.730
so you can bring in formatted text,
and you can manipulate it dynamically.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:56.660
And the large amount of scriptability
that came with ActionScript in Flash 5

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.450
is available within your Flash tracks.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:05.110
And because we can trigger Flash buttons
and whatnot from QuickTime actions,

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:08.400
you can do all sorts of neat things
with using the Flash track as,

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.700
you know, having complicated
ActionScript functions that you

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.010
trigger from other parts of QuickTime.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:19.710
So now we will go to the demos
and see something about Flash 5.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.600
All right.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.680
Demo 2, please.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:31.010
Now, like all the other file formats
we've been dragging into QuickTime,

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.700
Flash files just work.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:39.700
A nice way to lay these
out would be in Live Stage.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.610
Here's our Flash track.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.590
Here's a sprite track.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:50.140
You can see if we look at
the single sprite in here,

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:57.270
we have somewhat of a complex script,
but here's the key right here.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.560
Track of ID 1.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.640
which would be our Flash track, ID1.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.480
We can set Flash variables
from within QuickTime.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.640
This is Live Stage's
QScript notation for Wired Actions,

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:16.980
but it's a pretty seamless
integration with Flash interactivity.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.750
So what we can do with this Flash file,

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:33.140
The first step is skinning in QuickTime,
something that you can't do in Flash,

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:38.390
and exchange data with other
QuickTime tracks or with

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:44.740
a server or with a video,
or you could be controlling a video

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:49.550
track at the same time or even
incorporate Flash overlays on top of VR.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.570
the slides then.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:05.090
So, third party components are a topic
that's been touched on a little bit,

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.600
but I wanted to cover it some since
we're here and there's a number of

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.760
them that are adding interesting
interactive capabilities to QuickTime.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:16.010
The fact that QuickTime is based on this
component architecture makes it really

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.830
easy for developers to extend it and
add their own kinds of things to it.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:23.850
This allows us to come up,
people to come up with all kinds of new

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.170
media types that we don't do at all.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.520
And those new things can mix with
the other media just as we've

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:34.060
been talking about the QuickTime,
the QuickTime types.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.530
And, you know,

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.540
Then also we've got the
QuickTime Component Download program,

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:45.710
which is a program by which developers,
Apple hosts,

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.010
The components from some developers
on Apple's download servers,

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:54.840
and then when a movie that uses that
component is encountered by the player,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.650
if it doesn't have the component,
it can check the server and

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.660
offer to download the component
dynamically for the user,

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.050
which in most cases doesn't even
require reloading the movie.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.060
Often with media types,
you need to reload the movie,

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.920
but with codecs and things,
it usually just keeps going.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.790
The third-party components in
the component download program

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:21.670
right now include Indio,
Onto, Streambox, and Zygo Video,

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:25.740
who all provide codecs for
various sorts of purposes.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:31.380
And BeHere, iPix, Pulse3D,
and Zoomify all provide media types

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.710
that allow you to do various things.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:39.350
And Pulse and Zoomify
in particular provide...

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:45.820
Media types which have a lot of
interactivity and have got wired actions

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.180
around for you to do things with.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:45:17.300
[Transcript missing]

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.560
Which we're pretty pleased about.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:25.810
So here we have a 36K movie
playing here in QuickTime.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:33.070
It's an interactive,
well-designed for the web kind of thing.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:38.080
Using a video texture map here that's
streaming off of the Apple website.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:43.770
So, as you can see, the possibilities for
this are just great.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.130
We want to switch over to demo two now,
and Ben will show you a little bit

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.730
about the authoring process with Axle.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.220
Cool.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:01.090
Well, we've had a 3D component
in QuickTime in version 5,

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.620
the Pulse component,
but what makes Axle great is their

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.170
authoring tool is cross-platform.

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:09.950
It runs on 9, 10, and Windows.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.020
It's also extremely easy to use.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:20.120
I really see it as something that even
the most novice Flash animator could get

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:24.350
their hands on and be able to understand.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:31.890
So you have your traditional
4-view 3D modeler here.

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:39.040
Wireframe and Rendered View,
and you can preview how that will

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.200
interact right in the authoring tool.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:49.040
It's really amazing because
pretty much every parameter in

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:57.540
the application is animatable.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.750
and they have an excellent
sequencer timeline view.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.160
and I will be talking
about the QuickTime app.

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:15.740
And this should just blow your socks off.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.110
You can create the most complex
interactivity in Axle without

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:22.290
even writing a line of code.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:29.220
They have a notion of things called
sensors or triggers and reactions,

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.150
and you can have a lot of different

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.320
You can have a sensor be
triggered by pretty much anything,

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.200
a key, the mouse.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.630
You can communicate with the
host application as well,

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.170
including QuickTime.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:46.740
So here we have time
sensors at various times.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:52.910
We play sounds.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.040
And the linkages between

00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:01.250
These sensors and reactions
have various properties,

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:04.630
how they're supposed to loop,
how they're supposed to

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.780
re-trigger themselves,
essentially.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:14.000
create groups of reactions
and develop very complex

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.100
interactivity in no time at all.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:24.650
So this plays an animation that has a
path constraint with a number of keys.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.060
Toggl's Parameter is
visible and invisible.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.470
So it's really a powerful tool.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:39.230
So let's see what some people have been
doing with this inside of QuickTime.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:45.490
This is a movie.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:51.500
And the media is being handled
by the Axial Media Handler.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.500
We're lucky to have Justin here.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.100
He did most of the work on this.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:02.820
The great thing about Axle is
that they are not only a consumer

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.970
of the QuickTime technology,
but they're also a contributor.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:09.970
By writing a third-party component,
they are bringing their own

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.890
media to all of your apps that
are built around QuickTime,

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:15.810
and you get this for free.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:50:06.100
[Transcript missing]

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:13.820
Particles and other sorts
of dynamics built in.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.500
Some particles going on.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.000
I think we can move
the light around here.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.880
And I think this is my favorite.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.620
Don't forget.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.440
Check this out.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:35.680
Let's see if I can remember the controls.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.820
Space bar is jump.

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:58.660
You can see some of the images
and texture mapping going on here.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.190
I'm not positive,
but I'm assuming they're using

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:06.970
QuickTime importers to handle
a wide variety of images.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:25.800
and audio and video,
and so on and so forth.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:25.800
So it's QuickTime playing in Axle,
which is playing in QuickTime.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:25.800
Exactly.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:25.800
So you could have Axle playing
inside of Axle in QuickTime in Axle.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:25.800
All right.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.040
So then we come down to tons
of media we've talked about.

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.790
Well, so it's multimedia when
you put it together.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.610
So let's mix up that stuff.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:46.120
Just zip right back over
to the demo machine,

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:50.290
go to demo two here, and look at some,
uh,

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.660
and Eric Blazow,
who are the founders of the So here's

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.930
something that is definitely on the
pure engineering demo kind of style,

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:04.800
but this shows a sprite track
over on this side with a piece

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.580
of MPEG video slapped on top.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.110
and a Flash track over here.

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:14.360
And there's a chapter track,
so we can see the different

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.120
chapters available.

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.620
And these sprite buttons here
change the chapter using some

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.990
new features in QuickTime 6,
some new actions for

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:23.020
manipulating chapters.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.580
They also have updated the Flash.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:29.180
So the Flash buttons are changing the
chapters with the same wired actions,

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.020
as well as the sprite buttons.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:36.960
And the text that's being drawn
here is using Flash's XML import

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:41.520
and HTML style text handling,
so we can format it and edit

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:49.370
it outside of the movie just
by fiddling with that here.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:59.660
So let's just try changing some
color of some of that text.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Open up the movie again.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
I forget which sample.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.840
Yeah, we just changed that one to white.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:11.000
So that's production-wise a pretty
useful thing within the Flash 5 support.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.860
Another one to get into a slightly
more complex sort of movie.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.370
Here's a...

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:24.560
A skinned movie done for marketing
purpose for the new Mini.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.550
They've got a...

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:43.100
[Transcript missing]

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.290
and the little close button.

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:50.250
So there we're getting into the
sorts of things you can do when

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:53.110
you start taking a bunch of
different kinds of QuickTime media

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:53.980
and layering them up together.

00:53:56.170 --> 00:54:03.060
Let's speed on ahead, back on the slides,
to briefly talk about

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.690
intermovie communication.

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:09.230
Basically,
you can send messages between movies.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.960
Any particular object in a movie
that can do wired actions can target

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.430
a movie within the hierarchy of
another movie to create all sorts

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:22.190
of opportunities with manipulating
the various properties and whatnot.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:27.940
Another thing that we do a lot of
interesting things with is XML.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.970
As you may be picking up from
a number of these places,

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:38.410
XML is the text format where QuickTime is
sort of standardizing on to do various

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:40.180
kinds of descriptions of things.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:45.380
XML in QuickTime is...

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:49.630
As far as the interactive QuickTime goes,
it happens with QT lists.

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.390
QT lists are just hierarchical
variables that you can have

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.460
within a movie or a track.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:55:00.600
And they have this sort of element
attribute sort of appearance

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.780
that you see in an XML file.

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:11.340
But what's neat about them is that you
can import them and get them out as XML.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:18.420
So one example of doing this is as config
files that you load up to make a movie,

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.750
a generically authored movie,
open to have different sorts

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.660
of appearances depending
on what XML is around.

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:28.190
You can also pass them in
now through the plug-in.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:35.700
So the embed tag in an HTML page can
have an XML list in there for a QT list.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.020
And when that movie opens,
it's going to have the QT list

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:42.200
loaded into memory and ready to be
worked on with your wired actions.

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:46.740
and then you can do server
communication with them.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:52.790
You can select any portion of the
QT list in a movie and fire it

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:56.020
off to a server somewhere and deal
with it with your CGI's on that

00:55:56.020 --> 00:56:00.290
end and do some really neat stuff,
which we're going to get

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.720
into trying to talk about.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.410
So I'm going to show some demos here.

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:06.760
I'll just show you a little schematic
of the basic layout that we'll get to.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:14.420
Basically, we'll have a single movie,
which is looking at a database on a

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:17.760
server we've got running over here.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.460
And there we'll have some Perl CGI's,
which manipulate the data

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.560
coming in from the movie.

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:32.620
We'll do things like check a
MySQL database and send back information,

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:37.780
formatted XML,
out of the database to allow the movie to

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:44.020
then do what it needs to to grab things
like other movies and graphics and all.

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.580
to do its presentation.

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.760
So let's go back to demo two here.

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:59.170
Ben's got up the XML that we see.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:07.100
[Transcript missing]

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:16.040
Using PHP, we can look at the database
that we've got here.

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.500
So, I mean, this is one of the really fun
things about this is that,

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.300
you know, I didn't know much about any of
this stuff a couple months ago,

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:25.330
but just downloaded all this open source
stuff and installed it on my OS X box and

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:28.600
messed around with it and get it working.

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:33.280
So we've got a number of
movies here that have got,

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:39.840
the database has got a movie name field,
the URL to the movie, URL to a thumbnail,

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.070
a description if we want to use that,
and a hits field that we could use

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.680
for monitoring how often people are
viewing the movies and things like that.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.880
So let's...

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:57.940
have a look at a movie which is
going to talk to that database.

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.610
So here, this movie,
that was kind of quick,

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.110
let's do it again.

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:06.040
This movie goes and hits the database.

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:11.390
On open, it sends a server query to the
database and it gets back the

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:15.390
list that you saw there as XML,
which becomes a QT list.

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:21.220
And then it does things like imports the,
a set of JPEGs and Pings and things

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.340
that I'm using as new sprite images,
which get stuck on these sprites

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.720
so we can scroll them around.

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:32.560
And we can pop open a sprite and view it
there and maybe even dump the right text

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.770
that comes out of the database as well.

00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:41.390
And we can even go ahead
and load that movie into a,

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:45.170
right into a movie track here.

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.930
or we've got some
RTSP streaming there too.

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:56.090
That same server's got the
QuickTime streaming server on it.

00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:01.140
And give you the idea of the
sort of a dynamic thing that,

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:03.680
oh, well.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:09.450
Sort of dynamic applications you can be
building once QuickTime 6 is finished.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:14.760
Something that actually you could
be doing though with QuickTime 5,

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.350
here's a project where

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:25.610
There's a movie with a bit of XML which

00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:49.500
[Transcript missing]

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:52.200
Fire up this movie.

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.160
Here it is as a skinned movie.

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:58.020
It goes and instead of
its built-in graphics,

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.110
it's loaded all of these
graphics in a sort of a,

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.610
you know, HTML web page style setup.

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:08.560
It's loaded in its external graphics and
built an interface for us which has a

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:14.110
lot of sprite images that do their thing,
including the

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:20.390
Closed Captioning by
The Closed Captioning Project

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.900
This had the same movie,
the same skin point of the movie,

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:28.500
different set of graphics.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.500
We've edited the text file.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.810
We open up the same movie,
and we've got a

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.100
completely different look.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:39.260
The skin changed,
the graphic changing in there,

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.260
the buttons are different.

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:49.290
But again, we've authored,
we've done the hard work of

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.750
authoring one interactive movie once.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:54.660
And then when we needed to change
the content it was playing,

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.100
it was all Photoshop work
and a little bit of BBEdit.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.510
There was no more of that
live stage stuff that people

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.690
sometimes get scared away by.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:11.700
[Transcript missing]

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:13.950
That's going to have to happen over here,
right?

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.690
Can we switch back to the slide machine?

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.120
And we'll look at a movie that does
a number of interesting things.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.520
Here is the website
for Commanding Heights.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.400
So here's something that's
actually shipping that somebody's

01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:32.480
really using this stuff for.

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:36.620
So this is WGBH in Boston has made
a really sophisticated website to

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:40.070
go with this program that they aired
last month called Commanding Heights.

01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:41.320
It's three two-hour episodes.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:50.330
They've put the entire six hours
online encoded at various rates,

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:54.770
and they've presented it within...

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.360
Within some interactive movies.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.050
Is somebody else using the
entire pipe at the convention?

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:16.400
[Transcript missing]

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.840
All right, here it is locally.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.500
Not all the features work locally.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.790
Whoops.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:40.690
So... the... They've got
the whole thing laid out.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.150
and Broken Down into Chapters.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.680
So there's a different episode
for each of the two-hour episodes,

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.000
and those are all divided
into these chapters.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.490
They open up in these...

01:02:56.410 --> 01:03:00.850
In these movies, which have completely
sprite-drawn backgrounds and all,

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.610
with their own interface to play,

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.900
Can we get demo two, please?

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:13.540
I was approached by a government
official who had watched the movie.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.880
Okay, so maybe I'll do a step
or two of that again.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:19.130
So we go and we launch the movie here.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:23.780
And here we have a...

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.080
A chunk of the video playing.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.640
They've got their own
controller down here.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.470
They've got features like captions,
which are being done by

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.940
QuickTime text track.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:42.110
They've got their own volume control.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.000
You'll notice that bits of information
pop up over here on this side as we go.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.620
These are links to other
sorts of information,

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:53.800
like we can open up another text window
with the entire interview with that guy.

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:59.790
If we scrub ahead a little,
we'll see that we start to get some--

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:02.560
Some interactive information here,
which would link into

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:03.460
other parts of the thing.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.910
We also noticed that this
little movie popped up.

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.910
This little window contains
a movie they call The Brain,

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.750
which has information for
navigating between the movies.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.700
Let's look at the time map.

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.240
There's another
interesting feature of it.

01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:24.040
This is a flash track we can zoom
way in on and then navigate around.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:29.270
And as we scrub the time here,
we see the dominant economic model

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.220
for the time that's being viewed.

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:35.440
So there happens to be, I realize,
a flash point here.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.100
Then we have cross links,
which are based upon

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:41.610
the information here,
which would take us into

01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:43.730
their country reports.

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.010
Here we have the time map.

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:49.800
which, um,
through the intermovie communication

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.810
going on between all of these pieces,
it will be populating, um,

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.480
with the appropriate data
for what we're looking at,

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.340
although I think this may be one of
the things that doesn't work locally.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:00.700
Yeah.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.780
All right,
so we don't get the text data that

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:03.680
we wanted that comes out of XML.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.380
They're using a lot of
QT lists in XML here as well.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:10.940
So, um, the cool thing about
that is there they are,

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:17.590
um, needing to show a lot of information,
uh, way more information than what

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:22.370
actually went into the show,
and they're able to give a whole, uh,

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.270
a whole set of different ways of
looking at the information for anybody,

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:28.500
uh, anybody's own style of consuming it.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.890
And what was nice and worked
for them is that they created

01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:37.010
this country report movie once,
essentially, and for each time,

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:42.170
or each time in the timeline,
and each country in, uh...

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.990
and Eric Schultz,
who are the founders of QuickTime,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.290
are the founders of
the QuickTime platform.

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:49.300
They are the founders of
the QuickTime platform.

01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:14.430
Eric Blazpiek, Ben Bandt-Horn,
and Eric Schultz,

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:19.300
who are the founders of QuickTime.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:38.100
Eric Blazpiek, Ben Bandt-Horn,
and Eric Schultz,

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:38.100
who are the founders of QuickTime.

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:41.720
It appears that we're
getting towards the end,

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.200
but we do have some
ambitious stuff ahead of us,

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.240
so let's do a quick
overview of what we've done,

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:49.430
and then we'll try and build
something that we hope will work well.

01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:52.330
So, in conclusion, only QuickTime.

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:56.120
supports all of these tons of
media types we're talking about.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.390
A lot of things that we have
within QuickTime and a lot of

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.820
things that are just played by
taking these other formats in.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.450
And only QuickTime can combine them in
this elegant fashion and make it easy

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:13.210
for them to interact with one another
and communicate with the outside world

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:14.700
through server communication and things.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:20.030
Only in QuickTime can you deliver content
like that that's going to look the

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:27.070
same no matter which QuickTime playing
platform you deliver it on.

01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:34.140
So to get into our closing demo,
we'll want to switch Demo 2 to

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.830
the screen on my left and Demo
1 to the screen on my right.

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:54.130
Okay, so we've seen most of the major
forms of QuickTime in this session,

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:55.800
or interactive forms of
QuickTime in this session.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.470
Let's have a look at some of these.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:05.480
We've modified a couple of these movies
a little bit so that when we say...

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.940
We'll open up the sprite fish over here.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:15.960
This guy's swimming around.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.740
Now, the modified version of this movie
from what you saw before has got

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:24.350
a little bit of a script in it
which populates the database.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.890
Whoops.

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:32.260
and has put itself in with a link
to where it is and a thumbnail

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.870
for it and what its text might be.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.960
And it'll sit there playing.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.760
And then maybe we'll
open up the linear fish,

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.260
which should also go into the database.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:09:06.300
[Transcript missing]

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.940
Some actual content that's skinned.

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:12.600
That little guy follows us around.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:23.090
All right, now I'm going to, over here,
I'm going to...

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:28.040
Go somewhere else,
say... Did you change that or not?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:34.220
Oops.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:41.240
So, um, I've got a movie here
which I can open up,

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.300
which will look at the database
and populate itself with the

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:46.360
movies that we've got open.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.750
So there's the linear
fish and the sprite fish.

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:51.420
Well, okay, so we're being ambitious.

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:52.940
Something's not happening
with the Axlefish.

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:57.650
As I feed them, we'll notice that it's
feeding the fishes on screen.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.340
Charlie Tuna went to try to
get his food when I fed him,

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.150
but it didn't work.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.060
This is happening,
although I'm opening it on one machine,

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.020
it's going out to the
server and then coming back.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.860
If anyone's out there with AirPort,
we've got AirPort going on in here.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:19.500
You'll notice there's a
session 603 AirPort network.

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:25.080
And if you do that, the password is WWDC.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:31.980
Go to the URL here,
which is 10.0.1.4 slash index1html,

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.600
and you can open that movie.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.980
And there should be QuickTime 6
and 5 versions in there.

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:40.700
So if anybody's installed Jaguar,
they'll get that by using a ref movie.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.460
It doesn't matter which.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.170
You don't need to pick anything.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.140
You'll just get the right one.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.790
There's the Flash movie.

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:53.690
Now, one thing we haven't done
here is the live stuff.

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:56.680
So let's try and make it even more
complicated and get that involved.

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:58.240
So I'm going to need a little help,
though.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.530
Can I volunteer out of the audience?

01:10:59.530 --> 01:11:02.710
Are you over here, sir?

01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:04.980
No, not you.

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:16.100
What's your name?

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.100
My name's Peter.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.100
And are you new to Mac?

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.200
You know, I used to use it a lot,
but the last couple years,

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.100
that whole flying dock, genie thing,
it was kind of intimidating,

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:26.100
so I'm a little out of date.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.100
So what platform do you work on most?

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.080
XP something.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.100
Yeah, right.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:33.060
Have you done anything
with QuickTime before?

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.060
Yeah, yeah, I have some experience.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.070
Actually,
it came pre-installed on my BIOS,

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.090
so yeah,
I've got some experience with it.

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.040
All right, great.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:43.380
Well, I'm going to give you a
PowerBook and a Broadcaster here,

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.100
and we'll see how it goes.

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:57.160
and a camera and a fireware cable
and knock yourself out for me.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:57.800
I've got a lot of hands there.

01:11:57.810 --> 01:11:58.020
Thanks.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:17.700
We can... Has anybody managed to
get the fish feeding movie up?

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.670
Cool.

01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:19.340
So we got that going.

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.700
Let's see what the
database is looking like.

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:28.120
Sure enough, there's a few of the movies.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.710
And goodness,
we've had a lot of hits happening there.

01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:41.440
So that fish is just
going to keep feeding,

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.020
isn't it?

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:47.430
Now don't feed the flash fish too much.

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:49.340
It'll die.

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.980
It's serious.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.800
That's a wise thing to do.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.630
How's that going?

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.440
Uh-oh.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:08.420
Did I tell you?

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.250
Did you click broadcast?

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.260
Should I hit broadcast?

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:23.260
. Acts are hard to use, man.

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:32.670
. So let's revive him.

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.590
Okay, there we go.

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:42.050
So now you're probably going to
want something to point that at,

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.180
right?

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.310
How about this?

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:56.110
Now I think we've got another
movie to open up for that.

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:56.520
Do we?

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.110
It's over here.

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:57.560
Sure.

01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:06.560
There we go.

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:09.130
Oh wait, we need a way to feed him.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.840
So let's grab some food.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:23.720
We've got some electrodes
attached to the server here.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.870
Could you get a little closer
maybe and roll up your sleeves?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.300
[Transcript missing]

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:58.190
Now, if you close the movie
head here and reopen it,

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.180
it ought to...

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.750
Yeah, it's got the live fish
one in there as well.

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:09.490
So I don't know if anybody wants to
try to get Peter to feed the fish,

01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:10.890
but...

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:12.620
I guess someone is.

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.870
Well,
that pretty much concludes our demo.

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:21.720
Thank you very much.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.800
Thank you, Peter.
