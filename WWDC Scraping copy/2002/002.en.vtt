00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.060
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Manager of

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.760
Software Evangelism,
Tim Holmes.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.570
Hi.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.840
Welcome.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.290
I hope it's been a good
show for you so far.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.090
So you've gone over the
design concepts for UE,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.420
and those are broad and those are
important and they're critical for

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.700
your understanding of how to make
an application on the Macintosh.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.090
This session is going to
be about adopting Aqua,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.000
and that's implementing those
design concepts through the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.810
tools and controls we give you.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.930
This is really critical stuff.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.380
This is stuff that if you're
not on our platform today and

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.870
are moving to our platform,
you really need to understand

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.290
to have a successful product.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.280
To have a real sellable product.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.570
And it's also critical for our platform
because one of the key advantages of the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.800
Macintosh is the consistency of controls,
consistency of usage,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.350
and being able to understand
where you are and what you need

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.400
to do to get something done no
matter what application you're in.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.540
So I'd like to introduce John Geleynsse.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.400
John Geleynsse is our user
experience evangelist.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.390
Someone who's familiar to you all,
I think, probably.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.400
And if he's not,
you should get to know him.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.310
You should give him a call.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.250
Come on up, John.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.920
He does quite a few reviews
of people's products,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.800
and if he hasn't reviewed yours yet,
you should get in touch with him.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.800
you get in touch with him.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.080
So thank you, Tim.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.960
Have a good session.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.840
Okay, well, there I am.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.050
That's the nickname people have started
to give me in the developer community.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.690
Alright, I want to talk in this session,
carry on from session one,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.840
and I want to talk now about how do you
take those principles and adopt them

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.740
specific to your application on Mac OS X.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.860
And we're going to get really practical,
and basically we're going to come

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.770
around to discovering what it takes
to create a really great citizen

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.140
application in the environment of Aqua.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.220
And to do that, I want to first define
the term citizenship,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.480
help you understand what
I mean by that term,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.980
because I'm going to use it over
and over through this session.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.450
Then I want to look at what the
benefits are to you as you bring your

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.410
product to Mac OS X and you do some of
the things that we talk about today.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.300
Then we'll look at some of the
detailed steps that you need

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.740
to take as you adopt Aqua.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.110
And finally,
I want to finish with some testimonials

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.930
from some of your peers who have made
the choice to adopt Aqua completely.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.060
And they'll talk about that
whole process and talk about

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.770
the benefits that they've seen,
etc.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.090
And so it's really not only just
Apple talking about the benefits here,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.980
but it's your peers who have gone
through the process of adopting Aqua.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.150
And they've gone through the very
same experiences that you're going

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.290
through right now as you bring
your product to the platform.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.240
So first of all,
this is the world in which

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.500
your application lives.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.460
This is the Aqua desktop.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.460
It has very unique characteristics,
right?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.210
It's got shadowing and transparency.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.860
It uses anti-aliased text.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.810
It has quality icons, etc.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.500
Very, very distinct attributes.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.000
This is the world in which your
application is going to live.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.320
And if your application doesn't
feel like it belongs here,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.580
your users are going to notice and
it's going to affect you in many,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.450
many ways.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.000
As I said,
I want to talk about the definition

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.360
of citizenship first of all.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.180
And when I use this term,
I use it loosely in terms of the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.240
real definition of citizenship,
obviously.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.800
But I think it's one of the best terms to
use to help you understand what it means

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.030
to belong in this world of Mac OS X.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.740
So to start,
I want to talk about the first sentence,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.160
focusing on the first sentence,
and specifically focusing on the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.530
fact that a citizen actually has
benefits for being a citizen of

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.500
the land in which they're part of,
or the nation in which they're part of.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.280
In this case, it's your software that's
within the nation of Mac OS X or

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.400
in the world of Mac OS X.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.710
So what are the benefits that you
realize by creating a really great,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.530
compelling product on Mac OS X,
and a product that implements

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.490
the principles we talked
about in session one?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.160
Well, Stan went over some of these,
so I'm not going to go into great detail.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.460
But fundamentally,
the benefits boil down to two.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.710
And the two are, make more money and have
a competitive advantage.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.960
If you're reducing your
tech support costs,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.780
you're simplifying your documentation,
your product is highly usable,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.960
and your customers are tremendously
satisfied with it because they're

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.250
achieving what they set out to achieve,
and your product is actually

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.240
solving the problem it's supposed
to solve in a very focused,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.300
simple way,
the outcome is going to be upgrades,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.370
more customers, satisfied customers,
all of that turns into money

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.920
and a competitive advantage.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.530
All things being equal,
if your product does the same

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.350
thing a competitor's does,
but yet you knock it out of the park

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.090
from a user experience point of view,
you're the winner.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.950
So there are benefits
to being a good citizen,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.830
but there are also responsibilities,
clearly, right?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.420
We need to be law-abiding citizens,
which we all probably are, hopefully.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.390
And your application needs
to be a law-abiding citizen,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.170
so to speak.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.680
So let's talk through some
of these responsibilities.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.530
There are three areas of
responsibility that your

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.650
application has on the platform.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.530
And essentially,
they boil down to the basics,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.110
which we'll talk about.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.050
They boil down to behaviors,
implementing the behaviors that are

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.760
unique to the world of Mac OS X.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.460
And the appearance of Mac OS X.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.760
Does your application follow that
appearance and adhere to that appearance?

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.180
So what are the basics?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.030
By the basics I mean,
and these are basics that aren't

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.380
even specific to Aqua so much as
they are specific to the Macintosh.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.620
What does it take to make a, you know,
what are the characteristics

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.180
of a Macintosh application?

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.460
And believe it or not,
there are violations of these

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.780
and we'll have a lot of fun
looking at some of them.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.490
So I want to start with one of
the most basic characteristics

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.620
of a Mac application.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.840
And that is that the
application has menus,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.350
right?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.190
And that the menus are
structured in the proper format.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.440
And the menu layout for Mac OS X is such
that if we're starting on the very left,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.860
we have the Apple menu,
which is system global.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.240
It's for commands that
relate to the system.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.150
It is, it enables the user to do
stuff to the system regardless

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.880
of what context they're in,
regardless of what

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.720
application they're running.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.040
They can sleep the system or do whatever,
you know, go to system preferences.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.750
And the Apple menu is really
not for application developers.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.330
Moving right,
we have the application menu.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.100
This is where you start
to get interested,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.210
because the application menu deals
with the commands that are specific

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.840
to your application as a whole,
as a whole entity.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.160
This is where you put things like quit,
because we quit applications now.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.650
We don't quit files
like we did in the past.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.560
This is where you put
your app preferences,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.080
because preferences apply
to the whole application.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.010
And this is where you put anything that
relates to your application as a whole.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.260
Moving right from that,
we have the file menu,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.330
document specific commands.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.730
This is where you put any command
that relates to your documents,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.750
the documents that your
application manages.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.850
So we open documents, we print them,
we save them, etc.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.530
That's where they all go,
those types of commands

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.760
go in the file menu.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.670
Moving right from that,
remember there's this hierarchy, right?

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.740
We've got system, global,
the whole system.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.090
Then we've got the application
that runs on the system,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.650
commands.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.620
Then we've got the commands
that relate to the documents

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.860
that application manages.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.100
And then to the right of that,
we've got edit menu,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.920
the edit menu which affects
the content of your documents.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.790
And then to the right of that,
you might have some other specific

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.320
menus for your application.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.320
But remember,
those menus should contain commands that

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.520
affect the content of your documents.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.860
So that there's this inherent hierarchy
that users begin to understand as

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.150
they move through the application.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.840
And following the
application-specific menus,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.240
we've got the window
menu and the help menu.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.750
The window menu in Jaguar, in fact,
contains some new functionality,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.000
which is the ability to cycle
through your active document windows

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.260
using command-tilde on the keyboard.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.370
And the help menu is where you
would put your access to your help

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.240
book and your user assistance,
your online help.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.000
As we're talking about menus,
I want to talk about another fundamental

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.020
basic for a Macintosh application.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.900
And that is respecting or
adhering to the reserved keyboard

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.480
equivalents that we've set out in
the Aqua human interface guidelines.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.660
We all use the Mac.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.700
We're all used to, without even thinking,
doing command-s to save, you know,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.800
printing, cut, copy, paste, undo,
all of these things.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.630
We don't even think about it.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.320
Our hands just go down to
the keyboard and we do the

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.040
appropriate keyboard equivalent,
right?

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.100
Here we've got an example of a
shipping application on 10 that has

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.580
completely ignored these guidelines.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.770
And the effect is... that if I start
to use this application as a user,

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.860
I start to use those familiar
keyboard equivalents,

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.340
right?

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.770
And I'm going to be stymied
because it's going to do things

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.180
that are completely beyond what
I would have expected it to do.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.240
And in session one we
talked about expectations.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.340
And suddenly I'm going to use
this product and now it behaves

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.780
in a way that's very different
than what I expected it to do.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.200
We've got command P for preview, A,
which should be select all,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.450
does something else, S,
does scan instead of save, etc.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.640
So as you bring your
application to Mac OS X,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.960
if you're coming from Windows or Java,
there are many of you

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.840
that are doing that.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.460
Even if you're writing
custom in-house applications,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.340
it's important to use the reserved
command keys in the appropriate manner.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.200
Because it means that as users
move from your application to

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.450
another or from another to yours,
some of these basic behaviors

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.560
are going to be there.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.370
And they're going to have this
level of consistency between

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.030
the usage of the applications.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.750
And it'll mean that
they're very comfortable.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:17.160
Another basic thing that your application
should do is have your windows appear

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.260
and operate the way other windows
appear and operate in the system.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.780
Mac OS X introduces this
layering model of interleaved

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.550
windows between applications,
and windows have a unique appearance,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.070
they minimize to the dock, etc.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.270
Your windows should behave the same way.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:43.210
The only constraint in the world
of Mac OS X is the desktop.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.250
The Mac OS X desktop might
span multiple monitors,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.240
but they are constrained in that area.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.150
However, there are applications that
are being brought to Mac OS X

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.270
very different behavior and suddenly the
user is faced with a situation that's,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.960
you know, very foreign to them in terms
of how the overall system works.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.600
So the right way for this to be
done on Mac OS X would be to drop

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.350
the MDI interface and basically put
those document windows on the overall

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.380
desktop and let them behave like
any other standard document window.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.460
And if you're a Java developer
and this is an issue for you,

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.780
there's documentation on
our developer website,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.620
I believe,
certainly contact developer technical

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.020
support to get assistance with that.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.360
Contact me, we'll give you the assistance
you need to solve this problem

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.380
because it is solvable.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.770
And I don't mean to say
that Java developers are

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.540
the only ones doing this.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.530
There are other people who are
doing this occasionally as well.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.370
Another basic,
basic thing that you need to

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.710
do bringing your application to
Mac OS X is build upon system controls.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.530
We are doing our best to
extend the control set that

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.570
we have available to you.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.010
And so in most cases,
there's really no need to

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.350
customize the behavior of controls
or create your own controls.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.360
There are instances
where that is necessary,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.720
and so I would encourage you to
work with me to get an understanding

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.200
of that so that I can champion
that for you within engineering.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.860
But building upon the standard system
controls means you're going to get

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.000
the right appearance for one thing.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.530
But secondly,
you're going to inherit for free much

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.200
of the behavior that we're talking
about in terms of universal access.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.670
So the keyboard navigation
will come for free.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.190
Speaking back of the items below
the mouse will come for free.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.520
You know, focus rings,
all that will come for free provided

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.440
you use the standard system controls.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.170
If you don't use the system
controls but draw controls

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.320
yourself using Appearance Manager,
for example, in Carbon,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.760
it means you're going to have
a little... not only a little,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.290
but in some cases,
you're going to have a lot more

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.110
work to do to implement the same
behaviors that you could get for free.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.050
So I encourage you to use standard
system controls wherever possible.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.860
And on that topic, I want to just, it's,
you know, it's my honor to announce the

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.200
fact that the combo box control,
which has always been

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.360
available to Cocoa to date,
is now available for Carbon.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.810
And we'll look at a couple examples
later on of where that's being used

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.920
to greatly simplify some dialogues.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.400
And there are the APIs for you.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:13:36.200
[Transcript missing]

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.690
All right, honoring default folders.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.700
Another real basic for an
application coming to Mac OS X.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.900
Every logged in user on
Mac OS X has their home directory.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:49.190
That home directory contains default
locations for storing music and pictures,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.450
you know, everything that's listed there,
movies, et cetera.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.200
If your application is a
content creating application,

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.460
you should default to the
appropriate location for saving

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.190
documents from within your product.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.100
And while we're on this topic,
let's talk about the documents folder,

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.900
which is part of every logged
in user's home directory.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.480
The documents folder is another
area where we're seeing some

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.390
difficulty with applications.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:18.390
It is reserved exclusively for
documents that users create.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.590
So where a user is inside of a document
in your application and says save

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.240
and puts it in the documents folder,
that's the document that

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.690
they explicitly created.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.300
Everything else that's
related to your application,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.180
that's sort of vaguely user created
in the sense that it might be a mail

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.500
database or it's a contacts database or
it's some other thing that you really--

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.000
is necessary for application support
does not belong in the documents folder.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.800
It should be put in
the library directory,

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.400
library folder.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:50.750
So--and the side--sort of side issue on
that is training your users through your

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.840
documentation or through tech support,
et cetera, that if they back up

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.540
their world on Mac OS X,
they need to back up more than

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.690
just their documents folder.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.910
They need to back up their
whole home directory because

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.630
it contains preferences,
it contains application support

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.380
files that are important,
important, and it also as well

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.430
contains their documents.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.960
So those are the basics,
and I don't mean to imply

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.700
that those are the basics.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.500
I mean, they're the basics I'm
talking about today,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.750
but there's a whole pile of other
stuff I could have talked about,

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.120
but in the interest of time,
those are the ones I wanted to

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.610
touch on specifically because
those are the ones that I see the

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:26.980
most difficulty with developers
implementing those on Mac OS X.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.880
Let's talk about behaviors.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.120
You have responsibilities as a
citizen on Mac OS X to implement

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.420
some of the behaviors that are
available to you on Mac OS X.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.060
First of all, one of the unique behaviors
of Mac OS X is the dock.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.580
The dock is there at the bottom of the
screen or on the left or the right.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.480
And it has, as a developer,
you have some responsibilities

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.870
around working with the dock.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.320
There are three things that
you can do with the dock.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.710
Two that you should do,
and one that some applications might do.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.760
First of all,
every application on the platform--

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.240
and this is almost a basic,
but I didn't put it in that section--

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.500
every application on the platform should
respond to doc clicks appropriately.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.400
If your application icon
is clicked in the doc,

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.520
you should always produce a window.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.780
If you're a document-based application,
bring forward a new untitled

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.020
document if there are no documents
currently open in your application.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.270
If you're a document-based application,
but all of your document windows

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.060
are currently minimized to the doc,
then you should bring up the

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.120
last minimized document window,
because that's likely the one

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.540
the user was-- that's the one
they were last working in.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.680
That's likely the one they
probably want to work in now.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.570
And if you're a
non-document-based application,

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.360
say you're in iTunes or a system
prefs or something like that

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.050
where you have a main window,
then if that window is currently

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.990
closed but your app is running,
you should bring that

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.870
window up and activate it.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.690
Respecting the doc's location.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.500
As I said before,
the doc can be at the bottom of the

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.750
screen or on the left or the right.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.000
Who knows where it'll be in the future?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.540
I don't know.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.300
I'm not on the design team,
but who knows?

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.720
At the moment, it's in these locations.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.200
And as your application windows,
as you open new untitled document windows

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.610
or as the user resizes document windows,
you should always honor the doc's

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.530
position and never allow the user
to resize their window behind the

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:12.010
doc or never automatically resize a
new untitled window behind the doc.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.480
And so in this particular example,
you'll see here's a document window from

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.750
IE that your window should open flush
to the menu bar at the top and flush

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:26.220
to the doc if it's on the bottom or
flush to the bottom of the screen if the

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.810
doc isn't on the bottom of the screen.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.760
The APIs for that are
pretty straightforward.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.040
But remember,
the users can change the dock's location.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.300
They can also change the dock's size.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.020
So if they've sized their window
and you've honored the dock,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.000
and afterwards they resize the dock
to cover the grow box from the window,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.880
let them do that.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.530
Don't resize your windows
and move windows around based

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.900
on the movement of the dock.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.190
Once the users set the window size there,
and if they change the dock,

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.990
that's their choice.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.820
Let them change their environment
without adapting to it.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.060
Something some applications
should do is provide meaningful

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.870
status information via the doc.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.620
We talked about this a
little bit in session one.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.180
I'm going to talk briefly about it here.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.660
But the idea is,
if there's meaningful information

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.980
you can provide to your users about
the progress of your application,

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.230
doing something it's doing,
or if you're a fax application

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.890
and you're sending a fax in the
background or receiving a fax,

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.700
providing that kind of status information
or progress information through your

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.710
doc icon is really meaningful and
very subtle and yet very effective

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.360
at communicating what's going on.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.900
So for example,
with the mail icon in Mac OS X,

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.250
we badge it with a starburst that says,
"Hey,

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.640
there's new mail." And if it's sitting
down in the doc and your doc is visible,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.800
you see that and it's a really cool cue,
very soft cue, saying,

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.780
"There's new mail." And so you
don't have to switch the app to

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.660
look whether there's new mail.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.690
So that's an example of what
we're talking about here.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.880
Providing meaningful status
information through your doc icon.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.780
And again, I would say,
think very carefully

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.800
about when you do this.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.410
The last thing you want
to have is the doc,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.210
you know,
animating or having all kinds of

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.920
status stuff occurring constantly.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.910
But where appropriate, it's very,
very valuable.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.550
And to do this through Carbon,
it's just look for the APIs with

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.700
"doctile," the terms "doctile" in them,
in those header files.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.190
In Cocoa, it's "nsApplication,"
"setApplicationIcon."

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.020
Okay,
another behavior that's very specific

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.930
to Mac OS X that's very cool and
very visible to product reviewers

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.300
and to customers alike is Sheets.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.090
Sheets are document
modal specific dialogues.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.240
Use them wherever you have a
dialogue box whose contents affect

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.020
the currently active document.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.060
So think about your product for a minute.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.360
Do you have active documents?

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.400
Do you have document windows?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:39.760
Yes.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.080
Do you have modal dialogues
that currently open up to affect

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.220
the contents of that document?

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.860
If the answer is yes,
those are candidates for Sheets.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.020
And the cool thing about Sheets is
they really implement the principle

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.470
of modelessness well because
they attach themselves to the

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.920
document title bar of that window.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.430
They move with that document around,
so they're clearly associated

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.850
with the content that they affect.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.740
And yet,
they allow you to continue working in

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.390
that application on other documents.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.780
So they're only modal
to that application.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.710
Not modal to the whole application.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.220
To that document, rather.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.700
Not modal to the whole application.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.640
Another way that we've implemented
motorlessness in Mac OS X is drawers.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.290
Again, we touched on some of this
content in session one,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.230
but drawers are great for providing
often used controls that don't

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.850
need to be visible all the time.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.890
They're also great for enabling you
to provide additional functionality

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.640
closely related to the parent window.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.060
So it's really not a sheet because it's
not a case where you go and you do it

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.550
all the time and then you dismiss it.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.540
But drawers are there for stuff that
just sort of hangs around that's

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.390
sometimes meaningful to be there,
but sometimes it's not meaningful or not,

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.420
you know,
effective to be there necessarily.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.240
But it's great to have it there
because you can pull it out,

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.580
do something you need to do,
and push it back.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.650
So think about where you do that
kind of stuff and where this could

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.480
be useful and implement drawers.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.530
I have the pleasure of announcing
that Carbon drawers are now available,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.720
effective in Jaguar.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:02.320
And in the headers, macwindows.h,
just look for APIs that have

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.730
the word drawers in them.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.740
And this is a big deal for
Carbon developers who have been

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.660
waiting a long time for this.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.840
So there's no excuse to not implement it.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.780
into the drawers now.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.530
Another behavior of
Mac OS X is Apple Help.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.680
Apple Help is this really effective
way of delivering help content to

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.390
your users in a very rich manner.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.400
QuickTime is integrated,
AppleScript is integrated,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.500
so your users can read
through your help and say,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.420
"Well, okay,
show me," and you can control your

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.400
application through an AppleScript.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.520
It's a really great way to
deliver rich help content.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.440
And we've actually extended
Apple Help in Jaguar to build on its

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.380
ability to deal with remote content.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.770
So where we are currently with
Mac OS X One is that Apple Help can

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.310
support remote content.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.390
So you know how you're developing
your product and you run out of,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.440
basically the development team
is still working on some stuff,

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.400
but you've got to
freeze the help content.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.400
And yet you want to document the stuff,
but it's still changing.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.400
And so anyway,
we all understand that situation.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.930
Apple Help lets you put some
of this help content out on one

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.250
of your servers and go get it.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.720
The beautiful thing about Apple Help in
Jaguar is that now you don't need

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.000
to know what the structure of
that help content is necessarily,

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.890
because we retrieve the
remote index as well.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.510
So now you can add and remove help
pages on the fly as you change

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:22.000
your system or as you understand
or realize that your help content

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
could be restructured or something.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.000
So really great feature in
Apple Help now in Jaguar.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.910
Second thing is that Apple Help in
Jaguar is internet primary.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.470
In other words,
it's going to look to the internet for

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.520
remote content under the assumption
that the remote content is more up

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.000
to date than the current local files
that you installed with your product.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.600
So leveraging both of these means
that you can do a lot of things.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.060
So leveraging both of these means
you can really deliver great,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.160
really flexible help.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.390
As well in Jaguar,
the Help Viewer has been

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.270
enhanced significantly in
terms of its user experience.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.840
You can now,
with the Help Viewer in Jaguar,

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.540
look at multiple help
books at the same time.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.410
So you can have multiple
windows looking at help.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.280
You can copy text from the Help Viewer.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.790
Lots of people are asking for that.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.880
You can enlarge the font
display in the Help Viewer.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.090
It's got a customizable toolbar,
just like the Finder in Mail.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.490
So significant enhancements
to the usability of the

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.950
Help Viewer in Apple Help.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:17.300
Choosing colors is always a complicated
process just by its very nature.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:21.150
And we've provided the system colors
window in Mac OS X that up until this

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.920
point has only been available to Carbon.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.020
It's a Cocoa, sorry.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.300
It's now available to Carbon in Jaguar.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.950
And the beauty of it is that it
provides a consistent user experience

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.290
across frameworks for picking colors.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.320
If your application allows users
to choose colors in any way,

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.970
whether it's for, you know,
coloring text or some

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.220
background or whatever it does,
don't do your own color picker.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.100
The difficulty with doing
your own color picker is,

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.550
means that it behaves differently.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.680
The user comes to it with an expectation
about how it's going to behave because

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.780
you might have used the standard,
you know, control to get there.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.940
And suddenly what's revealed
is something very different.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.460
It behaves different than
what they're used to.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:02.900
And the system colors window is the way
to provide for color picking on Mac OS X.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.680
File name extensions are on Mac OS X.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.120
They're a way of enhancing
the file name to improve

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.760
interoperability with other platforms.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.440
We have specific goals around
providing file name extensions.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.760
The thing I want to talk about is
that our goal with this is to maintain

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.890
the usability of the Macintosh,
or that the Macintosh is always known.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.540
And so when file name extensions
are entered by the user,

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.260
it's basically a what you see is
what you get kind of behavior.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.400
So if the user types an
extension on the file,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.630
a file name extension,
that file shows up with

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.770
a file name extension.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.490
If they don't type the
file name extension,

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:35.880
it doesn't have a file name extension.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.040
It's appended by the application.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.230
Specifically as it relates
to user experience,

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.320
I want to talk about

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.020
The fact that there are display names.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.340
File names aren't only what the file
system tells you they are anymore.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.840
So historically you could
say to the file system,

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.230
what's the file name,
or what did the user choose,

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.230
and you'd get a name back.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:02.470
Now, pay attention to Nav Services,
what it tells you in terms of the

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.820
file extension being hidden or not.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.930
It's going to give you that bit.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.450
It's also going to give
you the full file name.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.050
And so if it's hidden,
show just the main file name.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.830
The save panels will
do that appropriately.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.330
But wherever you display a
file name in your application,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.930
say you've got a list of files,
or you're providing detailed

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.970
status information about a file,
make sure that you display the users,

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.210
the display name for that file.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.590
The user is explicitly chosen to either
hide or show the file name extension.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.330
Your application should honor that.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.170
So if I have a document
called lettertomom.txt,

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.940
but I've hidden the extension,
and as far as I'm concerned

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.730
it's just called lettertomom,
when I double click that document

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.580
and it opens up in the application,
the document title bar

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:48.140
should say lettertomom,
not lettertomom.txt.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.410
So the APIs to use are
in Launch Services,

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:55.240
lscopyDisplayNameForRef,
lscopyDisplayNameForURL.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.480
These are the APIs you should be using
to get the display name for a file.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.900
Speech.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.210
You saw this stuff demoed
earlier on in session one.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:11.340
Speech is a big part of our
universal access story in Jaguar.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:16.340
And so building on system controls
and doing things like that are going

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.900
to enable you to leverage speech.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.900
And you get a lot of stuff for
free with speech in Jaguar.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.320
And I would encourage you to attend
the speech session on Friday where

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.920
we're going to talk about how our
speech synthesizer can be improved

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.630
and made to sound really great.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.590
And our recognition is really strong.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.900
Managing Contacts.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.170
Today, we all run multiple applications,
we all run multiple tools,

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.070
and the reality is that if those
applications require a phone number

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.600
or an email address or whatever,
we rely on that application

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.750
to manage those contacts.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.350
I'm sure all of you have experienced
the case where you're using an email

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.860
program and you've got all of your
contacts in there for their emails,

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.430
but then you've got another personal
information management tool,

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.940
or you've got some other thing where
you're doing mail merge or whatever,

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.850
and all three of those products
or more are pulling from

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.080
different databases for contacts.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.310
Wouldn't it be great if all
of those applications used the

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.170
same source of information?

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.320
So regardless of whether I was
sending an email or sending a fax

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.260
or doing some other operation on
my machine with some other product,

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.380
that all of the context would
come from the same place.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.430
It's possible with Jaguar.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.500
Because with Jaguar,
we're introducing something

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.060
called Address Book Framework.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.740
It's a very simple framework
available to Carbon and Cocoa that

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.200
enables you to build on a standard,
single, centralized database in the

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.600
system to manage people,
the contacts around,

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.200
and the information around people.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.740
So in terms of delivering a great
user experience with your product,

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.210
and in terms of being a
great citizen on Mac OS X,

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.740
this is one of the things that you should
consider building into your application.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.040
Not only does it deliver
a great user experience,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.240
but it means that you can focus on the
value add that your product provides,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.240
which is the unique
capabilities that it has,

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.740
versus, "Oh, yeah,
we've got to write this context thing

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.520
and deal with all the UI around that
and all the database management," right?

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.840
Take your development cycles
and put them on the things that

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.440
are unique to your company,
the value add you bring,

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.110
rather than trying to write a lot
of stuff that everybody else is

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.850
trying to write and ultimately
confusing and diluting the

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.190
user experience for that stuff.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.600
We talked about three
areas of responsibility.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.000
We've talked about the basics
that you need to do for

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.190
delivering a product on Macintosh.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.200
We've talked about the
behaviors of Mac OS X.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.340
Now I want to talk about the
responsibilities you have in terms

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:39.700
of being a good citizen around
the appearance for Mac OS X.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.680
First of all,
it's clear that Mac OS X delivers

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.140
icons in a way that the
Macintosh has never done before.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.570
Icons are rendered in
a high quality manner.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:55.240
They communicate a lot about
what the application does.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.400
Your application icon should be the same.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.530
Last year we talked about
this idea of a tool and media.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.640
There's this tool like a pen and
the media being a piece of paper.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.040
And those two ideas in your
icon can communicate a lot about

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.700
what your application does.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:13.100
Not only should your icons be quality,
but the overall graphics of your

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.940
application should be quality.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.160
Think about taking the existing
graphics from your Mac OS 9 product,

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.880
or from your Windows product,
or from your Java product,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.940
taking those graphics and redoing
them to feel more like they

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.470
belong in the world of Mac OS X.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.230
Anti-alias text, soft edges,
removable black lines,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.470
these kinds of things that
you'll see throughout the system.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.570
Speaking of anti-aliasing,
I want to talk about anti-aliased text.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.870
The appearance for Mac OS X is such that
the text everywhere is anti-aliased.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.930
If your product is running on Mac OS X,
all of your text should

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.000
be anti-aliased as well.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.220
If it isn't, your application stands
out and feels incomplete.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.460
We'll look at some examples.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.820
The right way to draw text,
it depends on which

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.640
framework you're using.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.460
There are ways to do it
properly in Power Plant.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.830
There are ways, certainly Carbon has
multiple ways of doing it,

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.250
but if you're writing
directly to the toolbox,

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.070
using the Appearance Manager APIs,
like Draw Theme Text,

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.680
etc., are going to mean that your labels,
etc., are appearing properly.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.680
Using standard system controls are
going to mean that your controls,

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.020
the labels are drawn by the system,
so they're automatically going to appear

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.950
in the appropriate font face and size.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.120
So anti-aliased text really matters.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.200
And if you have content text
views within your documents,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.830
consider using MLTE views
or the ATSUI engine,

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:32.230
which there are sessions
about here at WWC.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.230
So what I'm talking about in
terms of antialiased text is

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.780
to not do something like this.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.840
Here we've got a window
from an application.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.920
For one thing,
it's got a scrolling area of text

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.020
that has a striped background,
which is not the appearance for Mac OS X.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:49.620
Lists and scrolling areas of text
in Mac OS X have a white background.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.280
So that's one difficulty
this developer had.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.150
The second is all of the text
is not antialiased and it's

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.100
so small it's hardly readable.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.210
So everywhere we deliver
text in your application,

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.940
it should be antialiased.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.230
Thank you.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.690
Steve introduced this
idea of the metal window,

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.480
metal for the rest of us.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.010
As all of you know,
Mac OS X delivers several

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.090
of our applications,
or Apple delivers several

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.300
of our applications with
a metal window appearance.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:22.630
We have iTunes, we've got DVD player,
QuickTime player, etc.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.570
And this metal window
is now available to you,

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.620
the developer community, to use.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.100
I'll talk about the APIs in a second,
but before I get there,

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.160
I want to give you some guidance around
the usage of this type of window.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:40.920
Where Apple uses it is in the cases where
we have a single window application.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.700
Think iTunes.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.250
There's a central window.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.410
That's where you focus all of your time.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.220
That's where we chose
to use a metal window.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.210
Also, because it kind of reflects
a real world device in a way.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.860
It's kind of like a player of music.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.670
Think about the QuickTime player.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.790
It's kind of like a little TV in a sense,
but it's not.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.680
But it kind of mimics
a real world device.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.920
Those are examples of where
you would use a metal window.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.060
The other guidance I would
give around that is that it's,

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.050
it's, use it only,
use the metal appearance

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.000
only for your main window.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.750
So if you think about iTunes again,
or if you're,

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.760
if you've got a PowerBook sitting
in front of you right now,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.340
fire up iTunes, take a look at iTunes.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.490
It opens, there are other dialogues
in iTunes for preferences,

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.880
etc., but those dialogues are fully Aqua.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.000
They're not metal.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.500
So if you're going to use
the metal window appearance,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.020
use it for the main window only.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.840
And all of your other dialogues,
supporting dialogues within

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.720
your application should be Aqua.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.240
So the way to do this in Carbon,
actually you can't do it in Carbon with

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.820
the build we gave you yesterday,
but you'll be able to do it real soon,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.000
because we're still some
stuff being defined,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.080
but it's a new window class
and we'll give you the

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.330
details later in the headers.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.400
And in Cocoa it's just a constant.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.920
Palette, layout, and appearance.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.090
There are tons of applications today that
ship on the Macintosh that have palettes.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:02.000
And there are lots of high-end
illustration tools and web

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:06.180
design tools and lots of
applications that use palettes.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:09.180
Because the cool thing about palettes
is they remain on screen all the time.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.160
They're easily accessible to the user,
therefore.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.840
They don't take up much real estate.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.410
And so your application,
if you deliver palettes

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.000
within your application,
should adhere to these

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.740
kinds of guidelines as well.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.780
Make judicious use of real estate.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.360
You don't want to take up lots of room.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.820
You want to use smaller
spacings and tighten things up.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.150
But at the same time,
you don't want to do something like this,

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:32.150
which is--

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.320
They've used standard controls.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.640
Everything is truly Aqua.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.330
The difficulty here is things are kind of
compressed and it seems somewhat messy.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:44.020
So remember,
if you're bringing things down in size,

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.800
to continue using the small
version of Aqua controls,

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.640
but also remember to focus
on the alignments and the

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.580
overall layout of the palette.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.060
So what would this look like if it was
adhering to the Aqua layout guidelines?

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.660
We've got more alignment of controls.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.560
We've reduced redundancy
in labels that were there.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.730
We've used verticals or horizontal
separators to distinguish

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.460
sections of this palette.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.150
So it's pretty simple stuff, but again,
a beautiful tool to do this around,

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.930
or a beautiful tool to use to
do this is Interface Builder.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:18.870
Alright, missing the basics.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.750
We talked about a section
earlier on which was the basics.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:25.400
I'm talking about here about the basics
for the appearance in the system.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:29.760
Here we've got an application,
and I see lots of difficulty with this,

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.900
particularly in Carbon applications
coming over from Mac OS 9.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:37.460
But also Carbon applications coming from
other platforms where the developer has

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.900
leveraged Carbon to do the interface
because of the structure of their code.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.900
They've chosen to use
Carbon because it's easier.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.900
And there's just some
real difficulties here,

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.900
and I wanted to point
these out specifically.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.200
Here I've got a dialog that's got,
has no respect for the margins that

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.610
we define in the Aqua guidelines,
so the tab panes are

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.780
very close to the edges.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.070
We've got multiple tab rows,
although the second row is

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.890
really an inner tab pane,
which is okay to do.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.830
We do it in System Preferences.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.350
But certainly it should be spaced
downwards and then inwards so that

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:11.660
you know that it's a separate tab
pane within a larger tab pane.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.950
The buttons at the bottom are
being obscured by shadowing,

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.650
so there's over-compositing
there of the tab panes.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.390
All of the text in the
dialog is non-antelious,

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.890
and it's all Geneva 9.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.900
It's hard-coded font faces and sizes.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.970
And I see this a lot as
I review applications.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.280
An interface like this, for example,
on your product is going to

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.240
mean that your users judge the
quality of your product based

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.300
upon what they see on the screen.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.520
You've put a lot of effort
into writing your code.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:41.780
You know it's great.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:44.600
You want the world to experience it.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.850
Spend the time to make a really
great interface on top of it,

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.740
to put a really great Aqua-compliant
interface that leverages sheets and

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.780
drawers and speech and all of the
stuff that we're talking about today

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.500
to really create a killer application.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.880
Because then the users
look at it and they go,

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.380
wow, this is great,
and look what it does.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.790
Most users really are not concerned
about what your product does.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.470
I mean, they are concerned about that,
but primarily they're

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.870
concerned with how it does it.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.320
What differentiates you from
your competition is ease of use.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.190
Think about iMovie.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.120
Before iMovie was on the scene,
it was really hard to just

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.760
pick up and edit a video.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.420
We spent a lot of time thinking about the
interface around iMovie and how do we,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.380
you know, who are users?

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.240
What are they doing?

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.830
Remember we talked about
this stuff in session one.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.560
Who are users?

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.100
What are they doing?

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.120
What do they need to accomplish?

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.470
Simplify, simplify,
simplify to the point where we've

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.940
got this iMovie thing that people are
just looking at as an example and a

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:44.830
benchmark for creating really highly
usable consumer-oriented products.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:50.040
Don't let your interface knock
you down in terms of the judgment

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.840
your users render upon you.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.510
You spend a lot of time in your code.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.220
Group boxes.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.350
Aqua has a very distinct
appearance in Aqua,

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.070
and we encourage the use of white space.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.400
We have margins in dialogs.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:07.800
We encourage spacing between groups
of items or a single separator bar.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.290
And group boxes are still
available in the toolbox.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:11.420
You can still do them.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.790
You can define them in Interface Builder,
etc.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.180
But I want to encourage you to
think about moving away from

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.750
group boxes wherever you can.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.800
Moving away from them means your
interface is going to feel lighter.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.320
It's going to feel cleaner.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.010
You can actually drop the side
and the bottom lines from group

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.720
boxes and have the very same effect
where you have stacked group boxes.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.720
So here we've got a UI on 10.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.090
It's pretty good.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.870
It's got Aqua compliance, pretty much.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.180
The spacing around the edges of
the dialog is a little tight.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.700
But it's pretty much there.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.720
And yet there's group boxes everywhere.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.450
So if we clean this up a little bit,
remove the group boxes,

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.720
we can actually do single
horizontal separators.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.330
We can use the combo box that
I introduced earlier to actually

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:59.220
reduce the size of this dialog while
still providing the same functionality.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.310
So we're trying to provide
the widgets you need,

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:04.120
but if you use those widgets and
adhere to the layout guidelines,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.720
etc., you can actually reduce your
dialogs in many cases and make them

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:13.200
more functional and tighter and yet feel
lighter and have more breathing room.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.190
Here's an application that
another difficulty I see,

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.590
which is where a developer sees
a need for something and they

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.940
choose to customize it somewhat.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.790
And so here the developer has
too many tabs for this dialog,

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.780
so they figured, oh, what the heck,
we'll throw a scroll bar

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.890
above it and scroll the tabs.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.580
The fact of the matter is that it's
a non-standard way to do things,

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.340
and not to mention the fact that the
tabs themselves aren't Mac OS X compliant

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.580
in terms of the appearance.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.850
And so as you clean this dialog up,
what you get is a slightly larger dialog,

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.000
because in fact there was only
one tab that wasn't visible,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.930
but for some reason the
dialog can't be resized.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.240
I don't know why, it's just a dialog box.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.480
Think about your dialog boxes,
don't make them too small.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.590
I see consistently small, tiny,
tiny dialogs where people

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:00.180
have crammed stuff into,
and you ask the developer why,

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.740
I ask them why, and they say, well,
that's the way it always was,

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.760
or whatever.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.620
The fact of the matter is
dialog boxes are modal in age.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.880
They're not just a product of nature.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.880
The user is focused on their
contents and they invoke them,

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.640
they focus on their contents,
and they dismiss them,

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.000
and then they're done.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.470
Mac OS 9-ish.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.560
Bringing a product from Mac OS 9,
make sure its appearance

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.830
is Mac OS X completely.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.230
Aqua provides for a very
rich graphical environment.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:31.010
However, overuse of color and things too
tight together mean that it's

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.880
just too visually stimulating.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.040
So in this case, I don't know,
there's just too much going on

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.790
even though it's fully compliant
with the appearance of Mac OS X.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.770
The appearance for toolbars in
Mac OS X is a very clean approach,

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.440
and the icons we use are high
quality in terms of their rendering.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:53.340
The icons we provide are shortcuts to
things that are multiple clicks away,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.350
and so consider very carefully
what you put in your toolbars.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.360
Don't put every function of
your application as an icon,

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.900
represented as an icon in your toolbar.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.370
You'll just have overpopulation
of your toolbars.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.110
Focus specifically on those
things that dramatically increase

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.400
the productivity of your users.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.340
And I'm pleased to announce that,
as of Jaguar, the toolbar control is

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.400
now available in Carbon.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.350
So Carbon apps can deliver a real system
toolbar just like Mail or just like

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.400
other Cocoa applications you've seen,
including the configure sheet

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.400
and all of that behavior.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.400
That all comes for free.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.370
If you're a Carbon developer
and you're doing toolbars,

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:32.230
you need to be leveraging the new
control that's available in Jaguar.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.990
So as you sit there
and you listen to this,

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.940
maybe you're at last year's session
and you've read the book or whatever,

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.860
maybe you haven't,
you sort of sit and you go, help,

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.770
I can't do this stuff.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.180
I don't know, I'm just a programmer or,
you know, I don't know.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:50.550
I want to just present four
resources that are available to you.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.100
And the first thing is an update
to Power Plant that's going to

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.790
dramatically improve the appearance of
your product if it's Power Plant based.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.500
And to do that,
I want to introduce Greg Dow from

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.680
MetroWorks to talk through
some of the changes there.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:01.240
Greg?

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.170
Hi, I'm Greg Dow, the Chief Architect of
PowerPlant for MetroWorks.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:24.430
Just want to give you a few
tips here to help you be a good

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.200
citizen as John has described.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:30.490
PowerPlant,
one of its benefits is that it's started

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.850
back in the system seven days and it's
maintained compatibility with each OS.

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:39.330
However, because of that compatibility,
it's sometimes easy to get

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:43.560
lazy and not update your user
interface for each system.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:47.010
And so, if you have a program now
that's running on Mac OS 9,

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.460
it's actually pretty easy
to just flip the switch,

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:53.060
make it a Carbon application,
and have it run on Mac OS X.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.190
However, it's not going to look right and
it's not going to be a good citizen.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.200
And here are just a few quick tips.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:07.770
Here are just a few quick tips of
what you can do to quickly update

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.780
your Power Plant applications to
have an Aqua-savvy appearance.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:15.540
First, make a new menu bar for Mac OS X.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.300
On Aqua interfaces,
there's the application menu that

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.940
automatically puts a quit item
and a preferences item there.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:27.250
On Mac OS 9 applications,
you probably had your quit

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.920
item in your file menu,
and if you had a preferences item,

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.900
it was probably at the
bottom of your edit menu.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.240
If you don't update your menu bar,
when you port your

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.560
application to Mac OS X,
those items will appear twice.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.660
You'll have two quit items,
and you'll have two preferences

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:42.920
items in your menu bar.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:46.340
Both items will still work,
but it looks sloppy and not polished,

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.860
and you won't be a good citizen.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.440
The other thing is background colors.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.400
On Mac OS X, the Aqua appearance,
the background cannot just be a color,

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.740
but it could be a pattern,
and the standard interface

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.150
has the subtle gray stripes.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.840
If you developed your application
for a platinum look on Mac OS X,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.340
you probably set it up so that your
window had a light gray background

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.280
color set up as the window color table.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.890
If you do that on 10, it'll again,
you'll get that platinum look,

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.100
but you won't get the proper system look.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.160
So use theme brushes,
and Power Plant provides classes for

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:22.390
automatically setting up your window
so it uses a proper theme brush.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.200
and use the Aqua Savvy classes.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:29.130
So, there's a little bit of
discrepancy here in terminology

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:30.200
between what John mentioned.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.200
When John talked about standard controls,
he meant the controls

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.810
provided by the toolbox.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:36.770
Power Plant,
because it's been around for so long,

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:41.450
when it refers to standard controls,
it means the System 7 controls.

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.040
You had four controls back then.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:47.640
You had a button, checkbox, radio button,
pop-up menu, and that was it.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.420
When the Appearance Manager came out,
Power Plant introduced a

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.520
whole slew of new classes for
using the appearance controls.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.370
Those are the controls
you should be using.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.010
You should not be using the
standard button on Power Plant.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.860
You should be using the
Appearance Manager push button,

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.470
et cetera.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:07.820
Similarly for text,
Power Plant provided a caption text

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.760
that used drawing via Quick Draw calls.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:12.590
Don't use that on Aqua.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.470
Use either the static text control
or the theme text box so that

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.700
you get proper anti-alias text.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:22.670
And if you want to use anti-alias
text also in your edited text boxes,

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.870
use the MLTE pane rather
than the text edit based.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:33.260
Now I just want to show a quick
demo here of two applications.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:38.160
One that was just quickly
ported over to Carbon.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:45:55.200
[Transcript missing]

00:45:55.230 --> 00:46:00.880
Just as a side-by-side comparison now,
if I bring up an Aqua Aware program here,

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.790
now we have the file menu.

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.790
Oops.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.360
I'll skip there.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.540
The File menu with no quit item.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.700
Edit menu has no preferences item.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.660
We bring up preferences here
from the Application menu.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.690
And here,

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.740
The interface has been aquified.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.050
Here we have the nice striped background.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.200
And if you want to notice
some other subtle bugs here,

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.040
you can see the non-aquified application.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.900
Actually, your button is pulsing
here in the background.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.910
This is the disabled window,
but because these are

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.970
stupid System 7 controls,
they don't know to properly

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.390
disable themselves,
so they continue to flash,

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:37.490
and it continues to be active text here.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.810
Whereas if I click off over here,
you see everything properly dims out

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.820
over here on the aquified interface.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:47.650
Another point that something different
that happened in Power Plant that

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:52.510
some people have tripped up on is
when you use the static text control,

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.680
the control manager automatically
erases to the background.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.210
In this case,
you get the gray striped background here.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.370
And if you're drawing
your text over a picture,

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:04.040
well, you probably don't want that.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.720
What you want to use
is the theme text box.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.880
This still draws anti-alias text,
but it doesn't do the

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.370
erase before you draw.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.210
So if you actually want to draw text,
you can do that by

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:12.740
clicking on the text box.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.860
So if you're drawing your
text over a background,

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.770
use the theme text drawing box
instead of a static text control.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.700
Another point here,
although it's not obvious visually,

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.020
is something that Apple has recommended,
is that the title of your pop-up

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.400
menu should actually not use the
title of the pop-up menu control.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.470
You should actually create your title
for the pop-up using a separate,

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.860
either a static text control
or a theme text box drawing,

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.410
so that the two are independent.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:42.650
It has to do with the
appearance and dimming,

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:42.660
because if I actually
made this the title,

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:47.160
it actually wouldn't dim here properly
when I deactivated the window.

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.660
So that's just another quick tip
there to get your applications

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.550
looking right on Aqua.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.490
And that's it for me right now.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.580
I'm going to switch it
over back to John here.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:01.580
So go out and aquify your
Powerpoint applications.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.650
Great.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:03.580
Thank you, Greg.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.010
That's fine.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.400
The second tool that's
available to you is coming soon,

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.090
and it's ADAP, kind of a cute little
acronym that I came up with,

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:16.420
called the Apple Interface
Design Assistance Program.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:19.250
Basically,
it's a program that I'm pulling together

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:23.130
which is to identify human interface
design agencies or visual design

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:26.880
firms that can help you implement
the things that I've talked about or

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.060
help you design a really highly usable
application that looks great in the world

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.880
of Mac OS X so that you can implement it.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.990
Not everybody is gifted in this area,
and there are certainly

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:39.040
people that are gifted,
and so if your agent,

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.260
if your company feels that it needs
the assistance of these companies,

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.090
I'm trying to provide the resources
available to you so you know

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.050
who to go to rather than sort
of just picking in the dark saying,

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.910
"Oh, maybe these guys know how to do it."
So these will be companies that we

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:56.150
know have a proven track record on
Mac OS X in terms of interface design.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.650
So more details to follow
in the developer news.

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:04.020
Third resource available to you to
help you create a great application

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.070
that knocks it out of the park
from a user experience point

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.530
of view and from an appearance,
adherence point of view, etc.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.200
is the Human Interface Guidelines.

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.200
This book is constantly being revised.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.340
We've got another revision
coming specific to Jaguar.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:18.120
We'll talk about where to use ComboBox.

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:20.200
We'll talk about universal access.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.200
We'll talk about speech,
where to use speech.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:26.260
We've got a lot of new content and just
encourage you to look at this book and

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.200
read it and review it and reference it.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.580
Make sure it's available to the
people who are designing the

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.200
user interfaces for your product.

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:36.960
And the fourth thing is Apple's
interface design tool of

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.310
choice is Interface Builder.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.920
Interface Builder,
if you've never seen this,

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.480
is an incredible product for creating
the interface on your application.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.330
And I consistently run into developers
who've never seen Interface Builder.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.440
They're a Carbon developer,
or they're even a Java developer.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.780
They've never even heard of it,
or if they heard of it,

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.070
they didn't realize what it would do.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:02.060
Interface Builder provides this
drag and drop metaphor for dragging

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.160
buttons and UI elements onto Windows.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.190
And as you drag them
and move them around,

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:09.520
you get guidelines,
guides that appear automatically that

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.600
tell you where to put that button if it's
going to be in the bottom right corner,

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.290
or where to put that tab pane,
and how big should it be sized to respect

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.850
the margins around a window and stuff.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.510
If you've never seen Interface Builder,
go to session 904, I believe it is,

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.460
which demonstrates IB and
shows you how to use it.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.410
And if you are using it
today to prototype your

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:31.760
product or to layout your UI,
consider taking the extra

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.930
step if you're a Carbon app,
for example,

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:37.960
and leveraging nib files instead
of being resource file based or

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.980
using some other mechanism for
defining the layout of your windows.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.620
Consider using the
Carbon APIs to read in nib files,

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:47.330
which means you'll be able to
use IB to create your UI and

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:51.190
then read those files in and use
them to display your interface.

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.590
Let's go back to the
definition of citizenship.

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:56.870
We looked at the first sentence and
we talked about the benefits that

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:02.550
are available to you if you create a
really compelling product on Mac OS X.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:07.780
It's not enough to just bring your code
to Mac OS X and then sort of ship it.

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:14.150
It is enough, or it's, it's, it's, it's,
the thing to do is to move beyond that,

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.420
to go beyond just the basics,
beyond just porting your

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.880
product to the platform.

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.740
It's really a question about going way
beyond those basics and leveraging and

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.790
implementing all of the other stuff we've
talked about today and a whole lot more

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.640
which we didn't have time to talk about.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.660
But I want to talk about now the
other part of this definition

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.420
which is the conduct as a citizen.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:35.100
And in this case,
I want to bring up three of your peers

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.450
to share their experiences adopting
Aqua and the process that they went

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:43.060
through as they looked at Mac OS X for
the first time and looked at their

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:47.490
current product and decided how would
they bring that product to Mac OS X.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:52.280
And I think hearing their experiences
will be very educational for you

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:55.490
just in understanding that other
people are going through the same

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:58.510
things you're going through and also
learning some of the thought processes

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.600
that they went through that you
might be able to employ for yourself.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.010
So to start off with,
I want to introduce Stuart DeSpain from

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:10.600
Microsoft to talk about their process
with the Office 10 product on Mac OS X.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.400
Please stand.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.400
One moment.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:06.870
Is it back?

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:06.880
Okay, I'm back.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:54:51.900
[Transcript missing]

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:55.410
Project Gallery was
introduced in Office 2001,

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:58.400
and it's been very popular,
very successful for us.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.600
We're very happy with it,
but we knew we could do better.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:06.880
In Office 10, we changed our file icons
so that they were closer in

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.240
line with real world objects.

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.640
So our calendar really
has a calendar in it.

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:14.280
Email has a big envelope in it.

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:17.150
The slide deck for PowerPoint looks
like there's slides you can hold up

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:20.110
and actually project to sort of convey
to people these are the functions that

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:21.760
these documents are designed to be.

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.060
going to actually execute.

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:28.220
In terms of low visibility
features that we knew were helpful,

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.300
the view switcher.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:33.180
PowerPoint and Word both have a view
switcher that changes modes to allow you

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:35.150
to do different kinds of work activities.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.280
Sadly,
they were kind of buried in the bottom

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.200
left corner of the document window,
and they're kind of hard to find.

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:42.760
So in 10,
we brought in a finder-like view

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.600
switcher that punches those features out.

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:48.400
People can see right away,
there are big clickable

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.590
buttons down there,
and they're much more successful

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:52.580
at finding that feature.

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:55.100
We even wanted to bring
Aqua to our product icons,

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:55.460
though.

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.940
We're definitely enhancing usability,
but we want things to look great.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.800
We want people to know that this
is a new suite of applications

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:05.510
under a new operating system,
and we changed our icons so they had

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:10.530
more depth and were more exciting,
more new, more fresh.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.920
But beyond the static visuals,
we wanted to take that language

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.380
step a little bit further.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:18.380
So we introduced animation.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:22.110
Now, the formatting palette was something
we introduced in Office 2001 as well.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.430
Again, very popular feature and
we're very happy with it.

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:28.680
But we have a slight problem if people
were trying to manage their windows,

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.310
there was a case where people would
hide the formatting palette because

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.500
it was in their way and then they
couldn't find out where it went,

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:36.840
as you can see here.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.260
So in Office 10,
we introduced animation so that when

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:44.470
people close the formatting palette,
it genies into a toolbar

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:46.300
and then genies back out.

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:49.080
And this has greatly
enhanced the discoverability.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:52.180
We've also enhanced the formatting
palette with other animations,

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.190
for example,
when you close and hide panes,

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:56.890
and there's a lot more fun
stuff we can do in the future.

00:56:56.900 --> 00:57:01.030
Aqua also gave us the opportunity
to redefine our dialogues.

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:03.520
You've seen a lot of examples
today about dialogues that

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.200
didn't quite make sense and,
well, this is one of ours.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.200
This is the FillFX dialogue.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:10.350
Kind of hard to follow.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:13.380
When we were moving over to 10,
we were also bringing in new features.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.630
So we took this as a good opportunity
to change the look of the dialogue

00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.440
so that it had a better flow.

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:20.030
We didn't just aqua-fied it.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:24.590
To a many extents, we ma-ca-fied it so it
was much more usable.

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:29.200
We also wanted to bring the key
components of Aqua to our feature set.

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.690
Beyond the user interface,
we wanted to embed it

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:33.390
into the actual product.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.560
Our graphics in 2001 were nice.

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:37.000
Our charts looked nice.

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:39.940
The problem is the edges are really,
really jagged.

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.730
The transparency didn't work really well.

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.060
And these were obvious clues
for us that in Office 10 we

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:49.710
wanted to see anti-alias text,
anti-alias lines, transparency,

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.170
and I think the results
speak for themselves.

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.770
We had to use a lot of different
methods to create a much,

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.480
much better chart.

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:56.100
So, have we been successful?

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:59.760
Well, the San Jose Mercury News thought
we were the best looking piece

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.600
of software they had ever seen.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:05.380
From Wired,
they thought we were so pretty

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:08.590
they didn't believe we were real.

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.390
Steve Jobs asked for a round of
applause and said that Apple was

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.120
thrilled with the application,
and we're thrilled to hear that.

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.800
So, have we been successful?

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.260
Well, there's been a payoff.

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:21.380
Eight hundred dialogues later,
five hundred icons later,

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:24.560
we have a great looking product,
and we're very proud of it.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.030
And the reviews have
been very motivational,

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:27.480
certainly for our team.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:31.170
It's great to get up in the morning
and fire up your browser and read

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:34.220
these great reviews from people who
really enjoy the work you're doing,

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.370
and then they're getting to use your
product and enjoying it even more.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:39.500
And, of course, it translates into sales.

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.510
The more people are
excited about your product,

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.110
the more they're going to
want to go out and try it,

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:46.810
especially as momentum builds more
and more and more behind OS X and,

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:49.560
hopefully, Office 10 along with it.

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.520
So beyond that even,
it's also sparking ideas

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:54.110
for our next revisions.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.880
We've been very successful adopting
the language of Aqua in Office 10,

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.750
but there's a lot more we can do,
and we're thinking

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:02.700
about this all the time,
so we're really thrilled with it.

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:03.700
Thanks, John.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:10.330
Great, thank you.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:17.840
Next,
I'd like to invite on stage Ivor Clarke,

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:21.590
who's president of Simple Factors,
a design agency working with

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.640
a company called Media Maker.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:29.540
Thanks, John.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.380
So as John said, my name's Ivor Clarke.

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.400
I'm president of Simple Factors.

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:36.110
I'm here to talk to you a
little bit about the work my

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:37.980
company did with MeetingMaker.

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:40.200
First of all, a little bit of background.

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:42.040
MeetingMaker,
for those of you who don't know,

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.730
is a collaborative
scheduling application.

00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:47.210
It's been around for
a fair amount of time.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.980
It's about 12 years old.

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.450
They're on version 7.

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.530
It's one of the original applications.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:55.920
There's a lot of stuff that's
been hanging around there.

00:59:55.940 --> 01:00:00.750
And they're now engaged in a
two-part release strategy for OS X.

01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:03.740
The first is to get out a
version that is carbonized,

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.420
works on OS X, gets full functionality.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.800
It's what everyone's been clamoring for.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.880
And the second is to really
take advantage of it and knock

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:15.300
-- take advantage of Aqua,
take advantage of the operating system,

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:17.460
and really knock a
release out of the park.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.360
The first portion of that was
released just a couple weeks ago.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.970
That's version 7.1.

01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:26.670
My company, Simple Factors,
was brought in to assist in the designing

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.150
of version 8 just a short while ago.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.740
So, before we talk about anything else,
the question is, why bother?

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.120
They've got a release
that's fully carbonized.

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:37.800
All the functionality works.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.250
You might as well say, job done.

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:43.060
Why move forward?

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.100
Well, first of all, customer feedback.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:51.790
When we started designing version 8,
Aqua had been out for two years.

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:55.310
Customers are really starting to
expect that of an OS X application.

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:57.170
OS X is not about multitasking.

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:59.110
It's not about multithreading.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.460
It's becoming about Aqua.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.740
It's becoming about a
great user experience.

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:05.730
Second of all, it's a way to get noticed.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.900
What you saw from Stuart's presentation,
there are,

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:13.060
when you do a great job with Aqua,
the press and others are going

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.940
to stand up and take notice.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.330
It's also an opportunity
for bigger changes.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.730
As you're going in,
making the changes to make

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:23.320
a great looking application,
making the changes to

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:26.950
take advantage of Aqua,
you have the opportunity to really get

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.730
in there and reevaluate some of the
ways you present your user interface.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.430
As I said, Meeting Maker had been
around for 12 years.

01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:37.640
This was an opportunity for
us to go in and ask ourselves,

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.230
were we really doing some
of the right things with the

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.170
fundamentals of the application?

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.240
And finally, other platforms.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.890
There are some other platforms out there.

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:48.690
Meeting Maker ports to them.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.450
And they are also, some of them,
starting to put an emphasis on

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.460
the visuals of the applications.

01:01:56.650 --> 01:02:00.950
And trust me, the work you do to create a
great-looking Aqua app will not be

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:03.620
lost when you move to other platforms.

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.900
So where did we focus?

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.640
We didn't work to take the
list of Aqua features and

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.050
just sort of make a checklist.

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:14.310
Instead, we said, well,
what is Aqua about?

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.430
There are a couple things.

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:16.640
First of all, look and feel.

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:21.230
I think this is what most
people associate with Aqua.

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:26.230
It's that high production value,
great presentation.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.140
But it's more than that.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.140
It's more than just pulsating buttons.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:33.120
It's also a way to improve
feedback for the user.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.190
When you look at the Dock,
the Genie effect, Sheets,

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:41.960
all of those are ways to tie
what's going on in the system to

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.800
an action that the user has taken.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.800
And it really helps reinforce
those actions for the user.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.360
And finally, information presentation.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.380
One of the reasons Aqua looks great
is because it does a great job of

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.550
presenting the user's information.

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.580
If you take a look at the
column view in the finder,

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.590
that's the same type of information
shown in the list view or finder view,

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:06.400
but they've taken the opportunity to find
a better way to present that information,

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.160
and I think it's what many people
are finding the most useful.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.580
So I want to walk through
a couple examples.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.280
This is the contact window.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.940
And when we were looking at aquifying it,
there's nothing fundamentally

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:19.580
wrong with this.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:20.480
You can see everything.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.040
We could have just put a striped
background behind it and called it done.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.590
But we wanted to do a
little bit more than that.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.240
And this really goes to improving
information presentation.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.660
Rather than just changing
all the controls,

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.620
we also looked at how the
information was organized.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.940
We looked at how it was presented.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.440
And what we ended up with
is something that not only

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.060
looks a lot better under OS X,
but it does a much better job

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.180
of presenting the information
and becomes more usable.

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:48.740
This is the Proposals window.

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:52.560
This is where you see proposals
from other users for meetings or

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:56.440
invitations that you've sent to other
users for meetings you've created.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.130
Now, we could have, again,
just put some new toolbar icons in,

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.130
improved the title bar, scroll bar,
that kind of thing.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:09.580
But instead, we again re-evaluated what
type of information do we

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.690
need to present to the user?

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.800
How can we make it look better?

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.160
Yes, we've got the new icons,
and we've got the new controls,

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.400
but we also looked at the
types of information that are

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:18.720
required for the user here.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.700
We gave them a little extra data,
and in doing so,

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.340
allow them to make better decisions
when they're using the product.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.730
So this is the schedule window.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.710
The schedule window is used to

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:36.450
Pick a time for your meeting based
on your guests' availability.

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:40.240
So if you see that red
stripe on the left-hand side,

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.240
that's the availability
of all your users.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:46.260
It shows when they're all
busy or when they're all free.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.950
Well, that can be a little limiting when
you're trying to make a decision

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.330
about when to have a meeting.

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:58.400
So when we redesigned it,
not only did we use Apple's

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.680
dialog layout guidelines,
use new controls,

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:05.980
make sure the presentation was right,
but we also added extra information.

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:10.200
Now you can see on a case-by-case
basis whether a user is available.

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:13.040
You'll also notice that
yellow transparent stripe,

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.180
that shows your chosen meeting time.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.050
We took advantage of some
OS X technologies to use

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:21.840
transparency to improve the ability
to see whether the meeting time

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.300
you've chosen conflicts with anyone.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.300
Thank you.

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:28.510
So,
my final example really touches on that

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:31.800
piece of improving feedback to the user.

01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:35.660
This is the dialogue you go to when you
want to change the view of your calendar,

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.420
change the appearance of your calendar.

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.540
So you can change some fonts here,
some other stuff.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.920
But of course what you have to
do is look at your calendar,

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.930
imagine what you want,
go to this dialogue, make the changes,

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:47.750
click OK,
then go back and see if what you

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:50.160
changed is actually what you wanted.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.680
Hope you're right.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.600
So instead, we just tie it in directly.

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:57.360
As the user's make the
changes to colors and fonts,

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.420
they see them reflected
directly in the calendar.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.930
And then when they go back,
it's going to be exactly

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:05.420
what they wanted.

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:07.340
Finally, reaction.

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:10.420
Now, as I mentioned,
this product has just started

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:13.140
the development phase,
but already we've begun to

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.960
share it with customers.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.170
First of all,
there's an enormous amount of

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:20.490
energy in the organization.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.250
The development team is getting
really psyched about developing this.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.970
The test organization can't
wait to start testing it.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.670
Sales is already seeing this as
a huge opportunity to go out and

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:32.760
sell a new product to customers.

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.050
And customers are really,
really liking what we're showing them.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.690
They see we're taking Aqua seriously.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.220
They see we're taking OS X seriously.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:44.360
And they also see us really putting an
emphasis on what's important to them.

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.290
I mean,
administrators are the people who have

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:50.220
to take care of this in an organization,
so it can cost them a lot of money

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.000
if the product's hard to use.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:55.110
They see us taking usability
of the product seriously,

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:56.980
and they really like what we're doing.

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:00.520
That's pretty much all I've got,
and I'll hand it back over to John.

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:07.010
Great, thank you Ivor.

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:11.150
And the last testimonial, so to speak,
comes from Microtech,

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:15.120
and I'd like to introduce Kristen Lee to
talk about their experiences.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:16.910
Hey Kristen.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:23.530
Hi, my name is Kristen Lee.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.780
I am Marketing Project Manager for
Microtech.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:31.040
We manufacture consumer and
professional scanners and also develop

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.900
the software that controls them.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.900
We have a little bit different story.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:40.130
Our initial plan for releasing
our professional scanner,

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:43.900
or scanning software,
was to port it to Carbon,

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.710
add Aqua icons to it, and ship it.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:50.740
While this made sense for us,
we have a very complex UI,

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:55.030
and we were able to save time
and resources for engineering,

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.900
and we would also be able to reuse
our documentation for Mac OS 9.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:06.840
But, last September,
we attended an Apple Design Kitchen,

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.900
and in just a few hours
of working with Apple,

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.380
we really realized what a benefit
applying the Aqua guidelines

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.900
was going to make for us.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.870
So, we went to the other extreme.

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:20.880
We took full advantage
of the opportunity.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.910
We took our application,
which historically has had a

01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:26.900
truly Windows look and feel,
and created a unique Macintosh interface.

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:33.380
We also took the chance to update
and reposition our software to a

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:40.900
true high-end scanning solution for
photographers and graphics pros.

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.800
We went from ScanWizard Pro 6
to the new ScanWizard Pro 8.

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:47.440
We have a new, well, not new, but a new,
well-designed, ScanWizard Pro 6,

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.520
with a cluttered,
haphazard look and feel, bitmap,

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.690
jaggy icon.

01:08:52.790 --> 01:09:00.120
ScanWizard Pro 7.0 Clean,
professional feel and a fantastic

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:04.790
new application icon that
really makes sense to our users.

01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:11.400
Quickly going through some of the
windows that had the most modifications,

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.340
our preview window.

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.330
Preview window contains tools,
all of the action buttons

01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:19.210
for our application,
as well as a pop-up menu

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.970
for scanning material.

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.630
In the previous version,
this pop-up menu had an icon that

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:26.680
really confused a lot of our users.

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:31.340
So we decided to opt for
a very simple pop-up menu.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:34.990
We rearranged all of the
information for workflow,

01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:36.880
and we redesigned all
of the tools as well.

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.190
Wow.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.000
You'll notice in later slides as
well that we have moved all of the

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:46.250
tools to the upper right hand corner,
making our application much

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.700
more intuitive for the user.

01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:52.560
Next window is the Settings window.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.900
This window controls our application.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.980
And as you see,
with the amount of information and

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:03.390
especially the organization of it,
very complex and intimidating.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.050
You'll also notice something
that John harps on often.

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:11.150
On the left-hand side here,
we've got labels as buttons,

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:14.860
and we've got very unclear
icons on top of them.

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:22.340
In the new window,
it has a much different look

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:27.200
and feel just from clearly
aligning the information.

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:32.600
We've also taken and reorganized
some of the information for workflow,

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.140
and I would like to point out category.

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:39.130
The category pop-up is used
to set the controls below it

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.680
to different custom settings.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.700
In the old version,
this was very unclear,

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.980
but now you have a control
that shows that it's dominant

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:52.020
over the controls below it.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.560
You'll also notice that the buttons
and the icons have disappeared.

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:01.340
Lastly, one of our correction dialogs.

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:03.840
This has a very complex workflow.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.560
The dialog is used to create
custom settings for some of the

01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.900
controls in the settings window.

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:14.600
The icons along the left-hand
side here are used to navigate

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.950
through this multi-panel dialog.

01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:21.900
And you'll notice that those icons
are the same unclear icons that

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.040
you saw in the settings window.

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:30.010
Also note that the tools are floating
down within the content of the dialog.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.190
In the new window,
most of the main content of

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.140
the dialog is still the same.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.820
What we've done is made a
change to the navigation and the

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.480
shared controls of this dialog.

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:46.210
Navigation moved from the
buttons along the side to a

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:48.210
simple pop-up menu at the top.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.620
All shared controls were
also moved along the top,

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:56.030
and the tools were moved up into that
right-hand corner to again create

01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:58.830
that intuitive feel for the user.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:13:02.300
[Transcript missing]

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:08.240
Great.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.050
Well, thank you, Kristen.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:14.800
The end result is it's clear from
these three cases and lots more

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.220
that I could have brought on stage
but we didn't have time for it,

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.230
that if you put the effort
in to make a really,

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.400
really great user interface,
put a really great user interface

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:27.150
on your application and an interface
that makes the product highly usable,

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:31.260
the end results are significant and the
benefits to you as a good citizen in

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.780
the world of Mac OS X are significant.

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.140
Remember,
don't focus just on your features.

01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:40.540
As the engineering people,
typically probably the audience

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.390
is filled with programmers,
you're interested in what you wrote,

01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.900
right?

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.020
You want your feature to
be exposed to the world.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.210
But remember,
users don't really necessarily

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:51.940
care how your product,
what it does necessarily.

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.530
I mean, they do, but they're more focused
on how it does it.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.300
Ease of use really matters.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.070
These interfaces that are
discoverable really matter and

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:00.440
the benefits are substantial.

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.760
So the last part of the definition
of citizenship is that there

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.160
are awards for good citizens.
