WEBVTT

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.860
Good afternoon.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.100
Welcome to the open source
Apple and You session.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.190
We're going to spend a few
minutes today and talk a bit about

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.510
Apple's open source projects,
what we're doing with our open

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.920
source efforts here at Apple,
where we're going to be going from here,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.860
and probably the most important aspect
of it is how you guys can participate.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.320
If you've been following
us over the past few years,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.760
you've noticed we have a
number of open source projects.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.190
We'll give you some status on
these and some new stuff as well.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.040
To kind of get into that,
we have a few new open source

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.200
projects we'd like to announce today.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.460
The first one is Open Directory.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.590
This one now joins the rest
of the open source projects.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.940
Open Directory is our, basically,
directory services layer of Mac OS X.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.370
The abstraction layer of the system
for dealing with directory service,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.810
the interfaces into things like
LDAP and NetInfo and a number of

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.100
other directory service solutions.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.090
The next one is CUPS,
which is our new common

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.180
Unix printing system,
which is kind of the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.270
underlying technology for the
new print system in Jaguar.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.750
and a bunch of additional Darwin goodies.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.560
Things like IPv6,
which is now part of Jaguar, IPsec,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.920
and we've also integrated OpenLDAP,
NetSNMP, and PAM for some of the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.050
security services and such.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.400
And there's a number of other
projects that have been updated and

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.930
other bits and pieces of Darwin that
are all brand spanking new.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.100
And in addition,
we've added yet more pieces

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.010
from Core Foundation.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.750
You know, I've been kind of slowly
but surely in CF Lite,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.150
that's part of Darwin,
and adding more pieces from the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.060
Core Foundation and bringing that
down into the open source layer.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.660
It kind of represents the kind of
the insulation layer between the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.920
Darwin open source activities and
the rest of the Mac OS X world.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.420
And so as those,
since that line is fairly blurry,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.710
we have been trying to bring
technologies that make sense

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.180
down into the open source layer.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.570
Common Data Security Architecture,
or CDSA, is one we actually

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.040
open sourced last year.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.780
But it's one of particular interest,
and I would hope if you haven't

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.290
had a chance to get involved in it,
you would.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.410
CDSA is actually an open group standard,
and it's basically the layer

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.640
that deals with security,
number of security features in Mac OS X,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.140
specifically things like encryption
and authentication in particular.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.430
As I mentioned earlier, just briefly,
we now have PAM support

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.140
as part of Darwin.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.280
Basically, PAM is programmable
authentication modules,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.600
which allow a common way to deal with
authentication at the command line.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.600
The various tools, things like Telnet,
stuff like that,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.380
that may need authentication,
go through one common set

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.680
of libraries called PAM.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.240
Well,
PAM is actually integrated into CDSA,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.150
our security framework for Mac OS X,
so that there is one consistent set

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.660
of behaviors for how authentication
is done within the system.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.380
CDSA also provides a number of plug-in
mechanisms for being able to deal with,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.010
again, cryptography,
for certificate management stuff,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.720
and for key management and
other authentication pieces.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.990
I think the most important message we'd
like to get out around CDSA is that,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.280
one, it's an incredibly powerful set of
abstractions for dealing with security,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.600
and if you are working with code,
for example, that uses OpenSSL,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.900
CDSA is actually something that
we believe should be replacing

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.080
OpenSSL as a way for doing secure
transport kinds of services.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.920
And the reason being is that CDSA allows
so many more ways to be able to

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.920
support authentication and encryption,
whereas OpenSSL does a great

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.180
job of handling the secure
sockets layer communication,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.300
but doesn't provide very many ways for
dealing with different types of security.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.760
Certificates are things like
smart cards or other types

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.270
of authentication services.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.270
Thank you.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.960
Other technology we've rolled into
Darwin includes IPv6 and IPSec.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.390
This is actually some
pretty exciting work,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.170
and we've been working with a COM-A team
to actually get this into Darwin.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.380
We're excited to announce that the
COM-A team will be joined as committers

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.080
as part of the Darwin open source effort.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.270
The documentation project is another
important one which I encourage

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.900
people to get involved with.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.700
We never have enough documentation
for all the technology we have.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.900
There are some key pieces that
we support as part of our open

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.900
source efforts so you can help out.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.060
A HeaderDoc, which is a set of tools for
being able to have embedded

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.790
documentation within source code,
within the headers.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.570
I/O Kit uses this heavily so that
basically all the APIs and services

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.780
for I/O Kit are actually embedded
in the headers for the source code.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.740
And HeaderDoc extracts all
that and presents it in an

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.920
HTML format so it's web-browsable.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.810
There's a number of ways that you
can get involved in documentation

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.240
efforts in the open source,
particularly in how-tos,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.140
helping with things like man pages
and XML tools and other things.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.480
There's quite a lot of things
that you can get involved with.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.360
We've done a lot in Jaguar to bring a
number of man pages onto the system,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.720
but there's a lot more yet to be done.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.720
So, you know, come land to hand.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.950
We've, as far as more specific and
focused documentation within

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.770
our documentation efforts,
I/O Kit and other kind of bits

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.100
and pieces of the I/O system have
been documented at various levels.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.000
There's another of online full
documents for these things,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.440
as well as a number of
kernel pieces and such.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.850
So if you haven't had a
chance to go check out the

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.220
site and see what we've got,
we've got to encourage you to do so.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.040
So the key thing with open source
is it's not just an Apple effort,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.940
it's a community effort.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.140
And we've been working really hard to
create opportunities for collaboration.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.590
And there's actually a lot of folks
who have been working really hard

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.780
with us and on their own to help
contribute to our open source efforts.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:37.670
In particular, just in the Darwin layer,
we've been working directly

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.720
with the FreeBSD team.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.710
There's the work on PAM.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.200
A lot of the work of integrating
that actually came from one

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.720
of our open source developers.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.650
Of course, Patchy is a key partner.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.720
And then a number of other services.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.700
X386 is another key one who has
been also working very hard.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.720
A lot of folks in the community
doing some great work.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:04.060
The Darwin community has actually been
remarkably busy in taking Darwin and

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.720
moving it onto the x86 platform.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.340
And in fact, just recently, I believe,
we had a meeting with a group

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.340
of people at the Darwin Center.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.340
They've got it up and running
now on AMD chips as well.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.530
So if you're interested in playing
it open source at the core level,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.320
all the Core OS pieces have actually
been ported to another platform.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.340
The streaming server has also been
ported to a number of platforms.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.340
It runs on Linux and Windows.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.340
And we'll tell you a bit more about
that later in the session here.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.260
But it's pretty exciting.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.110
It's all over the place.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.100
And the same for open play.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.830
It's great to see not only the
technologies that run on our platform,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:37.840
but also the capabilities that we have.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.910
But to really take advantage of the
open source movement is to really get

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.700
them into even broader communities.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.360
I think one of the most exciting things
that was just announced last night,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.460
if you guys saw the press release,
is that the OpenOffice project

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.160
is being ported to Mac OS X.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.570
And we'll give you a little bit more
information about that in a little bit.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.380
But it's pretty exciting.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.960
It's quite an impressive
piece of software.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.350
And then I think probably the most
important thing from our open source

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.950
efforts is the fact that last week
we helped launch OpenDarwin.org,

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.170
which is basically a way for
more people to get involved

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.220
in the open source activities.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.540
Darwin, our opensource.apple.com efforts
have been great for kind of

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.130
publishing the open source,
and we have some great relationships

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.700
with a number of committers.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.400
But to really make it work,
we need to allow it really

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.780
to be opened up even further,
to allow more forms of communication

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.050
and ways that people can participate in.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.790
And OpenDarwin.org really allows
the community to help drive the

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.040
open source efforts in key ways.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.210
and we'll talk more about
that in a few minutes as well.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.920
So a number of new Darwin committers.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.360
Darwin committers are folks that we've
established an even tighter relationship

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.920
and they have right access to our open
source repositories and can make changes.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.650
And there's folks from the CAMA team,
a number of documentation folks

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.380
who have joined the committee list,
and Robert Watson who's actually

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.480
dealing with the trusted BSD.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.350
There's a whole effort on
creating a secure trusted

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.730
OS platform based on Darwin.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.000
- Mm-mm.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.480
So we have a number of folks who
are going to come and tell you more

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.500
about the various technologies.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.450
And next up on the
list is Jordan Hubbard,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.100
who will tell you about Darwin.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.390
I manage the BSD technology
group at Apple,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.030
and we're basically the folks
who are tasked with merging all

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.420
the good bits from free BSD.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.090
We also do the official
Darwin releases for PowerPC and x86.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.620
I'm going to talk a little bit
about the evolution of Darwin,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.520
and what we've done with the
Open Darwin project recently,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.630
if this would work.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.020
Okay, oh yes, point it the right way.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:08.700
So, in the three years
since we started Darwin,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.190
we've gotten a lot of feedback
on how the project is run,

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.540
both good and bad.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.030
People obviously really like the
idea of Apple doing open source

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.470
and participating to this extent,
but they've wanted more

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.520
consistent and real-time access
to bug tracking information.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.050
They've wanted to have more people
be able to change the sources.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.360
One thing about the way Darwin is run,
which is kind of cool actually,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.270
is that you have access to
the live CVS repository.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.010
So, if you make a change,
it's a Darwin committer that goes

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.130
straight into the active sources
that we use to build a product.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.990
The downside of that is that you
have access to the live repository,

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.260
and as you might expect,
there are considerable controls

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.090
that are put on this process in
order that people not break stuff.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.920
So, there needed to be... sort
of a wider access without

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.190
a complete loss of control,
and I'll talk a little

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.050
bit more about that.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.950
Another thing that people
have been asking for is

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.800
more access to project news.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.340
They want to be able to put up
bulletins when some significant event

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.720
in the open source space takes place.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.470
They want to evangelize and
announce their own little

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.140
sub-projects or working groups.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.000
And while marketing has been sort
of the sole arbiter of what goes

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.220
up on the open source website,
this is pretty slow to change

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.300
and pretty tightly controlled.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.430
Um... And they just... Basically,
the community has wanted to

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.060
drive the presentation of
Darwin to a much greater extent.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.210
They want to determine a lot more
of the look and feel and how the

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.510
project is presented and sort
of what face it puts forward.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.680
So, that brings us to opendarwin.org,
which those of you who read Slashdot

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.520
have probably read about last week.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.600
It basically was founded
jointly by Apple and the

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.100
Internet Software Consortium.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.350
But Apple does not control the site.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.210
Apple has basically... Bootstrapped it.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.740
It is now run day-to-day by the ISC,
however.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.820
And the community will essentially
dictate how that project evolves.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.980
Sorry again.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.030
It's... The CVS repository
is completely open.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.810
So, you don't need to sign any
click-through licenses or do anything

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.660
special to check out sources.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.880
You can do it via non-CVS today.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.670
If you want to join the
project as a committer,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.320
someone who has write access,
that's a fairly lightweight process.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.670
You go to a little web page.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.580
You fill out a form describing what
you want to do and who you are.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.890
And right now,
this is basically... It goes

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.940
to the opendarwin core team,
which has three people

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.840
to start with on it,
who will sort of eyeball it for

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.520
correctness and goodness and,
in pretty much all cases,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.060
just to prove it.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.210
All the bug tracking news
and documentation is now

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.430
community maintained.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.350
So, we've adopted Bugzilla
for the time being.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.530
If people have a better solution,
we're certainly willing to hear it.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.670
Again, the community will drive this.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.230
So, we will determine which
tools we want to use.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.760
We will determine what sort of
infrastructure we want to provide.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.860
And all of that is entirely
outside of Apple's control.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:14.350
We also would like to leverage
the infrastructure in interesting

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.790
new ways as we go along.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.300
So, rather than just hosting Darwin and
OpenPlay and sort of projects like that,

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.750
we would like to look at new projects,
potentially.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:24.730
Some people have already come forward,
said, "Oh,

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.020
we're going to do this." Some people have
already started saying they would like

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.840
to have kind of a working area to port
KDE to Darwin and be able to collaborate

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.060
and have their own CVS repository,
their own mailing lists.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.140
And all of that infrastructure is
currently provided at opendarwin.org.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.130
So,
we can do that kind of thing very easily.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.940
So,
sort of a CVS map as it has existed up

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.980
to now and as it exists going forward.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.060
Right now, there's a one-way pool.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.460
You can, as a developer,
sign up for an account with

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.340
the Darwin project and have
read-only access to the bits,

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.360
basically the click-through license.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.290
If you make changes,
you can either get those changes

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.760
submitted via a web form,
or if you're a Darwin committer,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.890
which is one of the select
few that can actually write,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.290
then...

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.750
This can either go straight
back to the CVS repository

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.270
if you're a Darwin committer,
or somebody at Apple looks at the

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.000
web form submissions and commits
it for you if they deem it worthy.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.360
So now we have kind of an
interesting new piece of the puzzle.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.520
OpenDarwin.org is a completely
separate CVS repository,

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.120
as I said.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.520
And what we're basically
doing is we will pull,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.930
on an hourly basis,
copies of the Darwin CVS repository onto

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.520
OpenDarwin.org as a reference repository.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.570
That will not be the live repository.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.390
That will simply be there close
at hand for the convenience of

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.020
the committers in OpenDarwin.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.700
We'll probably also,
we haven't done this yet,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.340
but we'll probably mirror
the FreeBSD CVS repository,

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.910
NATBSD, OpenBSD,
any other reference code bases

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.090
we think might be valuable or
interesting will be available for

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.590
reference purposes on OpenDarwin.org.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.340
However,
the live OpenDarwin CVS repository,

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.450
which has started out sort of basically
being a copy of the Darwin CVS but

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.020
can now migrate or mutate in all
kinds of interesting new ways,

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.900
will be a two-way street.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.450
So the community can commit
their changes straight to it.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.370
They can pull it.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.640
They can have a lot more
control over where it goes.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.140
Some of the initiatives we've
been working on in Darwin as well

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.250
are just overall make Darwin and
Mac OS X a better Unix citizen.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.740
Make it easier to port
legacy applications.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.080
We've heard a lot of requests for
some sort of ports collection.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.020
And as one of the original authors
of the FreeBSD ports collection,

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.840
I obviously have a lot of ideas
on how that might be evolved.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.700
And maybe it's second system syndrome.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.210
Maybe it's really the
benefit of hindsight at work.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:54.800
I'm not sure.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.500
But my team is working on something
along the lines of the FreeBSD ports

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.800
collection for Darwin right now.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.540
We hope it will be a lot more
extensible and scalable in many ways.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:11.500
We're also looking constantly at
people's requests for more Unix APIs,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.770
more standard POSIX calls that
might have been missing up to

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.080
now for one reason or the other.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.440
Missing headers, libraries,
basically anything people need to be

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.340
able to port software more easily.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.620
And one thing you're going to
see in the next development.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.100
Developers CD is something
called the BSD SDK,

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.390
which includes all of the headers
and libraries for things that

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.370
people have been missing up to now,
like OpenSSL, for example.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.700
If you have a legacy
application that uses OpenSSL,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.280
you don't want to port it to CDSA.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.230
That's no problem.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.000
We've got you covered.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.950
We'll ship the full headers from
now on in the BSD SDK package.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.020
Same goes for TCL, Libcurl, Libbzip,
a whole bunch of different things

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.430
will basically go into that bucket.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.580
So when you install the developer tools,
just click on the custom.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:54.580
Okay.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:54.670
Okay.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.880
And check it off on the list,
and you'll get all that

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.320
stuff now for free.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.920
Again, this is for porting
legacy Unix applications.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.010
Obviously, there are a lot of high-level
APIs that you can and should use

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.820
if you're writing new applications.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.740
But this is all designed
to make it easier for Unix

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.560
folks to port their stuff.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.760
We are, as I said, actively working on
synchronizing with FreeBSD.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.200
We've done some major code
pull-ups from FreeBSD 4.4 recently.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.480
And this is an ongoing process.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.710
We hope to track FreeBSD with far
less latency than we have in the past.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.260
Darwin was originally
forked from FreeBSD 3.2.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.190
So as you might expect,
there was a lot of work that we

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.130
needed to do to kind of bring it
up to snuff and bring it current.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.120
But we have more bodies
on this problem now,

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.930
and we hope to be staying much more
closely in sync with FreeBSD and

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.520
other open source projects as well.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.360
And last but definitely not least,
we are definitely working on

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.250
making Darwin easier to build.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.580
And this is another goal.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.420
And this is a goal that OpenDarwin
Project will be instrumental on,

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.540
because its developers won't be
able to be very effective until

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.140
they can build the entire system,
install it on another system,

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.270
and sort of have reproducible results.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.760
So I hope that the community will
get actively involved in this and

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.810
helping us to evolve that process.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.130
Oops.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.800
Some new things that are in Darwin,
as Brett has already said.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.860
We are fully supporting the
Linux slash BSD PAM API.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.100
So if you have PAM modules
from other Unix systems,

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.900
they should port straight across.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.180
We also have a PAM module
for security frameworks,

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.620
which means there's basically one
chain of authentication by default.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.250
It would be pretty confusing
if it was a Y shape,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.480
so that's not the default behavior.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.200
But if you're an administrator and you
know what you're doing and you want

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.660
to have different PAM authenticators,
you can plug them in,

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.520
you can change the ordering,
it's all up to you.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.800
We are now a first
class Kerberos citizen.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.170
We have been working very closely with
MIT over the last year to provide a

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:56.080
world class Kerberos implementation,
a full Kerberos implementation.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.440
And we have integrated that into
security frameworks as well,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.640
so now everything from Telnet to the
login window can support Kerberos.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.520
And we've updated many,
many different pieces.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.460
As I say, there was the FreeBSD merge,
but we've also updated Apache, SendMail,

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.500
Emacs, Samba.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.580
We brought Samba into the desktop.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.220
We've brought in the product by default,
so you can do SMB sharing

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.190
from the desktop.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.630
We've brought in a bunch
of additional languages.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.900
We've brought in Python.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.420
So we're listening very closely to
what the Unix community has been

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.030
asking for and updating those things.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.080
And as I said, we're always working on
cleaning up the APIs.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:36.100
We basically want to be a really good
Unix from a perspective of portability.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.990
We've also been working pretty
closely with the X486 project.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.620
Tory Lyons, who unfortunately couldn't
be here this year,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.920
is a Darwin committer and
a X486 core team member,

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.120
or at least a prominent developer.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.380
And he has done a lot of work,
along with the rest of the X486 team,

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.220
in making sure that X486 is
well supported on Mac OS X.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.240
You can now run it on a separate display,
or you can run it rootless,

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.120
which means your X windows show
up on the same desktop as your

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.860
Mac OS X native applications.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.610
And the basic goals,
as I understand them,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.090
are to work on acceleration now.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.720
Phase one was to make it
work and make it work well,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.800
and now they want to make it work fast.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.090
And that goes for both 2D
and OpenGL 3D performance.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.620
So I'll look for some really
interesting developments there.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:29.170
And there are also people who are
working right now on better sort

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.780
of aqua-themed window managers that
make it all appear very seamless,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.520
whether it's an X application
or a 10 application.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.900
Here are some URLs you can
go to for further reference.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.900
opensource.apple.com remains the
canonical Darwin reference site.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.900
Well, actually, /darwin remains the
Darwin reference site.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.400
This is for all sorts of
open source efforts at Apple,

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.900
of which Darwin is only one.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.050
We have the opendarwin.org website now,
which again will be evolving

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.900
very rapidly because the
community is driving this now.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.900
They are checking in
changes to the web pages.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.900
It's a very, very young project.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.900
It's only been around for a week.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.530
I encourage you to check
up on it regularly because

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.900
it will be changing very,
very rapidly.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.960
Some of our sister projects, of course,
are projects that we use: FreeBSD,

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.900
Apache, Samba, and so forth.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.840
The ExxonX project is sort of the
codename for XFREAT6 on Mac OS X.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.940
You can check that out as well.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.260
Some other sessions you
might want to go to.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.130
We're having a BOF tonight at 7.30,
and so you'll be able to ask me and

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.440
lots of other Darwin folks questions.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.380
There is a feedback forum as well
where you can ask a lot of different

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.410
people questions at 3.30 on Wednesday,
and there are various

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.150
Darwin sessions sprinkled
throughout the rest of the week,

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.500
so check your schedules.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.040
Thanks.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.140
Thank you, Jordan.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.040
One year ago, we started looking for a
printing system for Darwin.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.160
The obvious answer was LPD,
but just as Darwin is the

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.910
substrate for Mac OS X,
we wanted a printing system in

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.500
Darwin that would also be the
basis for our OS X printing system.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.370
And to be kind,
LPD just wasn't going to cut it.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.930
So we started looking,
we broadened our search a little bit,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.120
and we found CUPS,
Common Unix Printing System.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.910
It's written by a company in Maryland,
Easy Software Products.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.330
Cups is available under the
GNU General Public License,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.620
so it's open source,
and so we can use it in Darwin.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.400
It's also built upon the
Internet Printing Protocol.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.430
Luckily for us,
our Mac OS X printing system

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.790
was also designed around the
Internet Printing Protocol,

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.390
so we had a nice fit there.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:55.790
Cups includes strong PostScript printer
description file format support.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.680
In fact, that's really the core of Cups.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.060
We've been using PPDs on Mac OSes
going back about 10 or 12 years.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.010
So again, a very nice fit for us.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.740
Cups includes both BSD and System 5
command line tools for printing.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.830
This was very important to us.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.240
We wanted people who were coming
to Darwin to feel very comfortable

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.460
when they started printing.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.330
So whichever flavor of
Unix you're coming from,

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.580
you'll find the commands to
print that you're used to.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.640
Cups is well documented.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.550
The Easy Software folks do an
excellent job of documenting Cups.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.960
There's a vibrant community
surrounding Cups as well.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.860
That is also really anchored
by the Easy Software folks,

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.790
but there are other parts of the open
source community that also back Cups.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.240
The KDE group is one great example,
as are some of the different

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.870
Linux distributions,
all backing Cups, all providing support,

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:43.510
all providing momentum
as it moves forward.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.860
So how can you learn more about CUPS?

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.820
Well, the obvious answer is to
go to the CUPS website.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.260
And again,
Easy Software supports this website.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.100
You'll find mailing lists and
newsgroups on that website.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.000
There are about a half dozen
documents there describing

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.350
CUPS from different vantage points,
be it user, administrator, or developer.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.390
So you can go there.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.070
But the best way to learn
CUPS is to get the CUPS book.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.830
It's written by Michael Sweet.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.580
He is the architect of CUPS.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.940
It's an excellent book.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.040
I own three of them.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.910
I have them all over the place.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.120
And the Developer Depot folks
have been kind enough to stock

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.120
them across the way for this week.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.030
There's a limited number.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.360
If you want one, I'd suggest you get one.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.890
But it really is the
best way to learn CUPS.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.090
Once you've read the source code,
read the documentation, read the book,

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.720
we'd love you to get
involved and help us out.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.510
Again, this printing system is
not only part of Darwin,

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.520
but also Mac OS X.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.760
So if you help us out with
the open source part of it,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.540
you'll see some of your changes
flowing through into Mac OS X.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.550
We can never have enough printer drivers.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.620
So if you have a printer
that's not supported,

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.020
don't complain to me anymore.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.990
You can go write your own driver.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.130
If you have expertise that we don't
have or you just really know something,

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:51.970
come help us.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.030
Kerberos support.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.750
If you understand the different
variants of Kerberos printing,

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.940
please bring it on.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:58.890
Help me out.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.750
And log viewers.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.800
CUPS is great about
logging different things,

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.460
and there's all sorts of log formats.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.480
We'll find things.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.100
three or four of them in the system.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.460
Log viewers and log filters
would be more than welcome.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.900
We're very excited about CUPS.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.660
Again,
we're excited to have CUPS in Darwin.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.660
We're excited to have CUPS in Mac OS X.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.260
We want to hear your feedback.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.760
So we have the birds
of a feather tonight.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.390
If you have opinions about CUPS,
it's a great place to bring

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.740
them and let us hear them.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.800
There's a Darwin printing
session tomorrow.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.790
Michael Sweet, again,
the architect of CUPS,

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.280
has graciously flown out here.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.650
He'll be giving that session.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.910
It's an excellent session.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.930
Please do not miss it.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.450
He's really done a great job.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360
There's a Darwin feedback forum.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.520
If you have questions about CUPS,
please bring them there.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.490
And on Thursday,
I'll be giving the Mac OS X printing

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.160
session where I'll be explaining
how we use CUPS in Mac OS X.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.070
It's not on the slide,
but there is also a feedback forum.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.060
It's the last session of the
conference on Friday afternoon.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.920
It's the graphics and
imaging feedback forum.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.850
If you have OS X printing questions,
please bring them there.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.410
So again, CUPS, it's open.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.110
Please help us push it forward.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.640
It's a great printing system,
and if you help us,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.910
we can really move it.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.060
So please help us out.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.130
David O'Rourke is now going to come out
and talk to you about Open Directory.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:11.820
Thank you.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.970
Hi, thank you all for coming today.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:22.500
My name is David O'Rourke.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.000
I'm working on Open Directory.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
This is a very exciting project for me.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.000
I went directly to Roadmap, wrong way.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:31.960
Open Directory.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.320
This is a new name today.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.440
It covers both the
client access technology,

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.120
APIs to access the
client access technology,

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.160
and server software.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.250
We feel that Open Directory combines
industry standard protocol access,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.860
and we think it's just a really,
really important technology.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.300
Much of this technology has already
shipped with Mac OS 10.0 and 10.1,

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.060
so what we are finally doing is
making that core technology that

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.300
10.0 has been based on since day one
open source to the community so that

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.870
it can be moved to other platforms,
and also just to show

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.060
people how we do it.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.300
So it's part of Darwin.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.240
It's published on the website today.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.860
You can go and download the source bases.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.230
We'd love your feedback.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.410
My team is new to the
open source community,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.160
so we're just starting to
monitor the Darwin thing,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.180
and we got questions three years ago
as to when we would open source this,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.040
and I can say, well, today's the day.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.980
So what is Open Directory?

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.720
The first thing it entails
is Open Directory access.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.850
That consists of two major binaries.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.410
The Open Directory... Mac OS 10.0
directory service process and LookUpD,

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.410
which has been part of
Darwin from day one.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.030
It includes directory server technology.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.980
We're integrating Open LDAP with
NetInfo for Jaguar,

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.750
but we also have NetInfo,
and that has always been part

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.510
of the open source technology,
so we have both an access

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.480
technology and a server technology.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.200
Apple also ships a number of integrated
tools for managing the directory.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.100
All of these tools, the desktop tools,
system preferences, users panel,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.360
all of this Mac OS 10.0 server
tools use and are based on

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.670
Open Directory technology,
so these tools can manage any data

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.790
for which Open Directory can access.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.120
I think a picture might help you
understand directory services,

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.320
which is the standard
three-layer architecture.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.100
In the blue box,
you have Mac OS X software.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.580
If you call the directory service APIs,
it will figure out which directory

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.520
system has been configured for access
and route it to the appropriate plug-in

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.080
that you see here in the red dialogs.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.780
What we've open sourced today is
NetInfo and the LDAPv2 plug-in.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.160
We will be open sourcing a
plug-in for BSD ETSI files,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.280
and there will be other plug-ins that
we'll be open sourcing in the future.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.890
If you want to hear about those plug-ins,
I encourage you to either

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.840
speak with me afterwards or,
better yet,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.420
attend my session on Thursday.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.590
That's session 813,
and we'll be going into much more

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.940
detail about this architecture.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.100
So as part of Darwin today,
I'm sorry the URL is out of date.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.950
www.apple.com.darwin will get
you to the Darwin website.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.370
Directory services consist of an
API framework and a daemon process.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.240
That's open source.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.520
LDAPv2, NetInfo, and we have a plugin
called the Search Policy,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.150
which implements how the system
goes looking for users in a

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.380
multi-node directory system.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.980
For Jaguar, we'll be open sourcing
DSAgent for LookUpD.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.360
We'll be open sourcing our
LDAPv3 ReadWrite plugin.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.270
And we'll be open sourcing our
BSD Configuration File plugin,

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:19.960
which is read-only.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.850
An opportunity for the community would
be to make that plugin read-write.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.920
Service Discovery plugins
will be open sourced as well.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:31.700
And these plugins allow you to discover
services on the network via AppleTalk,

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.820
Rendezvous, SLP,
and the SMB Windows protocol.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.160
So if you want to hear more about
the Service Discovery plugins,

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.580
I would encourage you to
attend my session on Thursday.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.970
It's not only about directory access,
it's also about what Apple's providing

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.820
as a directory server for our customers.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.260
For Mac OS 10.1,
NetInfo is included with Darwin and

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.400
included with Mac OS 10.1.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.850
Mac OS, it's part of Darwin.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.500
It provides both a standalone and
shared network configuration repository,

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.680
and many people have used this to manage
thousands of machines on their network.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.400
So NetInfo is open to the community.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.810
I believe it's already been ported
to Linux and some other platforms.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.090
We're adopting OpenLDAP for Jaguar,
so we have two open source,

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.080
very powerful directory servers that
we're shipping as part of both TIN,

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.660
the retail product, and Darwin.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.520
As a roadmap, there's the Darwin Birds of
the Feather session tonight.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.430
I would encourage you to go to the
security and authorization session.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:31.550
Jordan mentioned earlier that our
PAM module calls the security framework.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.970
Well,
the security framework turns around and

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:37.890
calls directory services in some cases
to verify the user's names and passwords.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.000
So that will give you more perspective.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.370
We're also working on how we're
tying PAM to the security framework

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.690
to directory services to allow
authentication to be out of any directory

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.310
system of the customer's choice.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.530
There's always the Darwin Feedback Forum.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.430
There's my session on
Thursday for directory services,

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.250
and following in the same exact
room is the Kerberos session.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.380
So I would encourage you
to attend that as well.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.390
At this time,
I'd like to introduce Chris LeCroy,

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.280
who will talk to you about
the Darwin Streaming Server.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.280
Thank you for your time.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.920
Hi, everybody.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.860
So I'm going to talk pretty briefly
about Darwin Streaming Server.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.970
You're going to hear me say
QuickTime Streaming Server a lot,

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.030
and the reason for that
is that Darwin Streaming

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.740
Server and QuickTime Streaming
Server are the same thing.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:25.150
Mac OS X, we call it QuickTime Streaming
Server or QTSS,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.780
so just be aware of that.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.860
So kind of a general status.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.420
We're about three years old now.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.700
We released the first version
of QuickTime Streaming

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.180
Server in April of 99,
and we just released in

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.120
February version 4 of the server,
and I'll go over some of the new

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.280
features in a minute about that.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.460
Since then, we've had over 300,000
downloads of the server.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.660
That's a lot of downloads for a server,
especially a streaming server,

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.110
which is a pretty narrow niche of people
who are doing streaming out there.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.030
We obviously are open source.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.120
That's why I'm here,
and we've made it so it's really

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.290
easy to port to other platforms.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.620
We have a couple of files that basically
provide whatever layer you need,

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:04.000
that provide kind of a layer abstraction
or an abstraction from the OS,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.980
and it's really easy to port to
anything that's POSIX compliant.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.320
It's fairly, well,
kind of a medium effort to port it to

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.340
things that are not POSIX compliant,
and we're completely standards-based.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.220
Some of the other streaming solutions
out there use proprietary protocols

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.600
and codecs and things like that.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.990
We are using RTSP, RTP, RTCP, SDP, HTTP,
MP3, and just about any other kind of

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:33.170
streaming standard you can think
of or acronym you can think of.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.510
So what's new?

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:39.960
In 4, we have... Enhanced the module API.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.960
So QuickTime streaming server contains a
module API sort of like what Apache has.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.710
You can write modules that can either
be dynamically loaded into the server

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.960
or statically linked into the server if
you want to rebuild the server itself.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.910
And this is basically where all the
functionality for the server comes from.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.960
So being able to stream
QuickTime movies was done as a module.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.960
Being able to rebroadcast live
broadcast stuff was done as a module.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.800
Being able to do access live
broadcast stuff was done as a module.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800
And then the service logging
was done as a module.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.800
So everything's done as a module.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.780
And we've enhanced the APIs as we
do in just about every release.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:18.800
I'll give you a little more detail
on what we did there in a minute.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.640
We've completely
redesigned the web admin.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:26.760
So QuickTime streaming server has
a web-based administration console.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.700
Works in any browser.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.780
And we've basically just
completely revamped it.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.680
We hired a really good engineer
who's really good at this stuff.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800
And so it works a lot better.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.800
It looks a lot better.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.790
Much easier for developers to
extend if they want to extend it.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.880
And actually,
if you want to take a look at this stuff,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.440
you can come to our session later,
which I'll tell you about in a minute,

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:47.790
too.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.800
We've added support for automated relays.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.780
So what that is is streaming
servers send streams to clients.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.070
Well, there are times when you may
need a streaming server to send

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.790
a stream to another server,
which then sends off to a client.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.800
In the past,
that was pretty complicated to set up.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.800
So we've kind of made it
so it's automatic now.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.800
Server A can announce to Server B that
it wants to relay something,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.800
and it just magically works
using standard protocols again.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.800
And we've added UI for
that in the web admin.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.640
and we've added native MP3 streaming.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:22.860
And what I mean by native
MP3 streaming is shoutcast,

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.520
icecast compatible streaming.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.100
We don't do encoding.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.490
All we do is the
reflection of the stream,

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:32.640
but we've, because we're using
standard protocols again,

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.270
you can use things like the LAME encoder
to hook into the stream if you

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.620
want to do any kind of transcoding.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.250
We have support for serving
MP3 straight off disk though,

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.480
but we're not doing any encoding.

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:48.860
We've added MPEG-4 support.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:56.060
QuickTime Streaming Server can now
serve any ISO-compliant MPEG-4 file.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:03.540
That means that in addition to being able
to send streams to QuickTime players,

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.660
you can now send to any
compliant MPEG-4 player.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:11.240
We expect this to really open things up.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.810
This is a great new standard.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.780
And as always,
we've made some performance improvements.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.880
So let me show you the performance
improvements we've done this time.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.020
So back with QTSS 1,
we were doing 1,000 streams

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.880
off a single machine.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.700
And with each release
we've increased that.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.330
We're now up to 4,000.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.840
And I think with the next release,
we'll probably be going

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.120
a little bit higher even.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.760
I think we've got a few
more tricks up our sleeves.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.440
In terms of the module API enhancements,

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.560
So you can build more powerful
and new types of modules now.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.360
And the major reason for this is
our API is really object oriented.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.350
And what I mean by that is that
there are actual objects that get

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:59.110
passed into modules and they can
call methods on those objects.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.610
Prior to QTSS 4, though,
modules could not declare and

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.950
instantiate their own objects,
objects that they owned.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.270
And they can do that now.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.240
And that makes it easier to
write much more powerful modules.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.230
We've also listened to developers
and provided some documentation

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.180
on some things that people
have been screaming for.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.700
We've documented our
reliable RTP protocol,

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.820
which the marketing term is
skip protection for that.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.300
So if anybody's writing a compliant
player or a compliant server,

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.760
that's documented now.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:33.280
We've also documented our implementation
of tunneling RTSP over HTTP.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.320
So if you want to write a
server or a player again,

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:36.360
that's documented.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:40.250
And we've also got some
caching protocol extensions.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.430
So for developers who are writing
streaming caches or proxies,

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.290
we've documented those extensions
so that they can take advantage of

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.280
some of the really good things that
those protocol extensions provide.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:55.760
So here's where I beg.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:03.560
So if you want to help us out,
we have a lot of pressure to get

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.130
new features into the release or
into the server every release.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.560
So some of the things that are
really difficult for my team to do

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.460
are some of the things that would be
nice for the open source community,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.740
like autoconf support.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.640
I would love it if somebody
would raise their hand right now.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.280
Anybody?

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.120
And volunteer for autoconf support.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.420
Also, we have great packaging
mechanism on Mac OS X.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:28.090
On the other platforms,
we basically live with

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.280
tar files and zip files.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.320
And it would be really nice if
somebody could kind of step up

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.210
and do some native packaging,
like install Shield for

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.830
Windows or RPMs for Linux.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.980
And as always,
developer documentation is always

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.120
something we could use help with.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.180
Just documenting how the
server works internally,

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.080
documenting the source code,
things like that.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.140
So that's my plea for help.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.380
Places that you can learn more
about this online are we have

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.160
a mailing list for developers.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.300
It's pretty low traffic and
it's pretty high quality.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:06.820
You can go to lists.apple.com and it's
a streaming server developers mailing

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:06.820
list that you want to subscribe to.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.920
I can always go up to the Apple open
source website to find more

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.140
information about the Darwin Streaming
Server as well as any of the

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.000
open source projects at Apple.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.070
And because the QuickTime Streaming
Server is the Darwin Streaming Server and

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:22.520
we also work very tightly with QuickTime,
the QuickTime site is also a great place

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:27.090
for getting information about some of
the things you can do with the server.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.380
And in terms of a roadmap,
so we've got a full-blown streaming

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:35.600
server session on Thursday,
and we'll have some engineers showing

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.280
how you can customize the server,
how to write a module, things like that.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.580
We'll go into the new features in a
little bit more detail as well there.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.770
There's a session on
QuickTime and MPEG-4.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.660
If you want to get a
technical overview of that,

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.950
that's Friday in Room A2.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.160
And we will have server people
at the QuickTime feedback forum,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.400
so if you want to provide
any feedback there,

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.460
we'd be happy.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.200
We'd love to hear it.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.200
I think that's it.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.250
So next is Ed Peterlin.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.000
He's going to talk about open office.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.400
Thank you.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.200
Hi, my name is Edward Peterlin.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.700
I'm a contributor from the
openoffice.org community.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:17.490
I specifically work on
the OS X porting effort.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.370
Well, first question that we usually get,
what is OpenOffice.org?

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:25.180
OpenOffice.org is an open source
project for technology within Sun's

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.660
Star Office productivity suite.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:30.700
A while ago, Sun open sourced the source
code for Star Office and

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.780
released it for our community,
and we've been working on porting efforts

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.620
ever since to support new platforms.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.940
We're supporting Linux PowerPC and x86,
Solaris and Windows.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.060
Mac OS X developer
build is now available.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.120
It's a great time for us.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.040
We've had 1.0 released
on our major platforms,

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.080
x86, Flourish Windows, and now OS X.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.460
And it supports Darwin as well.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.400
Several more ports are under development.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:07.260
FreeBSD, RX264, Amiga, talks of AIX,
HPUX, and there's over 21 languages

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.690
that it can run native in.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.900
On the OS X team, we kind of developed a
porting roadmap here.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.440
Our first stage was to
build and link on Mac OS X.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.230
There were lots of technical issues
that really held us up since April 2001

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.860
when we've been working on this.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.860
Next, we need to get up to the
OpenOffice 1.0.org source.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.720
We're just so far behind,
we need to catch up.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.660
After that, we need to start getting it
to work with the Aqua graphics

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.460
layer and core foundation.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.300
GCC3 is released.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.900
We need to get this
working for new compilers.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.000
We need printing support.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.280
Installation help.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.290
And after all of this is done,
then we need beta testers, end users,

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:46.880
and release 1.0 testing.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.310
So, I'm here to make a plea to
get developers to help us.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.130
We've only had less than 10
people ever work on this port.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.240
And right now,
there are only three active coders.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.350
So, it's been a long time and
we need everyone we can get.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.830
But the cool thing is, you know what?

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.590
It built.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.190
It's ready for a demo.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.660
OpenOffice.org consists
of a number of files.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.860
It's an open source productivity
suite that has a major

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.380
word processing component,
very similar to MS Word.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:22.640
You can type.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.040
We can even check spelling in runtime.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.090
We have dictionaries, and it works.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:33.240
In addition to word processing,
there's also a full

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.580
spreadsheet implementation.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.920
The spreadsheet is very similar.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.700
You can use similar formulas from Excel.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.760
We can enter.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.480
We can come down.

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:49.440
Make sums, insert ranges, add numbers.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.630
We even have some basic macro support
coming from opening cell files.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:59.210
In addition to all of this, there's also

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:02.750
Our word processing component,
which I brought back up by mistake,

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.120
but you'll get to see it again.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.790
We also have a drawing component.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:09.940
Drawing component, again,
we have basic support for two-dimensional

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.680
and three-dimensional objects.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:26.070
And we can also come around,
rotate these objects.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:26.070
We need people to help us
move this to work with OpenGL.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:26.070
And...

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.880
What I just did there,
ask it to insert an

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.540
openoffice.org calc spreadsheet.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.210
See if it'll do it for me.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:36.130
There we go.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.590
And here, two, three, four.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.410
and David O'Rourke.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:57.630
What you're seeing here is
our first developer build.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:02.110
We made this available this
morning from our website.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:02.110
And that's it for our demo.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.330
So let's figure out, how can you help us?

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:10.150
We just got it building.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.590
This is one and a half weeks old.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.420
This is such an exciting time for
OpenOffice.org in our community.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.660
You can go visit
http://porting.openoffice.org.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.630
This is our main porting website.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:24.270
From there you can find links
to all the Mac porting websites.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:28.590
And what's even cooler,
we've had some friends over the weekend

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.180
have some little CD burning bashes.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.380
You can get a couple of six packs and
burn developer CDs that we have at our

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.180
exhibitors booth in the exhibit hall.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.940
With full binary installers,
double clickable so you

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.140
can play with it now.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.380
Full source code from our CVS branch.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.480
Build instructions so you
can work on it tonight.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.920
We need Mac OS X developers.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.040
We need help getting Aqua working.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.080
We're going to support X11 and
Aqua so we can run on OS X and Darwin.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.820
We're going to continue this support.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.300
We need people to help with printing.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.440
We need people to help
with internationalization.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.650
Unicode, font support, everything.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.850
There's so many different areas
of this project you can work on.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.300
Non-developers, you can help too,
even if you don't have

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.460
time to contribute.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.020
We're going to need testers.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.240
We need documentation for the
OS X specific portions of this.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.860
We need web and graphics design.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:20.430
We need people to make screenshots,
make it look nice for end users.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.910
Usability testing.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:25.320
What the Mac OS X users
need out of this product.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.950
And also local language.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.900
It's an exciting time and
I invite you to come help us.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:37.090
And now here's Lane who's
going to talk about Open Play.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.580
and I'm here to talk to you
about OpenPlay and give you a

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.500
brief description of where we
are with the open source effort.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.500
And let's see.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:44:59.920
All right.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.430
Wait a minute.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.560
I did the same thing.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:27.280
You would come up to bite me,
wouldn't you?

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:36.280
Alright, so, OpenPlay started out as open
source a couple years back,

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.680
and one of the latest things
that we've done is we have

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:39.680
integrated NetSprocket into it,
and it's still going to fight me.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:48.130
What this means is that
NetSprocket's API now is integrated

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.190
into the OpenPlay effort.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:55.600
This gives NetSprocket the ability to
run on every platform that OpenPlay does.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.980
The old NetSprocket source
is still available on the

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.730
website if anybody wants it,
but all the future development is

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:07.010
happening with the OpenPlay source.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:12.140
Okay, the OpenPlay is a networking API.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:16.900
It's designed to be
protocol and OS independent.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:21.600
That means that it currently
runs under Mac OS X,

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.700
Mac OS, Windows,
and as of a few days ago,

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.660
Linux and some various Unix.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.580
Yes, we had somebody do a POSIX version.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:39.910
So, it also has, of course,
TCP IP as a module and Apple Talk,

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:43.380
although Apple Talk is only
for the classic Mac OS.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.840
And if somebody wanted
to take the time to make

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.460
Apple Talk work on other platforms,
that would be wonderful.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:58.240
So, OpenPlay consists of three
different API layers.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:02.000
There's a game interface,
which is the easiest to use.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.370
It just takes a couple minutes
to get something up and running.

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.920
That is the old NetSprocket API.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:13.350
There's the protocol interface,
which is basically a good wrapper

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.880
around the low-level APIs.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.640
This is the old OpenPlay interface.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.820
And then there's the
networking interface,

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:28.940
and these are the net module
wrappers around TCP/IP and AppleTalk.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.870
And that's what gives you
your protocol independence.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.100
It basically looks like
this to your application.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.520
There's the three layers.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.970
They all sit within OpenPlay.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.160
NetSprocket uses the protocol module.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.030
The protocol uses the net module.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.040
And then your application can use
any one or all three of those,

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.960
as well as the underlying
raw protocol APIs.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:03.240
With the new 2.1 release that
was just put up yesterday,

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.940
there are two new test and sample apps.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:12.210
The first is the NetSprocket stress test,
which exists for Mac OS,

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.470
and that has given us a lot of
good feedback in making NetSprocket

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.700
very bulletproof and able to handle
really good networking loads.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:24.420
It also helped us track down a few bugs.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:28.240
The really cool thing is
the new NetSprocket example.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.780
This is a really nice addition
to the open source archive.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.960
Previously,
there was a lot of example applications

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.210
and some testing applications,
but nothing that really

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.280
showed you how to use the API.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.100
This example does just that.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:48.210
It separates it all out into one file.

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.140
It's a full game with a client, a server.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.700
Players can come in and out.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:57.930
And you can take that code,
strip out the one file that contains

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:02.440
the NetSprocket or the OpenPlay protocol
API that you want to use,

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.760
put it into your application,
do a little bit of modifying,

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.860
and you're done.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.410
At least that's the goal.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:17.600
We also have a lot of titles that are
shipping now that are actually using

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.120
OpenPlay or the older NetSprockets APIs.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.220
This is a list of some of them.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.790
There's a lot more and several that are,
of course, in development.

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:33.940
So, now I'll give you a quick
demo of this test application.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:37.850
Let's see if we can't...

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.400
So it's very graphically intense.

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:53.060
This poor machine is going to be
very hard to keep up with all this.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.340
So we're going to start a server.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.910
We're going to run it
on the default port.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:02.970
We're going to allow the
default number of players,

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:02.970
the default name.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:18.900
[Transcript missing]

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.850
So it connects to it.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.730
You can answer the questions.

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.520
It tells the other client
whether it's working or not.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:49.200

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.320
That's basically the quick demo.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.760
That little program there is the
example program that is now provided.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.160
It gives you a really good idea of
how to handle players coming in,

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.370
players going out, hosting games,
connecting to games,

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.700
and all that good stuff that you need.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.810
And that's the end of the demo.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:20.580
simple roadmap for this one there is an
actual open play session Thursday two

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:26.520
o'clock it's in room C and I will
be giving a lot of code examples in

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:31.300
there going over that example app
that I just showed step-by-step about

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:39.050
how you connect how you start up a
server and all that good stuff and

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:46.990
now we'll have somebody else come
back on stage and wrap it up Thanks,

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.780
man.

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:57.540
Thanks again, Lane.

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.600
All right.

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:02.690
Open source.

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:20.300

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.540
If you've been watching
us over the past couple,

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.000
three years, you should see a real trend.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.280
We're just constantly
increasing our involvement in

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.660
the open source activities.

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:32.950
You see more projects,
you see more committers,

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.150
more opportunities for
you to get involved.

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.680
We certainly, you know,
hopefully you see a trend here.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.720
This is something we
take pretty seriously.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.190
There's a number of conferences that
if you're in the open source community

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:48.240
at large and you're interested
in participating or seeing more,

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:52.230
we're going to be at USNICS this June,
MacHack, of course,

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:57.220
which is always lots of fun, the O'Reilly
Open Source Conference in July,

00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.350
and if we can get Steve to
allow us to fly over there,

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.820
we're going to sneak a trip
over to BSDCon in Europe.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:08.450
So, you know, certainly there's a lot
of other conferences we're

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:10.540
trying to get involved in.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.180
The benefit of these other
forums is actually to get

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.950
more and more people involved.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.460
The BSD community and some of
the open source developers.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.760
The more they learn about TEN,
the more excited they get and the

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.340
more they want to participate as well.
