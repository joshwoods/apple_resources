00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.290
Good morning.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.290
Welcome to Worldwide
Developer Conference,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.810
day three.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.440
Everybody having a good time?

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.860
Pretty good conference so far?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.130
Great.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.920
Well,
I'm really glad to see this 800-person

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.570
room is at least half occupied.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.520
We were wondering how much interest we'd
have in wireless directions this morning,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.490
and it looks pretty great.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.360
So we have a lot to cover today.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.610
I'm going to get right into it.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.150
I'm the first name you see up there,
Dave Russell,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.460
Director of Product Marketing for
Wireless Products at Apple.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.680
During this presentation I'm
going to talk about wireless

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.520
directions at a pretty high level,
where Apple's going,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.780
and actually share some
real content with you.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.240
Later on in the presentation I'm
going to bring up Paul Rekieta,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.980
Networking Engineering Manager at Apple.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.640
He'll talk about some new
features of AirPorT in Jaguar,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.810
and then later on in the
presentation Tom Weyer from the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.990
Worldwide Developer Conference,
who's an evangelist for

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.560
networking products,
is going to come up and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.480
talk about Bluetooth,
new features in Bluetooth as well.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.160
So the agenda today is
Apple's strategy for 802.11.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.040
Our implementation of that is AirPort,
and also Bluetooth.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.200
As you know, we released a technology
preview a couple of months ago.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.270
We're going to release
another one later on today.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.780
We'll talk more about that later.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.160
I want to tell you about where
we're going in terms of 802.11,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.000
how we're going to evolve AirPort,
what the considerations are there.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Paul Rekieta is going to talk about
new AirPort features in Jaguar,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.560
and Tom's going to talk about
Bluetooth technology preview,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.880
too.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.000
A lot of content in that.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.880
First thing I want to talk
about is technology leadership.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.100
We decided in about the late
1990s to build Ethernet into

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.460
every Macintosh that we build.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.980
It's taken the rest of the computer
industry until just recently to build

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.210
in Ethernet into almost every machine,
and you can still find notebooks out

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.940
there without Ethernet built into it.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.020
So we established in the late
90s that Ethernet was going to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.540
be our wireless LAN strategy
and build it into everything,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.200
okay?

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.370
We followed that up in 1998 with
the introduction of the iMac,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.200
ditching legacy I/O and implementing USB.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.530
And from then on,
every Macintosh had a built-in USB port,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.500
at least one.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.080
And that became our new technology
for wired peripherals and human

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.300
input devices on the desktop.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.640
You know, we think about where would
USB be if we hadn't done that?

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.300
Probably laying fallow in the industry
in a chicken-and-egg situation.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.000
Here's this wonderful technology,
but nobody wants to implement it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.180
The devices are too expensive
because there aren't enough of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.670
them and there aren't enough
computers to attach them to,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.120
etc.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.200
We just bagged all that, basically,
and just built it into every machine.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.540
And today,
we really can't imagine what the world

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.600
would be like without USB peripherals.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.240
We intend to do that with
every technology that you

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.850
see on the slides behind me.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.650
We followed up that USB leadership
in 1999 when we introduced

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.400
the iBook and AirPort,
wireless networking

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.200
technology for mobile devices.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.100
We built into the machines antennas
built into all of our machines,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.100
AirPorT software built into every
single machine that we ship.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.070
And that became our wireless
networking strategy.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.530
A couple of months ago,
we introduced Bluetooth as a technology

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.080
preview at Macworld Tokyo back in March.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.100
And we intend to do the
same thing for Bluetooth,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.360
hardware devices as well as software
support built into our OS that

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.100
we've done with every other one
of the technologies that you see.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.100
Granted,
we're still in our infancy stage.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.000
Granted, there will be some problems.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.540
Granted,
we'll probably end up debugging the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.130
world's Bluetooth devices out there,
just like we ended up doing

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.000
with USB devices back in 1998.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But we think the future is,
in terms of wireless peripherals,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
is Bluetooth.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.870
And we're going there.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.680
So what does that mean?

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.140
We think AirPort is wireless Ethernet,
and we think Bluetooth is

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.580
wireless peripherals.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.380
Now, a lot of people think Bluetooth is
wireless networking also,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.490
and we don't really position it that way.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.690
That'll become very clear
during this presentation.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.240
Let's talk a little bit about
why we don't see it that way.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.180
If you look at the slides up above,
you look at the speed of 802.11b,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.220
which is a specification that
we use to build AirPort with.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.760
11 megabit per second maximum
theoretical data rate in 802.11b in the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.720
AirPort products that we offer today.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.460
Bluetooth offers theoretical maximum
data rate of 1 megabit per second.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.190
So in terms of scaling,
one is really good for networking and one

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.400
is really good for moving small amounts
of data over short distances also.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.100
If you look at the
coverage radius of the two,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.720
maximum data rate of AirPort can
be served out to about 150 feet.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.330
You know, Bluetooth really stretches
itself to provide any kind of

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.420
data rate out to 30 feet or so.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.680
It's really good at much,
much shorter ranges than that.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.870
Something that'll be interesting later
on in this presentation is the fact that

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.320
they both operate at the same frequency,
2.4 gigahertz, okay?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.910
And also the number of
devices that both can support.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.800
We support up to 50 users off
one single AirPort base station.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.850
Bluetooth technology allows seven
slave devices to be wirelessly

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.980
connected to one master device.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.900
The signal power is very different
between the two of them and

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.240
that's why the range varies
so much between the two as well.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.900
So you look at those considerations and
it really tells you that the purpose that

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.900
we think of 802.11b should be wireless
LAN and the purpose that we think,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.710
where we want to take our products,
of Bluetooth should be

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.980
wireless peripherals.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.200
And that's the direction we'd like
to point the developers in as well.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.300
Okay.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.280
A question I get asked
a lot is do 802.11b and

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.190
Bluetooth interfere with one another?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.920
Well, absolutely.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.800
You know?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.200
So do garage door openers,
so do cordless phones that are on

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.940
the market because they all operate
in the 2.4 gigahertz frequency band.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.150
So there is some interference.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.060
But because Bluetooth and AirPort
have a different modulation method,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.600
those interferences are random and
infrequent and basically what happens is

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.570
packets that are lost in interference,
collisions between Bluetooth and

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.720
802.11b are dropped temporarily and
then sent at the next opportunity

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.170
when Bluetooth basically hops out of
the particular channel that AirPort

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.780
is communicating in and retransmits.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.320
That's kind of a mouthful.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.940
An animation would really help here.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.040
Maybe I have one.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.670
So let me set this slide up real quickly.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.190
The 2.4 gigahertz frequency
band is divided up into several

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.350
channels that AirPort uses.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.870
The 2.4 gigahertz frequency
band is divided up into several

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.000
channels that AirPort uses.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.470
channels that airport can communicate
on individually and bluetooth

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.000
actually frequency hops in that two
point four gigahertz frequency band.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.820
Bluetooth actually divides that
band up into seventy-nine channels

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.550
that are one megahertz wide.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.020
And it hops in between randomly,
not just in a linear

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.830
back and forth sequence,
but randomly in each one of

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.540
those subchannels basically,
about sixteen hundred times per second.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.210
So what does that look like when a
packet from a bluetooth telephone

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.900
is communicating with a notebook,
say a power book or an iBook,

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.830
and that power book or iBook
is also communicating on a

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.580
wireless LAN with airport?

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.160
Well, this animation should make
it clearer than my words can.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.400
So you see packets starting,
airport and power book

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.010
communicating with one another,
and the bluetooth phone,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.060
let's say it's doing access
to a WAN to do email.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.130
Packets moving back and forth.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.940
Here's a packet now that is colliding.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.100
That same packet then is dropped
and then picked up and retransmitted

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.410
at the next opportunity.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.110
I'll let this loop for a
minute because it's kind of

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.290
hard to catch the first time.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.910
So yes,
you do see some occasional interference.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.240
Our own testing indicates
that from a user level,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.060
you don't really notice a slowdown
in throughput when those packets

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.310
are dropped and then retransmitted.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.920
Let's just focus specifically
on AirPorT for a little while.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.840
What I really want to talk to
you about is 802.11 directions,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.540
where we're going to
take this technology.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:23.030
You've probably all heard about 802.11b,
which is what we build in AirPort.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.940
You've also heard about a competing
standard that have products on

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.800
the market today called 802.11a,
which seems to be the best thing

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.820
in the world in the sense that
it offers much higher data rate,

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.190
higher bandwidth,
potentially could support more users.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.980
I don't think the world's
quite that simple,

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.510
though.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.280
Let's look a little bit at the pros
and cons of 802.11a and 802.11b.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.440
Granted, a does offer a much
higher data rate than b,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.650
and that's a good thing.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.250
That's a great thing,
as a matter of fact.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.220
In terms of range, b,
at a lower data rate,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.970
offers a much greater range
than 802.11a can support.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.370
And actually, as you look at a plot of
a's data rate over distance,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.130
it drops up very, very, very,
very dramatically at a short distance.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.870
So at longer distances,
out in the thresholds of

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.890
where 802.11b can communicate,
b actually offers a higher

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.530
throughput than a does.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.360
In terms of power,
because a operates at a higher frequency

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.920
and a different modulation method,
it uses a lot more power than b.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.620
This is not a good thing for notebooks.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.200
And notebooks is one of the critical
applications for wireless networking.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.340
Notebooks run on battery power.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.380
Trying to give as much battery life into
a notebook like a PowerBook or an iBook,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.810
something we really pride
ourselves on in Apple,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.690
is important.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.250
So we're not really interested in
things that really wreck our battery

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.120
life that we've worked so hard for.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.300
We've worked so hard in the
OS and in the hardware to deliver.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.020
In terms of availability,
both products are on the market today.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.220
Base stations and cards that support
a or b are on the market today.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.360
So, there's a competing standard
that's coming on the market,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.600
probably towards the end of the year,
as the IEEE ratifies the specification.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.340
And that's 802.11g.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.080
If we go through this chart,
we can look at some of the

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.810
defining features of A,
B, and G.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.960
A, as I said,
11 megabit per second maximum

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.980
theoretical raw data rate.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.860
A serves up at 54 megabits per second.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.330
And G, the same 54 megabits
per second that A does.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.250
If you look at the coverage, though,
it's a fairly sophisticated

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.060
piece of slideware here.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:35.700
B has a maximum range at its maximum
theoretical data rate of 150 feet,

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.880
whereas A drops off very
precipitously at about 38 feet,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.220
and 802.11g pulls that
range out to about 59 feet.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.460
That's kind of a simplistic
way of looking at it,

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.500
just in a linear fashion of how far
away can you get from a base station

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.760
and still get the maximum theoretical
data rate of 15 megabits per second.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.700
So that's one of these technologies.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.480
Probably more importantly is to think
about it in a two-dimensional form,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.120
and that is to look at the area
coverage in terms of square feet,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:02.700
okay?

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.000
Pi r squared.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.300
So 71,000 square feet for 802.11b,
4,500 square feet for A,

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.720
11,000 square feet for G.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.640
But in a perfect world,
these base stations are

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.000
providing a spherical coverage,
a three-dimensional coverage.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.030
So basically...
Basically a cubic coverage,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.630
if you will.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.090
Four-thirds pi r cubed is the
formula for looking at that.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.410
So what do you get?

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.300
You know, 41 million,
actually that's a typo,

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.200
it should be 14 million cubic feet,
just a little quick math,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.620
14 million cubic feet of 802.11b,
230,000 roughly cubic feet for A,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.980
and over 800,000 cubic feet for 802.11g.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.010
So why is that important?

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.170
Because customers who are
trying to deploy base stations

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.540
want to use as few of those as
possible so that they don't have,

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.300
you know, expense issues,
wiring issues to those base stations,

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.810
etc.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.180
So the ability to deploy fewer
base stations is important,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.670
and we think G offers higher data
rate and the ability to offer or

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.660
to deploy fewer base stations.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.560
We feel that's very
important for our customers.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.140
Stepping down on the chart,
looking at frequency,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:20.310
you can see that both G and B operate
in the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum,

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.820
and A operates at 5 gigahertz.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.610
Fundamentally, therefore,
A and B and G will not be

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.020
compatible with one another.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.420
A and G, on the other hand,
have the opportunity to

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.620
be compatible because they
operate in the same frequency.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:42.880
And if you look at the modulation method,
B uses direct sequence spread spectrum,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.640
quite a mouthful,
and also at lower data rates,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.540
802.11g operates that same
kind of radio as B does,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.500
and therefore those two
can become compatible.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.500
We think that's extremely important.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.480
So how does all this thing plot out?

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:07.330
What you see on the slide here is a plot
of 802.11b's data rate over distance.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.770
And I have three slides showing
each one of these technologies.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.340
The slides are normalized
for the same x-y axis.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.980
So here's B trucking along at
about 11 megabit per second,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.930
getting out to about 50 meters or so,
and its data rate steps down

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.470
to about 5 megabits per second,
then down to 2,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.560
and then down to 1 at long distances.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.530
So it offers really nice range.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.800
The same x-y axis plotted
for A looks like this.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.430
So you can see that A's maximum data
rate drops off very precipitously,

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.880
and it actually offers
fairly short range.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.120
Where we think the future is,
is this is the plot for G.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.190
You see the dotted line towards the left?

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.980
That's the end of G.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.060
That's when it becomes a B radio
and begins to offer the same long

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.310
range at a lower data rate as B.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:57.110
But it also offers 54 megabits per second
at a much greater distance than A does.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.100
Here's all three of
those plots put together.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.370
So the orange is A,
products on the market today

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.520
that offer high bandwidth.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.610
And then the yellow,
this looks yellow to me, is B,

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.920
the technology that we have today.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.180
And green is 802.11b.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.240
Products that we expect to see on the
market towards the end of the year.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.020
And that's what Apple thinks
is worth waiting for.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.600
We think 802.11g preserves the investment
in airport base stations today,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.190
offers the low power, the high bandwidth,
and the long range.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.690
So that's where we're going.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.000
I don't have any specific
products to announce today,

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.590
but long term,
our commitment is to 802.11g and

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.650
B base stations and B cards will
fit into networks that offer 802.11g

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.200
data rates and range as well.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.520
So that's where we're going with airport.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.720
Next, I'd like to bring up Paul Rekieta.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.710
He's going to talk about new
AirPorT features that you may have

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.320
already discovered in the Jaguar release
that you got earlier in the week.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.640
If you haven't had time to look at them,
Paul will take you through them.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.420
At the very end of this,
we'll have a Q&A,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.500
and you can ask any questions on
any of these technologies as well.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.600
So, Paul, I'll leave the stage to you.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.140
There you go, your clicker.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:10.140
Thank you very much.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:13.730
Thanks, Dave.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.450
I just wanted to talk a little
bit about what we're doing,

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.800
AirPort and Jaguar.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.550
As you know,
we've done several hardware and

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.900
software releases over the past year,
and we never rest.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.910
We keep going,
so there's plenty more to do.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.530
First is the AirPort base station.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.110
As you know,
the AirPort base station does NAT.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.330
NAT's going to be with us for a
long time until people move to IPv6.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.260
So what's important to us is to make
sure that the NAT that's in the base

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.820
station works as well as it can.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.980
And to that end,
we're spending a lot of time

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.320
working on various gateway
software to work through the NAT.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.380
What customers have been asking
for a lot is PPTP and IPsec,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.300
and both of those we'll be delivering.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.530
And what that does is allow several
popular Windows VPN clients to work

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.310
through the AirPort base station.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.330
As we work on the base station,
we always take opportunities to improve

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.340
features and fix problems that we see.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.520
And one of those is kind of
an embarrassing problem that

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.220
we had with port mapping,
and so we've got that working right now.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.980
I've got Traceroute working
through the base station.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.630
One of the big advantages of the new
software that we're doing will be

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.900
that it registers with multicast DNS.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.270
And that's what Steve called rendezvous
the other day when he put up this slide.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.250
I was thinking, what is rendezvous?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.380
But I realized that
that is multicast DNS.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.840
So that, together with zero
configuration networking,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.960
will allow for simpler
access to the base station,

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.100
allow for our tools to find it more
often than it sometimes does today,

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.000
and maybe opportunities for
third-party development management

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.920
applications to also get in there
and discover the base stations.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.670
A big new feature for this
release will be PPP dial-in.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:03.020
So what that does is allow you to
dial into your own base station,

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.240
have access to your home network,
and access to your

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.060
ISP through that base station.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:13.060
So that's typically useful for, you know,
if you have cable motor or you have DSL,

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.400
oftentimes you don't have dial-up access.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.900
So if you're out on the road or
if you're staying in a hotel,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.190
rather than trying to figure out how
I can get a free AOL client account long

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:27.930
enough to check my mail or get access
to Earthlink or something like that,

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.390
this way you can just dial
up your home phone number,

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.450
dial into your network,
and do everything that you want to do.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.240
The other part is
disabling the SNMP access.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.130
Earlier this year,
there was a search advisory that came out

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.180
that talked about some SNMP weaknesses.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.050
We did test the base station
against those weaknesses,

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.380
and we didn't discover
any vulnerabilities,

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.000
but several customers are
still concerned about it,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.200
so we just have a simple checkbox to just
completely disable SNMP on the WAN side.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.220
Finally, DHCP message text.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.780
This is something that we
support currently today in OS 9,

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.500
and I hope the OS X networking
guys are going to do it for OS X.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.800
Basically,
what this does is allow you to program

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.420
a welcome message into the base station.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.890
As you acquire a DHCP lease,
you'll get a little notification

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.580
up on your screen saying,
Welcome to my base station.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.340
Welcome to Starbucks.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:27.650
Welcome to Hilton Hotels or wherever
happens to have this base station.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.140
This is kind of just some of the
high-level things that we're doing

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:37.460
at the base station level to just
continue to advance that technology.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.820
There's just a couple
slides of how we do it.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:50.150
This is showing the checkbox that
just controls whether you can

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.040
access SNP over the WAN port,
so it's just a simple checkbox.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.460
We're looking at some other things
in terms of adding access control

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.450
lists and different kinds of
password mechanisms so that you can

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.400
conditionally allow some people access,
but for now we just

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.860
decided to do it this way.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.980
Don't want to hear any jokes
about whether or not-- how much

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.340
information we expose over SMP,
but if you don't want to see anything,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.440
you're just completely turned off.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.130
And then this is just kind of the current
model for configuring the PPP dial-in.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.240
So, again,
you just set it up with a username,

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.630
password,
and some information about when you

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.990
want the base station to answer,
and if you want to leave it--

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.090
Kick people off sooner rather than later.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.900
I just want to make a word about
what is on the seed CD that you got.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.450
Some of the software is there,
and it's kind of in a pre-release state.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.800
This particular feature
I don't think works very well.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.440
So I would just say that if you were
going to install this on your...

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.100
If you want to install
this on your base station,

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.810
you're not going to get the full
things that we talked about today.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.580
Do it and play around with it,
but just be prepared to step back.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.210
In terms of the features
that are there today,

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.370
the software that's on the
seed will continue to work,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.270
so you can play around with it.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.100
Right now,
this is just experimental stuff.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.030
The next thing I want to talk
about is just kind of what

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.110
we're doing on the client side.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.970
The client side that we have,
I think we do a pretty good job

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:28.360
of offering easy-to-use features,
a lot of power and

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.670
flexibility for the user,
but we get a lot of comments

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.920
and questions and requests
for different things,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.610
so what we're trying to do with this
Jaguar release is just continue to

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:43.210
improve the preferences UI that we have,
mainly just to...

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:49.450
and other companies have made a
significant contribution to the industry.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.220
In the last two years,
Apple has been the leading provider

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.490
of wireless computers to consumers,
which is a major advantage.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.470
administrators,
especially school administrators,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.500
don't want that to happen.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.500
What we've done is provide an
option that's available to system

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.100
10 administrators to prevent
those IBSSs from being created.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.890
Unfortunately, there's nothing we can
do at the standard level,

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.320
at this kind of level.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.790
It would be nice in
keynotes to be able to say,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.450
don't allow any IBSS networks anywhere,
but we can't do that.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.710
At least at the UI level,
at the computer level,

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:45.120
at the workstation level,
we can stop that.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.390
The other part, and again what we say
here is multicast DNS,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.980
but that's the rendezvous technology.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.800
So our airport admin utility
will use that to discover

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.390
and manage base stations.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.970
The setup assistant,
we introduced AOL support in

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.490
the last software release,
but it was kind of a two-step process.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.390
So you had to go in,
set up your base station to use AOL,

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.000
and then come back to AOL client and do
some setup there to actually use AirPort.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.600
So what we've done for this release
is kind of combine that together

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.120
so that now the setup assistant
will also go out and automatically

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.380
configure the AOL client for you.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.060
So these are some of the preferences,
and again,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.400
another comment about the Seed CD,
these preferences are all disabled.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.840
So you won't see it looking like that.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.600
You'll see this panel,
but they'll all be disabled.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.490
There's nothing wrong with your
computer when you see that,

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.130
it's just that we don't have the
feature turned on for this Seed release.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.080
So I want to talk a little bit about how
this differs from what we have today.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.080
What we have today,
I don't know if people really realize it,

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.330
is kind of we just have this middle
option that remembers the most recent

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.180
networks that you've been a part of.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.910
So what it tends to do is it
tends to just work all the time.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.060
So if you go home and
you join your network,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.540
once you've kind of primed the pump,
more or less,

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.190
it just kind of always works.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.690
So you go home and
join your home network.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.450
You go to school and
join your school network,

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.260
and you go to work and
join your work network.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.770
We remember those recent networks.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.870
Then every time the system starts up,
every time it wakes from sleep,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.930
it kind of works back
through that list and says,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.780
oh, am I at home?

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.100
If I am, I just joined the network.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.700
If I'm not at home, then I say, well,
is it at the school network?

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.400
So if it's there,
it just joins that school network.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.650
So I think that's a really
kind of powerful feature,

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.340
and I think it was a
big thing that we did.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.700
I can't remember which software release,
a couple of releases ago.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.080
But it just mainly means that
every time you wake from sleep,

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.150
every time you start up,
things just work,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.230
and you just get associated with
a network that you think you

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.400
should be associated with without
really having to do anything.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.010
So we want to keep that feature,
but at the same time, people have, again,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.120
made some requests that
we change a few things.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.460
One is when we remember those networks,
we also remember the WebKey.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.390
So people are concerned at schools or,
again,

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:05.460
in kind of shared computer locations
that if you join a network with a WebKey,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.290
that computer goes to sleep,
somebody else walks up to it,

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.040
wake it back up,
then you're back on that same network.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.480
So, again, this is an administrator-level
option that just says we're not

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.160
going to remember the password.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.190
So, yeah.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.740
We're trying to actually kind
of figure out if we're going to

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.570
prompt you for those passwords,
which we will if we

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.610
can find the networks.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.360
Otherwise, you'll just have to manually
reassociate with them.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.020
But again,
this is kind of a security feature,

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.960
and so you don't reassociate with
networks that you don't want to.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.360
There's been a lot of
confusion over that behavior,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.300
which has kind of always
been hidden under the covers,

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.880
compared to the other option up there,
which is to join a specific network.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.800
In the shipping 10.1.4 kind
of things we have today,

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.580
we have this option that lets
you join a specific network,

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.100
but it really only works when you
first start off the computer or

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.390
when you switch computer locations.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.260
So the intent there when we first
did it was that you would have a

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.380
location for home and a location
for work and a location for school,

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.260
and each of those would have a network
and a password associated with it,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.450
and you switch locations and then
you would join the right network.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.440
That's just kind of awkward.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.500
Nobody really wants to set up
a whole bunch of locations,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.200
and nobody wants to really
switch between locations.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.360
So that's when we introduced
this other feature.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.300
But again,
in shared environments or in school

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.670
environments or lab situations,
you want to join a network,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.210
and you want to join only that
network and not do anything else.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.260
So that's kind of what
this last option is for.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.250
For shared computer environments,
it says, "I just want to join the

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.690
English department network.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.980
I just want to join the
computer lab network,

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.350
and I don't want to do anything else."

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.890
And finally,
then we have these other kind

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.720
of situations where you're on
the road and you want to open

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.120
up your computer at Starbucks.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.940
You want to open up your
computer in the hotel lobby.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.770
You know, open up your computer out here
in this lobby and just get on the

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.500
network and you don't care what it is.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.290
And that's what the top radio button is,
which is just join whatever

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.700
network you can join.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:04.420
And again, these in this release will be
kind of also location-based.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.590
So you would typically choose
one of these options based

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:07.640
on what you want to do.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:12.040
If you want to have, you know,
a travel location where you select

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.430
this best network kind of option,
that would provide that

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:15.840
opportunity for you.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.590
And you'll see this
checkbox at the bottom,

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.790
which is where we disable the
ability to create IBSS networks.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.180
And again,
that's just a local administrator option.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.420
It just happens on the local computer.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.810
And with that, just a couple more things
before I turn it over to Tom.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.500
I think I talked about the seed CDs.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.200
Just to kind of reinforce
what Dave was saying,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.940
that we're continually looking
at standards that are coming out.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:52.050
We have representation at the various
IEEE committee meetings where we

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.320
discuss things like B and A and
G and the different kind of security

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.900
standards and different new forms
of WEP and new forms of encryption.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.770
So we're very active in those groups,
and we're not standing on the

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.650
sidelines waiting for things to happen.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.680
We're there participating
in those discussions.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.790
And we're also listening
to our customers and...

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.100
providing features that those
customers are asking for,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.440
specialized features for education,
and a few other things that

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.220
I couldn't talk about here today,
but we hope that you'll be pleasantly

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.980
surprised when the Jaguar CD comes out.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.980
So with that, I'll turn it back over to
Tom to talk about Bluetooth.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:47.000
Now you know why I didn't go through
college on an athletic scholarship.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.120
I'm going to talk for a
little while about Bluetooth.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.140
Dave's done a pretty good job of already
positioning the technology at Apple,

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.430
and how we view Bluetooth and AirPort as
being rather complementary technologies.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.890
So let me quickly summarize
what is Bluetooth.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.700
Again, you heard Dave talk about it's
a short-range cable replacement.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.780
We see it as wireless USB.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.060
It's, in general, IR done right.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.640
You don't have to aim it,
you don't have to point it,

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.710
and you get a pretty
good distance from it,

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:21.860
around 30 feet.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.430
It's based on a publicly
available specification

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:30.050
controlled by the Bluetooth SIG,
and it's based on RF.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.420
It's a very low-power wireless technology
that operates in the same band,

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.600
as AirPort in the ISM band.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.950
And it's based on this
concept of profiles.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.710
I'm going to go into detail
on some of those profiles in

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.150
the next couple of slides.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:52.120
The profiles describe how devices
interoperate between one another.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:58.660
It was originally developed by the
cell phone companies as a replacement,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.180
again, for infrared on their
phones and other devices.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.900
So let me talk about the
Bluetooth Preview 1 that we

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.740
shipped at Macworld Tokyo.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.610
The first release provided support
for a number of different profiles.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.340
The first profile was dial-up networking.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:23.180
What dial-up networking allows you to do
is to use your cell phone as a wireless

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.690
modem connected to your computer,
so that you can use your computer to

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.540
dial up to the internet anywhere you are.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.440
This will give you network coverage
anywhere that you have cell coverage.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.340
And again, this is based on the idea of
Bluetooth being a functional

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.550
replacement for the infrared
connection you previously had

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.710
between your portable and your phone.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.340
The other profile that I'm going to talk
a little bit about is the serial profile.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:56.130
So we use this serial port profile to
support things like POM synchronization

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.540
from a handheld to a computer.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.990
The last profile that we
supported in Preview 1 is OBEX,

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.460
or Object Push.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:11.650
That allows me to send a vCard from one
computer or phone to another device.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.700
And it also allows me
to send small files,

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:21.280
and I'll show you a demo of sending a
file between two computers using this.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.580
But again,
the idea is to move a very small file,

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.920
a vCard, you know, a business card has
very little data in it.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.300
So, in the first implementation,
we tested this with a number of devices.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.760
We tested this with some
PDAs and some phones.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.550
Specifically,
we tested it with the Palm 500 series,

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.990
with the SD Bluetooth card,
which I'm going to demo a little later,

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.270
with the Sony Clie,
which has a memory stick adapter.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.190
The memory stick adapter isn't
available in this country;

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.160
it is available in Japan.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.500
And that was the demo
that we did in Tokyo.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.130
It also is compatible with a
number of third-party devices,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.160
which actually attach
to some of these PDAs.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:16.070
And there's devices to adapt your
legacy PDA and give it Bluetooth access.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:20.040
And that's things like
the Big Red -- I'm sorry,

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.640
the Red M sled.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:28.840
And also, the same company, Red M,
makes a device for the hand spring.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.480
We've tested this with
a variety of phones.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.350
We're finding more and more
phones compatible every day.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:40.110
We've got a very active users group out
there on our boards who are testing a

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:44.120
variety of phones and telling us that
more and more things work every day.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.960
The ones that we tested internally
were a variety of Ericsson phones

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.980
-- I'm not going to read the
list; you can see it -- a Nokia,

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:58.840
and also a Docomo, NTT Docomo phone,
I'm Mofone from Japan.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.730
So let me talk a little bit about
the demos that I'm going to do,

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.220
and we'll all cross our fingers
here because any demo that's

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:08.820
live requires crossed fingers.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.240
I'm going to show synchronization
from a POM to a laptop

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.900
without wires over Bluetooth.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.520
This is using the serial port
profile that I described earlier.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.120
I'm then going to send a vCard
from my POM to my laptop,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.680
and that will be using
the object push profile.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.960
And what you'll see is when I send it,
the business card will

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.920
actually open up on the laptop.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.710
The next set of demos I'm going to
do are from computer to computer.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:49.240
So I'm going to send from one Mac to
another Mac an image using iPhoto.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.280
So I'll drag an image

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:56.640
from iPhoto into Bluetooth file exchange,
and I'll use that to send it to another

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.170
PowerBook and then open it on that.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.500
Finally,
the last demo I'm going to do will be

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:07.320
showing off the Object Push profile
by sending from my PowerBook a

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.090
vCard directly to my phone to add
to the address book on the phone,

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.900
because we all know that typing
names and addresses on a number pad

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.900
is not the ideal user experience.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.060
So with that, I'm going to try and
bring up my demos here.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:52.610
What I've got on the left is
Palm Desktop running on top of

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:57.270
Jaguar with a new build of the
Bluetooth support that will be

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.270
shipping later this afternoon.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.200
This is Preview 2.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.730
Preview 2 will install on the
build of Jaguar you've got.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.120
That's the same build I'm running here.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.190
The current Preview will
not install on Jaguar.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:19.440
So what I've got here is a Palm 5
series with a Bluetooth SD card.

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:24.700
I'm going to go to my calendar,
and I've added to my calendar

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.680
a very important event,
which is a meeting that I'm going

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.800
to try and make right after this,
which is the Bluetooth in-depth session.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.310
What I'm going to do here is I'm
going to trigger a synchronization

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:39.760
just like I would normally,
but this time what I'm going to do

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.880
is I'm going to do it over Bluetooth.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.180
So I've already set this up to
synchronize over Bluetooth to the

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.440
Mac that you see on the other screen.

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:54.220
And you'll see on this screen
there's no event at 10 o'clock,

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.190
and you saw that there was one here.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:01.900
You'll see that the POM will go out,
look across the network,

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:11.090
look for the other Mac,
it will find the other Mac,

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.920
There's actually a bug in
some of the Jaguar support,

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.350
but let's try that again.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.850
So again, it'll go across.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.700
It'll find the Palm desktop
running on the other computer.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.590
It'll launch the
synchronized application.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.480
It'll determine what files
need to be synchronized,

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.700
again, just like you had it
directly connected to it.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.220
Run through the conduits
that are installed,

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.390
close the application,

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:12.600
[Transcript missing]

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.830
Let's go.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:25.290
The next thing I'm going to do,
as I said, is I'm going to send a vCard

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.950
from my palm to my Mac.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.660
So this is the equivalent of, you know,
somebody walks up and

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.280
they've got a business card,
they want to send it to you,

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.880
and you want it on your PowerBook,
in your address book,

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.810
because we all know that the
address book is the place that

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:42.520
we go for contacts at Mac OS X.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:50.860
So I'm going to go to my address book,
and I'm going to beam a business card.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:03.730
I'm going to beam this business card
to the other Mac here on the screen.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:10.300
So again, I just choose Send Address,
and it gives me a choice

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.000
of various ways I can send.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.300
I'm obviously going to choose
Bluetooth for this demo.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.410
and it's now searching across the
network of Bluetooth devices that are up

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:26.280
here and it will then give me a choice
of the various devices that it found.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.420
There's actually somebody
else up here too,

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:29.370
because there's now four of them.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.040
and it'll get human-readable
names for each of the devices.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.770
I could have previously paired with one
of the computers so I didn't have to

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.000
go through this whole search process.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.260
But since I know that FSA is the
computer I want to send it to,

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.860
I'm going to say OK.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.030
And what will happen is it
will send it to this computer,

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:57.990
and the way that I've got it configured,
it will ask me what I want to do with it.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.640
So let's take a look at that.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.760
So I'm going to send that.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:16.400
[Transcript missing]

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:21.670
and you'll see it opens up into
address book and now I have a new

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.530
business card which is bogus bogus.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.390
So that's all, again, all configurable.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.900
Let me show you a little bit
of the user interface here.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.650
So here's where I assign that behavior.

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:41.470
Do I open it automatically
with an application?

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:46.350
Do I ask the user whether they
want to confirm it or not?

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.180
So when I receive files,
what do you want to do?

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.440
Do you want to automatically accept it?

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:54.040
Or do you want to prompt each time?

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.600
I ask usually to make sure that
I accept it so that I know that

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.960
somebody's not sending me some
huge file taking up disk space.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.560
You also have controls
based on the type of data.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:10.060
So if I receive PIM data, vCards, vCalc,
things of that nature,

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.080
I can have various options for it.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.620
Again, I can save it automatically,
I can launch the helper,

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.870
which is what I did,
or I can ask the user what

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.420
application do they want to launch.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.820
Again, the same thing for things
which aren't PIM data.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:28.940
And of course I can also choose
where the data is actually stored.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.430
So with that,
I'm going to try my next demo,

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:37.300
Tempting Fate once again.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.000
And I'm going to

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:49.410
I'm going to open iPhoto
here on one of my PowerBooks,

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.180
and I'm going to send the
files from this PowerBook,

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.670
a picture from this PowerBook,
to the other PowerBook.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.480
And again,
we're going to see how when I drag

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.630
something to Bluetooth file exchange,
the other computer wakes up,

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.530
notices there's a document,
asks me what I want to do, says,

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.470
do you want to accept it?

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.380
I'll accept it.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.070
Excuse me.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.770
And then it will automatically launch
the helper app that I've chosen,

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.430
in this case, Preview, to open.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.640
So let me go pick a photo here.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.180
These are some photos I just shot diving.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:31.890
I'm going to grab one of these and
I will drag it onto this helper

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.260
app that installs with Bluetooth.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.980
So, I will pick the other computer
that I want to send it to,

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.680
and I'll tell it to send.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:46.350
You'll see then on the other screen,
the alert come up saying that

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.140
you're receiving a document.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.130
Do you want to accept it?

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.590
Sure.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:55.400
And very quickly,
I'll move that 300K file

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.900
over to the other computer.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.200
And again, since you saw the
Open Automatically dialog,

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.820
you'll see Preview Launches.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:07.170
And the document will come
to the foreground and display

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.300
on the other computer.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:10.800
And there it is.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:25.400
Okay, the last demo I'm going to do
is I'm going to actually push an

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.070
object from my computer to my phone.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.870
Again, we talked about this earlier,
the user interface

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:40.600
The user interface on this phone is
not exactly lend itself to... Yeah,

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.200
ignore the picture.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:47.200
Does not exactly lend itself towards
editing pictures and images real well.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:54.200
So, let's go ahead and...

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.440
Set that aside.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.320
We're going to open... I think
we're on the wrong computer.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.500
Okay.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.510
We'll go ahead and open the address book.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:17.660
And I've got a V-card here
that I'm going to send,

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.000
but this time I'm going
to choose my phone.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.220
And I'll send it.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.540
And on the other screen,
I've now received a

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.640
business card on the phone.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:43.190
So I'll walk over here,
and I will look for that contact.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:06.500
[Transcript missing]

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.460
We'll try one more time this way.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:33.600
Can we switch to the other screen?

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.300
We'll try it from the other computer.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:45.830
This machine isn't actually discoverable.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.540
This is why you pair ahead of time,
so you don't actually have

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.610
to search for devices.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.970
Okay.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.680
So we'll pick my phone again.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.500
Try sending it.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:43.280
It's asking me if I want
to accept this card,

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.150
and I will say yes.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.360
And it will say it's been added.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.910
And I will...

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.700
Go into my phone book.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.650
I will look for that business card.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.190
And I will find it.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.100
And I'll see there that all
the information was sent,

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.430
the name of the person,
and the various phone numbers and

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:12.250
email addresses I had in the vCard.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:12.250
All right.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:17.850
Can we get the slides back up?

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.710
OK.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.960
So let me talk a little bit
more about what's in Preview 2

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.460
and how that's different from
what you guys have seen already.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.480
So in Preview 2,
we've added a number of new functions.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:36.610
We've added the ability to create
outgoing serial ports automatically.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:42.230
We've also provided the ability to
pair to things other than phones.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.020
There are a variety of devices
that you might want to pair to

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.850
your computer that aren't phones.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.060
You saw my PDA,
and there are a variety of other

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.070
things out there coming on the market
that make a lot of sense to connect.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:58.340
We've also, with the release of
Preview 2 later this week,

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.820
released a developer SDK.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:04.260
And inside the developer SDK,
you'll find sample code to help

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.540
you develop your application,
documentation and headers,

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.170
as well as some sample applications.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:16.930
These helper apps will help you in
developing your Bluetooth applications.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.720
You'll also find some tools to
help you manage the serial port

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.520
and Bluetooth ports on the device.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.020
For more information on Preview 2 and
the developer opportunities around that,

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:22.340
I recommend that you stay
here for session 807,

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:22.790
where my colleague Mike Larson is going
to go through in detail the functions

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:23.520
of Preview 2 and how you can extend
the Bluetooth solution to your device.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:49.420
We've also provided the ability to
pair to things other than phones.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:50.480
You'll also find sample code to help
you in developing your application,

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.520
documentation and headers,
as well as some sample applications.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.480
You'll also find sample code to help
you in developing your application,

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:53.520
documentation and headers,
as well as some sample applications.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.830
A couple of additional
links for more information.

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:01.980
Of course, there's the canonical source
for information on Bluetooth,

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.270
which is the Bluetooth SIG,
and that's at www.bluetooth.org.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.620
There's a number of really
good books out there,

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.710
but the best one that
I've seen is one entitled

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.460
Bluetooth Connect Without Cables.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.960
The information on
that's up here as well.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:25.690
In terms of 802.11 or AirPorT,
the canonical reference site for that,

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:32.620
for 802.11, is the Wi-Fi site,
which is the Wireless Ethernet

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:33.860
Compatibility Alliance.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.980
And of course, the IEEE site,
if you want to read all the gory

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:42.160
details on the specification and
any of the various flavors of

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.850
802.11 which are being worked on.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.200
So much of this is probably
pretty obvious to you.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.570
There are a number of related sessions
that are probably of interest to you.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.780
We've already talked about
the Bluetooth session,

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.280
which is immediately following
this in the same room.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.140
There's also an advanced
Mac OS X networking session,

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.020
which is on Thursday at 9 in the morning.

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:13.270
There's the rendezvous session,
which is later in the

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.340
afternoon on Thursday.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:21.030
And there also was, earlier in the week,
an overview session on

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.130
Mac OS X networking.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:29.650
So if you watch the video streams after
the show is over or end up with the DVDs,

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.530
then you'll probably want to take a
look at that for more information.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.360
And with that,
if you have additional questions,

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.620
feel free to contact me.

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.620
My contact information
is up on the slide.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.060
And, of course,
there's a mailing list that we've

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:48.690
set up for developers who are working
on... supporting Bluetooth applications

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.930
or Bluetooth hardware.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.460
And you'll see the URL for
that on the board as well.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:59.200
I've referenced a couple of times
during my session to a board at

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.500
Apple where a number of people
are talking about Bluetooth,

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:06.090
sharing their experiences,
what they've tested, what works,

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:09.000
what doesn't work,
how to get various things to work.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
You might want to take
a look at that as well.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.830
And that's the Bluetooth link
that's up here.
