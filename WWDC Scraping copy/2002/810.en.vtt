WEBVTT

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.410
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.630
I'm Rob, and today we have a good crowd.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.430
We're going to be talking about
NetBoot and network installation.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.310
This is a portion of the
Jaguar 10 server product.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.260
My name is Rob Neville.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.160
So this session is a little bit
different from a lot of sessions that

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.460
we have here at WWDC in that the NetBoot
and network installation products or

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.770
portions of the server products are not
specifically geared around the developer

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.140
community producing products on top of.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.230
The NetBoot and NetInstall
products are useful and are going

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.030
to be utilized by your customers,
hopefully, and also by probably,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.460
as I look around the room
and see some familiar faces,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.030
probably a lot of you all in the room.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480
In past years, what we've found,
and this is the first year we've been

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.070
talking specifically about this product,
that there are quite a few of you

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.430
here who are actually users of the
server product specifically and the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.750
NetBoot and NetInstallation product
that we're going to be delivering

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.080
to you in the next couple of months.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.130
And your users of the product,
your people who actually install

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.910
and run and have customers
who live on top of this.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.200
And we're going to be gearing a
lot of our talk today about that.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.680
If, however,
you are developing... There are some

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.400
things that you should keep in mind.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.100
There potentially are some things which,
if you want to have your software

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.980
installed in this environment,
that you're going to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.460
have to pay attention to.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.000
So, NetBoot, it's coming in a new flavor.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.200
NetBoot for Jaguar,
we've got a variety of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.670
new types of offerings.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.100
We're going to be able to give
you NetBooting for Mac OS 9,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.850
the same way as we do today,
and Mac OS X.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.570
In addition, we're going to be supporting
network installation.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.710
As part of that process,
we're going to give you in the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.480
X environment some new tools for
customizing both your NetBoot

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.980
and your NetInstall images.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.500
I want you to know that this is going
to be part of the Jaguar server product,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.270
but it's not part of the developer
CDs that you all received.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.840
Those of you who are interested received
a Jaguar 10 server CD that was available.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.610
This is not on that disc.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.950
NetBoot images in and of themselves,
for those of you who are

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.030
familiar with the product,
can get to be quite large.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.780
The actual packaging of that is still
being worked out in some fashion.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.330
We decided that it was just too much data
to be able to give you this particular

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.660
product at this particular time.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.350
So what we're going to talk about today,
what do I want you to take out

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.700
of this particular session?

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.950
For those of you who are
not familiar with NetBoot,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.720
we're going to be talking a little
bit about what the product is,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.680
where it's come from, NetBoot on 9.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.820
We're going to tell you what's different
and what's the same about NetBoot on 10.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.730
We're going to talk about network
installation and what that means,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.690
how that works, things that you're going
to need to watch out for.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.760
And we're going to talk a little
bit about the tools we have for

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.040
customizing this particular installation.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.990
and customizing your netboot images.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:47.200
[Transcript missing]

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.480
Pretty powerful stuff.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.250
This is a power tool.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.880
And for those of you who are implementing
and deploying this particular tool,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.670
the capabilities of it are not simple and
not real easy to configure and set up.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.970
This is not something which you want
to give to a trivial administrator

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.650
or someone who maybe administrates
adding users to your file server,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.120
those kinds of things.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.460
There are a lot of different
steps to this process,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.900
and as we add the possibility
of doing network installations,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.060
you're really going to want to keep some
control over this particular process.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.040
NetBoot for 9.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.480
What is NetBoot?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:41.100
NetBoot is the ability for a Macintosh
to mount or come up or boot from a

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.980
disk image that's out on a server.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.040
Currently,
the current product that we have today

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.060
and the product that we've shipped
from the first iteration of Mac OS X,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.380
a couple of years ago now,
is a version of Mac OS 9.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.260
We ship it on four flavors.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.670
The four flavors we ship are the
four languages that we support.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.670
Those languages come in images.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.060
The images reside in a CD.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.320
The CD gets installed in the
system in a specific location.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.290
You can boot up to 50 clients in
the current iterations against that.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.200
It's a read-only volume.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.810
We have shadow files on the hard drive,
on the local server hard drive,

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.810
that allow for write space.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.730
You can boot a 9 image.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.440
We gave you tools to allow
you to modify that image.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.250
They were a little bit tedious,
a little bit ponderous,

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.840
but allows you to put things into
the... Some of you have used the tool,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.860
I can tell from the laughter.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:07:13.800
[Transcript missing]

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.590
More productive experience when
you're modifying your 10 images.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.680
So, now we get into some of the
stuff that's really new,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.940
and that is we're going
to be NetBooting 10.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.240
I'm kind of excited about
being able to NetBoot 10.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.640
From my particular standpoint,
this makes my life a whole lot easier

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.460
on the other products that I manage,
in that now that I've got

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.250
multiple image support,
if I'm running a version of Jaguar,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.200
and we iterate those occasionally
to add features and to fix

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.420
bugs and things before we ship,
and I need to regress,

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:59.440
find out when a particular feature
went in or stopped working,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.780
I can now NetBoot that image.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.300
And I don't have to install the
whole thing to find out whether or

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.450
not that functionality was there.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:15.640
So you can NetBoot an installation
to test whether or not you've got

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.540
a particular configuration for your
users if you're installing this.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.420
You can create multiple copies
of 10 to install and test to see

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.760
whether or not you've got the right
mix of applications for your users.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.830
The other nice thing about it is,
and what we've found,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:39.490
though I'm not going to be making
any sort of performance comments,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.610
Promises at all.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.470
But what we found is that the
experience that you have with X is

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.740
that you boot to the login window.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.560
And that may take some amount
of time because you're loading

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.560
the kernel and you're loading a
bunch of the underlying pieces.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.060
But you do that once.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.920
And then when the users,
they tend not to,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.410
like they did with Mac OS X,
they tend not to shut down.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.910
They tend to log out.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.040
So now you're sitting
there at the login prompt,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.900
which is running.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.780
And you log out and you log back in.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.530
And that experience for your
users is going to be much faster.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.640
So, we're also providing a new image,
a new tool for modifying the images,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.800
and we call it the Network Image Utility.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.400
Very catchy name, it's the new tool.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.720
And the other thing to consider,
and I think this is going to

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.370
help those of you who work in a
more enterprise kind of setting,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.210
is we're going to be booting,
today we're going to be

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.920
booting over NFS for Mac OS X.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.520
What that allows you to
do is to put your images,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.900
of various multiple images,
allows you to put it on big

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.330
iron in the back and point to
it from your Mac OS X server

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.390
and just mount it over NFS.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.190
It gets exported over NFS.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.920
The server is what,
the image file itself is HFS+, but

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.410
where you can store it and where it gets
mounted from and loaded from is over NFS.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.000
So it gives you a little
bit more flexibility.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:19.770
So we also support classic
inside the Mac OS X image.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.990
But, there's a big but here.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.810
We don't install it for you.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.260
With NetBoot for X,
ostensibly what we did was we

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.330
gave you four localized images.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.350
Well, we did that because you used them.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.380
If you didn't use them,
you would have given us some

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.980
sort of feedback and told us you
didn't need them or want them.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.220
But you use these localized images.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.660
And we don't know which particular
version of the OS or which localized

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.810
version of the OS that you want.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:59.000
So basically what we have is the tool
that we use will create a 10 boot image.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.000
and then what you need to do
is you need to mount that.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.260
So it's a disk copy image,
so you just mount it like you

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.890
mount any other disk copy image.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.640
And then what you do is you
go get the version of 9.2.2

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.610
that you want to install,
insert that,

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.870
install that system into the image.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.510
Well, so now you've got an
installed image there,

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.770
and if you stop there and every
time you started up the machine,

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.770
your users would get the
experience of running through

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.980
the setup assistant for Mac OS X.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.190
So you don't want them
to have that experience.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:42.090
What you do is you then,
with that image still mounted read-write,

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:49.120
you point your classic startup at
the image that you just installed.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.920
And then you launch it.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.550
And you configure it how you will.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.230
Save your file,
and now you have something

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.760
where you can launch.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.220
Basically, your users can launch classic.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.320
Okay.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.180
We are not supporting
being able to NetBoot.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:15.500
[Transcript missing]

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.460
Okay, now some of you are
giggling and laughing,

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.700
but we've had that request and there
is some logic behind that request.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.340
The ability to,
the same reason you'd use NetBoot in the

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:32.290
first place is because you want to be
able to only support one known image,

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.810
read-only.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.840
So that's why people wanted to be
able to NetBoot their classic folder,

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.730
but we don't support that.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.090
So the caveat here is you're
doing the installation,

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.320
so we're not going to
be holding your hand.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.410
If you want to install a
non-supported version of 9

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:58.290
that Classic won't launch with,
knock yourselves out.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.320
Your users aren't going
to be able to use it.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.830
And that's the other reason we recommend
that you test these installations

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.760
before you roll them into production.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.540
So what's network installation?

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.660
Well, the short answer for network
installation is that network installation

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.620
is Netbooting to the installer.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.530
So what does that give me?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.220
Well, that gives me a couple of things.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.610
First, it gives me the ability to take
what in essence is the user

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.210
CD that you get with Jaguar,

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.700
Put an image of that on the server and
now have everybody in your enterprise

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.470
or in your school or wherever,
you know, whatever community is seeing

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.600
that particular server.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.880
It allows them to install
without having to have the CD.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:57.040
So, well, that's good,
but I tend not to install OSs every day,

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.300
so that's not, maybe not be real useful.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.290
Now, it might be extraordinarily
useful for the times when,

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.680
if you're in charge of the new
equipment coming into your enterprise,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.980
and you want to make sure that it's
got the latest version of the OS on it,

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.130
or the version that you're supporting,
maybe not the latest,

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.820
but the version you're supporting,
then you can just come in,

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.840
have these things run a NetInstall
as soon as they come in the door.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.010
The other thing you can do is
you can put your apps on it.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.390
You can also,
since it boots to the installer,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.810
you can take out the OS and
put whatever applications,

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.170
utilities, scripts, customized widgets,
anything you want,

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.660
into the install package
and have it install.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:57.700
[Transcript missing]

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.140
I give out to my
particular customer base,

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.670
CPUs.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.340
I own them.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.880
I may not want to give them
root access to those machines,

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.960
and yet I want to be able to
update their software or to

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.120
install new bits on their disks,
but I don't want to give them

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.340
root access to the machine.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.820
So how can I do that?

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.860
Well, in this particular way,
what you can do is you can say, you know,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.480
Run site licensed app install.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.270
The installer is running his root,
and it'll install all the

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.390
bits in the right place.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.370
So you don't have to give
the user the root password,

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.500
so you can still keep
some modicum of control.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.600
The other thing,
and this is where we get into a

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.640
little bit of the power tool area,
is you can automate these installations.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.180
You can run these things.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.080
Currently, you run an installer and it
asks you a series of questions.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.000
A lot of times,
you're just clicking the arrow.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.540
Sometimes, you have to really enter data.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.170
For those of you who want to
do unattended installations,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.540
we're giving you that capability.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.140
If you want to do some level
of attended installation,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.300
we're giving you that capability as well.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.400
With this capability,
we're giving you responsibility.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.820
We're giving you the authority.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:23.490
We're giving you the
power to do nasty things.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.850
So how does NetBoot work?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.350
For those of you who aren't
familiar with the product,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:35.000
NetBoot works similarly
in both environments.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.180
I won't go into the original
NetBoot that shipped way back when,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.320
because that works a
little bit differently.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.550
In general,
the way the current NetBoot works

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.700
is the clients that you see,
they request,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.100
after they get a DHCP address
from whatever DHCP server you

00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:01.320
happen to have on your network,
they make a BSDP request over DHCP to

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.890
discover a multicast for a server.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.170
and the first server that they get
that responds to them will be the

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.850
server that they attempt to boot from.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.070
And that's if they don't
do anything at all.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.950
So if I come in,
I haven't configured my machine at all,

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.730
I hold down the hardware interrupt,
which is the N key, and I want to boot,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.370
it's going to do a broadcast,
it's going to find the first

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.500
responding NetBoot server.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.170
And for 9, what it's going to do,
it's going to TFTP down the boot ROM,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.030
then it's going to
mount an image over AFP,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.080
and you're up and running.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.300
For 10, what's going to happen is it's
going to download the kernel,

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.680
then it's going to establish
an NFS session to the server,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.850
and it's going to load your
root partition over NFS.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.510
We give the users another
mechanism for doing that.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.090
Once you've made that connection,
you are then bound.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.580
The server knows about you,
you know about the server.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.820
That data is stored on the
machine in parameter RAM.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.010
So next time you NetBoot,
it's going to try and

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.480
NetBoot to the same server.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.530
So, the trick is,
what if the server that it

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.570
NetBooted from goes away?

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.160
Well,
then it's going to try and NetBoot again,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.350
and it's going to find another server.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.250
Well, now it's going to bind
to that new server.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.890
So that if I have two servers
and I'm NetBooting from server A,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.460
and then server A goes away,
and next time I NetBoot from server B,

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.870
I'm going to continue to NetBoot from
server B even if server A comes back.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.480
So that's the unattended installation.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.770
However, we are giving you new
tools to be able to pick,

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.400
since we now have multiple images.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.360
We're giving you the
capability to pick those.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:06.590
Network Image Utility This is
going to allow you to ostensibly

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.030
create NetBoot images.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:13.800
I was talking to a gentleman
earlier before the session and

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.250
Quite frankly,
I want to be out of the business

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.260
of providing NetBoot images.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.510
Every time a CPU ships,
every time there's a new widget that

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:30.460
our wonderful people in the CoreOS ship,
every time we rev the system or

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.590
produce a software update or a fix,
I have to rev NetBoot.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.390
That's a lot of overhead.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:47.510
It also, it's also I'm making the
assumption for you about what

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.780
it is that you want or need.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:56.920
So what I'd like to do is get out of
the business of creating NetBoot images.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:02.810
And the way I'm going to do that is
I'm going to give the ability to you.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:09.390
And the way that we're doing that in 10
is through the network image utility.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.750
and through disk copy, ostensibly,
is you're going to be

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.830
able to create images,
mount them with disk copy,

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.330
modify them to your heart's
content in a much easier fashion

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.990
than you could with NBDA.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:28.150
We're going to allow you to
create boot images from CDs,

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:28.150
and then you

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.100
from Installation Discs.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:34.280
We're going to give you new system
preferences and control panels

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.870
to allow your users to pick which
image they wish to boot from.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:48.360
What you see here is a sample screenshot
of the Mac OS X network image utility.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.510
Now, what I mean by sample screenshot,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.100
I can see it, so you can see it too.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.440
Enable classic on the image?

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.970
That's not there.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.400
System folder path?

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.520
That's not there.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.060
In other words, the UI is going to be
a little bit different.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.260
However, it's going to be a single user
interface that comes up that

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:16.100
will allow you to create either a
NetBoot image or a NetInstall image.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.850
Why would I want to differentiate
between NetBoot and NetInstall?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.690
Well, let me think.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.580
So my user comes up and they just
see a couple of images and they say,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.490
oh, let me try booting from that one.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.510
Well, when they boot from that one,
it erases their primary hard

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.300
drive and installs the new
operating system onto it.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.390
Oops.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.740
That's a lot different experience from
just booting to the latest version of

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.270
the OS and still having the contents
of their hard drive available to them.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.620
So we want to give the users at
least some graphical user interface

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.960
to be able to differentiate between
a boot image and an install image.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.540
Now your installers are going to be
really nice and they're not going

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.270
to erase people's hard drives,
except in the lab situations where

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.720
you're controlling all of the machines.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.520
You're going to just do things
like incrementally update

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.280
your favorite applications.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.300
You're going to write a NetBoot,
a NetInstall image for your suite of apps

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.710
if you're a third party developer out
there that you can just distribute so

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:23.920
that one of the options your users have
is to NetInstall your suite of images.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.170
One of the things which
we're also including,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.940
this is just reminding me
and this isn't in the slides,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.100
but that I want to talk a
little bit about is licensing.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.210
For those of you who happen
to be developers out there,

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.850
we're now giving the users
with Mac OS X the ability

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.210
to site license install.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.320
And that's the way you can
install the operating system.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.190
But that comes with some caveats.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:56.740
You guys who are site licensing have to
do some things according to the license,

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.610
like take responsibility that
the users who do the install are

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.510
going to live up to the license.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.710
You have to do some trivial things
like on an internal corporate website,

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.040
put the license agreement.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.990
There's some I's to cross and T's to dot.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.050
But what you need to remember is
if you're developers out there,

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.550
you can also give your users
the capability of doing that.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.610
And you might need to take some time
and talk to your attorneys to figure

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.290
out what the licensing agreement might
look like if you're going to give

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.160
the users the ability to do that.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.300
So the end users are going to love it.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.460
They're absolutely going to love it.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:45.940
But especially with an automated install,
you could have someone,

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.050
i.e., most of you,
answering yes to do you accept this

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:53.160
license agreement and not the person
who is actually using the software.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.210
So you have to watch out for that.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.330
This is an example of the
startup disk in Mac OS X.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:14.010
I believe on your CDs that you
got for Mac OS X Jaguar that this

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:19.770
is the version that is in the OS.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.550
However,
none of you have my new NetBoot server,

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.580
so none of you are going to see this.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.290
These icons may change a little bit.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.370
However, what you can see is you can see
you've got NetBoot disk for 9.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.660
It should be 9.2.2 probably.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.600
A Mac OS X 10.2 network disk.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.790
You can have multiple
versions of this if you wish.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.380
You can have as many as you want.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.980
Also network installation.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.980
You have a NetInstall disk if
somebody wanted to install it.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.860
And you can see what the
differentiation between the,

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.450
that green arrow may turn red.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:01.600
It may change a little bit,
so don't hold me to the graphics per se,

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.990
but in addition,
you can have multiple servers

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.640
serving multiple images.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.280
So that's a lot of
bandwidth on your networks.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.520
There's a lot of you probably
aren't going to do that,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.050
but you can do that.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.510
You can do that.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.680
Okay, so automating your installation.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.620
This is, I think,
this is where we're now getting

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.340
into the power tool arena.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.150
Because you can automate,
you can bypass portions of

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.900
this with an XML script.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.580
You can have some interaction
to no interaction.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.060
We're hoping to be able to
provide you with a default

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:55.320
Wait screen, like your primary hard
drive is about to be erased.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.220
You have 30 seconds to cancel something
if you don't wish this to occur.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.470
However, I think in most of the cases...

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.650
When you all write the XML scripts
to bypass the installation

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.430
and answer yes to a series
of questions that create a default

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.320
username and all that other stuff.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.130
You're not going to give the
user the ability to bail.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:26.180
However, if you're giving the users the
ability to install a series of

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:30.320
applications on a particular CD,
I mean on a particular location or

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.550
particular partition where they wish,
so you've got a suite of

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.590
site-licensed software,
and you want to give your

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.590
users the ability to pick

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:59.200
[Transcript missing]

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.750
I'm going to hit this home probably,
you know, for the next 30 minutes.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:13.480
You can unintentionally create situations
which cause your users to lose data.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.180
You will be responsible for that.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.010
You are the ones who are going to
be writing the XML scripts that

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.420
tell the computer to do that.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.940
I am just providing you with the tools.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.620
This is an example of, if I want to buy,
you all want to, you're asked for this,

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.080
you want a table saw.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.330
If you go to a school situation,
you see the table saw,

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.360
you see a guard over the
blade in the school shop.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.990
You take that same table saw,
you take it out to a construction site

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:45.350
where they're building your house,
or to a lumber yard, where's the guard?

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.120
Who knows where the guard is?

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.770
Probably the same place
as somebody's fingertips,

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.330
but there's no guard.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.830
And we're giving you a table saw.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.580
And we're giving you a guard.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.260
And if you take the guard off,
and some of your users cut

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.360
off the tips of their thumb,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.200
There are no defaults.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.590
We are not providing you with
a default automated install.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.250
We are going to show you how
you can remove the guard.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:28.210
We are not giving you a sample
table saw with the guard removed.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.180
So there are two types of
installations using our install tool.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:42.220
There's a minimal install,

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:49.430
It comes up with no confirmation,
though we may add one with this,

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:53.920
what I told you about, you know,
you have 30 seconds to remove this

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.370
tape or the CD will self-destruct.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.210
But there is a progress bar,
and you auto-restart.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.800
So there may be a small alert saying,
you know, we're getting ready to

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.400
install Mac OS X to the best
operating system on the planet.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.240
We're not going to give you
do you wish to continue,

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.020
do you wish to stop, right?

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.080
And then we continue.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.960
And then there's a confirm method
where the panel allows you to pick

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.310
what volume you want to install on.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.340
It's got an OK button before it,
so it doesn't do anything.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:39.940
The user selects the targeted volume.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.790
It's similar to the experience
that you have today with a CD.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:51.600
and where we do this, and again,
this is an ever-changing

00:29:52.400 --> 00:30:06.800
[Transcript missing]

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:13.040
It was called install tool
when I created these CDs.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.910
It was called install tool when I gave
these CDs to the people who made

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.540
them pretty and were putting them up.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.920
But between then and now,
they changed the name.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.470
I believe it's called Installer.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.900
Shaking your head.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.790
You back there yet?

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:28.790
It's called Installer.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.570
We're not going to go into a
great deal of depth because

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.830
my team is not responsible
specifically for the installer,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.660
but ostensibly I'm going to go
through what you're allowed to do.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.090
This thing,
a variety of optional parameters.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.010
The optional ones are
the ones in brackets.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.880
You can get a list of the packages
that are allowed to be installed.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.220
You can get a list of the volumes that
are available with the volume info.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.600
You can get help.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.740
Wow.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:10.300
You can get a list of what metapackages
are to be installed or to find which

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.470
ones are supposed to be installed.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.340
You can designate the path
that you wish it to go to.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.160
Be very careful on this.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.240
Your users may have changed
the names of the volumes,

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:24.870
so unless you nuke them and rename them,
it's not going to be a problem.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.230
You can designate what's
the default language.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:31.930
This could be very useful in
determining a pre-configured

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.300
setup for your installations.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.910
You can save these parameters out.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:46.760
This is really good in debugging
and in testing your configuration.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.760
Most of these are here,
so you'll have a list of these.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.430
When this material is available to you,
you'll be able to access this

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.230
and refer back to it again.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.670
Formats.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.580
These are options to format
the output to an XML file,

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:09.250
designate the path of the XML file,
have it in verbose mode,

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.280
check the versioning.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.680
The name of the port to
send the progress info to.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.750
You might want to send that
progress information out some

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.220
port other than the video port.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.800
You may be interested
in viewing it remotely.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.560
Other things to watch out for.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.590
This is new technology.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:44.470
Some of the technology on
X is new functionality,

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.780
though the technology is the same.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.950
However, network installation, I

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.510
differs greatly from NetBooting.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.340
And how is that?

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:03.840
When I Netboot my image on 10,
it brings me up to the login window.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.500
I execute the login window.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.700
The kernel's loaded.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.700
The Windows server's loaded.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.700
Everything's loaded.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.360
I log in.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.050
It launches the finder.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.480
The finder's running.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:18.200
And I launch individual
applications as I need them.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.700
And I'm basically running 10.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:25.530
That data is sometimes being
read off of a mounted disk image

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.490
that's mounted over the network.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:36.000
With the installer, what you're doing is
you're mounting the OS,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.890
you're launching the installer,
and it's copying files from that

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.390
read-only image over the network.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.670
That's a lot of data.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:56.760
We do installations at
Apple of the operating system.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.690
We do those sometimes over the network.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.340
We sometimes send out
emails to people saying,

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.580
"Please, everybody,
don't install at 10:00 in the morning.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.540
If you can help it,
install a little later."

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.380
Because what happens is,
even at a big corporate

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.180
network like Apple's,
if you have 5,000 users all

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:24.450
doing that kind of installation,
it's very slow.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.320
And we have a fast network.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:32.170
So it's much bigger than NetBoot.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.140
And NetBoot is,
for those of you who are currently,

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.510
how many people currently use NetBoot?

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.830
10-15% of the audience.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.390
You know, it can take up a considerable
amount of bandwidth.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.680
This is not something that
you want to do over airport.

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:55.040
and not just because of airports,
you know, the fact that if I stand in

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.140
front of an airport base station,
you might not get a good signal.

00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.720
It's because of the bandwidth, right?

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.230
So...

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.400
Network installation takes up more.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.700
You may want to have more,
if you're going to be handling

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.760
network installations,
you may want to have more

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.270
than one server doing them.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:23.730
So the other thing to watch out for is,
so we're giving you this

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.990
networked image utility.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.570
And that allows you the ability to take

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:52.200
[Transcript missing]

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:54.880
We don't do any error checking for that.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:59.350
We don't know that the
bits you put on the disk,

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.100
because ostensibly all I'm
doing when I'm NetInstalling is

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.170
I'm booting to the installer.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.550
Well, I don't check to see whether or
not the OS is going to boot to

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.660
the installer or the login window.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:19.600
I rely upon you to turn that flag on so
that when the control panel comes up,

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.640
You see an install image.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.710
So that's up to you.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:35.450
Pre-flight, pre-test up your setups.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.340
You're going to have a lot of
cut-off thumbs if you don't.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.010
A lot of cut-off thumbs.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.280
only use unattended
installs when required.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.900
[Transcript missing]

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:01.390
and always, always,
always give users a warning beforehand

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.540
if you're going to do something
that they may not know about.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.770
So, I'm going to get you out
of here a little bit early,

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:12.950
unless you have tons of questions.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:20.310
So, in summary,
we've got a new version of NetBoot.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.400
The new version of NetBoot
supports multiple images.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:30.050
It supports Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:35.040
The technology supports,
you can have a Mac OS 10.2.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:41.860
If there is a 10.2.1 or a 10.2.2,
you can have those as well.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.660
You can have different flavors of 9.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.830
You can have your Japanese 9 image.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.550
You can have your English 9 image,
your German 9 image.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:56.450
You can have your 9 image with
applications installed on it.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.130
You can have your plain vanilla 9 image.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:04.380
You can have your kiosk 9
image or your kiosk 10 image.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.060
Those kinds of things.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.260
Network installation.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.850
We're giving you the capability of
installing the software over the network.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.670
You're going to be able to
take the Mac OS X Server,

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:22.350
set it up,
and upgrade your users to Jaguar.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.420
You're going to be able
to set up a Jaguar 10,

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:33.310
10.2 installation and use that
to install it over at your site.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:41.790
But with this functionality,
we need you to use it carefully.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.240
So a couple of cleanup items here.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:57.790
For those of you who were here
on Monday at 3:30 and at 5:00,

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.200
we had an overview of
the Mac OS X Server.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:05.920
We had -- and then that was followed
by the Mac OS X Server in depth.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:11.200
Those talked about the other -- a lot
about the other portions of Mac OS X.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.070
Some of you I recognize from
being at that session and may

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.180
have been asked questions.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.160
I want to thank you all for coming.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.590
This is a really great turnout
for a technology that I think

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.900
is just now really starting to
mature and really starting to be

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.200
a really useful tool for you all.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.230
And if you're developers,
what I want to stress to you is use

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.200
the package format wherever possible.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.420
This will allow you to leverage
off of our technology to do network

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.950
installations for your customers.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.950
For you people who are actually
going to be deploying this,

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.460
we're trying to give you the
tools so that you have the

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.190
capability and the customizability.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.420
We're also giving you the responsibility.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.510
Who to contact?

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:01.920
If you have questions or technical
kinds of issues that you wish to raise,

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:07.140
features that you wish to give, myself,
Tom Weir, who's a network and

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:12.380
communications evangelist,
will be joining me here in a minute.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.990
If you have complaints
or you have problems,

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:21.160
use the appropriate channel for those.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:27.360
I'm not going to turn anybody away,
but there are mechanisms that we

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.310
need to facilitate the use of and
need to make sure things get tracked

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:36.310
correctly so we know we are making the
right decisions at the right times.
