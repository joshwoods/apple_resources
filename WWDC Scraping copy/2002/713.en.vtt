00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.830
Good morning, everyone,
and thank you for coming to our

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.460
first session on the last day
of the developer conference.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.590
I realize it's really early and
appreciate you getting up to join us.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.870
Can I see a show of hands of people
who went to the event last night?

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.630
Wow.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.070
That's great.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.560
And you guys still got up this morning.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.000
Awesome.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.550
So our first session today is our
WebObjects Solutions session where

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.090
we're showcasing a few of our
developers who we've invited to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.400
come up and share what they've done.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.920
Bob Frazier is actually going to be
your emcee for the session this morning,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.600
so I'll bring up Bob.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.660
So there really are two of us.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.260
We're very pleased to have representation
from four of our customers here.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.450
And they'll each give a
presentation on their technologies

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.880
in four different areas and
their experiences with WebObjects.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.060
And we've asked them to give a
little background not only on

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.600
the project that they're doing,
but kind of like how

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.160
they used WebObjects,
if they made any transitions,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.990
and give us some feedback on
what and why kind of thing.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.790
So I think you'll find
this very interesting.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:55.600
[Transcript missing]

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.600
So are we all powered by
Krispy Kreme this morning?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600
God,
I was really looking for something else.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.590
Here we go, Krispy Kreme.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.530
So as Bob said, my name is Bob Davis,
and I'm the project manager for

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.600
the Collaboratory Project at
Northwestern University.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600
Let's see if I can get this to change.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600
There we go.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.120
So here's a picture of our
homepage and our address,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.570
Collaboratory.Nunet.net.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.110
And we sort of joke,
one of the hardest things we ever

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.100
have to learn to do is learn,
first of all,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.710
to pronounce "collaboratory,"
and second of all,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.490
to spell it.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.280
And we actually work with
K-12 students and teachers,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.540
so it's kind of tricky sometimes.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600
So what is the Collaboratory Project?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.440
It's an easy-to-use,
web-based collaborative environment

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.600
that teachers use to develop
project-based activities that

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.600
are accessible to all students.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.600
So what is the Collaboratory Project?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.600
It's an easy-to-use,
web-based collaborative environment

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.600
that teachers use to develop
project-based activities that

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.600
are accessible to all students.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.770
So what is the Collaboratory Project?

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.020
It's an easy-to-use,
web-based collaborative environment

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.290
that teachers use to develop
project-based activities that

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.600
are accessible to all students.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.620
that are benchmarked to
Illinois learning standards and goals.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.980
And as I said, this is our home page,
and I welcome you all to come visit us.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.700
It's very simple to navigate.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.520
I'm not going to go
through a lot of it today,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.740
but there's basically five or
six buttons that will lead you to

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.800
most of the pertinent information.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.310
If you'd like to go and learn
more about the Collaboratory,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.910
learn how to participate,
learn about some of our communities,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.090
see who our staff is.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.830
And there's actually a
search mechanism there also,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.380
so if you just want to see some of the
projects that teachers have created,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.490
you can go and sort of search by
curricular and grade area and sort

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.460
of get a sample of some of the things
without actually creating an account.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.570
And, of course, you can log into the
Collaboratory project.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.940
So just to give you a
little bit of information,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.940
I'm part of the IT organization
at Northwestern University,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.940
and the Collaboratory Project is
really sort of an information

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.800
technology outreach into
the Illinois K-12 community.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.670
We help educators learn to
integrate network technologies

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.620
into their curriculum,
and it's really a $2.2 million

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.370
investment over the course of five years.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.250
Our original funding came from
SBC Ameritech with seed money,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.320
and now we're funded by the
Illinois State Board of Education with

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.350
some additional money from SBC and
some help from vendors like Apple and

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.270
vendors like Sun who provide hardware
for some of the things that we're doing.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.530
We really like to think of the
things we do as sort of scaffolding.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.100
We're not from the School of Education.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.540
We're part of information technology.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.880
What we do is provide an online
resource for teachers to use.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.830
We don't produce any content.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.060
Everything that's in the
Collaboratory is really things that

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.360
have been produced by teachers.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.270
It's a very,
we've been in existence five years,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.780
so it's really a very mature,
sort of well-developed set

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.690
of resources and services.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.800
We really sort of attempt to try to
empower teachers and students themselves.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.390
Teachers manage all content.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.910
It's really their responsibility
to approve anything that is

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.180
put up on the Internet that
reflects their students' work.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.780
Has to agree with their acceptable
use policies in their schools

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.840
and their school districts.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.890
Teachers create all of the
accounts that students use,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.430
manage all of the content.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.210
We don't do anything like that.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.500
So we're really empowering the teachers
to take control of the environment.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.760
The students can access the
Collaboratory at any time.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.400
They can access it in a computer lab.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.340
They can open up their iBooks,
sit down in the hallway and

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.000
access the Collaboratory.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.740
They can access it from home.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.120
They can access it at
their grandparents' house,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.350
showing them the things
that they're doing.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.360
So it's really a 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.360
really easy way to get the students
to access the Collaboratory.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370
They can access it from home.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.420
They can access it at
their grandparents' house,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.450
showing them the things
that they're doing.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.480
So it's really a 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.860
really easy way to get the students
to access the Collaboratory.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.050
We're the Collaboratory project,
so that sort of makes sense.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.560
And also, over the course of five years,
we really have developed

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.770
an archive of replicable,
sort of model projects that have been

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:15.170
developed by Illinois teachers and
match Illinois learning standards.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.170
Just a few statistics.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.110
We have roughly 662 participating
schools from the state of Illinois.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.200
That sort of represents 122
different school districts.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.520
2,000 or more Illinois teachers have
developed projects and worked with us.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.420
There's over 4,000 different
projects and resources,

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.000
and I'll explain that a little
bit more what that means.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.490
And we've had over 50,000 logins into the
Collaboratory project in the last year,

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.630
and that's not browsing our website.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.970
That's actually students and teachers
doing work in the Collaboratory.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.230
So here's our login page.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.230
Very simple designs.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.940
Once you log in,
I'm going to spend a few minutes

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.850
sort of showing you some of the
aspects of the Collaboratory,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.630
like alerts and interests,
the communication services that are

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.020
integrated across all of the communities,
what we call projects and activities,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.380
the various resources that teachers
use to work with those activities,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.100
our online e-courses
that we've developed,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.560
and our whole volunteers, ask an expert,
sort of knowledge-based

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.980
system that we've developed.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.780
And all this has been developed
in WebObjects over the

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.570
course of the last two years.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.120
So when a teacher or student logs in,
they basically come to what

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.300
we call their headlines page.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.420
The headlines page is
customizable so that they can

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.800
be receiving some up-to-date
information whenever they log in,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.200
and they can sort of set the time frame
that they want to be aware of things

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.080
that are happening in the collaboratory.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.760
So in this example, we're seeing some,
when a student logs in,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.180
they can see any sort of announcements
that the collaboratory might

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.060
like to make them aware of.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.160
They can see if they have any alerts.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.530
If they're a teacher and any
content has been added to any

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.360
project that they've been managed,
they get various alerts and

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.750
links that they can directly
go and manage that content,

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.420
approve it, edit it, delete it,
whatever is important for them to do.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.060
They also get sort of tickled.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.080
They get tickled about if
they have any messages.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.070
Those messages can be
from their students.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.080
It can be messages from other teachers.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.080
It can be messages from any
collaboratory participant.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.080
They also can see if they
have any invitations.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.670
Invitations can be sent out by
teachers to other teachers and

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.080
students to participate in shared
projects that they might have.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.680
You also get links to
your project calendar.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.680
So if you're a student,
you can see exactly if there's

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:53.680
anything happening currently.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.680
If there's anything happening today
or this week or in the coming month.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.730
And finally,
you can see if there's any new

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.610
interests that may have occurred.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.660
And interests are things that you're
interested in the collaboratory.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.680
You sort of fill out a profile.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.680
And anything new that's been
created in the collaboratory

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.570
in whatever time frame you set,
you then get direct links to it.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.680
So if you're interested in math,
if you're interested in science,

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.260
or if you're interested in haiku poetry,
you can attempt to sort of

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.280
keep in contact with all of
the things that are happening.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.280
There's also search mechanisms
where you can go directly to it.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.590
So we have an integrated
set of internal messaging,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.740
very similar in a lot of ways to email,
but it's purely internal for

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.260
collaboratory participants.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.080
Anybody who knows email would
feel quite comfortable using this.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.890
We have a set of project-based calendars,
so any project that a

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.600
student is involved with,
they'll have a calendar for it.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.220
And actually, students use this as
sort of their jump point,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:54.900
generally.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.680
When they log in,
quite often they'll check their messages,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.550
go look at their calendar,
see if they have any activities

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.610
or events occurring on that day.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:10.030
We also have an online discussion room,
chats that students and teachers can use.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:15.010
We have threaded discussion forums that
can be integrated with any project.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.970
The Collaboratory project is really,
the main focal point

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.800
is a curriculum unit,
a project that a teacher creates.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.700
This is some examples of screens
of sort of forms-based screens,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.590
how a teacher would create a project.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.470
Each project can have
a series of activities.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:41.300
These activities are all linked to
resources that we've created and are all

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.700
aligned with Illinois learning standards.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.700
And here's some examples
of the interface we built.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.020
So we've actually taken all of the
Illinois learning standards and put

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.800
them in our own database and can,
through a very nice, easy interface,

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.700
link them directly to any activities
that the teachers are doing.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.130
This is really important.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.920
I know probably a lot of you aren't
sort of involved in education right now,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.700
but this is very important
in K-12 education.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.430
You're sort of teaching to the
standards in a lot of states,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.440
so it's very important
to be able to do that.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.410
So I'm going to show you very
quickly sort of our four core

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.030
resources that have been built.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.860
It's called the Cybrary, MediaSpace,
Internet Book Club,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.370
and the Survey Studio.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:32.900
So the first one I want to show is an
example of a cyber force that a teacher

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.290
developed called Robots and Robotics,
sort of a typical curriculum

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.750
unit you might have.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.470
A cyber is an online library of
internet resources or internet URLs that

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:50.350
are pre-searched and customized
for a particular curriculum unit.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.150
So a teacher can create a
cyber for a curriculum unit,

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.800
can create categories under that cyber,
and under those categories there can be a

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.300
whole series of links that a student can
click on and go off onto the internet.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.230
The cyber is available for any student
who has access to that project.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.630
The cyber can also be used
by other teachers in their

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.300
projects that they develop.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.370
This is an example of
what we call media space,

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.690
physics, AP thermal dynamics.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:27.490
This is just a very simple place for
students to publish on the internet.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.190
It can have text, graphics, sound,
and video incorporated into it.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.140
This is something called
the Internet Book Club,

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.190
and it's exactly like it sounds.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:42.310
Students can post book reviews,
original compositions, original essays,

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.200
share and collaborate
with other students.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.320
And I always throw this
one up for shock value,

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.170
roadkill monitoring.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.560
This is a real project,
sort of environmental

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.010
science project in Illinois,
and I won't get into

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.990
the gory details of it,
but what they're using

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.410
here is our survey studio,
which is an online way

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.200
to do data collection,
pre and post testing.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.190
It's all browser-based.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.180
Data can be displayed in pie charts and
bar charts and various other graphics.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.710
charts and various other graphs.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.240
We also have developed a whole
series of online e-courses.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.880
As we started to extend into
throughout the state of Illinois,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.940
we couldn't really go out and
do workshops for everybody,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.900
so we've moved all of
our workshops online.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.290
We wrote our own interface
in order to do this.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.380
And we really very heavily use
volunteers who man our ask an expert

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:45.070
system and sort of man our knowledge
base and help out in the discussion

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.900
rooms and conference centers.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.630
So, some specifics.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.900
That should give you
some idea of what we do.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.980
We've been doing this for a little
more than two and a half years now.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.210
We've been using WebObjects.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.160
We're at WebObjects 5.0.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.150
Our deployment is on a Sun server,
which is an educational system.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.200
We're running an
educational grant from Sun.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.180
It's an E250, and we're running Apache.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.630
Our development is all
still done on Windows 2000,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.110
because it's sort of legacy systems,
although we're really

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.780
hoping now to move to OS X.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.520
Our database is Microsoft SQL Server.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:25.250
Our database servers are all Dell,
and right now we're using

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.580
JTurbo JDBC drivers.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.580
Our web server is IIS.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.520
And we're basically using CVS.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.200
Our web server is our
version control system.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.590
And we, at any given time, we have, oh,
seven to ten developers,

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.200
both full and part time.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.200
Four full time staff and then
a whole series of Northwestern

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.200
University students are involved in it.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.160
This is our staff here.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.170
And I don't know if any of you
are on the Omni group list,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.630
but Jonathan Rockind is one
of our lead programmers.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.690
He's a very heavy contributor.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.340
Unique problems solved.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.180
We really feel like we sort of
know the directions we're going,

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.560
and we can really start to reap the
benefits of object-oriented programming.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.080
So we've tried to develop a whole
series of what we loosely call learning

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.650
media and display objects that really
form the core basis of all of our

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.520
next generation of applications that
we're writing for the Collaboratory.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.460
Learning objects,
loosely we describe as things like

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:35.280
objects that allow for reflection,
assessment, annotation, pure critiquing,

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.010
focused feedback,
things like that that really allow

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.480
for enhanced collaboration with the
work that students are putting up.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.820
Media objects are sort
of just like they sound,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.990
ways of displaying various media types.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.180
And then display objects that
really just give us consistent

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.890
ways for interface design,
layout, navigation.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.040
Sequencing.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.460
Here's an example of one of
our new applications that we're

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.160
writing called the ePortfolio.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.030
A student might have a project
that they wish to publish.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.960
They would pick a display component,
display object from a series of

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.880
things that we make available.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.640
They can then upload content in there.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.830
That content can be any media type,
can be text, graphics, sound, video,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.090
PDFs, URL links, anything like that.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.720
Each of this is divided up into various
components and sort of interchangeable.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.160
All of these are reusable components
that we can plug into all of our

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.180
next generation of applications.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.960
Sort of up at the top,
you can kind of see a

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.160
little icon for F and D.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:46.160
Those stand for our discussion forum.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.380
So at any point,
any of these objects can have feedback

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.170
and critiques and reflection added to it.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.850
That might be a discussion forum.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.440
It might be a chat room.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.810
It could even be a cybery
that might be added to it.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.860
As far as reusability,
all of our accounts, groups,

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.640
authentication, and permissions can all
be reused very easily.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.470
We have our set of core learning
media and display objects.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.470
All our JavaScript and style sheet
components are completely reusable.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.640
We've developed a whole series of
interface widgets that give all of

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.480
our applications a real consistent
look and feel to the interface design.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:32.000
So, we're expecting to grow to
over 100,000 accounts in 2003.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:37.120
We plan to add additional WebObjects
servers and load balancing as needed.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.600
We'll be upgrading to
Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.700
upgrading our QuickTime servers to
handle the increase in QuickTime that

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.580
we see happening in K-12 schools.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.600
So, I'll sort of stop here.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.460
Again, this is our website here.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.350
And I just,
one point that I didn't mention

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.060
is that all of the services,
because we're sponsored by the

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:07.140
Illinois State Board of Education,
all of the services,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.750
the Collaboratory is completely free
to potentially over 2 million students

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.700
and teachers in the state of Illinois.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.350
And I don't think we could
ever begin to attempt to,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.580
you know, handle that scalability.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.720
We're scaling up without having
something with the rapid deployment

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.510
capabilities of WebObjects.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.190
So, thank you very much.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.800
Thank you very much
for that presentation.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.460
It's just really nice to see
something that has both simplicity

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.230
and also in terms of being,
you know,

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.190
the students and the teachers can use it.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.890
I think it's really interesting
that it can empower them to

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.100
navigate the whole thing.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.240
Nice usability and everything.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.940
And we're not going to have
Q&A on individual sessions

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.440
or individual speakers.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.030
What we're going to do is at the end,
I'm sure that, you know,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.480
a lot of people probably want to network
and have some specific questions on

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.680
maybe what they did or how they did it.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.020
So we're going to have people
kind of over on the side here.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:21.570
I'd like to introduce our next speaker,
Matt Firlik from PowerSchool.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.700
Thank you.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.200
As Bob said, I'm a WebObjects engineer
from PowerSchool.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.990
Just to begin,
can I see a show of hands of

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.800
people who have either seen,
used, or heard about PowerSchool?

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.540
Not counting the people that work here.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.450
Okay, thank you.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.760
A little bit about what is PowerSchool.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.740
A little over a year ago,
Apple purchased PowerSchool.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.900
It's a company based up in
the Sacramento area in Folsom.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.560
In their four-year tenure as a
software development company,

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.530
they've been working on a
student information system,

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.860
sometimes shortened to SIS,
to work with K-12 districts to

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.150
manage all their information,
assets, and the like about the mechanics

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.150
of actually being a school system.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.160
Now, as a division of Apple,
we're actually continuing to develop

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.860
this application and add it to the
education resources that Apple provides.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.410
To talk about why we're using WebObjects,
we need to go back and talk about

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.870
the beginning of PowerSchool
and the incipients when

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.360
PowerSchool became a company.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.500
The application was developed by
a very small group of developers,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.960
a very small team, using 4D.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.910
They developed a web-based application
to implement different administrative

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.960
functionalities and pieces for
student information systems.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.260
As the popularity grew and they
had more and more customers

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.230
come into the application,
they started to increase the volume in

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.860
the application and started to scale
up the number of users and access and

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.820
information the application provided.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.400
It reached a functional limit
at some point of about 7,500

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.010
users with the maximum capacity,
based partially on the tool,

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.160
the fact the database is in memory,
some other limitations.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.710
As the application did
become more and more popular,

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.760
we started to see different metrics
on how the application could be used

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.660
and where it was actually applicable.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.110
It's interesting to note that 80%
of the school districts across the

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.290
United States fall into the category
of being around 7,500 students.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:21.210
The interesting metric therein, though,
is that that represents only about 20%

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.340
of the students in the United States.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.340
So as the application became
more and more popular,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.200
it became increasingly more important
to target a larger audience,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.960
the other 80% of those
students that were out there.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.120
To do so,

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.150
We needed a tool to do so,
and that's why we're here.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.230
As the use of WebObjects
allowed the application to

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.630
scale to a larger set of users,
giving us a feasibility to

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.200
attract larger audiences,
larger sets of schools,

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.190
provide larger functionality
to migrate the application

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.800
to better serve their needs.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.880
So the application we're going
to talk about today is the

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.700
PowerSchool Enterprise version,
which is written in WebObjects.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.440
The application, you may think,
power school.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.710
Obviously teachers and students.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.250
But there are large constituents,
audiences that we need to

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.460
handle and a various number of
users that we need to address.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.220
Students and parents make up the
largest audience for the application.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.790
Obviously parents and students are
going to want to go on and look

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.600
at information about the student,
about the curriculum,

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.110
about the events at the school.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.040
Being the largest audience though,
they represent the smallest amount

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.760
of functionality for our application.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.100
Information is typically relegated
to either the school district or the

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.200
school or the individual student.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.240
So our largest user base is
actually the lowest amount of

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.340
functionality for us to implement.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.840
At a more moderate level
is teachers and staff.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.200
Information like grades and the like,
which we'll go into in a little bit,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.900
represents a moderate
amount of functionality.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.520
There are more teachers, pardon me,
less teachers,

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.540
but it's actually more functionality.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.080
We need to start talking
about aggregate information.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.500
We need to start talking about
aggregate information of students,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.980
grades per classes,
looking at class information,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.390
comparisons, looking at information
across whole semesters.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.060
So while it's a fewer number of users,
it's actually a larger amount of

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.570
information that we need to manage.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.240
Additionally though is administrators.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.390
Administrators represent the smallest
audience for the application.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.590
Typically a very few
administrators per district,

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.140
but it's actually the largest
feature set we need to implement.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.900
Information about aggregate
sets across an entire district,

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.000
looking at grades for an
entire school district.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.260
So the application needs
to handle disparate users,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.490
disparate types of users,
and disparate pieces of functionality.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.090
There's actually a lot of
overlap between what teachers

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.490
and parents and students can do,
teachers and administrators can do.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.740
So we needed to find a
way to bridge the gap,

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.610
not only lots of different users,
but how to span lots of

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.930
different functionalities,
even overlapping across

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.730
the large set of users.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.620
Parents and students typically
use the PowerSchool application

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.960
in ways to foster communication.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.300
We give them the ability to look
at real-time status information,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.410
grades for the student,
personal calendars for the events going

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.340
on that are important to the students,
also future assignments that

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.580
the teachers can put in.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.580
This information is extremely valuable.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.680
Obviously,
it's important to the students to

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.780
know exactly how they're doing in
their classes on a daily basis.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.070
It's also important for
the parents to know that.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.380
Sometimes, I think we all know that notes
can get lost in backpacks or

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.720
someone can say they did well on
a grade and not necessarily do so.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.110
The development of this kind of
communication between parents,

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.720
students,
and teachers in a way that's actually,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.330
in some ways, unavoidable.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.590
That a student can always see
their current information,

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.690
parents can always see
their current information,

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.350
and it allows a way for them to interact.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.370
So students are no longer trying to forge
signatures on notes to their parents.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.670
They're probably just trying
to hack their passwords,

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.310
but it's a little bit different
problems we have these days.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:37.820
.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.930
Teachers use the application
for information access,

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.620
providing them a way to look at all the
information about their classes and all

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.940
the information about their students.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.830
Important is a two-way communication
with the information system,

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.080
the ability for them to put in
information from grades to students to

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.290
calendars and schedules into the system,
but also see that information reflected

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.170
out instantaneously on how their
students are doing across a particular

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.060
schedule per semester by term.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.390
Ease of information is
extremely important to them.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.270
When you start looking at the
old school way of doing things

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.700
with grading books and having to
summarize and tally up grades,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.100
we provide them an easy way
to look at this information.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.410
We also provide an easy way
to look at the information

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.980
regardless of their location.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.660
The ability to look at this information
and input it in the classroom if you

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:29.180
have time or wait until later to go
home and look at the information gives

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.920
them the ability to span their work
accordingly and work from any location.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.630
Administrators probably reap the most
benefit of the centralized administration

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.130
and information that we provide.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.400
The WebObjects application,
centrally located,

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.140
gives us the ability to provide secure
access to real-time information.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.940
As teachers are putting in grades,
they can start to see how the

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.660
grade point average is looking
for the entire district.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.650
Giving the ability to manage
the large sets of information,

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.860
looking at the student population
in larger sets or in larger chunks.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.900
And also provide
mechanisms for reporting.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.900
Reporting is an extremely valuable and
important tool for school districts.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.150
Reporting is a way that they get
funding of being able to report to state

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:11.100
institutions and educational institutions
on how the schools are doing,

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.200
what the schools are doing,
particular events as such.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.510
So the application gives the
administrators the ability to

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.300
look at large-scale pieces of
information and use it accordingly.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:28:12.100
[Transcript missing]

00:28:14.200 --> 00:29:48.100
[Transcript missing]

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.510
The second is data validation.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.230
We have lots of data.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.430
Lots and lots and lots and lots of data.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.110
And the problem is figuring out
how to take that data and make it

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.660
useful to all of our customers.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.890
Not every customer uses all of our data.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.840
Lots of customers have
more data than others.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.170
And we need to find a way to
not only manage that data,

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.360
but validate that data
with different rule sets,

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.380
different kinds of security measures
to accommodate for each one of

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.040
our particular types of users.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.430
So the EOF and the ability to
model our data differently based

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.200
on particular applications,
based on particular users,

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.200
using the user info information
in the model to store particular

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.920
information on validation,
gives us the ability to encompass

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.150
validation in a way that would
not be possible otherwise.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.490
As mentioned before,
state reporting is an extremely

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.500
valuable tool and an extremely large
requirement for all of our users.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.390
Implementing something on
top of the object model,

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.200
there are a number of
tools out there to do so.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.220
We've actually implemented a
state reporting system that uses

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:47.930
an XSLT template using Apache's
FOP formatting objects implementation

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.170
to generate PDFs on the fly,
generate, in some cases,

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.590
ad hoc reports of different
kinds of queries and information

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.430
that we need to show,
giving users the ability

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:59.180
to take custom data sets,
custom information,

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.900
and generate reports for
their particular institution,

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.690
which is extremely valuable.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.130
We have a number of different external
systems we need to integrate with.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.830
As I've spoken before,
we have a scheduling engine that

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.900
we need to integrate with to do
a large amount of scheduling.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.780
And by no means is scheduling
an easy thing when you consider

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.860
different kinds of students,
different kinds of class schedules,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.900
different kinds of courses
that need to be implemented.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.100
We also have external systems
for state-required things

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.130
like CSIS to integrate with,
the ability to take aggregate sets

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.900
of our information and shuttle it
off to other systems for information,

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.300
use their system to pull
information into our application.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.800
Multi-platform support is extremely
important when you consider

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.640
that what we're working on is
a shrink-wrapped application.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.070
It's an application that we need
to deliver to these users to

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.740
install in their environment and
customize in their environment.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.100
So the ability to use
different kinds of platforms,

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.950
different kinds of
installations of web servers,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.340
databases, architecture platforms,
gives us the ability to span

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.100
this to multiple kinds of users,
multiple installations,

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.810
without changing our install base,
without changing our code to handle

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.770
the different kinds of users.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.950
But the flexibility truly comes when
we start talking about a shrink-wrapped

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.210
application that you need to customize.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.340
We can't assume that every single school
district does things in the same way.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.960
So by doing things in frameworks,
by doing things in components,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.010
by remembering that we need to put in
hooks and delegates in certain places

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.210
to provide custom functionality,
we can create an application

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.240
that has a core set that you
can customize based on the user,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.350
based on the implementation,
to use the core set of features,

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.760
but also do exactly what they need.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:35.280
Typical deployment of PowerSchool
takes one of two forms right now.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.300
Typically,
they'd look at something like an

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:42.300
IIS on a Windows machine running
SQL Server or a hybrid installation

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.440
running Apache on Oracle and Solaris.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.860
An example of deployments
that we try and target,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:54.050
a typical district of 20,000 students
is one of our types of customers,

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.630
but we also do statewide deployments,
something where you span

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.570
multiple districts or all the
districts in an entire district,

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.480
I'm pardoning, district in the state,
to bring all their information together.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.110
But we also target the other side,
which is a single school in a

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.660
district with over 200,000 students.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.610
So our application varies on
implementation size based on the

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.910
particular customer that we're targeting.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.690
The application was developed
initially in WebObjects 4,

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.330
and it's been moved up
to the latest version,

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.230
5.5.1.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:24.130
It was done all in Java,
so there was no porting from Objective-C.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.140
Development is all done on
Project Builder on Mac OS X.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.730
We have about 25 developers
at any one time working with

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.100
revision control through Perforce,
and our database of choice

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.450
internally would be Oracle.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.990
We spoke about how we broke up the
applications and functional pieces.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.340
We also break up our
development in that way.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.340
We have functional teams
developing the applications,

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.520
specific applications for
particular types of users,

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.800
but we also have a team of developers
working on core frameworks based

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.740
on solutions or utilities so
that they can look at the large

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.040
scope of the application and start
developing classes and different

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.010
implementations as the need arises.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.250
We also have back-end database engineers,
in particular engineers for scheduling,

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.040
that can focus on those systems
and provide us the ability

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.830
to seamlessly integrate that.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.850
But in addition to our development teams,
we also have a bunch of

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.800
teams working with us,
from marketing and analysis,

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.270
going out and getting the
large binders of requirements

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.080
that we all know and love,
to go ahead and figure out

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.010
how to implement those.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.040
We have full teams of quality
assurance and tech pubs to go

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.640
and validate what we're doing and
tell us we're not doing it right,

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.980
but also to document what we're doing and
provide that functionality to our users.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.970
And we also have full
implementation and training,

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.800
is that once we take
this application out,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.020
we have engineers that know
about Waylogic's deployment,

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.770
how to take this application out,
ship it to customers,

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.410
and work in their particular
environments and make it work.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.240
Up next for PowerSchool is working
on our interface usability as we

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.430
have more and more customers in
larger applications trying to make

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:54.530
the UI work a little bit better,
find better ways to interface,

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.890
provide that functionality
to our particular users.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.100
Also looking into
deployments all on Mac OS X.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.860
Find a way to do a single server
installation running on Mac OS X database

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.250
web server in the whole nine yards.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.740
And features, features, features,
as everyone knows and loves.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.940
So that's just a little
bit about PowerSchool.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.040
If you want to find more
about the application,

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:14.900
there is a website.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.240
abl.com/powerschool,
which talks about the application

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.800
and the things we provide.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.540
Thank you.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:37.340
Thank you, Matt.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:44.130
Great example of also showing sort of
the engineering process behind that and

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:49.740
kind of like how you can leverage off of
the ability of the separation of function

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.740
that WebObjects gives you and then
represent that sort of organizationally.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.040
Also another good example,
you can see how in both of these

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.430
education examples how the state
requirements and reporting and things

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.580
start creeping into your requirements.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.820
So I would like to
introduce our next speaker,

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:17.960
Thomas Lehmann,
who will tell us about Deutsche Bank and

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.460
their online banking application system.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.200
Okay, let's begin.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.590
Okay, a little introduction
about Deutsche Bank 24.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.370
It's a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:45.200
I think it's one of the five
largest banks in the world.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:52.490
And Deutsche Bank 24 has 2 million
customers using our web application.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.190
This web application is
built with WebObjects.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:05.690
Since 1986 we have an applet
solution and then we moved in 1998 to

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:10.490
WebObjects 3.5 and program in Java.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:15.140
So let's have a look
at what it looks like.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.800
Okay, this login page,
you have to provide

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.630
your account number and

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:28.200
[Transcript missing]

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:34.280
And as you can see, the web pages are
working on Mac OS X too,

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.100
not only on Windows.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:42.090
We even provide Linux as
a user interface.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.800
And we are able,
with the same application,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:51.200
to provide a different user interface,
like here.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.540
And again,
you can see the asset overview.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.580
Okay, which problems have we solved?

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.580
In our environment,
we have a legacy system

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.050
we have to talk to,
and this is done by

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.450
COBRA-based middleware.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:15.460
And so we have to program some
classes to use COBRA easily.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.790
Then we have business objects.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:24.860
These are based on the IDL definitions
of objects in the COBRA layer.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:34.880
And so it's easy to transport data from
our application to the legacy systems.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.740
We have built a navigation concept.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:46.510
It's just a concept because you have
to program a lot for a new application.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:55.800
We have programmer rules
that makes life easier.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:55.800
Then we are able to

00:38:56.210 --> 00:39:00.160
Provide multi-language
support and multi-layout.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.470
Multi-layout you have seen and
multi-language we are able to,

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.430
in addition to the German language,
our English language,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:18.340
but there are business cases we have
to provide a right and correct text,

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:18.340
and so it's a very complicated process.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:26.100
Okay, and we are able to,
using a chip called link automation,

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:30.280
authentication with our application
instead of the account number and

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.070
PIN we provide in the login page.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.740
And that's done with an applet,
with a faceless applet and

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.510
live connect in a web browser.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.340
And then, that's the great impact
on our application.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.160
We can handle heavy load.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.140
Okay, so what we are using to
build these applications,

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.320
we have WebObjects for sure,
and on Win2K,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.630
we have a CVS server on Ulnux.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:02.770
We have an Oracle database,
and we've stored our

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.330
little data over JDPC.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:08.890
We have the homegrown middleware
for the enterprise application

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.020
integration for the legacy systems.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:18.250
And our test environment is on Solaris,
and we have an SSL Apache web

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.070
server on Linux.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.910
Okay, we're up to five developers.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.500
It's a small team.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.780
They are fast enough to make
changes and build the application.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.140
So what can we use in other applications?

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:42.970
We have built a component framework,
a visual component framework that takes

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.270
Input fields with generic input
validation we can provide on

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:52.640
these input fields error messages
right by these input fields.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.650
Okay, then formatted currency
values and selection lists

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.060
are configured by XML data.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:06.080
And again, the navigation concept,
two parts in this.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.670
We can configure the logic
in the navigation with XML,

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:17.950
and how does it look like is done
in a component with HTML text.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.590
Okay,
and then we have core implementation,

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.590
what we think should,
and every bank likes account and

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.900
securities and something like that.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:34.430
And this is done,
we have used this in three other banks,

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.330
and it works very fine.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.680
Okay, now scalability.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.200
That's a very important thing here.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.900
We have two Sun-E 10,000 machines
running WebObjects instances.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:50.710
We have 480 instances.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:58.770
The writing time of these slides are
150,000 customers logged in every day,

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:02.300
but now it's about 200,000.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:07.720
The maximum we measured
in the past are 400,000.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:13.620
The customers logging in
every day on this special day.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:19.060
Okay, and then, okay,
web server's handling 11.5

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:24.920
million HTTP requests,
so it's 25 gigabytes of net traffic.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:30.790
Okay, architecture,
it's like every WebObjects

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.700
deployment environment.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:36.370
We have a web server,
we have an application server,

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.080
and we have, for us, they are legacy

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.540
Okay, in the middle is the ETN.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:48.210
There are the two ETN-K boxes and with
the WebObject instances in the middle

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:51.600
there and four different legacy systems.

00:42:52.550 --> 00:43:00.350
So we have moved from
WebObjects 4.5 to WebObjects 5.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:05.550
And we have a lot of
performance enhancements here.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.560
And you can see we have a
stress testing one hour.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.660
And the blue line is the WebObjects 4.5.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:20.680
There is a lot of CPU usage
in 4.5 and in WebObjects 5.0.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.420
You have a little usage of the
CPU with the same task pace.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.290
and Tex Hule.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:37.280
We have significantly more
performance with WebObjects 5.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:38.670
It's in real life.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:44.100
We have 200% faster application.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.030
We have a very small CPU workload
you have seen on the slide before

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:55.760
and have improved availability and
reliability of the application.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:03.190
In 4.5 they have many problems
to provide a reliable system.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.100
WebObjects 5 is much easier to do this.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:11.710
Okay, and then the conclusion we have,
with the same hardware we can serve five

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.020
times more customers with WebObjects 5.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:24.650
So what have we to do to move
from Folder 5 to WebObjects 5?

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:31.390
There are scripts provided from
Apple to do the conversion,

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.130
and they solve 90% of the issues.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:41.140
We have a little problem with
Log4j because it's for JDK 1.1.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.370
There's another Log4j version,
and they have changed a lot

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.700
of things in Log4j for JDK 2.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.240
We have to do these changes,
and because we're using

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.380
Log4j for logging,
we have a lot of things to

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.640
do in the whole application.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:01.000
We have no problems with
the chip card communication.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:04.350
It's a little bit surprising for us,
but it works again.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:08.080
I think that should be done here.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.570
Thank you very much
for that presentation.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.740
I am very,
very pleased to have Deutsche Bank as

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.700
an enterprise customer,
somebody out there who is really,

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.270
really pushing very,
very hard on WebObjects besides,

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.300
you know,
we always talk about the Apple Store.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.690
It's very nice to have somebody else out
there who is really pushing the edge.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:44.510
And my other favorite slide is the
guy by moving from Java on 4.5.1

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:49.300
to Java on 5 that they were able
to take care of four times as many

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.540
customers with the same hardware.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:55.280
So I want to thank the
WebObjects team for doing that.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.490
And I want to thank
Deutsche Bank for giving us that

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.860
information and that feedback.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:04.440
That's great.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:10.290
Our next application and our
next speaker is Michael Buening,

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:14.630
and he is with Weblecon,
and a very interesting application

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.560
in personal information management.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.890
I think you'll enjoy this.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.320
Thanks Bob.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.790
Hi everybody,
thanks for coming out this morning.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:30.600
My name is Michael Buening
from Baplikon Technologies.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:34.200
Baplikon Technologies is a
software development company.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.600
We are located in Berlin,
the one in Germany.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.020
We were founded in summer
2000 and we specialized in

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.890
personal information management.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.680
That's what I'd like to
present to you today.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.700
It's a Weblicon PIM,
Personal Information Manager,

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.740
intended to be used by
telecommunication companies,

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:56.960
portals, or corporates.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:02.040
It's a fully-featured organizer that
lets you manage your address book,

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:07.160
your calendar, your to-dos,
as well as your emails, SMS, or MMS.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.780
Let me just quickly explain SMS/MMS,
just in case you're

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.030
not familiar with that.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.660
SMS means short messaging service.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:23.660
It lets you send messages up to 140
characters to GSM mobile phones.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.940
It's very popular in Europe.

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:32.350
I think at the end of last year
we had an amount of 150 million

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.190
messages sent over the GSM networks.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.780
It's probably much more by now.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.160
MMS means multimedia messaging service.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.960
It's a new upcoming standard
for mobile messaging.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.820
It's also a new standard for sending
multimedia content to mobile phones.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:52.090
The Weblicon organizer lets you do that,
and it's done using Apple's

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.590
outstanding WebObjects framework.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:48:05.110
We started developing using WebObjects
4.5 and moved to 4.5 this year.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:06.600
How is it done?

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:12.040
Let me show you the basic architecture.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:18.710
So you can access server data
from your PC or preferably a Mac.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:24.130
or your mobile GSM phone
using six different clients.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:26.590
Let me introduce the clients to you.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:31.580
The first one will be HTML,
just a web browser.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:37.000
We do not use JavaScript or
cascading style sheets.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:43.480
Just plain HTML 3.2,
so virtually every web browser will do.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.160
The second one is the Java Client.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:51.180
It's a highly interactive
Java swing desktop application using

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.480
WebObjects Java Client technology.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.890
So, third one, SyncML.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:01.740
SyncML is a protocol for synchronizing
data between different devices.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:07.170
The WebLicense Server is SyncML certified
by the SyncML organization,

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:11.960
and you can synchronize your
data on your PC with server data

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:17.360
using our native clients for
Outlook on Windows or Windows CE,

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.670
or using a palm conduit for your PDA.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:28.630
Or you use SyncML-capable GSM phone
like the Nokia Communicator

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:30.940
or the Ericsson T68.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:33.190
So, the first client is WML.

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:39.040
WML means Wireless Markup Language.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:44.900
So,
any warp capable gsm phone uh... will do

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:46.970
The fifth one is Voice XML.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.110
It's even more simple.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.860
All you need is a phone
and you can dial a service.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:55.300
For example, your latest email will
be announced to you.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.180
Last but not least, J2ME.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:01.850
It's a Java midlet running
on J2ME-capable devices like

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.240
the latest mobile phones.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:10.200
We have a server application
running for each client.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:10.200
That's the yellow layer.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.400
Usually,
each server application uses a couple

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:20.340
of frameworks that will provide the
user interface for the certain tasks,

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.440
like address book, calendar, and so on.

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:28.520
And we have shared frameworks,
shared between those server applications,

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.590
that will provide data.

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:36.600
So database access is done
transparently using EOF,

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.600
which is represented by the yellow layer.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.420
Actually, there's one layer missing
because the standard architecture

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.400
diagram has only five layers.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:51.590
There should be a layer between those
shared frameworks and the EOF containing

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:56.600
our business logic and our foundation
frameworks and utility frameworks.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.840
So as I said, database access uses EOF,
which means all the

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.110
data is handled as EO,
Enterprise Objects,

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:11.140
inside the applications,
even messaging information.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.500
So what databases can you use?

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:18.420
First is LDAP for storing
user or contact information.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.330
We are using JNDI to access
the directory servers,

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:27.240
and we tested against OpenLDAP,
the Netscape directory server,

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.880
and the Critical Path directory server.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.630
At BMS databases,

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:37.440
Well, you can use any database you
have an adapter or driver for.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:43.700
So we're using JDBC adapter for Oracle,
FrontBase, or OpenBase.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:49.250
And you can switch between
LDAP and RDBMS as data store

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:51.960
for contact or user information.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:57.700
And the third one is not that usual,
I think.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:03.190
We're using an IMAP server as
a data store for ERF to store

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.670
our messaging information.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.760
Therefore, we implemented an object store
using some Java mail package

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:13.450
that connects to the IMAP server.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.680
So let's have a closer view of
how client requests are handled

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.040
and responses are generated.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.430
For standard browser requests,
we use WebObjects.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.240
You probably know about that.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:30.680
But we have two additional
frameworks that are used by

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:33.560
the other server applications.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:38.500
The WML server application
uses WAP objects.

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:43.230
It's a framework that handles
requests coming from a WAP browser

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.100
and generates WML responses.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:50.120
We acquired the code and
adapted and ported it.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.400
It's pretty much the same with VoiceXML.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.430
It uses a VoiceXML objects framework.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:00.460
It's a plug-in to WebObjects as
well as a WAP objects framework.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:05.040
VoiceXML objects was developed
by Vaplicon and handles requests

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:08.500
from a VoiceXML browser,
generates VoiceXML responses.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:12.980
So again, you have the different
server applications and the

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.430
shared framework layer there.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:19.860
So that's how it's done, basically.

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:22.460
Let's have a look at how it looks like.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.730
I've got some screenshots for you.

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:28.780
So, first of all,
let me mention we have a common

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.660
design pattern for HTML applications.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:37.850
You have a list of modules,
which represent the address book or the

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:42.900
calendar or messaging on the left hand,
and you have a toolbar on top,

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:47.350
which provides basic
functionality like saving changes,

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:51.960
creating new objects, deleting them,
switching between views,

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.820
or browsing through data.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.010
So, this one is the address book.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:01.820
It shows you a sortable
list of your contacts.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.440
They're sortable by columns.

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:07.200
You have full content search
capability at the upper right corner.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.580
And you can group your contacts.

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.790
The contacts group,
the lowest entry in the

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.130
list is a contact group.

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:19.230
It's quite convenient when sending
messages to a bunch of people.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.760
I'll come to that later.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.760
Next one.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.480
It shows the contact editor.

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:28.880
You can browse through your
contacts by using previous and

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:30.800
next buttons in the toolbar.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:34.380
And you can have multiple
communication data entries.

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.620
You're not limited to just
having one fax number,

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.970
because you just have one field for it.

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:44.360
You can have as many as you want.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.910
This one shows the messaging module,
again a toolbar at the top.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.940
On the left hand you have a
hierarchical view of your mailboxes.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:57.420
You can add one, rename them, sort them.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:02.170
On the right hand you have a sortable
list of your messages showing your

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:04.480
emails or your SMS in one list.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.060
Below that you see the content
of the selected message.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.520
You can file those messages
into your mailboxes by using

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.700
the small arrows there.

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:17.600
This one actually goes
down to the IMAP server,

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.110
so if you use any other
IMAP client like Outlook,

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:26.800
you will see exactly the
same structures there.

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:34.360
This one is the email editor
subject to CCBCC text.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:36.270
You can

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:40.050
Add and upload attachments,
like any other email client.

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:45.030
Any of that list on the right
hand that lets you find and add

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.700
addresses from your address book.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:53.170
It's pretty convenient to
pick a contact group there,

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:58.480
then the message will be sent
to all the members of the group.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:04.050
This is Calendar,
showing all your appointments that month.

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:07.720
You have an overview calendar
on the right hand that lets

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.880
you quickly access months,
weeks, and days.

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.600
The calendar week view.

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:21.300
Let me mention that the WebDecon
pyramid is fully localized.

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.500
We are currently
supporting six languages.

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.520
And it's fully customizable
in look and feel,

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.930
as you will see in the next slide.

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:33.010
This is a week view again,
but this time of a different skin,

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.710
as we call it.

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:39.080
You can switch skins on the
fly and it's pretty easy to

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.770
add skins to the application.

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:45.350
You don't have to recompile,
you just put the web server resources

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:50.660
in the right place and you edit the
configuration file and you restart

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.590
the application and you're done.

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:58.500
This one is the SMS editor,
again with the custom skin.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:04.970
This time it's for KPN Mobile,
the biggest Dutch mobile phone provider.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.480
This one is live on the
website since May of last year.

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.760
Notice it's a Dutch localization.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:19.940
It's basically used for
group SMS sending there.

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:30.030
So this is how it looks like
if you access it using a mobile

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:34.090
phone with a web browser.

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:35.980
On top you see the main menu.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:41.730
The one below shows the day view
of two appointments that day.

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.810
Again, WML server.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.130
It's your address book main view.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.830
Again, you have full content
search capability there.

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:56.390
The one below shows you your mailboxes,
so you can check your mail on

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:59.090
the road using your mobile phone.

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:03.460
So this one looks pretty
much like the HTML calendar,

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:03.880
but it's not.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:09.400
It's the Java client,
Java swing desktop application using

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:12.860
WebObjects to Java client technology.

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:17.310
And it features almost everything
you know from desktop applications

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:20.780
like multiple selection and
drag and drop and so on.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:29.700
So, I have no screenshot for
VoiceXML application for obvious reasons.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.320
That means I'm through with my slides.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.300
If you want further information,
go to webdicon.com.

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:56.500
[Transcript missing]

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:07.260
Wow.

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:13.930
That's a really outstanding example
of showing how you can really push the

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:18.770
presentation layer with WebObjects and,
in fact, adding like three different

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:22.320
clients and it looked like another
adapter getting stuff in from IMAP.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:27.710
So there's really taking WebObjects
pretty far and really delivering

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:30.910
something to the end user where
they have accessibility to data

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:32.640
from anything they can pick up.

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.040
I think we should, you know,
make them do a client for

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:38.380
the iPod or something?

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.960
Okay,
and the URL for signing up for the beta.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.160
And one thing I will mention is even if
you were in one of our previous betas,

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.380
it's very important that you
sign up again because we're

00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:53.130
starting over on the list.

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:57.110
So even if you were in a previous beta,
please do go to this URL and sign up.

00:59:57.190 --> 01:00:01.570
Last chance for the lab.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.540
And please do come back
for the feedback session.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.970
That should be a rousing session.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:13.260
Who to contact?
