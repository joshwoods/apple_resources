WEBVTT

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.720
Good morning.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.600
I'd like to welcome you to session 815,
developing for the Managed Desktop.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.730
I also want to command -- or
commend your stamina for being

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.710
here at 9:00 in the morning.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.310
I think you'll find the
contents worth arriving for.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.160
With that,
I'd like to introduce Rob Neville.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.720
Thanks.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.300
Again, good morning.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.780
My name's Rob Neville.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.580
Since those of you who are here,
I think probably most of you,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.940
with the exception of a couple
people that I actually know,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.550
wanted to be here.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.740
So, welcome.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.380
This morning we're going to talk
about managing for developing

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.500
and using a managed desktop.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.320
And I want to let you know
that Mac OS X in the Jaguar

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.170
timeframe is a managed desktop.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.240
We're going to be talking about
what Apple's doing and how

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.680
that Managed Desktop works.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.660
We're going to tell you how
your applications can play

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.490
in the Mac OS X networked
environment and how you can best

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.860
fit in to this Managed Desktop.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.260
You're not going to get a choice, really.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.810
I mean,
there will be and there will continue

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.840
to be for Mac OS X individual desktops,
people using computers at

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.130
home that aren't networked,
but more and more where your

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.980
products are being utilized.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.410
And there are probably,
as I look around this audience today,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.520
too, I see a lot of people
who aren't developers,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.980
people who are actually
users of this product.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.820
And your customers are going to
be in a networked environment.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.010
They're going to be using the
management tools that we're going

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.890
to be giving you and or they're
going to be managed by them.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.880
And you all are going to have to deal
with the consequences of that management,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.180
either through an administration level,
through a support level,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.200
or through a feature level.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.760
So what we'll learn today.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.900
Well, we're going to talk a little
bit about how we got here.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.690
We're going to talk about the
Managed Desktop in Jaguar and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.200
we're going to talk about how
you can play in this environment.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.440
So how did we get here?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.140
Well, Mac OS X is inherently
a multiple user system.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.100
However, in Mac OS 8, 9, and before,
the classical Macintosh operating

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:55.200
system was not a managed and/or
multiple user environment.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.550
We did provide, however,
a suite of applications over time ending

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.930
with the Macintosh Manager applications,
which allowed you to manage work groups,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.450
individual users,
groups of resources for the network,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.110
and allowed you to give a multiple
user interface to the Macintosh OS.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.760
Again, this comes built in to Jaguar.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.770
In Mac OS X today,
it's a multiple user system.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.470
Individuals use it one at a time,
even though some people can come in

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.240
through Telnet or SSH or other mechanisms
for accessing the data on the computer.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.240
Usually there's only one person
at a keyboard with one monitor.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.590
But you can't guarantee in the long
term that that's going to be the case.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.210
Because that's the way it is now,
it doesn't mean that that's the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.240
way it's going to be next year,
the year after, the year after that.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.410
I'm not announcing any capabilities.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.320
I'm just saying that it's possible.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.700
So don't plan and don't program that
you're only going to have one individual

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.310
accessing the computer at a time.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.180
Macintosh Manager 2.1 ships
with the Mac OS X server today.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.240
It provides, as I was saying,
the multiple user functionality

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.980
to Mac OS 8 and 9.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.930
It also allows you to customize
the desktop environment.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.410
It allows you to give access to users
via work group or via individual user.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.320
It's largely used in
our education market.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.880
It's used largely in
our education market.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.210
Our education market is
our primary customer.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.780
So we're going to continue
to support this product,

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.390
this 8 and 9 product,
going forward with Macintosh

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.190
Manager as it exists today.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.360
And this product was a
follow-on to and an evolution

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.390
of Addy's Macintosh Manager 1.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.820
We took feedback from
the customers out there,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.720
we incorporated that,
and we got to where we are today

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.860
with Macintosh Manager 2.1.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.650
That's going to stay as it is.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.950
We're going to continue to support it.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.840
We're going to continue to
fix critical bugs in it.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.960
We're going to continue to ship
a version of the server that

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.290
allows you to support your 8 and
9 customers and clients out there.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.240
But we're not going to be doing any new
development on Macintosh Manager 2.1.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.840
And there is, in essence,
no need for Macintosh

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.930
Manager in Mac OS X.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.270
Mac OS X is a multiple user
desktop managed environment.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.860
And at Jaguar,
we're going to be giving the

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.320
administrators of the systems more
control over what they can manage.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.730
In the process of shipping a
multiple user system to network

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.580
customers like we have in schools,
we've learned a few things.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.730
And I want to talk about some of
the things that we've learned.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:08.830
Network traffic is not good.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.940
In the past, our primary customers,
in this case the education market,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.580
were on slow-speed networks.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:28.250
Those of us who remember the
old days of coax cable and local

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.440
talk know that those networks,
which were utilized in

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.510
schools to a great degree,
were pretty slow.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.920
Those things have been upgraded.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.300
Now they're talking about 10 megabit.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.180
If they're not talking about 10 megabit,
maybe they've got 100 megabit

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.270
or even a gigabit backbone,
but they may not have that wiring

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.120
down to the switch to the classrooms.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.100
And that's traditionally,
over the last 10 years,

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.920
been the migration that
they have moved through.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.350
However, we're actively marketing,
and people are actively

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.200
using wireless networks now.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.470
AirPort is very big,
and we are also selling lots

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.580
of AirPort-capable CPUs.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.460
I'm looking around the audience
today and I see a lot of people

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.000
with a lot of PowerBooks.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.420
There are a lot of people
with a lot of iBooks.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.500
Those iBooks are all airport capable,
and those of you who have airport

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.900
carts are probably using them
at this conference because we're

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.340
providing you airport connectivity.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.940
The airport connectivity is not fast.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.840
I mean, it's faster than local talk,
but it's not a huge pipe.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.930
And what you get here is this could be
a sample classroom or three classrooms.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.790
And if you get everybody accessing
data over the network simultaneously,

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.130
if you all had PowerBooks, network I.O.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.420
would cause a bottleneck.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.860
So network I/O in essence is bad.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.020
And that's one of the things that we've
learned is to try as much as possible to

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.490
keep our network traffic to a minimum.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:17.240
Preference storage is another thing that
we've gotten bitten by historically,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.810
one of the lessons we have learned.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.460
And to the point where
with Macintosh Manager 2.1,

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.740
we gave our users the capability
of creating home directories

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.850
for their users on the server.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.110
And they used that functionality.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.420
And what happened was we stored
then in those home directories,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.740
we stored preference files.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.670
We stored cache files.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.380
We stored all the data that
allowed a user to access a similar

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.380
environment no matter where they went.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:58.960
However, again, with multiple users,
not per machine, but per server,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.580
those people accessing that
data simultaneously over the

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.920
network could bring that network
to its knees very rapidly,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.310
especially if you're
storing a lot of data there.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.760
If you are using the cache
file or the preferences file

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.730
as just this big scratch area,
well that scratch area

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.590
may be out on the network.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.520
and it's on the network and it's accessed
by everybody in the room all at the

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.900
same time even on a fast network you're
gonna bring that network to its knees.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.650
The other thing that we noticed is that

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:40.070
With the notion of a home directory
and with the notion of the files

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:48.490
being stored on the server,
the infrastructure and or the

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:48.490
connectivity to that server is not always

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.460
Guaranteed.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.640
Especially when you're talking
about an airport environment.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.740
In an airport environment
that can go up and down,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.740
whether or not the teacher is
warming up a cup of coffee in the

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.530
room next door to the classroom,
or some big person like me walks in

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.340
front of the airport base station,
you can get interruptions.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.620
And if you are not storing your files,
at least some portion of

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.820
your scratch files locally,
and the connectivity to

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.470
the server goes away,
and you try and then write that file out,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.790
but you no longer have
a path to that file?

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.980
Some cases,
some of you in the audience have

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:31.000
written software which will crash.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.280
But in essence,
what you need to be able to do

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.510
is give the users the capability
to save the file locally,

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.870
wherever possible.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.780
Be volume independent.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.260
So, just to reiterate, the customers are
moving towards wireless.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.380
This is 11 megabit,
currently 11 megabit maximum,

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.320
and that is a shared environment,
so that goes down.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.280
A lot of our customers,
a lot of your customers,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.080
don't have robust networks, switches,
and servers, or bottlenecks.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.360
Again, to reference the preferences
and the caches again,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.320
let's say you have similar cache
data for each of your users,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.030
and I now have 10,000 users on a server.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.170
Well,
I've just replicated 10 megabyte files

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.130
that contain the same amount of data,
all existing on the same

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.340
hard drive somewhere.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.340
Well, that's no sweat off of
your nose as a developer.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.910
I mean, you want to have that data
accessible to your users,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:42.090
but the end user, the person who is
maintaining that server,

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.060
might not like that very much
because suddenly their resource,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.990
the hard drive on that server,
even though hard disk space is cheaper

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.780
now than it has been ever before,
still is a resource that they covet and

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.590
they want to keep as clean as possible.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.500
So the next thing we're going to do,
and we're going to talk about this,

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.240
is from a development standpoint,
what I want to make clear to you,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.220
and we'll show this to
you here in a second,

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.080
is that polling is bad.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:16.270
File I.O.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.210
takes time.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.560
It takes very little time locally,
but it can take a lot

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.570
of time to a network,
especially if it's happening

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.760
all at the same time.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.220
So I'd like to come over
here and show you a sample.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.920
This is on demo two.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.230
Thanks.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.240
I might be showing software that some
of you in this room have written.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.420
I don't know everybody here,
and I'm not doing any of

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.840
this to embarrass anybody.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.820
But I do want you to know that...

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.090
We're just as guilty of this,
of some of the stuff I'm

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.110
going to be showing you.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.700
And what I've got,
and what I'd like to recommend

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.060
that you do as developers,
and we're going to be providing

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.550
you hopefully with a suite of
tools that you can run as part of

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.510
the development environment that
will allow you to facilitate this,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.240
but this is something you can do today.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:27.510
What I have here in this particular
window is I'm running Top,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:27.510
and I've got three applications running,
Address Book, Apple Works,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:27.510
and Internet Explorer.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:27.510
And the only one that you can see,
the other two I have hidden

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:27.510
currently is Address Book.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:27.510
So if I come over here
to this other window,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:27.510
and I'm going to...

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.530
The process ID of the
address book is 513,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.350
and I'm going to watch the file
system usage for the address book.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:56.400
[Transcript missing]

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.440
Let's try Apple Works.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.620
Now,
Apple Works is running in the background.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.280
And what it's running in,
and I'll show you in a minute,

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.550
is just running a blank word processor.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:19.080
Imagine 30 of those all going through a
10 megabit switch all at the same time.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:29.020
Going to a local hard
drive is not any big deal.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.800
But going across the network it is.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:37.530
And just so that I don't
pick on Apple Works,

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.240
here's Internet Explorer.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.240
I'm going to go

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.220
The reason I'm pointing this out
to you is Internet Explorer is

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:49.290
sitting hidden in the background
and it's hitting its cache file.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:53.540
Once a second.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.890
You don't need to do that.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.800
Please stop.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.730
Those are some of the things that you
don't have to set up a complicated

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.960
server to check this kind of stuff out.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.890
These are some simple tests
that you can run locally.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:29.950
The fact that we were accessing a
cache on a regular basis and that

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.090
cache happened to be associated
with my logged-in user ID,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.320
Well, that cache could be on
the internet someplace.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:41.480
The home directory for that particular
file could be you don't know where.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.900
We have a little utility,
which one of our engineers wrote,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.020
that puts your home
directory on an iDisk.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.870
In Atlanta.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.340
We don't know who's going to be
serving up the home directory.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.420
And we're going to be trying
to make available to you,

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.970
as much as possible,
mechanisms by which you can...

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:16.790
which the user can mitigate and
move the storage to a local device.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.510
However, to do that,
and if we provide that

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.920
kind of functionality,
you need to take advantage

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.790
of system-level calls.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.760
So that's when we get
into preference storage,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.480
which is the next point.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.840
Cache the user's preference locally,
if possible.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.310
And if not possible,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.050
Use the system-level resources.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.290
Store them in a system cache.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:52.800
[Transcript missing]

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:59.150
Don't store it in your folder
in the user's home directory.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.890
Use system resources.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.220
If we get continual feedback from
customers about the amount of

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.450
network traffic being generated,
there may be some facility that we

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.920
can do to take advantage of that.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.650
And if you don't take advantage
of the system-level calls,

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.120
you're going to be left in
the dust and your application

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.480
isn't going to work well.

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.940
Don't use preferences as cache files.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.420
Use preferences for those
things which you want to have

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.300
be static or across sessions.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.700
Cache files should be just that cache,
temporary,

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:41.120
store the data on the local disk,
use slash temp wherever possible.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.420
Document access.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.500
Try and keep your document
access to a minimum.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.190
Always assume that the
reading and writing is going

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.320
to take place over a network.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.260
and that extra network I/O is going
to give your users a bad experience.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.680
Understand also that the network
connection may not be persistent.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.190
I went out to a customer site

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.850
About three or four months ago,
and they had a router between

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:24.120
buildings on a campus that went
down at one o'clock every day.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.290
and they just lived with it.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:28.810
They didn't fix it.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:29.830
They just lived with it.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.540
They walked over at one o'clock
every day and rebooted the router.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.960
Well, that meant that the servers on
the other side of that router

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.940
went away every day at 1 o'clock.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.800
So always allow saving locally
wherever possible and try

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.700
and be volume fault tolerant.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.900
Okay, so that's enough beating you up.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.100
Let me tell you about what we're
giving you in Mac OS X Jaguar.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:08.950
The administration for the server,
the administration for the users

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.770
takes place on the Mac OS X server.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.740
And it takes place through the
server manager application.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.800
Basically,
what we're doing is we're managing

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.820
resources in three different areas.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.140
The first area is users.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.900
I think we all understand
what the notion of users are.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.500
They're individual, identifiable units,
people who actually

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.060
utilize your software,
utilize our software.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.770
Then there are groups.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:42.230
And the notion of groups is
dependent in some cases on

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.880
the operating system itself.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.770
However, there's also a notion of
groups that is logical to how

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.310
people utilize the software,
how people group together.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.200
We have engineers.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.810
We have students.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:19:59.980
We have faculty.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.520
Those are logical groups.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.040
And those logical groups use
resources in similar ways.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:14.360
Then we have physical devices,
computer lists, groups of

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.740
hardware resources by which the
users and groups of users access

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.790
the facilities that you give them.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.470
Access to the applications, the printers,
the hard drives, the FireWire devices,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.060
the CD-ROM drives,
those all get access through a computer.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:38.750
And that's where the crux of
where we start managing begins,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.450
is in the computer list.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.260
We're also giving you the
capability of setting,

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.900
when you set up share
points on your file server,

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.340
of setting up group volumes.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:56.200
Things that will automatically,
when a user connects to a group,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.660
You will log in and those
particular group volumes

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.390
will either be auto-mounted,
they may be put in on the user's desktop,

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.530
they may be put in a dock.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.310
So that the facility in the same way
in Mac OS X where you have a home now,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.340
we're not providing you a group now,
a little group icon.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:19.610
But we're going to provide you all
as administrators the capability

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.660
of pre-configuring an environment
for your groups of users.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.690
And SharePoints is one of the ways
that we're going to be able to do that.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.810
We're also going to let
you set up preferences,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.020
Mac OS X preferences, per account type.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.870
That means you can set
up preferences per user.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.870
If you have 10,000 or
100,000 or 700,000 users,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.170
that might get a little ponderous.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.960
But we're going to give you
the capability of doing that.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.640
We're going to give you the ability
to set up preferences per group.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:58.500
Freshman class, sophomore class,
class of 92, class of 07.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:19.000
[Transcript missing]

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.560
and you can set up these
preferences in three ways.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.050
The first way is initial.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.910
What do I mean by initial?

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:30.360
That means when the user starts up,
you can put some item or set

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.640
some initial preference for them.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.880
The user can then change those,
change that preference.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.750
And I'll use, for example,
I'll use the dock.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.720
When you start up Mac OS X,
you first boot it up,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.720
you'll have a readme item in
the dock that you can delete.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.220
You'll have a set of of default
applications that get put in the doc,

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.220
which you can remove.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.150
and initial preferences
are are exactly that.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.300
They're things that you set up
for your particular set of users.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.270
Let's say you've got a new employee
comes into your company and you want

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.660
to have a pointer to your website.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.670
So you might want to put an
HTML pointer or a web page or

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.500
home page in the user's dock.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.760
And the user may leave that
in their dock for as long as

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.140
they wish and you don't care.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.760
You just want to make sure
that it's available to them

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.900
the first time they log in.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.310
So those are things that
are initial preferences.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.740
Then we have forced preferences.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.860
Forced preferences are things which are
written out every time the user logs in.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.310
Or the user connects to a group.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.050
Or the user uses a specific computer.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:41.390
So a user walks up to a particular
computer that every time it gets booted,

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:46.540
sets up the default printer to be the
one that's directly connected to it.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:54.610
Now, if the user has permission to add
more printers to that printer-- to the

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:54.610
printer list available to him or her,

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.500
Fine, they can do that.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.910
They may even be part of a group
which allows them to print to

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.260
any computer on the network.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:06.160
But when they log in at
that particular computer,

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:10.060
that computer creates
a preference that says,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.730
you can print to this
locally connected printer.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.520
And no other computer on the
network may have that capability.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.140
They may not have that preference set.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:26.370
And every time the user logs in,
we rewrite out those preferences.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.200
So those are forced preferences.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.560
Then we have none.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.760
And that's a managed
state in and of itself.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:40.240
By default, we don't manage any
particular set of preferences.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.200
So by default,
we have no management for the options.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.690
We let the users do whatever they want.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.960
But that's a conscious decision that
you should probably make if you're

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.950
administrating these facilities.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.180
So the other thing that we do,
and this is where it

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.070
gets really interesting,
is...

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:09.220
We cache these preferences for
access when the computer or the

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.020
computer's offline from the network.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.660
So what's that mean?

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.570
So I've got a PowerBook.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.060
I log into my network.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.130
I log in as me.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:27.880
I connect it up to the server and it
downloads a bunch of forced preferences.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.810
Those forced preferences are a
variety of different things and

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:31.900
we'll get into some of them.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.900
But some of them are which
applications I can access,

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.680
where my dock settings are,
what things show up in my dock,

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:44.800
whether or not I can read and write
to the CD-ROM drive or burn CDs.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.500
And all those preferences get
forced and cached locally.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.940
Then I close my PowerBook up,
I unplug it from the network,

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.470
and I walk away.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.020
Next time I open up that
computer and log in again,

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.590
those preferences are going to stay
the same because I can't access,

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:06.080
I'm not accessing the server to
be able to update or change those.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.940
If I'm the administrator of the machine,
I'm given the option to clear

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.140
that cache whenever I want,
but if I'm not, I don't have that option.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.720
So I don't have to give you control
of the computer I just handed you.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.550
I can set up the permissions and
the privileges so that you can only

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.190
use the applications that I want

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.460
You can only use the devices that I want.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:38.500
You may be able to change
which groups you're accessing,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.710
so you might get different sets
of applications for different

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.290
groups as you access them,
different capabilities,

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.870
different printer devices,
that kinds of things.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.390
But you can't ever
clear those preferences.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.790
So I also may not give
you the ability to access,

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.740
and we'll be going
over these in a second,

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.370
to access the system
preferences themselves.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.190
So if I set your dock to be to
the right and don't give you any

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:09.030
access to either the dock menu
items or the dock system preference,

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.710
you can't change it.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.160
So we can give you,
and we are giving you,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.780
the capability of managing down to
the minutia level of how your users

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.100
are going to access the computers.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:28.540
or you can choose not to
manage certain sections at all.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.160
It's your choice.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.930
All of this, as I said before,
is set up using the

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.640
Server Manager application.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.770
You set basic configurations here.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.880
You can create a user,
give them a home directory.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.300
You've got a managed environment.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.440
A user logs in.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.140
Every time they log in,
they click on the home.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.030
They're going to go to a
place on a file server.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.900
Well, you're going to go to
their home directory.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.310
It's managed.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.220
You allow them to pick a group.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.270
You may give them fours.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.290
file system quotas on that server.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.640
You may give them print
quotas on that server,

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.010
and they're fully managed.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:21.460
This data is stored in the directory
service node associated with the server.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.590
If the server,
if the individual computer or

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:29.080
the individual user does not
wish to bind it to your network,

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.870
does not wish to point to a directory
service someplace out in your network,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.380
they won't be managed.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:38.650
They'll be able to take advantage of
your network in the same way that they

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.840
could with a classic Macintosh OS.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.780
If they know a username
and password to a server,

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.260
they'll be able to go
out and browse for it,

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.820
they'll find it,
they can log in with their

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.410
username and password.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.050
They get basically the same functionality
they get today with Mac OS 8 and

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.790
9 in a non-managed environment.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.540
If, however,
they wish to take advantage of the

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.140
power and the access of your system
and automatically log in to certain

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.980
facilities or print to certain
printers or see certain items,

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:12.890
then they're going to need to
bind to a directory service node.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.850
And that can be currently
either an LDAPv3 or NetInfo.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:22.720
And there have been several sessions here
at the conference on directory services.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.190
If you wish to continue
to support 8 and 9 users,

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.570
you will have to import those users
into the Macintosh Manager application.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.140
This is only for the 8 and 9 users.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.620
The 8 and 9 model and what's available to
the 8 and 9 users is different than 10.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.380
Server Manager is for
creating your lists of users,

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.300
giving them passwords,
signing them home directories,

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.580
setting print quotas for them,
setting file system quotas

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.130
for them on the server,
doing a wide variety of things.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.800
If you want to manage whether or not
they see the simple finder in Mac OS 9

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.520
or the panels environment in Mac OS 8,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.380
You need to use the Macintosh
Manager application.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.640
And to do that,
you have to import those users

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.710
the same way you do today.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:25.400
I mentioned a little bit earlier,
I mentioned about group volumes.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.540
Creating group volumes, creating groups,
managing users by group is what

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.620
we're going to be recommending
to our user community.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.570
For those of you who are
going to be administrating

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.760
and utilizing this product,
that's the way we

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.780
recommend that you do it,
as opposed to on an

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.580
individual user-by-user basis.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:53.120
You may have in a large installation
some big number of users,

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.460
let's say 50,000 users.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.390
You probably aren't going
to have 50,000 groups.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:10.720
So to be able to define and update
data against 50,000 records as

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.310
opposed to 100 or even 1,000,

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.830
More likely somewhere in between groups.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.090
It's going to take you less time.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:28.190
and logically there is some
way to group bodies of units,

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:29.960
user units together.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.040
And if you think about it,
you can come up with creative

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.880
solutions for what you give individuals
in particular groups access to.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.450
So,
and you can set up these groups also get

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:52.250
set up in the directory services node,
as do the computer records,

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.010
the computer lists.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.830
So what do we give you
management right out of the box?

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:04.030
We don't allow you to manage
everything explicitly.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:07.250
We do, however,
allow you to manage everything

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.600
by not allowing access to some
things after you set them up.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.300
So basically what we give you and
what we'll show you is we give you the

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:21.720
ability to manage the login window.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.280
What's in the login window?

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:27.200
Well, it's how the users view
their list of individuals.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:32.200
If I have a user list that's, again,
I'll use the example of 50,000.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:38.370
Well, I may not want or choose
to show a list of users,

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.340
all 50,000 of them,
every time a user logs in

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.200
to allow them to pick it.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.600
Even with type ahead,
that may take a bit of time.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.890
So I might want in that
particular environment to choose

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.300
just to have a type in field.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.100
I may choose to put icons
next to everybody's name.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.700
because that's cool.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.460
Again, five thousand pictures,
icon pictures,

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.780
maybe a lot of network traffic.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.200
You may choose not to do that.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.670
That's handled,
and that's an example of something that's

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:16.190
handled on a computer by computer basis.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.450
So that,
if I've got thirty computers in a lab,

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.620
All of those computers are
going to give a list view,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.920
or most of them are going
to give a list view,

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.800
or all of them are going to
just give a type-in view.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:34.180
You can also launch particular
items through the login window.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.550
You can say,
automatically launch Classic.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.930
Login window.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:45.540
Finder.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.260
The things in the Finder.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.920
Basically what we give you access to.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.200
How the Finder looks.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:54.290
Small icons, large icons.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.580
In some sense you may be thinking, well,
why would I care about

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.660
what size the icons are?

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.400
Well,
in most cases you probably wouldn't.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:06.480
But on any particular computer,
or for a particular group of users

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.530
who may be visually impaired,

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:23.970
...or old like me,
may need to have their icons bigger.

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:23.970
So you may wish to change
some of those options.

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:23.970
Doc.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:33.500
The doc, where it is, how it operates,
what's in it, what the user can do to it,

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.360
all of that is manageable.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.510
Media access.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:43.240
Media access is,
can the user access a CD?

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.290
I'll go over the specifics of it.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.600
What sort of physical media
can they connect to the device,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.620
to the computer?

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:54.070
Internet, the internet preferences,
system preference.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.890
Application access,
this is where we get a

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.040
considerable piece of our power.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.840
And this is where it may affect
you if you're a developer.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:10.340
And that is, if you are controlling
application access,

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.480
it's an additive list.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.810
It's not a deny list.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.260
It's an additive list.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.500
So if I put on, for example, mail,

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.940
and mail uses a spell checking
application to real-time check the

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.600
spelling when I'm typing into mail.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.240
And I don't include the
spell checking application.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.820
Guess what won't work?

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:41.340
because it's an additive list and once
you say control what these groups or

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:48.510
these specific users people accessing
from this particular computer can do

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.500
You might have a mail workstation there,
and that may be the only application

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.050
at that particular workstation.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:55.960
It's just for email.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.260
And that's the only application anybody
can use at that particular computer.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.150
So it's additive.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.340
So if you have suites,
Internet Explorer is a good example.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.110
If you have,
launch this stuff it when you

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.510
download an application or download
something over the net that's stuffed.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.500
If you don't give the user the access,
the file system will go, nope,

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.370
you don't have power to do that.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:26.440
So,
be aware in your documentation that if

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.380
you have inter-operating applications
that you make note of those.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.430
So that some poor schmo who
doesn't use your application

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.710
and is setting it up for,
you know, a school full of students,

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.500
doesn't then end up getting
a call on Saturday saying,

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.860
none of these students can
access their blah-da-da-da-da,

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.510
because he forgot to add some helper app.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.150
The preferences are invoked at login,
and we'll go over how they're

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.240
invoked here in a second.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.500
And we cache these preferences
for offline access.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.790
There's an order to the
preference priority.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:12.040
And the order is that the first thing
that gets loaded is the computer record,

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.440
what's the preferences that
are stored by computer lists.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.560
Then we find out who the user is.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.410
We get the user, the user,
is the user a member of some groups,

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.280
we allow them to pick a group.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:29.310
However, the preferences that are set for
the user take priority over the

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.550
preferences that are set for a group.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.000
and preferences that
are set for a computer.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:43.700
So that if I wish to have a
computer preference take priority,

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.890
I probably don't want to set that
for a user because anything I set

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.710
for the user is going to override
whatever preferences I set for

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.150
either the group or the computer.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.780
So we recommend that you manage
most of your settings per group,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.830
and that you create, where possible,
local accounts for your users.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:07.790
Since we'll be caching these
preferences for offline access,

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:14.480
Having the users be managed on
a local machines is very useful.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.380
What happens?

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:28.240
User starts the machine up and the
computer is bound to a directory

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.300
node out there in the network.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:35.630
We go out to that directory node and we
look to see whether the computer that

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:40.480
is connecting to this node is in a list.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:40.480
If it is, we're going to have

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.400
We ask for its preferences.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:48.920
If it's not,
we find out whether or not you're

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.030
controlling any computer that's
connected to this directory node.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.030
And we'll be showing
you that in a minute.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.840
We get the preferences for
that particular computer.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.880
Those things might affect
things like the login window,

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.880
which is why we go do that.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.170
It also means that now we're managed,
and everything else is going to

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:06.920
take place in a managed environment.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:14.470
So these login prefs go into the login
window and they're going to change

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.210
the way the login window is displayed.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.960
Then we're going to get a list of
users or just to type in the user

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.460
name and password fields depending
upon how you configured it.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:32.130
If that user is a member of a group,
we will display then a list of

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:35.540
groups that the user can choose from.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:40.860
Now we know who the user is and what
members of the group they're part of.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.390
We go back to the login window

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:50.520
and then we invoke the full suite
of preferences for the computer,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.990
the group, and the user,
and they're an aggregate.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.960
Some preferences are unionized.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.480
Printing is a good example of this.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.640
You may have a printing
for a particular computer.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.950
You may have a list of printers
that's available to a particular

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.860
group and a list of printers that's
only available to an individual user.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.810
Those are unionized so that
when the printer goes to print,

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.380
they'll see a union of all the
possible printers available to them.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.730
That doesn't make sense
in every particular case,

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.850
but that's the way it works.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.080
So I'd like to show you,
here on Demo Machine 3,

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.350
and go through some of the...

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:35.770
Preferences.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.660
I'll show you what we're
going to be able to manage.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:42.700
What I'm doing here is I'm launching
the server manager application.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:52.730
Enter in my username and password.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:03.760
And then what I do is I switch to
the network visible node that the

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.810
other computers on the network
are going to be able to bind to.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.850
Now, I want to be able to make
changes to that particular node,

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.490
so I'm going to authenticate.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:22.100
And you're noticing that
my authentication to log

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.940
into the network node

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:31.400
is different than the admin that
I use to log in to the application.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.540
I could have the server application
be sitting here and the directory

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.540
node be sitting someplace else.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:41.600
It could be an LDAP directory,
it could be anything.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.510
It could be anywhere,
as long as it's accessible from here.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.510
That may be where I'm editing my records.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:53.700
Here we have three different types
of accounts that we can manage.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.760
We have users.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:57.720
We have groups.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.080
We have lists of computers.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.740
And what I've got set
here is two examples.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:08.070
One is I've got set up
as a notion called Lab 1.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.800
And I could go through and
set up the individual-- this

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.690
user interface is not final.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.120
We may be getting questions.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.740
One question that we got was,
can I set this up by IP address?

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.360
There will be an area for you to
enter in your IP address here.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:23.360
And that will be displayed.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:43:11.800
[Transcript missing]

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.900
and you can restrict to
which groups can use,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:21.440
can access the preferences that
are set by all other computers and

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.100
whether or not this is managed,
how often the cache gets changed.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.500
You can refresh the cache if you wish.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:36.780
So in essence what we've got
is you can also determine,

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:41.250
we come into here,
I can say that the computers in

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:41.250
Mac OS X and the tools that are available
to ensure your customers have the best

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:41.250
possible experience with your software.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:47.170
Lab 1 list aren't managed.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:50.880
Or the faculty computers aren't managed.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:54.500
Or my boss's computer isn't managed.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:57.830
But all other computers are.

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.460
All student computers are, for example.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.710
So this is where you enter
in the computer list.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.040
And if we come here, then I can go and as
we'll walk through these,

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:13.500
I can set any of the preferences
I can set for anybody or any group.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:17.170
I can set for any grouping of computers.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.910
We have groups.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.620
The groups are pretty
much standard groups.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:30.000
One of the things that you'll notice is
accessing these groups and controlling

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:37.720
these groups are much easier and
faster than the Mac OS X Server product

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.560
currently shipping.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.140
We've heard you, we've listened,
we've made it easier,

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:48.650
we've made multiple selections work,
dragging work.

00:44:49.150 --> 00:45:03.050
and individual computers
and individual users.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.050
So in each of those,
I can click on the preferences and,

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.050
for example, I can

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.860
I can... Now what I'm showing you here,
if we go back to preferences,

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.830
is I'm showing you here the applications.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:13.450
And I want to set up the
applications that are used by...

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.440
by this group of computers.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:25.280
So I'm going to say always right now,
and I'm going to add a group of

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.820
applications that this particular group,
and this is

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.220
Desktop Management Services Engineering
Group.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.580
So what do I want them to have access to?

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:37.980
Well, let's see.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.220
Text edit because they're going
to need to write source code.

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:53.040
Well, I probably want them to set up a
console because there may or may not

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:58.630
be some bugs or some error messages.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.630
And...

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.080
Where is that terminal?

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.970
Oh yeah, and then terminal.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.160
Terminal is a good one.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:06.460
Because,

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:13.600
What do we want?

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:13.600
We wanted a console.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.580
So they're going to get access
to these three applications.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.440
And that's all.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.820
They're not going to be
able to play their iTunes.

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:28.400
I don't want them listening to music.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.030
They need to be typing in TextEdit.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.520
and checking for error messages
on the console and moving

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.240
files around in the terminal.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.560
Then the system preferences.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.680
I can go on and I can, again,
manage the preferences.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.960
I can say, "Well,
I want them to be able to launch

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:55.550
Classic and I want them to be able to
access their desktop control and...

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:04.360
Change your network settings.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.320
So that's going to be all the
system preferences they're

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.330
going to be able to access.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:11.610
All the other system preferences
are going to be grayed out.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.740
I could show all of them,
give them full access to

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:17.200
all the system preferences.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.920
I can show none of them,
in which case if they open

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.660
up their system preferences,
what they will see is all

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.090
of the items grayed out.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.140
They won't be able to change
anything in their system preferences.

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:32.350
and they're only going to be able
to use these three applications.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:46.740
Apply Now.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:46.740
We're done with that.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:46.740
Finder.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:46.740
I can show them in the Finder.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:46.740
I can show them whether or not they want
to use a simplified Finder or whether or

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:46.740
not they want to use a regular Finder.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:49.720
where they can show their hard disks,
get showed.

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.050
These are basically
standard Finder options.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.620
I can set them for them.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.830
I can set up a use of the
commands that the Finders access.

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.000
Do I want them to be able
to connect to any server?

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.160
Do I want them to be
able to go to any folder?

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.480
Do I want them to be able
to restart or shut down?

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.460
Or maybe all I want them to
be able to do is log out.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.190
All of these things are controllable.

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.940
And then if I don't give them access
to change these particular settings,

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.260
that's what they're going to get.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.280
What views do I want them to have?

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.090
Do I want them to have
large view or small view?

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.260
We can get into minutiae here,
and the level of control we're being

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.960
able to give you is exactly the level
of control that you want to exercise,

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:39.870
from nothing to where the dock
sits and how big the icons are.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.300
Classic.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.940
I can start Classic up when you log in.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.980
I can hide Classic if it started up.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:49:00.710
I can choose which classic volume
I wish them to be running off of.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:07.620
I can allow them or not allow
them to turn off extensions

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.780
or to rebuild the desktop.

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:10.780
I can hide the chooser.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.360
These are features that are currently
in the Macintosh Manager 2.1 product.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.470
I can hide control panels.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.620
I can show other Apple menu items or not.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.740
I can put Classic to sleep.

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.730
Two things you can do with the dock.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:30.780
You can set all the preferences that
you normally can from the dock settings.

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:35.330
The other thing that you can
do with the dock items is...

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:48.400
You can add things.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:48.400
As you can see here,
I've added the admin PDF guide to

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:48.400
the doc for this particular group.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:48.400
That means, and it's forced,
that means every time the user...

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:50.580
Logs in.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.560
They're going to get an admin
guide stuck in their dock.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:59.330
They can throw it away if I give them
the ability to change the dock or not.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:05.260
user may add items to the dock
if they wish or not I can control

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.880
that but if they throw it away,
if I give them access to throw

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.580
it away next time they log in
it's going to be there again

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.580
and the same thing I can
do with applications.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:19.860
So let's say I want to have put
iChat in the dock because I want

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.520
to be able to talk to my engineers,
so I want to be able to chat with them.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.970
So, iChat's going to show up in the doc
as well as the admin guide every time.

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:37.380
And we're going to go down here
and we have finder we talked about,

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:42.790
internet, internet preferences,
what their default reader is,

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:44.510
What their email address is.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.590
Now these things don't make sense.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:48.440
The email address doesn't
make sense for a group.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.710
So you probably wouldn't want to
be setting these on a group basis.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:56.460
And we probably will prevent you
from setting them on a group basis,

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.020
though I believe that the
interface allows you to do it now.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:01.670
What the web settings are.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.630
You can set what your default
websites and home pages are.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.390
For a particular group of users,
it might be different.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.800
You might want to have your HR department
always come up with the HR website

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.980
whenever they start their home page.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:22.500
Login window,
we talked a little bit about.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.670
Login window doesn't make any sense.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.810
This is one of the areas
we don't have a bug for.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.930
It doesn't make any sense at a
group level because it happens.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:34.930
You don't know who the group is when you
log in because you haven't logged in yet.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:41.490
What items get automatically launched,
though, however, could be per group.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:47.550
So the login window only makes sense
in a computer list environment.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:51.630
So if we switch over to computer
lists and come in here to login,

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.700
we show you what you can
do with a login window.

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:59.670
Name and password entry field,
a list of users, show other user,

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:04.690
disable restart and shutdown, give hints.

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:07.060
All of those things.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:10.570
And those things are per computer because
it's the only place it makes sense.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:13.730
Media Access.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.260
The things that we can
do with Media Access,

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:20.130
we can allow or require
authentication to use a CD-ROM,

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.470
DVD, or recordable disc.

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:26.720
We can allow or require
authorization or have read-only for

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:31.940
internal disks or external disks,
and those include zip drives, firewire,

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:37.610
USB drives, and then we also give you the
ability to prevent them from

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:39.910
removing any media if you wish.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.380
And lastly, we have printing.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.950
We can add printers to the list.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.010
We can create a list of printers.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.920
I have no printers configured to
this machine since it's local.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.380
Then there are no printers up here.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.120
I can create a list of printers.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.780
I can open up the print center.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.070
I can open up the print center, create,
using print center,

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:03.890
create some computer lists,
and then add the ones that

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:07.340
I want to this particular list
for that particular group.

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:08.640
And then that group's
going to have access,

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:09.900
or that user's going to have access.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.920
Or in this particular case,
that computer's going to have access.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.480
access.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:17.030
So that's what we're
giving you out of the box.

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:22.220
Now one of the things that I mentioned
a little bit earlier is that these are

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:29.480
all preferences and they're all stored
and defined in the CF preference model.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:34.250
And while we don't have
it in today's release,

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.600
if you all as developers

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.540
Read and write your preferences
using CFPreferences.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.200
Hopefully...

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:47.490
in the near future will be able
to give you an API that will

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:52.340
hook into this interface and
your application can be here.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:00.080
That means that an administrator
can access the preferences

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.400
that your applications use.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.080
And they can do it as initial,
they can do it as forced,

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:06.520
they can do it as none.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.420
So the capability for your
service or your application

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.500
or your suite of applications,
if you use the common system preferences,

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.190
we will read them and write them for you.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.940
In the same way we do
for these preferences,

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:23.180
and we're going to be adding more system
preferences as time allows as well.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:29.100
So it's a really powerful tool to be able
to give our users and the administrators

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.720
of our users the capabilities
of setting up an environment,

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:36.260
including setting up preferences
for your individual applications.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:42.930
So development going forward.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.860
So as I mentioned before,
what I want you to do is I want you

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:55.870
to assume that your applications will
be running in a network environment.

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:59.820
If you're here and you're basically
your users of the current product,

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:03.150
and you're trying to find out how
we're going to manage Mac OS X,

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:05.460
hear me now.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:11.920
We're trying to tell the developers who
are sitting around you that they're going

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:18.720
to be working on a network and that they
want to make those kinds of assumptions.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:23.640
Assume that the application access
will be controlled by administrators.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.900
Developers,
assume that the person sitting next

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.010
to you is actually an administrator,
is going to want to actually

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:32.390
control how their users use
the equipment that they own.

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.160
So identify any helper apps, clearly.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.000
An example of this is IE and Stuffit.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.950
And those things are from
two different companies.

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.950
But

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:49.980
You know and can know which applications
get utilized in the interplay

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.720
with your applications as well.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.860
So mention those kinds of
things in the documentation.

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:03.570
Use the CFPreferences Model.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:04.280
I just made an allusion to that before.

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:06.790
This allows, in the future,
for us to do managed applications.

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:11.340
In essence,
we're giving managed applications today.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:14.010
We're just managing the
system applications,

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:15.630
like the Finder or the Dock.

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:23.120
If you use CFPreferences, in the future,
we may be giving you APIs that will

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:28.820
allow you to stick a preference
model for your particular application

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.660
in the same server manager app.

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:38.090
and always take advantage of
system level compatibility.

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:41.590
Always write out to
standard system locations.

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:44.500
Use /tmp wherever possible.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.600
So in summary,
I'd just like to say that the

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:53.300
Mac OS X is a managed client,
out of the box, it's managed.

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:56.500
The management may be none,
but it's managed.

00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.430
Assume your applications
are running on a network,

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.930
try and limit the
I/O as much as possible,

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:04.120
don't pull,

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:07.220
You saw a couple examples of polling.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.300
You saw an example of one application
that didn't appear to be polling.

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:12.300
So you cannot poll.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:14.700
It is possible.

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.420
And use the CF preference model.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:28.000
[Transcript missing]

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.620
So this is the last
day of the conference,

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:34.000
and most of these sessions
have already been,

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.460
most of them, two-thirds of the three,
have already run.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.400
But if you're going
to be reviewing these,

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:43.700
you didn't get a chance to go
to these particular conferences

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.380
or these particular sessions.

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.750
These are the sessions which also refer
to the data that was presented here,

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.420
Mac OS X Server in-depth,
Mac OS X Server overview,

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.780
both of which happened on Monday.

00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:01.760
And this afternoon at 5 o'clock,
the Server Services Feedback

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.630
Forum will be here,
and we'll be able to talk

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.380
even more of your questions.

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:10.560
So with that,
I'd like to bring up Tom Weir and Eric.

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:11.700
Did I see you here?

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.070
Eric is our Marketing Manager.

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.780
I'd like to bring him up if I could, too.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.570
If you have any questions
or concerns or comments,

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.430
the questions, you can go to the mics.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:25.250
And mic is right there.

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:31.780
You can contact either me or Tom Weir,
and our addresses are there.
