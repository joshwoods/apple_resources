[ Applause ]

- Good afternoon
- Welcome. We have a great -- great event for you right now, and we just -- we're just so thrilled that you are here. You came back after the state of the union. This is a non-technical session so you can just relax and enjoy as we celebrate some really cool apps.
- These are exciting times of growth and innovation.
- You know, today we are here to celebrate excellence in design and innovation on iOS and OS X.
- Each year finding the best apps becomes more and more challenging.
- There are more developers, more apps, more technologies, more ideas, more innovation every day.
- Before we began, we want to acknowledge you, the developers who've worked so hard to make all of the amazing iOS and OS X apps that people love and that have changed our culture.
- They've changed the way that we work, the way that we play, and the way that we connect. And we just -- we just want to take a moment to thank you for your hard work and anybody else who's watching this event once it gets on video.

[ Applause ]

- Tonight's winners were selected by dozens of judges from across Apple using a variety of selection criteria.
- You know, this is my thirteenth year doing the Design Awards and we have changed the way that we judge things, but we still look for many of the same qualities in apps. We look for apps that are attractive and have strong visual design. We look for apps that have intuitive interaction or really great gameplay.

We look for apps that have great attention to detail. And we look for apps with high production value. We also look for apps that are high performance, that are super responsive, and give immediate feedback. We look for apps that have deep system integration and that take advantage of all relevant Apple technologies.

And finally, we look for apps that are unique, apps that bring an innovation or new approach to something, or they bring innovative gameplay in a way that we've never seen before. And these are the kinds of things -- well-designed, state-of-the-art, and innovative -- these are the attributes that bring people back again and again and again to great apps.

- Each winner today will receive an amazing set of prizes: The 13-inch MacBook Air, an Apple TV, a 27-inch iMac, 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display --
- And winners will also receive a 64-gig iPad Mini, a fourth-generation iPad Wi-Fi with Retina display, a 64-gig unlocked iPhone 5, and a 64-gig iPod Touch. So basically

[ Applause ]

we're giving winners pretty much one of everything that Apple makes.

- Oh, and don't forget, the winners also receive one of these coveted Cubes.
- And you know, there's so many new people here at the AD -- at WWDC this year, and at the ceremony I bet you didn't knows that these cubes light up when you touch them. They are touch sensitive and the Apple logo glows just like the back of your MacBook Pro screen. So that is very cool.
- So let's get on with our winners. Just quickly, some logistics. If you are chosen as a winner this afternoon, please quickly come up through the house and join us on stage through one of these sets of stairs at the front, and then when we're finished, you're going to exit stage right.
- We've got a lot of winners so we need you to move fast to the stage so we're not sitting here all evening.
- We're going to begin with students. So let's start with Finish by Ryan Orbuch and Michael Hansen.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- Why don't you come over here.
- Finish is a streamlined task management app for procrastinators built by two high school students from Colorado. It gets in your face when you need it and stays out of your way when you don't to help you focus on completing important tasks. Let's take a look.
- So some screenshots here. So I don't know where the other student is but -- so I guess you did all the work, yeah.
- Michael, he's at home.
- All right. Michael's at home. Well, he's going to benefit from this anyway. You know, this is an app that manages short, medium, long-term tasks. These guys put it together probably 'cause they're not that good with that and they are procrastinators themselves. But we thought this was such a great app by a couple of students. It uses numerous iOS technologies, integrates with Facebook and Twitter so that you can share tasks with other students that are in your class or in your year. It looks great on Retina display, and is totally optimized for iPhone 5. So congratulations. Great work.
- Thank you.
- That's Finish. That's it right over there. Okay.

[ Applause ]

Just walk down those stairs.

[ Music ]

And that's Finish. Our other student winner is mosaic.io by Ishaan Gulrajani, Alex List, and Zain Shah.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

Congratulations. Congratulations. This app is built by students from MIT and the University of Pittsburgh. It magically connects two or more iOS devices into a beautiful mosaic. View photos and files with the swipe of a finger. It's like having your very own personal hypertable. Let's take a look.

- All right. So here's a video that we asked these guys to put together, and they had no idea that they were doing this for us. But these are self-taught iOS developers. They put a prototype for this app together in a weekend, and it creates a mosaic across multiple screens; so you select an image, and then it uses core animation, device motion, and gestures to determine the devices' relative location to each other and which determine which part of the image it draws. So watch this. They're going to add an iPad; now they're going to swipe across the three devices, and it will reposition that image across those three devices. So very, very cool app. Great job. Two students.
- Congratulations.
- Again.
- You can go out that way. Thank you.

[ Applause ]

That was mosaic.io, and those were our two student winners. Let's move on to our next winner which is Coda 2 by Panic.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

- Congratulations. Right over -- that's all right. Congratulations. Hi. Nice to see you again.
- Of course not.
- Coda is an incredibly innovated all-in-one editor for your web code. This new version has added features and updates to almost every aspect of the product including some really compelling integration with their iPad app Diet Coda.
- You know, who doesn't know the Panic guys, right? And I think that they're going to love adding this to their display of ADAs. But, you know, Coda 1, five years ago or six years ago in 2007, won and ADA, and we at the time thought it was just such an incredible app.

And we felt that these guys deserved a new ADA because Coda 2, it's been six years in the oven, and it is just -- it is so much stronger and it's a majoring update to the app that they had previously. And you know what? More than anything else, we felt that this app was a shining example of what a great Mac app is supposed to look like and behave like and be built like.

And it's a highly flexible IDE for web development with very customizable UI; it has an extensive use of -- extensive support for plug-ins so they can add on a lot of extra functionality; and they support endless web development technologies and languages -- ActionScript, ASP, CFML, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, and the list goes on.

This app is deeply integrated with OS X, and the guys at Panic know how to do this. Many of you probably consult with them for assistance -- technical assistance. The app is built on AppKit, as are most OS X apps, but they do everything the right way. They're built on core animation, iCloud, Notification Center; they use QuickLook; they're integrated with AirPlay and more. And probably the coolest and most innovative feature is AirPlay, which is tied to Diet Coda on the iPad

- AirPreview.
- AirPreview, sorry. It allows you to dynamically preview the work that you're doing, the code that you're making, you can preview that on the iPad. And so Coda and Diet Coda together, they complement one another, and they provide an award-winning OS X and iOS web development solution. And so congratulations.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

That's Coda. Our next winner is Ridiculous Fishing -- A Tale of Redemption by Vlambeer.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- This is a handcrafted game about fishing with weapons, chainsaws, and toasters. Follow Billy on his search for redemption from an uncertain past in this never-ending infinite arcade world.
- Yeah. What you're seeing back here is -- this is an app that deliver -- a game that delivers hours of unique entertainment. It's expertly crafted in the lo-fi retro video game style. I mean, all of the graphics are intentionally done this way. It has engaging physics-based gameplay mixed with humor and a really fun soundtrack that reverses as you go back up to the surface. It embraces Game Center, makes extensive use of Multi-touch, device motion, core audio, and OpenGL ES. It's built for iOS and optimized for iPhone 5. Congratulations.

[ Applause ]

That's Ridiculous Fishing. And our next winner is WWF Together by the World Wildlife Fund.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

- Congratulations. Want the trophy?
- Congratulations. Congratulations. This app explores the lives of endangered species such as tigers, elephants, and polar bears. Built from the ground up with iPad in mind, it features exquisite visual design and inventive interactions.
- This is an incredible app. It was probably one of the coolest apps we've seen on iPad. It's got outstanding attention to detail, beautiful aesthetic, wonderful sound design and musical score. There's some really engaging writing, some rich typography, gorgeous photography, and then the interaction method for -- whereby you move through these different endangered species, and then you drill down into more information about them is fantastic. It's just got this great attention to detail. And we loved their use of Multi-touch, clever gestures, Core Location support, OpenGL ES, and so much more. This is a fantastic app, and it's tailored for and exclusive on iPad. Congratulations.

[ Applause ]

That was WWF Together. And our next winner is Evernote 5 by Evernote Corporation.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

Coming from both sides. Congratulations.

[ Music ]

Congratulations.

- It will turn off eventually.
- There you go. Evernote helps you remember everything and anything that happens in your life. Beyond notes, that lets you save interesting webpages, create to-dos, attach images, PDFs, and more. And it lets you sync between your Mac, iPhone, iPad, and the web.
- The folks at Evernote took this app on the Mac, it's across multiple IOS devices as well, but they took the Mac app recently and they completely rewrote this client. And they gave it a redesigned Retina display optimized modern single-window UI.
- We'll do photos later.
- They also took advantage of more technologies on Mac OS X than a lot of apps I've seen. They integrate with iCloud, Notification Center, Reminders, they've got QuickLook support, Secure Keychain, Disk encryption, Core Location. They support Full-screen for browsing through your notes. They're fully accessible. And they leverage In App purchase. Great list, and there's even more to say.

And they provide a variety of ways to locate your notes and to dig up the things that you've stored away in the archive. They're localized into 25 languages -- this is on the Mac -- and with Mac iPad and iPhone versions of the app, and even a Safari extension.

These guys -- this teams and your extended team, have shown -- I think they've set the bar for showing how you can differentiate an app on these platforms and do with the right way. And so they built some great products for iOS and for Mac and we wanted to award them for that.

- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

[ Applause ]

That's Evernote. Our next winner is Badland by Frogmind.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

Congratulations. Badland is an atmospheric action adventure platformer that takes side scrollers to the next level. It features innovative physics-based gameplay and extremely beautiful graphics and sound.

Yeah. If you've not played this game, you have got to pick this up and check it out. It has intuitive one-touch controls where you're tapping on screen to raise the little critter up or let him go down, immersive sound design -- this awesome with earphones on. There's some really balanced physics-based gameplay.

And players discover imaginative traps and overcome endless obstacles as they go through these different scenes and environments. There's excellent production value and brilliant execution in this app. Heavy use of OpenGL ES, obviously. It's designed for Retina display, and it's specifically designed for iOS devices, iPad, iPhone and, iPod Touch and it's available only on iOS. Congrats.

[ Applause ]

That's Badland. And our next winner is Yahoo! Weather by Yahoo.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

Congratulations. See weather like never before. This app combines stunning photos with location, time of day, and current conditions. The forecast is beautiful.

- Yeah. This app is an app that totally stands apart. It's got simple, uncluttered, and beautiful visual design; stunning photography; has great layouts and typography; compelling animations as you move through the different cities; and the attention to detail we felt meant that this app stood out in a really saturated category. This is the way to get attention: By doing something that is fantastic like this. It's available in 30 languages and it's optimized for iOS. Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- You guys can head off that way.
- Congrats. Thank you.

[ Music ]

And that's Yahoo! Weather. Our next winner is Letterpress by atebits.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

Congratulations. Beauty meets brains in Letterpress, a fresh take on word games that's a perfect blend of fun and strategy. Find words and steal tiles to color the board.

I think the most interesting thing about this app is, I don't think you were good with words in school, were you? Yeah. Terrible with words in school. So that's what you got to do is write apps that are, you know -- but this is a deceptively and highly addictive game.

It draws you in again and again because of that. And it stands out for its beautiful understated UI. It's got simple gestures, subtle animations, and a really restrained sound design. We love this app. And it illustrates masterful asynchronous gameplay with Game Center, and is available on only on iOS. Congratulations.

[ Applause ]

- And that's Letterpress.
- Wait, though. But I just want to ask you something though.
- Yes.
- What's up with the hair this year?
- I was inspired by the color scheme of the conference this year.
- Oh, nice.
- I blend in with the things downstairs in registration.
- Like a chameleon?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Our next winner: Procreate by Sketch Paint Create by Savage Interactive.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

Congratulations.

- You guys --
- Some good Aussies I understand. Yeah.
- There you go.
- Artists love this app. It comes packed with 48 brushes with everything from true-to-life pencils and inks to unique digital tools. It's a complete art studio at your fingertips.
- This app is exclusive to iPad and iOS, and it is a powerhouse of IOS technologies using ARC, Grand Central Dispatch, and OpenGL ES extensively. And because of that, it's able to deliver state-of-the-art performance and responsiveness with 64-bit precision. It renders canvasses -- canvas sizes up to 4K x 4K at a smooth 60-frame per second.

And anything that you draw on this app can be shared via Photoshop, given -- handed over to Photoshop or shared via Twitter or Facebook, given to mail, photos, and a variety of others destinations. And you can customize virtually anything in this app: You can customize your brushes. You can customize your different digital tools.

And if that's not enough, you can go and purchase more brushes or pencils or tools through In App Purchase. And the App does this really innovative preview of your brushes and pencils in -- before you purchase them in In App Purchase. It also uses Core Bluetooth smoothly to connect with devices like styluses. This app has advanced layer management and compositing, as well. And, you know, we just -- we couldn't put this app down. The judges consistently ranked it high. And it earns an ADA for technical, aesthetic, and creative excellence. Congratulations.

[ Applause ]

- That's Procreate. We're on to our last winner I see --
- Really?
- -- over here. Yes. It is Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders by Atypical Games.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

- You're first, you get the trophy. Congratulations.
- Congratulations. Congrats. Hi.
- Let's move that way a little bit.
- Participate in dogfights, protect fleets, or attack enemy basis in this amazing World War II air combat game. It includes accurately re-created locations, realistic weather, and interactive cockpits.
- And if you've not played this game, again, like the Badlands, pick up a copy of this either for the Mac or for iOS. It's got impressive graphics and sound design. It's Retina enabled and AirPlay enabled. It looks awesome on the Mac or on iOS. And it's got amazing OpenGL based -- based capabilities and effects that are provided. Specular masks, bump mapping, atmospheric scattering, volumetric clouds. As he's shooting here, you're getting bullet cartridges flying off -- flying out of the guns.

Supports radial blur. Shows off heat haze and refractive raindrops on rainy days. It's amazing. This app is iCloud enabled so as you play it across multiple devices, it knows what levels you are at -- that you're at. And there's extensive cross-platform Game Center support, meaning that you can play Mac versus Mac or Mac versus iOS and do that over Game Center. It's localized into 10 languages and this app is available only on OS X and iOS. Congratulations.

[ Applause ]

Congratulations, gentlemen. Nice job.

[ Applause ]

And that was Sky Gamblers. And so those are our winners for today. In addition to the great price package we discussed earlier, these winners will be featured on the App Store, on our Facebook page, as well as on Twitter.

- Nice.
- But that's not all we wanted to share with you today.
- Because every year there are dozens of students who come to WWDC on a scholarship.
- This year the scholarship process required that applicants submit an app. They had four days or less to work on it. And the app was to tell us about themselves.
- And we were so impressed with some of these apps that we had received, you know, that people had submitted for their scholarship, that we wanted to show some of the best submissions.
- So we created a special version of the Apple Design Award trophy, and we'd like to give away a few of these now. Please join -- oh, yeah. And there's one other thing.
- Well, they not only get the trophy. In addition, these budding developers get each a 64-GB iPod Mini -- iPad Mini.

[ Chuckle ]

So please join me in welcoming on stage three student scholarship winners. Louis Harboe, Bryan Keller, and Puck Meerburg.

[ Applause ]

[ Music ]

You must be Puck. Nice to meet you. Congratulations.

- How you doing?
- Congrats you. Are you Louis? We're going to start with you. These three did some pretty impressive work and we'd like to tell you about them now.
- Stand here.
- Let's start with Louis Harboe, in the middle here I believe. Louis is 17 years old and attends the University of Chicago's Laboratory High School.
- Louis began developing on iOS in the seventh grade, and he's already collaborated on several apps in the App Store that have been featured in the "Chicago Sun-Times" and on "Cult of Mac." His WWDC Scholarship App, which you're seeing here on screen scrolling through it, is called "My Adventure book," and it presents a scrolling list of photos and videos that tell the story or provide details about his apps, his education, his experiences, his friends, his family, and etc. You tap on each one of these, they expand and provide more detail. And Louis also interned at Square recently here in San Francisco, and this tab, this little photo right there, tells you that. So pretty amazing stuff for four days of work. Congratulations, Louis.

[ Applause ]

- Next, let's look at Bryan Keller's work. Brian's 19 years old, attends Marist College in New York, and is studying computer science.
- So Bryan is really extremely passionate about programming and he's got an app in the App Store today called "Augmentative and Alternative Communication." And he believes that technology should be intuitive and approachable. And the app that you're seeing right here is just named "Bryan Keller." It's not available in the App Store -- none of theirs is -- but it presents a word cloud that could be tapped and zoomed to reveal details about his apps, his family, his life, his school, his sports, and his interests. And we picked it because it had hockey I think is one of the words, right? No. Kidding. We picked up it because we liked it.
- So that's Bryan's app.
- Good job.

[ Applause ]

- Tremendous. And finally, Puck Meerburg. Puck is 13 years old. He's from Delft in the Netherlands, and he loves to code, as you will see.
- So pay close attention here, okay. Puck learned HTML, PHP, and JavaScript when he was six, all right; he's been recognized as the Internet Hero of 2011 by the VNN, a Dutch television network; he's presented at TEDx Amsterdam when he was 11; and he's released ten apps on the App Store already that have been downloaded 200,000 times. This guy.

[ Applause ]

I mean, the app that you're seeing behind me is his WWDC submission called WWDC, and it uses UIKit, Core Animation, Multi-Touch, Core Graphics to present a comprehensive resume of his life and interests. And each section is different. This one, you're tapping on these clouds, dragging them around. They're just kind of floating around telling you what he dreams of doing and where he plans to be. Which is at Apple I guess one day, yeah? or something. All right. Anyway, we just wanted to highlight these three students for amazing work. Four days of work by each of them. Tremendous. Congratulations.

Congratulations. We're going to have you exit right that way. Congratulations.

[ Music ]

- Now, one thing I will say, too, is all ADA winners are also going to be wearing special lanyard, so if you see these three guys walking around, please introduce yourself to them, talk to them, learn from them or something, and just help them out. And also there's the other ADA winners as well. Please acknowledge them throughout the week and find out how they did what they did.
- So these are our ADA 2013 winners.
- These are 11 great apps that demonstrate technical, design, and creative excellence.
- Eleven really great apps they set the standards that other apps should reach for.
- And 11 really great apps that people are going to come back to again and again and again. And like we've said in a lot of the sessions today already, we can't wait to see what you are going to do on iOS VII and OS 10 Mavericks. And so we look forward to having your app featured here on stage next year in the ADA as we will be looking for apps that exploit these operating systems.
- Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next year.

[ Applause ]
