WEBVTT

00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:10.176
[ Silence ]

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.286
>> We have audience
participation.

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:14.176
Look at that!

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:15.026
That's great.

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:16.446
Yehey! [applause]
It's working together.

00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:18.376
We have achieved
something here today.

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:19.116
All right.

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:20.206
What's new in iBooks Author?

00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:23.946
Great. So today's agenda,
I'm going to give you a demo

00:00:23.946 --> 00:00:24.686
of iBooks for the Mac.

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:25.846
It's going to be a
little bit more in depth

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:27.926
than what Craig showed
yesterday during the keynote,

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:30.106
although it showed amazing well.

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:31.006
They were very proud of it.

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:33.076
I'm going to show
you iBooks Author 2.0

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:34.386
as I promised I would do.

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:36.146
And through that you're
going to learn how

00:00:36.146 --> 00:00:37.366
to do a few different things.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.126
You can learn how to
create your own templates,

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:41.036
how to build interactive
content.

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:42.946
You're going to discover the
new widgets and learn how

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:44.076
to apply them effectively.

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.656
I'm going to show you how

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:48.676
to publish books directly
within iBooks Author.

00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:51.446
It's one of the features
we added in version 2.0,

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:53.586
and also show you how to
version your book directly

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.716
from within iBooks Author.

00:00:55.226 --> 00:00:56.776
And then hopefully along
the way, we're going to pick

00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:58.746
up some skills that you
wouldn't have come here

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:00.796
with that will enable
you to create books

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:02.196
in a very efficient manner.

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:04.896
First, a recap.

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:07.566
So we launched the iBooks
Multi-Touch Experience

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.446
in January of 2012
with the intent of kind

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:12.746
of revolutionizing textbooks.

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.676
And our vision was
that through the iPad,

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.856
we could create a
new generation of--

00:01:18.856 --> 00:01:21.056
new version of education
materials that did a lot more

00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:22.906
than their printed counterparts

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.456
by making it a more
multimedia experience,

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:29.426
a more explorative experience
that obviously textbooks can be

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:31.016
in their static guise.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:35.416
So this is an example of
what our textbooks look like.

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:37.576
You can see they're
very visually rich.

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:39.676
You can't tell here of course,

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.136
but they're very
touch-interactive.

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.796
These callouts, for example, the
interactive image I can interact

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:46.376
with and explore
different facets

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:48.746
of that underlying
image very easily.

00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:52.806
So we've achieved
a few of our goals

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:54.626
that we'd set out to accomplish.

00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:56.726
So far, we've got thousands

00:01:56.726 --> 00:01:58.436
of textbooks published
to the iBooks store.

00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:01.746
We have an excess, I think at
this point, of 22,000 titles

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:04.596
on the bookstore today,
Multi-Touch titles,

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:07.296
which includes publications
from all

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:09.395
of the major textbooks
publishers, Pearson,

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.586
McGraw-Hill, Houghton Mifflin,

00:02:11.176 --> 00:02:14.876
and a bunch of independent
publishers, you may be some

00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:17.076
of them, thousands
of those worldwide.

00:02:17.076 --> 00:02:20.366
We've got 100 percent coverage
of the high school core,

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:22.986
common core curriculum
in the United States.

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:25.046
We have over 2,500 classrooms

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.926
in the US using these
Multi-Touch textbooks today.

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:31.886
And now we have books
available in the US, in Canada,

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:33.726
Australia, and the UK.

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:36.396
So really proud of our
achievements there.

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:38.646
And here're some examples
of the kinds of textbooks

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:39.756
that are being published today.

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:42.476
Shakespeare like you've
never known it before,

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:43.576
the Shakespearience.

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:45.556
Just give round of applause

00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:46.996
for the Shakespeariemce
folks right now.

00:02:47.216 --> 00:02:51.306
By making judicious use of media
and interacted experiences,

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.386
it allows you to kind of explore
and experience Shakespeare

00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:55.316
in a way you never,
ever could before.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:56.866
The Houghton Mifflin's biology,

00:02:57.236 --> 00:02:59.466
Richard Feynman's
Six Easy Pieces,

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:04.046
it's-that's a bald face lie
of a title, but whatever.

00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:07.976
Core-- Core Class Life
Science, our course E.

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:08.116
O.

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.076
Wilson's Life on
Earth, I could go on.

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:12.176
But in addition to those
educational titles,

00:03:12.176 --> 00:03:15.606
we're seeing books in many
other categories find their way

00:03:15.606 --> 00:03:16.476
to the iBooks store.

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:19.016
Publishers have found this
platform and are using it

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:22.206
to showcase titles that are from
different categories altogether.

00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:25.996
So from Random House, we have
Tyler Florence's Fresh book,

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:29.286
which through interactive
content allows you

00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:31.906
to explore these recipes
in kind of a different way.

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:35.136
They've even got smart things
like an HTML widget at the end

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:38.466
of the book that allows you
to calculate the ingredients

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:40.466
that you're going to need
given the number of servings

00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:41.256
that you need to serve.

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:45.506
Jessica Alba's lifestyle
book, The Honest Life,

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:47.346
a book she managed to published

00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:50.606
on her own despite my
repeated attempt to help her.

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:56.026
The Rolling Stones, 50-year--
50 years of the Rolling Stones,

00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:59.556
it's an amazing multimedia
book, a great back scenes,

00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:01.976
behind the scenes kind of
view point of the band.

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:06.206
Linda McCartney's photographic,
just published by Taschen,

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.476
very happy to see
that get published.

00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:11.786
DK, one of our most prolific
publishers with amazing animals,

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:15.676
I think they've got-- well,
over 40 titles now around.

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:16.646
I might be lying about that.

00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:19.016
Don't quote me, but
just a lot of titles.

00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:22.196
Amongst those other
titles, we have books

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:25.036
that are somewhat technical in
nature which may be the kinds

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:26.846
of things that maybe
you're hoping to do

00:04:27.176 --> 00:04:30.006
out there spans the
gamut from, like,

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:33.586
gaming guides to user guides.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:38.876
Here we have a Canon
Mark 5D user guide.

00:04:39.226 --> 00:04:40.956
I see a couple of titles
here that are going

00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:43.936
to need updating just
based on revelations

00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:46.946
from this very conference,
that guy notably.

00:04:47.926 --> 00:04:49.556
But you get the picture.

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:52.706
If you've got something
to say and the materials

00:04:52.706 --> 00:04:54.686
to say it with, you can
put a book together.

00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:56.186
You can publish to
the iBookstore

00:04:56.186 --> 00:04:57.206
and get the message out.

00:04:57.716 --> 00:05:03.266
And now, you're not just getting
the message out on the iPad,

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:05.286
you're also getting
it out via the Mac.

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:08.276
So without further adieu, I'm
going to give you a little demo

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:09.706
of iBooks for the Mac.

00:05:09.836 --> 00:05:12.876
All right, so this is my
new Mavericks desktop.

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:16.886
I'm going to click the shiny new
iBooks icon, up pops my Library.

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.576
Here all the books in my Library

00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:21.886
which I can browse a
number of different ways.

00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:24.506
It's going to point out the
buttons on the toolbar here

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:27.426
so everyone is familiarized
with the UI.

00:05:27.586 --> 00:05:28.686
This is the Store button.

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:31.356
I dare not press it
today for this demo

00:05:31.846 --> 00:05:34.296
but when you do click
it, we're shipping--

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:36.146
you'll flip over
to the iBooks store

00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:38.286
and you'll get the
complete iBooks experience

00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:39.696
and if you shop in context,

00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:41.246
the same way you do
within iTunes today.

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:44.586
Next we have a set of tabs
that allows me to kind of look

00:05:44.586 --> 00:05:45.976
at my books in a different way.

00:05:45.976 --> 00:05:47.496
So I can click on
the collections tab,

00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:51.066
see all my purchased books,
see just my textbooks,

00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:52.836
see my fiction books, and so on.

00:05:53.316 --> 00:05:56.396
I can view by author, I can
view by genre or I can view

00:05:56.396 --> 00:05:59.096
in a list view which
hasn't built out yet.

00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:01.196
Obviously the books
are all searchable.

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:04.836
I can sort them in
different ways,

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:08.326
can sort them alphabetically
which will make more sense

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.556
when I turn on the labels.

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:13.226
You have a number of different
options for viewing your books.

00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:16.506
So let's get into one
of our book experiences.

00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:19.206
The first one I'm going
to show you is Curiosity.

00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:20.546
And this book kind

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:24.926
of exemplifies why we
built iBooks Author.

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:27.166
Because the gentleman
who published this book--

00:06:27.276 --> 00:06:30.566
his name is Patrick Lister
is not a book publisher.

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:32.376
[Background Music] He's
not a book designer.

00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:33.866
His background is
in engineering,

00:06:34.716 --> 00:06:39.156
but he has a fondness and love
for the Mars Exploration Program

00:06:40.406 --> 00:06:43.436
and thought he could
showcase it in a book

00:06:44.746 --> 00:06:46.166
which he's absolutely done.

00:06:46.316 --> 00:06:48.356
And he's created a
beautiful experience.

00:06:49.526 --> 00:06:52.336
So there you saw the intermedia
which you may recognize

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:53.976
or remember from the iPad.

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:57.296
When it plays through, I'm
brought to the graphical table

00:06:57.296 --> 00:06:59.956
of contents view, it's
exactly the same as the iPad

00:06:59.956 --> 00:07:03.726
and it's a good place to call
out evidence that you built

00:07:03.726 --> 00:07:07.036
for one platform and you get
the benefit of having it run

00:07:07.086 --> 00:07:08.246
on multiple platforms.

00:07:08.246 --> 00:07:09.016
So it's going to
work on the iPad.

00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:09.886
It's going to work here.

00:07:09.886 --> 00:07:11.026
You don't have to
do anything special.

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:15.476
Also the methods of
interacting with the content

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.696
on the iPad have transferred.

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:20.316
So here I'm using my Macbook Pro
and I've got a trackpad with it.

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:22.406
So if I want to swipe
through my chapters,

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:24.316
I can just swipe
using my fingers

00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:25.716
on the trackpad and away I go.

00:07:26.606 --> 00:07:28.976
I can also swipe through
the thumbnails down here

00:07:28.976 --> 00:07:32.216
at the bottom, decide where I
want to go and just click there.

00:07:32.436 --> 00:07:33.736
Let's start with page 1.

00:07:34.326 --> 00:07:38.266
So here, I swiped to page 2.

00:07:38.266 --> 00:07:39.466
There's a movie.

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:40.946
[Background Music] I can
play that movie in place.

00:07:41.516 --> 00:07:45.896
[ Music ]

00:07:46.396 --> 00:07:47.916
I can also expand that movie--

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:49.336
>> It was this really
amazing moment--

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.226
>> So it fills the
window if I want to make

00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:52.986
that window larger, I can.

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:54.866
That's great.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:58.016
You'll note here that we've
actually overtaken the

00:07:58.016 --> 00:07:58.766
toolbar here.

00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:00.436
So it's an edge to
edge experience--

00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:02.016
to full bleed experience
for media.

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:04.226
We want it to maximize
the impact

00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:05.496
of that media on the page.

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:10.606
When I'm done, I just click
Done and I'm back to the page.

00:08:11.146 --> 00:08:13.806
An example of some beautiful
typographic treatment

00:08:13.806 --> 00:08:15.776
that Patrick has
integrated within his book,

00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:17.016
we're going to replicate
that later

00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:20.686
on so I'm drawing your attention
to it, kind of right now.

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:21.876
Next, we have gallery.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:25.026
You can swipe through the
images of the gallery in place.

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:27.776
I can click on individual
thumbs.

00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:30.216
I can go full-screen.

00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:31.936
I can do all of that stuff

00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:34.626
and you can see the
experiences very complete.

00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:36.566
If I pause for a
second, the UI fades away

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:39.515
and then you can really feel
that completeness of the image.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.476
Scanning over on our
pages a little bit.

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:52.026
Here we've got a 3D
element, interact with Mars,

00:08:52.026 --> 00:08:53.946
spin it around, which
I love to do

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:56.346
and of course here it's
identifying all the landing

00:08:56.346 --> 00:08:58.046
points for the various
rovers and landers

00:08:58.086 --> 00:09:00.256
that have spotted
Mars over the years.

00:09:01.016 --> 00:09:04.046
Next, I want to show
you an example

00:09:04.046 --> 00:09:06.156
of something that's
found on another page.

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:09.246
To get back to the graphical
table of contents view

00:09:09.506 --> 00:09:11.086
with the trackpad,
I simply pinch,

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:12.476
same convention as the iPad.

00:09:12.506 --> 00:09:16.116
And now I can scan ahead
to the next chapter,

00:09:16.536 --> 00:09:18.466
click on the contents
of the next chapter,

00:09:19.036 --> 00:09:20.756
and find a page that
I've bookmarked.

00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:22.076
Here it is.

00:09:22.216 --> 00:09:26.186
So whenever you bookmarked a
page in iBooks for the Mac,

00:09:26.386 --> 00:09:28.626
you see a red bookmark
represented on your thumbnail.

00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:32.616
So I want to show you this guy
'cause this is an HTML widget

00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:36.886
that is really effectively
used and it's a good example

00:09:36.886 --> 00:09:41.136
of when you should choose
to use HTML to have kind

00:09:41.136 --> 00:09:42.416
of a unique experience.

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:45.586
So here, it's a timeline
of Mars exploration.

00:09:45.976 --> 00:09:48.806
So I can actually scroll
down here with the trackpad,

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:50.846
click on an event
in the timeline

00:09:51.446 --> 00:09:54.256
or I can use these
little previous,

00:09:54.256 --> 00:09:56.156
next navigators to
get to a place.

00:09:56.156 --> 00:10:00.316
It's really quite beautiful
and impactful and no reason--

00:10:01.406 --> 00:10:02.626
well, they have every reason,

00:10:02.626 --> 00:10:04.686
Patrick had every reason not
use a conventional widget

00:10:04.686 --> 00:10:07.626
but rather do something
in it's own in this case.

00:10:08.286 --> 00:10:09.916
And I hit Escape and I'm out.

00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:11.636
So this page is bookmarked.

00:10:11.636 --> 00:10:13.936
If I rollover the
toolbar area up here.

00:10:13.936 --> 00:10:15.596
You'll see that we have
a few different icons

00:10:15.636 --> 00:10:17.456
that appear within the toolbar.

00:10:17.456 --> 00:10:18.896
I can see this page
is bookmarked.

00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:21.246
If I click the arrow
just to the right of it,

00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:23.966
I see that I've got some
other things earmarked.

00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:26.036
I'm going to choose one--

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:28.596
actually I'm not going
to choose one right now.

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:31.786
Let me show you the
pop-over widget first.

00:10:31.786 --> 00:10:35.126
So, here you can't really
tell but this is more

00:10:35.126 --> 00:10:36.536
than just a static image.

00:10:36.576 --> 00:10:38.386
Patrick used the pop-over widget

00:10:38.386 --> 00:10:40.066
to provide some additional
information about the

00:10:40.846 --> 00:10:43.226
where the world's
radio broadcast here.

00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:48.596
So, the sidebar widget and the
pop-over widget are widgets

00:10:48.596 --> 00:10:50.316
that are great for kind
of condensing the amount

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.836
of information that
you get on a page.

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:53.836
So if you have a side story
that you need to tell,

00:10:54.066 --> 00:10:56.076
you can tell it really
well using these widgets.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.826
I want to show that
everything is clickable.

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.066
You can click on an image,
it's brought full-screen.

00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:03.856
You can examine it
in full glory.

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:05.156
Every image that we save

00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:08.036
out in iBooks Author is
taking iPad Retina Displays

00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:11.696
into accounts which means you
have overhead for users to kind

00:11:11.696 --> 00:11:13.086
of zoom in and explore images,

00:11:13.086 --> 00:11:14.956
and really get the
most from them.

00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:20.326
All right.

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:21.716
So next I'm going
to switch gears

00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:23.236
and show you another title.

00:11:23.236 --> 00:11:24.166
No, I'm not going
to do that either.

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:25.606
I'm going to search
for something.

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:28.606
So Johannes Kepler,
who had a lot to say

00:11:28.606 --> 00:11:30.216
about planetary motion.

00:11:30.296 --> 00:11:33.866
In here, I mentioned a sidebar.

00:11:34.046 --> 00:11:36.426
This is where I want
to show the sidebar.

00:11:37.016 --> 00:11:38.866
So the sidebar here is
a scrolling sidebar,

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:41.926
looks and feels a lot like the
pop-over widget I just showed,

00:11:41.926 --> 00:11:45.106
except that always occupies a
place on the page, but again,

00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:48.236
a very great way to kind
of collapse information

00:11:48.456 --> 00:11:50.426
within any given page.

00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:53.886
And now I really will switch
to go show you another title.

00:11:54.326 --> 00:11:56.296
So I click this little
Toolbar icon at the left,

00:11:56.296 --> 00:11:58.396
it represents the Library
up comes the Library.

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.916
I'm going to close this guy.

00:12:01.136 --> 00:12:03.916
Now I'm going to show Richard
Feynman's Six Easy Pieces,

00:12:04.546 --> 00:12:06.426
like I told you very much a lie.

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:12.426
>> [Background Music] Things on
a very small scale behave-- -

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:12.886
>> All right.

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:13.956
So [inaudible] for
me the experience,

00:12:13.956 --> 00:12:16.506
apparently Richard Feynman
was as fond of bongos

00:12:16.506 --> 00:12:18.256
as he was theoretical physics.

00:12:18.256 --> 00:12:23.466
Who knew? It's the
same deal once you get

00:12:23.466 --> 00:12:25.936
into the chapter view, of
course, from scrolling ahead,

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:28.996
there's something I want
to show here in Chapter 2,

00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:30.496
and I know I bookmarked
that page.

00:12:30.986 --> 00:12:35.676
What I'm going to show you
now is two different guises

00:12:35.676 --> 00:12:38.116
of this audio widget, which
is in fact, the media widget.

00:12:38.406 --> 00:12:42.246
So here we see the
standard playback control

00:12:42.246 --> 00:12:44.016
that you may remember
from version 1

00:12:44.086 --> 00:12:45.826
of iBooks Multi-Touch Books.

00:12:45.826 --> 00:12:50.176
So this is great for long form
audio if you have something

00:12:50.176 --> 00:12:53.496
that users may need to
scrub through or want to zap

00:12:53.496 --> 00:12:55.056
to a specific point within.

00:12:55.496 --> 00:12:58.876
The scrubber is a great way to
kind of support that activity.

00:12:59.526 --> 00:13:02.586
But that's not appropriate
for all audio links.

00:13:02.906 --> 00:13:05.826
Here, we have another
version of the audio widget.

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:06.976
It's in the button the mode.

00:13:06.976 --> 00:13:08.116
And when I click it--

00:13:08.116 --> 00:13:11.366
>> So we gradually try to
analyze all this trying

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:13.786
to put together things which
at first sight look different

00:13:14.266 --> 00:13:16.536
with the hope that we maybe
able to reduce the thing

00:13:16.536 --> 00:13:18.216
and understand it better.

00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:20.146
>> Obviously, you
didn't hear any of that.

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:22.986
But you saw the radio playback.

00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.086
You saw that it was
giving you feedback

00:13:25.086 --> 00:13:26.416
about the length of the content.

00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:28.356
And that content was the right--

00:13:28.526 --> 00:13:32.646
or this button interaction
was the right way

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.816
to represent audio
of that duration.

00:13:36.096 --> 00:13:37.596
But what I really
want to show you

00:13:37.596 --> 00:13:41.616
in this title are our
note taking features to--

00:13:41.616 --> 00:13:46.206
so I'm going to launch our
pop-over table of contents view.

00:13:46.206 --> 00:13:48.426
So this is another kind
of table of contents view.

00:13:48.426 --> 00:13:50.276
You saw the graphical
table contents view.

00:13:50.826 --> 00:13:54.036
This represents all of the
contents of your book as a list

00:13:54.176 --> 00:13:55.786
and it's analogous
to the portrait table

00:13:55.786 --> 00:13:57.106
of contents from the iPad.

00:13:57.886 --> 00:14:02.856
So I can expand in chapter
and click on a location

00:14:03.316 --> 00:14:05.316
and I'm brought to that
page within the book.

00:14:05.776 --> 00:14:07.446
And you'll note that
down here, what appeared

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:10.666
in this little placard is
basically a kind of snapback UI

00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:13.246
or history UI that would
allow me to get back

00:14:13.326 --> 00:14:14.436
to my previous location.

00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:17.166
So if I'm following a hyperlink,
or exploring something

00:14:17.246 --> 00:14:18.386
in kind of a free form way.

00:14:18.386 --> 00:14:21.146
I can get back to previous
location very quickly.

00:14:22.506 --> 00:14:23.546
But here as I mentioned,

00:14:23.546 --> 00:14:25.576
I want to show you our
highlights and notes.

00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:27.896
So I have a highlight
and a corresponding note.

00:14:27.896 --> 00:14:30.396
If I want to view the contents
of that note, I can click on it

00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:32.006
and that note will
appear in place.

00:14:34.396 --> 00:14:38.896
If I want to create a highlight
and a note, I can simply draw

00:14:38.896 --> 00:14:40.896
out a selection range and then

00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:43.546
up will pop this little
highlighting menu, and then via

00:14:43.546 --> 00:14:45.626
that menu I can just
hit Add Note.

00:14:52.956 --> 00:14:53.986
And there I've added my note.

00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:55.886
There's another method
for creating a highlight

00:14:55.886 --> 00:14:57.146
in very quick fashion, too.

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.476
That's using the
command key as modifier.

00:15:00.326 --> 00:15:01.456
It was a shortcut rather.

00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:04.066
And with it, I can just
simply draw out my highlight,

00:15:04.226 --> 00:15:07.906
click on it again, change the
color, and you get the idea.

00:15:09.146 --> 00:15:11.856
Now whenever you
resize the window,

00:15:12.046 --> 00:15:13.856
we're trying do a
couple of smart things.

00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:17.846
So you'll note that, when the
window is fit to the page size

00:15:17.846 --> 00:15:19.286
and it kind of roll
over the margins,

00:15:19.326 --> 00:15:21.576
these little page affordances,

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:23.526
paging affordances
appear in the page margin.

00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:26.146
If I make the window
just a little bit larger,

00:15:26.496 --> 00:15:28.626
you'll see that they actually
appear on the outside,

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:30.496
it will allow me to page.

00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:32.686
If I make the window
larger still,

00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:34.996
you can see that the notes are
telegraphing that they're going

00:15:34.996 --> 00:15:36.176
to appear in the margin for me.

00:15:36.366 --> 00:15:38.876
So if ever I need to
review my notes in context,

00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:40.826
this is a great and efficient
way to be able to do that.

00:15:41.286 --> 00:15:43.856
Then I can simply page through

00:15:44.466 --> 00:15:48.146
and view all these
notes in line.

00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:51.406
But wait, there's more.

00:15:53.146 --> 00:15:54.616
If I make the window
larger still,

00:15:54.616 --> 00:15:56.486
you can see that there's a
little page trying to peek

00:15:56.486 --> 00:15:57.236
out in the background.

00:15:57.236 --> 00:15:58.576
When the window gets big enough,

00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:01.756
I get Two Up mode
which is awesome.

00:16:02.026 --> 00:16:05.976
And then, of course, if you want
it all, you can have Two Up,

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:10.206
notes in margins and you're good
to go, making really great use

00:16:10.326 --> 00:16:12.046
of the Mac's overall resolution

00:16:12.316 --> 00:16:14.286
and the ability to
resize windows.

00:16:14.446 --> 00:16:15.766
We also have a notes view.

00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:18.666
So up here in the toolbar,
you click on the second icon

00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:21.546
from left and it will come the
notes view or the notes panel.

00:16:22.026 --> 00:16:23.326
And within it, I have--

00:16:23.466 --> 00:16:24.886
or can see all of the notes

00:16:24.886 --> 00:16:26.666
across all the chapters
in the book.

00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:28.556
Only those chapters that
have notes are represented

00:16:28.556 --> 00:16:29.096
in this view.

00:16:30.006 --> 00:16:34.136
But if I want to quickly find a
note, I can scan to a location,

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:36.956
click this button, and,
of course, that page,

00:16:37.386 --> 00:16:39.666
and I click this button, of
course, it's only one page away.

00:16:39.856 --> 00:16:43.136
I will click this button
and boom, I just warped

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:44.226
to another part of the book.

00:16:44.226 --> 00:16:49.156
All together, if I want to edit
a note in place, I can do this.

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.156
And I'm good to go.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:59.386
And then, if I want to get
back to the previous location,

00:17:00.116 --> 00:17:02.346
where we were before, I
click on that and there I am.

00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:07.185
Finally, when it comes
time to review my notes

00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:11.096
and to study the contents
preparing for a test,

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.346
we brought over the study cards

00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:13.766
that you may remember
from the iPad.

00:17:14.246 --> 00:17:16.056
So here's a set of study
cards that are derived

00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:17.796
from my highlights and my notes.

00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:19.266
There are no glossary
terms defined

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:20.076
for this particular book.

00:17:20.136 --> 00:17:22.526
But if they were, they
would appear here in line

00:17:22.816 --> 00:17:24.096
with my own notes
and highlights.

00:17:24.996 --> 00:17:28.566
But in order to move through
the cards, I can simply swipe

00:17:28.766 --> 00:17:31.426
with the track pad,
click to flip the card.

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:39.306
I've heard it said a number of
times, but I wish I had this

00:17:39.966 --> 00:17:44.496
if when I was in school
about 20 years ago.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:48.096
You can also filter these down,
so it's just your glossary terms

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:51.006
or highlights of any given
color, a very powerful tool

00:17:51.006 --> 00:17:53.816
for studying and we think this
is going to be a great boon

00:17:53.816 --> 00:17:57.906
for students who used their
Mac in studying contexts.

00:17:58.466 --> 00:18:05.456
So that's it for our tour
of iBooks for the Mac

00:18:05.456 --> 00:18:07.156
and to switch back to my slides.

00:18:11.106 --> 00:18:13.496
So all of that content was
enabled with this tool,

00:18:13.496 --> 00:18:18.376
iBooks Author, textbooks, cook
books, photography anthologies,

00:18:18.756 --> 00:18:21.436
anything that is visual
in nature is fair game

00:18:21.436 --> 00:18:23.406
for iBooks Author and
anything that could be extended

00:18:23.406 --> 00:18:26.206
with media is also fair
game for iBooks Author.

00:18:27.926 --> 00:18:28.976
So what is it?

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:31.706
Well, it's a tool for creating
exactly that kind of content,

00:18:32.106 --> 00:18:35.056
it's a WYSIWYG in dragg-and-drop
editor, we try and stayed--

00:18:35.136 --> 00:18:36.666
we stayed very true
to those kind

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:40.166
of interaction principles
throughout the system

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:41.656
and all the workflows
it supports.

00:18:41.736 --> 00:18:44.106
So with those paradigms in mind,

00:18:44.106 --> 00:18:46.766
you can write edit
and import text.

00:18:46.856 --> 00:18:49.376
You can add graphics, you
can customize page layouts,

00:18:49.376 --> 00:18:51.416
you can make the thing look and
feel exactly as you need it.

00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:55.266
You can also create these
interactive experiences using

00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:57.806
basic media like
images, video, and audio,

00:18:58.046 --> 00:19:00.356
just using basic drag
and drop techniques.

00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:02.826
It works for single publishers.

00:19:03.106 --> 00:19:05.966
It also works for professional
publishing pipelines

00:19:05.966 --> 00:19:07.926
where you have many
users collaborating

00:19:07.926 --> 00:19:09.786
around a single book.

00:19:10.146 --> 00:19:11.656
And probably, the
biggest incentive this,

00:19:11.656 --> 00:19:12.726
of course, it's free.

00:19:12.726 --> 00:19:15.486
We're not asking you to
shell out lots of cash.

00:19:15.486 --> 00:19:18.016
We are however asking you to
publish to the iBooks store.

00:19:18.226 --> 00:19:19.506
So please do that.

00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:23.056
Why would you choose to use
this particular platform

00:19:23.056 --> 00:19:25.816
over other competitive
choices that you may have

00:19:25.816 --> 00:19:26.946
and that are open to you?

00:19:27.516 --> 00:19:31.146
Well, you can create these
immersive iPad experiences

00:19:31.146 --> 00:19:33.316
without code and
these are experiences

00:19:33.316 --> 00:19:34.446
that are designed for the iPad.

00:19:34.446 --> 00:19:37.826
So all of that work and
thought and experience

00:19:37.826 --> 00:19:41.306
in designing the iPad itself is
being translated directly here.

00:19:41.766 --> 00:19:44.476
So when we design a widget, you
can be assured that you're going

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.206
to get a very equality
experience at the end

00:19:46.206 --> 00:19:48.276
when the users actually
interact with your content.

00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:52.356
But we provide flexibility
for you to go out on your own

00:19:52.356 --> 00:19:54.756
and create these great
unique experiences

00:19:54.756 --> 00:19:56.896
like the timeline I showed
you from Patrick Lister's book

00:19:57.726 --> 00:20:00.456
when you need to, just
using HTML widget and HTML5.

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.976
As I mentioned, it's designed
to work perfectly on the iPad.

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:07.516
But now, of course,
the Mac create--

00:20:07.566 --> 00:20:09.686
wants published in
many places or have it

00:20:09.826 --> 00:20:11.176
to be consumed to many places.

00:20:11.726 --> 00:20:14.136
You get true layout and type
setting, so things looked

00:20:14.376 --> 00:20:16.796
like real books but they
feel like something else.

00:20:16.796 --> 00:20:19.446
They feel like something
it's truly interactive.

00:20:19.666 --> 00:20:22.676
And the sum-- total of which
leads to this statement,

00:20:23.026 --> 00:20:24.546
which is bold, but
it is my opinion.

00:20:24.946 --> 00:20:26.116
It's the best platform

00:20:26.116 --> 00:20:28.276
for creating interactive
media rich books,

00:20:28.446 --> 00:20:29.266
that's out there today.

00:20:29.526 --> 00:20:30.506
You can't do it with ePub.

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:32.316
You can't do it with PDF.

00:20:32.316 --> 00:20:35.276
Of course, not in the way that
you can with iBooks Author

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.486
in the .ibooks format.

00:20:39.896 --> 00:20:42.146
So what's new in
iBooks Author 2.0?

00:20:42.146 --> 00:20:45.326
What kind of stuff
you're going to see today?

00:20:45.526 --> 00:20:47.246
We introduced portrait-fixed
layout books.

00:20:47.426 --> 00:20:51.146
Our first version of the books
where in a landscape flavor,

00:20:51.146 --> 00:20:53.726
there was a portrait
flow mode that was kind

00:20:53.726 --> 00:20:56.596
of an optional mode that was
enabled by turning the iPad

00:20:56.596 --> 00:20:58.366
into a portrait orientation.

00:20:58.896 --> 00:21:01.286
But now, portrait-fixed layout
books, you can layout something

00:21:01.286 --> 00:21:02.796
that fills a lot
more like a book.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.736
We have introduced two math
typesettings using LaTeX

00:21:05.966 --> 00:21:06.646
and MathML.

00:21:07.116 --> 00:21:09.996
We are optimizing
media automatically.

00:21:09.996 --> 00:21:13.026
So when you drag in a piece
of media, you don't have

00:21:13.056 --> 00:21:15.256
to precompress it, we're
going to do that for you.

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:17.036
We're also going to transcode
it to the right format.

00:21:17.036 --> 00:21:19.186
So you don't run in any
glitches when you're uploading

00:21:19.186 --> 00:21:21.786
to the iBooks store and your
content will get refused

00:21:21.786 --> 00:21:22.276
as a result.

00:21:23.476 --> 00:21:25.766
We've got new widgets, I
showed you the pop-over widget,

00:21:25.766 --> 00:21:27.376
I showed you the
scrolling sidebar widget,

00:21:27.376 --> 00:21:29.196
and the new audio widget modes.

00:21:29.996 --> 00:21:33.356
The enhanced publishing workflow
with the support for versioning

00:21:33.356 --> 00:21:35.786
which is very important when
you want to update your book.

00:21:35.856 --> 00:21:39.226
Basically, we're trying
to transform people's--

00:21:39.226 --> 00:21:41.536
I don't want to say it--

00:21:41.796 --> 00:21:44.306
understanding of books and
make them feel more evergreen

00:21:44.306 --> 00:21:44.846
in nature.

00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:48.316
So like apps can be updated on
an ongoing basis and content

00:21:48.316 --> 00:21:51.386
and new value can continue to be
added to your-- for your users.

00:21:51.666 --> 00:21:53.756
You can do that now
with iBooks books.

00:21:54.516 --> 00:21:57.556
And we also now support embedded
font, so you really can get

00:21:57.556 --> 00:22:00.526
that crisp, custom look
that you're looking for.

00:22:01.076 --> 00:22:03.976
All right.

00:22:03.976 --> 00:22:07.206
So now on to part 2.

00:22:07.336 --> 00:22:09.936
Let me show you how to
build this great stuff using

00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:10.976
iBooks Author.

00:22:11.936 --> 00:22:14.746
Now there are few points I
want to leave you with today.

00:22:14.796 --> 00:22:19.966
Probably, the most important
of them is this, when you sit

00:22:19.966 --> 00:22:22.086
down to write your book
or compose your book

00:22:22.086 --> 00:22:24.686
within iBooks Author, you
really should have written your

00:22:24.686 --> 00:22:25.346
book first.

00:22:25.756 --> 00:22:28.556
You can sit down and
start typing away

00:22:28.896 --> 00:22:30.796
and you can craft your book.

00:22:30.796 --> 00:22:33.826
And you'll get there and
you'll be able to do it

00:22:34.776 --> 00:22:38.846
with little difficulty, but it
won't put you on the great place

00:22:38.846 --> 00:22:40.126
to make changes down the line.

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:43.216
So what we recommend to do
is that you do two things.

00:22:43.426 --> 00:22:45.276
You write your book
first, your write it

00:22:45.276 --> 00:22:47.846
with your interactive content in
mind to know what you want to do

00:22:48.276 --> 00:22:50.436
when you sit down to compose
with in iBooks Author.

00:22:50.436 --> 00:22:52.956
And then finally,
we ask that you--

00:22:52.956 --> 00:22:56.596
or recommend rather that you
build your template first.

00:22:56.716 --> 00:22:58.586
Building your template will
allow you to make those kinds

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.146
of changes late in the editorial
process when you need to.

00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:06.316
It will help support multiuser
or collaboration workflows

00:23:06.316 --> 00:23:08.256
when you're working with
many people, you know,

00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:11.316
just make your life a
lot easier, trust me.

00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:14.566
So our content here that
I'm choosing to replicate is

00:23:14.566 --> 00:23:16.906
that Curiosity book
that we'd shown.

00:23:18.246 --> 00:23:20.566
So in order to replicate
it, I'm going to try

00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:21.796
and find a template here

00:23:22.176 --> 00:23:25.236
that roughly approximates
Patrick's look and feel,

00:23:25.496 --> 00:23:26.826
nothing is identical to it.

00:23:26.986 --> 00:23:28.546
So up here, we have a collection

00:23:28.546 --> 00:23:31.686
of landscape templates
which I can choose.

00:23:31.686 --> 00:23:33.666
Down here, we have the
portrait fix layout templates

00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:36.596
which we introduced
with version 2.0.

00:23:37.196 --> 00:23:39.306
It's a landscape book
that we're going to create

00:23:39.526 --> 00:23:44.006
and this is the template we're
going to chose to create it.

00:23:44.266 --> 00:23:48.346
So when you launch a template
we're putting you in a place

00:23:48.346 --> 00:23:50.806
where if you want to start
creating your book, you can kind

00:23:50.806 --> 00:23:53.846
of just get under way and
start building things.

00:23:54.216 --> 00:23:57.866
We're not going to do that
right here now that we're going

00:23:57.866 --> 00:23:59.616
to build our template
first as I recommended.

00:23:59.966 --> 00:24:02.846
But first, let's take a look
at the UI of iBooks Author.

00:24:03.646 --> 00:24:07.896
So if any of you are users of
Pages, Keynote, or Numbers,

00:24:07.896 --> 00:24:09.956
do we have those users out
there, are they out there,

00:24:09.996 --> 00:24:11.726
and so we'd like to see.

00:24:11.816 --> 00:24:14.326
This is going to
feel familiar, right.

00:24:14.326 --> 00:24:16.936
It's the same framework that
you recognize from those tools.

00:24:17.226 --> 00:24:18.686
Not only as the UI
framework the same,

00:24:18.686 --> 00:24:20.006
the underlying objects
are the same.

00:24:20.006 --> 00:24:22.836
So when you create a table
in Numbers and you paste it

00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:25.406
in here, you're getting that
table, we don't support things

00:24:25.406 --> 00:24:27.776
like computation
within those tables,

00:24:27.776 --> 00:24:28.786
but the table will come over.

00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:31.106
If you create graph,
any graphic elements,

00:24:31.106 --> 00:24:34.276
in any of those applications,
you can copy and paste them here

00:24:34.276 --> 00:24:35.406
and stuff, is just
going to work.

00:24:35.736 --> 00:24:37.756
So going left to right
across our toolbar,

00:24:37.756 --> 00:24:39.776
if you want to add
content to your book,

00:24:39.776 --> 00:24:41.266
you do it by the
Add Pages button.

00:24:41.676 --> 00:24:45.666
And as I'm rolling over
these different objects,

00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:47.486
I'm seeing a bunch of layouts

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.676
that correspond with
these objects.

00:24:49.786 --> 00:24:52.036
These objects are also
describing the structure

00:24:52.036 --> 00:24:52.906
of an iBooks book.

00:24:53.626 --> 00:24:56.926
At the highest level of the
book, there is the chapter,

00:24:56.986 --> 00:24:58.816
beneath the chapter,
there's the section,

00:24:58.906 --> 00:25:00.786
a section contains pages.

00:25:00.826 --> 00:25:04.056
So here's the chapter,
it's top to your item,

00:25:04.166 --> 00:25:06.006
second to your section,
and then finally,

00:25:06.006 --> 00:25:09.446
discreet page layouts
which I can apply.

00:25:09.756 --> 00:25:12.386
Be delving into that
further in just a little bit.

00:25:13.386 --> 00:25:16.476
Next up, the View switch,
used this to turn on

00:25:16.476 --> 00:25:20.696
or off different user interface
elements within iBooks Author.

00:25:21.106 --> 00:25:23.956
So for example, if I
wanted to change my sidebar

00:25:24.006 --> 00:25:27.036
to an outline view, instead of
thumbnails, I could do that.

00:25:28.076 --> 00:25:31.876
I could turn on or off the
Format bar, but I'm going

00:25:31.876 --> 00:25:33.676
to turn that on because
that's actually going

00:25:33.676 --> 00:25:35.596
to help us edit more quickly.

00:25:36.416 --> 00:25:38.896
The Orientation switch
which allows me to switch

00:25:38.896 --> 00:25:42.226
between the portrait flow mode
that is used only on the iPad,

00:25:42.226 --> 00:25:45.526
it's not used on iBooks
for Mac in landscape.

00:25:45.526 --> 00:25:47.246
We won't go into that today.

00:25:47.726 --> 00:25:49.536
I'm not going to touch
on anything having to do

00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:51.216
with portrait flow
mode here today.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:52.926
But if-- should you
want to learn more,

00:25:53.246 --> 00:25:55.796
I recommend going back to
last year's session where I go

00:25:55.796 --> 00:25:58.806
into great detail about how to
work with portrait flow mode,

00:25:59.076 --> 00:26:01.566
that's available online
in the developer website.

00:26:01.566 --> 00:26:04.066
Next up, we have a
graphic create tools,

00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:06.156
I need text, I add a text box.

00:26:06.156 --> 00:26:07.776
If I want to add
a graphic shape,

00:26:07.776 --> 00:26:11.106
I can have a graphic shape,
create a table, add a chart,

00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:13.206
you can add any of the numbers,

00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:15.356
any of the widgets
that we shift with.

00:26:15.456 --> 00:26:18.036
Here they are all nine of them.

00:26:18.036 --> 00:26:18.866
I can preview.

00:26:19.046 --> 00:26:20.596
I'll show you how to
preview a little bit later

00:26:20.596 --> 00:26:22.456
and I can also publish,
we'll be going

00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:24.146
through the publish
workflow in a little bit.

00:26:24.326 --> 00:26:26.216
Finally, there's the Inspector.

00:26:26.946 --> 00:26:27.696
Well not finally.

00:26:27.696 --> 00:26:32.666
We also have the system edit
panels, font color and media.

00:26:33.016 --> 00:26:33.976
We won't use those.

00:26:34.496 --> 00:26:35.846
But the Inspector
is very important.

00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:38.266
The Inspector is the thing that
used to edit the attributes

00:26:38.266 --> 00:26:40.496
of any object that you
select within the canvas.

00:26:40.496 --> 00:26:43.256
So when you're composing
things right here

00:26:44.136 --> 00:26:46.706
and you're editing things and
you're moving stuff around,

00:26:46.706 --> 00:26:49.506
this is where you edit the
attributes of the said things.

00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:54.746
So it's good to get
to know the Inspector.

00:26:55.676 --> 00:26:59.416
Now to round out our tour,
over here we have the sidebar,

00:26:59.746 --> 00:27:01.756
it's got some special
nodes contained within it,

00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:04.016
the top most node is our cover.

00:27:04.086 --> 00:27:05.886
This is where we can
compose and build our cover

00:27:05.886 --> 00:27:07.776
that will get shift out when
we go to publish our book.

00:27:07.776 --> 00:27:10.026
And we have a spot
for Intro Media,

00:27:10.026 --> 00:27:13.666
so that splashy video intro that
you saw for both of the books.

00:27:13.666 --> 00:27:16.796
This is where you would add it,
just by dragging in a movie.

00:27:17.146 --> 00:27:19.266
We have the table of contents
authoring environments,

00:27:19.266 --> 00:27:21.236
so you can build out your
table of contents here

00:27:21.236 --> 00:27:22.686
and create a custom
look and feel for it.

00:27:22.686 --> 00:27:25.466
And then finally, we
have the glossary.

00:27:25.956 --> 00:27:28.196
All right.

00:27:28.196 --> 00:27:30.336
So let's get start--
started building.

00:27:30.406 --> 00:27:34.976
I'm going to open another
document just for reference.

00:27:42.456 --> 00:27:45.726
So just to remind myself,
what Patrick's book looked

00:27:45.726 --> 00:27:50.906
like I'm going to call this
up from a time to time.

00:27:51.126 --> 00:27:52.446
Now I should make
that a lot smaller.

00:27:56.676 --> 00:27:57.166
All right.

00:27:57.166 --> 00:28:00.006
So this is an example
of this very same page.

00:28:00.916 --> 00:28:03.956
It's similar and that is
got a very full-bleed image,

00:28:03.996 --> 00:28:06.096
but the title is
completely different.

00:28:06.096 --> 00:28:08.186
It's got this background
element here.

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:09.216
We don't want any of that.

00:28:09.216 --> 00:28:11.466
So let's go edit
it away right now.

00:28:12.206 --> 00:28:18.136
So the first thing I'm going
to do, just because, you now,

00:28:18.136 --> 00:28:20.346
it's my book, I want to see
what it feels like a little bit.

00:28:20.346 --> 00:28:22.206
I'm going to drag in my
image from my chapter

00:28:22.206 --> 00:28:23.506
and that kind of feels good.

00:28:24.186 --> 00:28:26.636
I'm going to edit the
title, OK, the long--

00:28:33.966 --> 00:28:37.136
Great. So it sort of feels like
my book, but not close enough.

00:28:37.366 --> 00:28:40.086
In order to make it really look
like the book, I'm going to have

00:28:40.116 --> 00:28:43.376
to change the layout that
this page references.

00:28:43.466 --> 00:28:46.346
So to view my layouts, you
can do one of two ways.

00:28:46.346 --> 00:28:48.736
You can go to the view menu
where I told you, you can turn

00:28:48.736 --> 00:28:52.206
on or off different UI
elements and go show layouts.

00:28:52.436 --> 00:28:54.146
Or you can simply
split this bar down.

00:28:54.396 --> 00:28:56.886
It's just living behind
your page thumbnails.

00:28:57.486 --> 00:28:59.556
And this little check
mark indicates

00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:02.206
that this is the layout
that's being utilized

00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:04.346
for this very page right now.

00:29:04.846 --> 00:29:07.216
But there are two pages
associated with chapter

00:29:07.216 --> 00:29:09.076
and section layouts and
I'll explain what they are.

00:29:09.756 --> 00:29:11.696
The first page is
always the splash page.

00:29:11.696 --> 00:29:12.586
It's the visual thing

00:29:12.586 --> 00:29:15.536
that identifies an incoming
chapter or a section.

00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:19.016
And then, the second page
is a body page which is used

00:29:19.016 --> 00:29:22.126
to create all of the text
pages within that chapter

00:29:22.126 --> 00:29:23.506
or section as the case may be.

00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:27.456
So when you import text and
random pages are created

00:29:27.456 --> 00:29:30.226
for you automatically, that's
the page that's being reference.

00:29:33.886 --> 00:29:35.876
Well, here's a layout that
looks a little bit more

00:29:35.876 --> 00:29:37.106
like the one we want.

00:29:37.156 --> 00:29:39.096
I'm going to actually
apply it right now.

00:29:39.426 --> 00:29:40.336
Looks a little bit better.

00:29:40.336 --> 00:29:43.026
It's still not the
thing that we need.

00:29:43.446 --> 00:29:45.846
So I'm going to edit
the contents

00:29:45.906 --> 00:29:47.596
of the layout right now.

00:29:48.116 --> 00:29:51.326
So in the Inspector,
I'm going to switch

00:29:51.326 --> 00:29:52.146
over to the Layout tab.

00:29:52.146 --> 00:29:53.406
And within the Layout tab,

00:29:53.406 --> 00:29:56.106
I find the attributes
for layout objects.

00:29:56.106 --> 00:29:58.806
Layout objects are anything
that lives inside your layout.

00:29:59.156 --> 00:30:02.096
When I select this background
image it tells me a few

00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:03.696
different things about
what it set up to do.

00:30:03.996 --> 00:30:07.096
So this first check
box enables the--

00:30:07.146 --> 00:30:09.286
well, me as the book creator

00:30:09.856 --> 00:30:13.486
to basically edit this
content on the page.

00:30:13.486 --> 00:30:17.526
If didn't check this box
and I apply these changes,

00:30:18.106 --> 00:30:21.226
I would be unable to edit
or modify or even select

00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:24.106
that thing anymore on the page.

00:30:24.106 --> 00:30:26.146
So I'm just going
to undo that change.

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:31.816
It has a special tag.

00:30:32.046 --> 00:30:35.666
This main image tag is what
we used to identify images

00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:38.306
that will also be used in
the table of contents view.

00:30:39.146 --> 00:30:41.516
So follow me just for a second.

00:30:41.516 --> 00:30:43.196
If I switch over to the
table of contents view,

00:30:43.196 --> 00:30:45.066
you can see that two
things have happened.

00:30:45.536 --> 00:30:47.146
The background image
that we have supplied

00:30:47.146 --> 00:30:51.746
for the chapter was used here
and the title that we entered

00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:54.436
onto the chapter head
page is also being used

00:30:54.436 --> 00:30:55.606
in the table of contents view.

00:30:59.786 --> 00:31:02.336
So you might be asking yourself,
how do iBooks Author know

00:31:02.336 --> 00:31:04.186
to make that the
title for the chapter?

00:31:04.576 --> 00:31:06.146
It knew to make that the
title for the chapter

00:31:06.146 --> 00:31:09.986
because it was using something
called a section title smart

00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:12.466
field which this thing is.

00:31:12.886 --> 00:31:15.956
It has a telltale visual
cue which is kind of hard

00:31:15.956 --> 00:31:18.756
to see here in this display
or in this composition.

00:31:19.216 --> 00:31:20.716
But basically, it's
a blue outline

00:31:20.716 --> 00:31:21.886
that surrounds that word.

00:31:22.626 --> 00:31:26.816
And what this field is used to
do is basically name the thing

00:31:26.816 --> 00:31:28.336
that it's currently applied to.

00:31:28.576 --> 00:31:31.006
So what we're telling
the smart field to do is

00:31:31.006 --> 00:31:32.976
to name every chapter
it's applied to,

00:31:33.026 --> 00:31:35.616
it either reflects the name
if you put it in somewhere

00:31:35.976 --> 00:31:39.246
or it allows you to edit
the name directly in place.

00:31:39.326 --> 00:31:41.546
So when I went and
edited the name here,

00:31:42.436 --> 00:31:43.596
that's how it got all the way

00:31:43.596 --> 00:31:45.306
over to the table
of contents view.

00:31:45.846 --> 00:31:48.556
And if something goes
wacky in your setup,

00:31:48.556 --> 00:31:50.596
and you should accidentally
delete this thing

00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:52.836
and delete the other
thing, don't freak out.

00:31:52.836 --> 00:31:57.346
You can very easily
create another one by going

00:31:57.346 --> 00:32:00.546
to the insert panel and
selecting section title

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:03.266
and you're often
running yet again.

00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:07.386
What we need to do here,

00:32:07.386 --> 00:32:09.436
I'm going to preserve those
elements is restyle these

00:32:09.436 --> 00:32:12.376
things, so it looks a little
bit more like Patrick's design.

00:32:12.496 --> 00:32:14.106
He used the Avenir font,

00:32:14.106 --> 00:32:16.416
it's going to very quickly
select the Avenir font.

00:32:16.976 --> 00:32:22.316
And he used basically one
lockup for the chapter

00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:24.176
and the chapter numbers.

00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:26.096
I'm going to delete
the second thing here.

00:32:27.296 --> 00:32:30.096
And then, I'm going to
insert another smart field

00:32:30.096 --> 00:32:32.096
which we called the section--
numbering smart field.

00:32:32.206 --> 00:32:34.936
The section numbering smart
field is a dynamic thing,

00:32:35.276 --> 00:32:39.276
but you don't edit things in
it, it just reflects the title

00:32:39.336 --> 00:32:41.226
or the name of the thing
and the number of the thing

00:32:41.226 --> 00:32:42.396
that it is applied to.

00:32:43.726 --> 00:32:45.566
So if I insert section
number here,

00:32:45.566 --> 00:32:48.416
it comes up by default telling
me, "Hey, I'm Chapter 1."

00:32:48.956 --> 00:32:50.616
But I just want it
to be a number.

00:32:50.696 --> 00:32:52.106
So I say, hey, give
me the number only.

00:32:52.776 --> 00:32:58.896
And then I believe Patrick
had this as an orange element,

00:33:00.526 --> 00:33:03.806
I know full well, he
did, blind you guys.

00:33:04.186 --> 00:33:06.656
I've applied the changes
and that we have something

00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:09.616
that looks a lot more like
what Patrick had in his book.

00:33:10.256 --> 00:33:13.796
So we've just finished
editing our chapter head page.

00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:19.446
Now the body page has a
couple of different things.

00:33:19.446 --> 00:33:20.646
You can't really
see it right now.

00:33:20.646 --> 00:33:23.946
Down here, we've got
a page number element

00:33:24.096 --> 00:33:25.876
and up here we've got
the body text container

00:33:25.906 --> 00:33:26.656
which you can't see.

00:33:26.656 --> 00:33:30.776
Now Patrick's pages
featured a black background,

00:33:30.776 --> 00:33:34.736
I'm going to create one here by
simply adding a graphic form.

00:33:40.186 --> 00:33:41.226
You can't see what
I'm doing here.

00:33:41.226 --> 00:33:47.066
I'm using a hotkey to push
this object into the back.

00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:52.086
Now I'm going to just
make the body text white.

00:33:53.446 --> 00:33:54.946
So we can see it.

00:33:56.946 --> 00:34:00.446
And now we have edited
the wrong thing.

00:34:00.926 --> 00:34:01.336
That's OK.

00:34:06.436 --> 00:34:07.746
Did anyone see me
making that mistake,

00:34:08.065 --> 00:34:09.656
hands up if you saw me
making that mistake.

00:34:10.216 --> 00:34:11.726
That's good eyes,
good, thank you.

00:34:12.396 --> 00:34:14.246
Call it out next time though
'cause I get really farther.

00:34:16.746 --> 00:34:22.326
Let's copy and paste that
stuff, add text container

00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:23.466
because that guy
won't come over.

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:32.326
All right.

00:34:32.326 --> 00:34:33.286
Now we're back on track.

00:34:41.656 --> 00:34:44.386
OK. So we now fully edited--

00:34:44.596 --> 00:34:46.186
sorry, don't get
confused by that again.

00:34:46.186 --> 00:34:48.076
I was going to delete him so I
can't make the mistake again.

00:34:48.556 --> 00:34:51.196
We've now fully edited
that body page.

00:34:51.196 --> 00:34:53.766
So if the chapter needs to
create pages, it can do so.

00:34:53.766 --> 00:34:56.376
And they're going to look
exactly like we need them.

00:34:56.846 --> 00:34:58.636
Next up, we're going to
create the section page.

00:34:59.526 --> 00:35:02.666
And one of the benefits of
working with the templates

00:35:02.666 --> 00:35:05.546
that we've provided
as the iBooks group is

00:35:05.546 --> 00:35:08.376
that we have done all of the
thinking around, you know,

00:35:08.376 --> 00:35:10.386
what's the best point
size for the iPad,

00:35:10.386 --> 00:35:11.956
what are the best page
layouts for the iPad

00:35:12.006 --> 00:35:14.566
that give the right
proportions of white space

00:35:14.566 --> 00:35:15.946
to the actual text content.

00:35:16.076 --> 00:35:18.306
So it's in your best
interest that kind of work

00:35:18.306 --> 00:35:20.246
with the layouts that we
provide and customize them

00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:22.996
in exactly the way that
I'm showing right now.

00:35:23.586 --> 00:35:26.936
We do this because we don't want
you putting unnecessary effort

00:35:26.936 --> 00:35:29.296
if you are a real book
designer and you want

00:35:29.296 --> 00:35:31.006
to completely custom, you
can go ahead and do that.

00:35:31.336 --> 00:35:32.866
But for the rest of us,

00:35:32.866 --> 00:35:34.676
it's nice to have
these starting places.

00:35:35.126 --> 00:35:37.956
And that's the setup for
me saying, "Hey, don't go

00:35:37.956 --> 00:35:39.946
and rebuild a section
from scratch the way

00:35:39.946 --> 00:35:41.376
that we just did the chapter."

00:35:41.866 --> 00:35:44.216
If you want to create
a new section,

00:35:44.216 --> 00:35:46.586
you can just duplicate the
thing we've already created

00:35:46.586 --> 00:35:50.596
which has most of the stuff
that we need and drag it

00:35:50.596 --> 00:35:52.296
over to the section layouts area

00:35:52.586 --> 00:35:54.186
and now we have a
new section layout.

00:35:54.756 --> 00:35:57.436
We don't need this thing.

00:35:58.996 --> 00:36:00.336
We will need this thing.

00:36:00.886 --> 00:36:04.186
And we're going to need another
one of these black things.

00:36:09.916 --> 00:36:10.556
And there you go.

00:36:10.556 --> 00:36:12.616
Now the only problem with this
is, it's currently setup is

00:36:12.616 --> 00:36:16.926
that that chapter-- that section
numbering field that we set up,

00:36:17.386 --> 00:36:19.296
is currently pointing at
the chapter we want it

00:36:19.296 --> 00:36:20.786
to actually point at a section.

00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:24.116
So we can double-click to
edit it, specify section

00:36:24.336 --> 00:36:25.976
and we're pretty much
good to go at this point.

00:36:33.136 --> 00:36:36.716
Now, I'm going to remind us
again what Patrick has done

00:36:36.716 --> 00:36:37.856
in other areas of the book.

00:36:38.066 --> 00:36:40.946
I think, I can actually
tour that guy down.

00:36:41.626 --> 00:36:45.526
He has these large
quotation-- sorry--

00:36:45.526 --> 00:36:48.296
he has these quotations that are
rendered in large or in text,

00:36:48.296 --> 00:36:49.726
orange text, do you
remember that when I showed

00:36:49.726 --> 00:36:51.856
that in the original
run through.

00:36:51.856 --> 00:36:54.896
I'm going to go very
quickly create that text box

00:36:55.466 --> 00:36:57.986
to contain that quote.

00:37:06.576 --> 00:37:09.416
But I chose a ginormous
point size.

00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:10.326
That's pretty ginormous.

00:37:10.326 --> 00:37:12.116
Maybe not that ginormous,
a little smaller.

00:37:13.996 --> 00:37:14.946
There you go.

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:16.466
To make sure that
we can edit it later

00:37:16.466 --> 00:37:17.946
when we're actually
composing the pages,

00:37:17.946 --> 00:37:19.096
I mark it as editable.

00:37:19.586 --> 00:37:21.146
And I'm going to
give a custom tag.

00:37:21.676 --> 00:37:24.266
Now the benefit of using tag
is that when it comes time

00:37:24.266 --> 00:37:26.316
to switch out layouts, if
you got multiple layouts

00:37:26.316 --> 00:37:27.986
that can all be applied
in similar content.

00:37:28.426 --> 00:37:31.256
If you tag things the same
way throughout the layouts,

00:37:31.566 --> 00:37:33.726
they'll actually inherit the
contents between the layouts

00:37:33.726 --> 00:37:35.546
which is kind of nice.

00:37:36.066 --> 00:37:40.096
And then finally, there's the
attribution which I'm not going

00:37:40.096 --> 00:37:44.766
to bother adding right now
'cause I want get underway

00:37:44.766 --> 00:37:45.646
building our book.

00:37:46.006 --> 00:37:47.106
But we're basically done.

00:37:47.246 --> 00:37:50.056
We've created two layouts now
that through which we're going

00:37:50.056 --> 00:37:54.676
to be able to compose
the rest of our chapter.

00:37:55.436 --> 00:37:58.496
So now I can go to
our add pages menu,

00:37:59.296 --> 00:38:02.396
add our new section layout.

00:38:02.396 --> 00:38:04.066
Actually, I'm not
going to do that.

00:38:04.796 --> 00:38:07.026
Do something even better.

00:38:07.646 --> 00:38:12.116
I'm going to bring in the Pages
document that contains all

00:38:12.116 --> 00:38:14.636
of my text for this chapter and
just drag it into the sidebar.

00:38:15.916 --> 00:38:19.016
When I do, iBooks Author
prompts me to choose a layout

00:38:19.016 --> 00:38:22.266
and in this way it tells iBooks
Author what level this content

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:22.896
is going to live at.

00:38:23.346 --> 00:38:24.476
We want this to be a section.

00:38:24.476 --> 00:38:25.906
It's a little bit different
from Patrick's book.

00:38:25.906 --> 00:38:28.486
He only had chapters, but
I want to show a little bit

00:38:28.486 --> 00:38:29.976
of the book structure
and hierarchy here.

00:38:30.646 --> 00:38:33.406
Note also this check box.

00:38:33.406 --> 00:38:36.346
If you have crafted--
and many people do this,

00:38:36.346 --> 00:38:38.936
painstakingly so, if you
crafted paragraphs styles

00:38:39.196 --> 00:38:40.976
in your document that you
want to preserve, you're going

00:38:40.976 --> 00:38:42.206
to want to check this box.

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:43.416
And when you do that, all

00:38:43.416 --> 00:38:45.916
of the incoming paragraph
styles will merge

00:38:46.396 --> 00:38:48.086
with the paragraph
styles from the template

00:38:48.086 --> 00:38:50.606
and you'll have them, but we're
also smart enough to recognize

00:38:51.926 --> 00:38:53.356
when they've been
named the same.

00:38:53.486 --> 00:38:55.646
So you won't have
duplicate paragraph styles.

00:38:55.646 --> 00:38:58.606
We'll just keep the
ones that are incoming.

00:39:01.676 --> 00:39:04.376
So there you have it.

00:39:04.506 --> 00:39:06.126
We've created a run of pages all

00:39:06.126 --> 00:39:07.906
from the layouts
that we just created.

00:39:07.906 --> 00:39:09.946
I'm not sure how long it took
us to create those layouts,

00:39:09.946 --> 00:39:13.996
but something in the
order of 10 to 15 minutes.

00:39:13.996 --> 00:39:16.986
And you would also want to
create some custom page layouts

00:39:16.986 --> 00:39:18.316
which you could apply
to your book throughout.

00:39:18.316 --> 00:39:21.076
That's going to take
some additional time.

00:39:21.216 --> 00:39:24.406
But suffice to say, you can do
this kind of thing very quickly.

00:39:28.026 --> 00:39:32.756
So I'd embedded the quotations
that we need here over there.

00:39:33.126 --> 00:39:38.286
Copy that text and just
paste it, I should have done

00:39:38.286 --> 00:39:39.766
that attribution
as another element.

00:39:41.146 --> 00:39:41.746
Forget that.

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:43.876
We're going to name
this section.

00:39:51.616 --> 00:39:53.306
So great, it's named
on the page.

00:39:53.366 --> 00:39:57.206
But as I mentioned, because
we're using those naming smart

00:39:57.206 --> 00:40:00.506
field, I'm actually identifying
the components of my book.

00:40:00.506 --> 00:40:03.026
So now if we switch back to
our table of contents view,

00:40:03.556 --> 00:40:06.036
we can see that we have
three sections created

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:09.876
within our chapter, the first
of which I've actually named.

00:40:11.366 --> 00:40:13.646
Did I actually do that?

00:40:13.646 --> 00:40:14.406
No, I didn't.

00:40:14.906 --> 00:40:20.806
I fell into a trap of my--
literally my own design,

00:40:21.076 --> 00:40:22.216
literally my own designs.

00:40:22.806 --> 00:40:25.436
It's-- I'm not proud
of this fact.

00:40:25.646 --> 00:40:29.586
OK. So if you should see that
that blue line has gone away,

00:40:29.586 --> 00:40:30.956
it's evidence that you've wiped

00:40:30.956 --> 00:40:33.266
out that section
naming smart field

00:40:33.566 --> 00:40:34.666
and you need to recreate it.

00:40:34.666 --> 00:40:41.016
So I've just undone
that mistake.

00:40:41.016 --> 00:40:43.316
And now we see that the thing
is kind of correctly named

00:40:43.896 --> 00:40:46.076
and I also undo that resize
there, but there you go.

00:40:46.436 --> 00:40:50.936
Now while we're looking at
the table of contents view,

00:40:50.936 --> 00:40:53.586
this is the area where you can
obviously customize the table

00:40:53.586 --> 00:40:55.226
of contents experience.

00:40:55.326 --> 00:40:58.066
The only caveat being that
what you do for one chapter,

00:40:58.066 --> 00:40:59.226
you do for all chapters.

00:40:59.226 --> 00:41:01.596
So if I'm going to
delete this background

00:41:01.596 --> 00:41:04.346
and then restyle my text and
do whatever I needed to do,

00:41:04.596 --> 00:41:07.666
it has to work for all of
the chapters of my book

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:09.956
because it's going to
be shared amongst them

00:41:09.956 --> 00:41:12.726
when the user is swiping
through in the graphical table

00:41:12.726 --> 00:41:13.416
of contents.

00:41:13.796 --> 00:41:19.406
The next thing that
you're going to want to do

00:41:19.406 --> 00:41:22.936
to define the structure of
your book is through something

00:41:22.936 --> 00:41:24.856
that we call semantic
paragraph styles.

00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:29.116
So books have subjects
or headings contained

00:41:29.116 --> 00:41:30.436
within things like chapters.

00:41:30.826 --> 00:41:33.986
And you want to identify these
things to iBooks Author so that

00:41:33.986 --> 00:41:36.376
when the user searches
for them in the book.

00:41:36.596 --> 00:41:38.116
We can bring them
to the right place,

00:41:38.156 --> 00:41:40.186
the places that matter--
that matter most.

00:41:40.816 --> 00:41:44.536
There are three components
to any templates.

00:41:44.636 --> 00:41:47.316
There're the layouts that
are contained with in it.

00:41:47.796 --> 00:41:50.626
There are the object styles
that are preserved within it.

00:41:50.626 --> 00:41:52.986
And then there are the
paragraph styles that it owns.

00:41:53.026 --> 00:41:55.736
If you want to view the
paragraph styles for template,

00:41:55.786 --> 00:41:57.816
you can do one of two ways.

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:00.936
You can click to view the
paragraph styles drawer

00:42:02.066 --> 00:42:03.486
and here you can
see them all here.

00:42:03.916 --> 00:42:06.306
Also your character styles and
list styles are preserved there.

00:42:07.176 --> 00:42:09.946
So I'm going to apply the
heading one, paragraph style

00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:12.606
to this text and
it's been adopted.

00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:14.326
The font is incorrect,
so I'm going

00:42:14.326 --> 00:42:18.276
to change it, Avenirs
I did before.

00:42:23.876 --> 00:42:25.536
Make that a little bit smaller.

00:42:26.256 --> 00:42:28.756
And now what we'll see--

00:42:28.756 --> 00:42:30.986
see this little red arrow in
the paragraph styles drawer,

00:42:30.986 --> 00:42:33.246
this indicates that
the paragraph style

00:42:33.376 --> 00:42:34.806
that that text think it--

00:42:34.936 --> 00:42:37.236
thinks it is, is different

00:42:37.236 --> 00:42:38.876
than what the text
actually is right now.

00:42:38.876 --> 00:42:40.666
We've overwritten
that paragraph style.

00:42:40.996 --> 00:42:43.166
If we want everything to
have this new paragraph style

00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:48.776
that we just defined, we can
select this via that menu,

00:42:49.426 --> 00:42:51.136
redefine style from selection.

00:42:51.576 --> 00:42:55.936
Now every time we come across
a heading that we want to apply

00:42:55.936 --> 00:43:03.046
that style to we've got the
new style and that's great.

00:43:03.076 --> 00:43:03.646
All right.

00:43:05.336 --> 00:43:07.356
So how about the
interactive stuff,

00:43:07.356 --> 00:43:08.896
we've got some content
over here.

00:43:08.896 --> 00:43:11.246
I'm going to close my
paragraph style drawer first,

00:43:12.076 --> 00:43:13.206
bring in some new content.

00:43:13.936 --> 00:43:16.406
The first and most basic

00:43:16.436 --> 00:43:20.016
of the interactive elements is
the simple and humble image.

00:43:20.316 --> 00:43:22.816
And insert a page
break here quickly,

00:43:22.816 --> 00:43:26.196
so we're just looking
at that image.

00:43:26.606 --> 00:43:29.316
This image, we know
it's special,

00:43:29.316 --> 00:43:30.856
iBooks Author doesn't
know it's special.

00:43:30.916 --> 00:43:32.236
The way that you
make this special

00:43:32.236 --> 00:43:35.266
so that people can actually
interact with it is you go

00:43:35.266 --> 00:43:36.986
over here to the Widget
tab in the Inspector.

00:43:37.996 --> 00:43:40.416
And within this Widget tab,
you'll find the attributes

00:43:40.416 --> 00:43:41.536
of interactive things.

00:43:41.656 --> 00:43:45.466
So there are two ways to make
this thing actually interactive,

00:43:45.466 --> 00:43:48.506
you can add a title
to it or a caption

00:43:48.606 --> 00:43:52.076
and that's evidence enough
that you think this is special.

00:43:52.176 --> 00:43:55.126
So when a user taps on it, it's
going to go full-screen for them

00:43:55.646 --> 00:43:57.016
or go to the expanded state.

00:43:57.496 --> 00:44:00.626
You can also just check this box

00:44:00.626 --> 00:44:02.746
which is make zoomable
in iBooks.

00:44:03.076 --> 00:44:07.906
So if you didn't have a title or
caption, you can check this box.

00:44:07.956 --> 00:44:10.786
And then, when a user clicks
or taps on that thing,

00:44:11.206 --> 00:44:14.126
they'll be able to see it in
kind of an expanded state.

00:44:17.896 --> 00:44:20.416
But I'm going to leave the
title and caption there.

00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:25.146
Next up, I'm going
to show you another

00:44:25.146 --> 00:44:27.236
of the version 2.0 features

00:44:27.236 --> 00:44:30.976
which is our support
for LaTeX and MathML.

00:44:33.086 --> 00:44:36.246
So in order to do that, I'm
going to place my cursor here,

00:44:37.356 --> 00:44:40.806
you access the equation
input user experience

00:44:41.156 --> 00:44:43.366
through the Insert panel,
I'm going to insert equation

00:44:43.856 --> 00:44:46.776
and up will pop our
Equation Editor.

00:44:47.296 --> 00:44:49.546
And I hope to God, I can
remember this equation.

00:44:49.976 --> 00:44:53.326
So for circular pads,

00:44:53.506 --> 00:45:01.656
the equation is something
like 2 [inaudible] 3.

00:45:04.156 --> 00:45:04.526
There you go.

00:45:04.526 --> 00:45:06.086
You can see this preview area

00:45:06.086 --> 00:45:08.676
that I've successfully
entered an equation.

00:45:09.126 --> 00:45:11.706
My mother would be
very proud of me.

00:45:11.806 --> 00:45:13.236
If you edit it in such a way

00:45:13.236 --> 00:45:14.956
that the equation
becomes invalid--

00:45:15.226 --> 00:45:16.486
we just redo what I've done--

00:45:17.026 --> 00:45:21.346
like put the hat without
completing that statement.

00:45:22.026 --> 00:45:24.006
You can see it, it shows
as an invalid equation.

00:45:24.006 --> 00:45:25.616
But once it's done,
I can insert it.

00:45:26.446 --> 00:45:28.426
This is proper text.

00:45:28.606 --> 00:45:29.366
I can edit it.

00:45:30.216 --> 00:45:32.376
I can give it a new size.

00:45:34.746 --> 00:45:36.256
I can send or justify it.

00:45:37.616 --> 00:45:40.296
So real math type setting
now within iBooks Author,

00:45:40.296 --> 00:45:41.486
also works for MathML.

00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:43.476
Trust me. I'm not going to
show you that right now.

00:45:45.456 --> 00:45:47.746
Next up, I want to show you
the scrolling sidebar widget.

00:45:47.746 --> 00:45:49.356
I mentioned that's a
great way to do something

00:45:49.356 --> 00:45:52.126
like tell a historical
aside like I'm going

00:45:52.126 --> 00:45:53.456
to do for Johannes Kepler.

00:45:53.976 --> 00:46:00.386
So this is very simple, just
drag in some text, boom;

00:46:01.046 --> 00:46:05.396
drag in an image, double boom.

00:46:06.256 --> 00:46:08.576
He's not a very happy looking
man, but he was brilliant.

00:46:08.916 --> 00:46:12.006
You can also style this.

00:46:12.006 --> 00:46:14.006
It's a graphic object like
any other graphic object

00:46:14.006 --> 00:46:14.956
within iBooks Author.

00:46:14.956 --> 00:46:17.816
So if I want to give this
a black background fill

00:46:18.216 --> 00:46:25.946
and make my text white like the
rest of my content, I can do so.

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:27.576
So there you have it.

00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:29.416
There's the scrolling
sidebar widget.

00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:32.826
Now finally, I'm going to add
one more page which I think,

00:46:33.406 --> 00:46:40.366
just going to add a blank page
here and add a final widget.

00:46:40.366 --> 00:46:42.656
It's going to be the timeline
widget that we saw before.

00:46:46.516 --> 00:46:52.676
Now the timeline widget is a
full-screen-only experience

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:56.866
which means that you have to
tap on the element that's shown

00:46:56.866 --> 00:46:59.976
on the page before you can
interact with the HTML.

00:47:00.946 --> 00:47:03.046
You can, however,
preview HTML most

00:47:03.046 --> 00:47:04.426
of the time within
iBooks Author.

00:47:04.426 --> 00:47:05.456
I can't do with this widget.

00:47:05.486 --> 00:47:08.666
But if you hit Edit HTML,
you're brought to an environment

00:47:08.666 --> 00:47:10.546
where you can actually
preview the HTML.

00:47:10.546 --> 00:47:12.436
It's not going to work, as I
mentioned, for this widget.

00:47:13.776 --> 00:47:15.156
You click Done when you're done.

00:47:15.436 --> 00:47:18.206
But there's our HTML
widget in place.

00:47:21.166 --> 00:47:24.246
Now that's our first section
of three sections built out.

00:47:24.246 --> 00:47:26.146
I can go-- click back to
the table of contents.

00:47:26.146 --> 00:47:28.106
Say yes, everything is
going according to plan.

00:47:29.436 --> 00:47:35.036
I'm going to paste in our quote.

00:47:35.816 --> 00:47:39.436
I expect you're following
along now.

00:47:39.476 --> 00:47:41.636
So I'm going to move
a lot more quickly.

00:47:42.516 --> 00:47:46.816
Choose that heading style that
we applied or that we created.

00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:51.506
Oh, did I actually
ever prove to you

00:47:51.506 --> 00:47:53.596
that we were doing something
special with that heading style?

00:47:54.096 --> 00:47:54.236
>> Yes.

00:47:54.676 --> 00:47:56.726
>> Did I? OK.

00:47:57.226 --> 00:48:00.786
Did I switch over to
the sidebar to do that?

00:48:00.786 --> 00:48:01.536
[Inaudible Response]

00:48:01.536 --> 00:48:02.166
>> Thank you.

00:48:02.406 --> 00:48:04.236
So let's switch to
the outline view.

00:48:04.466 --> 00:48:06.486
You can see here,
that's the evidence

00:48:06.486 --> 00:48:09.006
that those semantic paragraph
styles are doing their job.

00:48:09.006 --> 00:48:12.026
So when I go to that
table of contents view,

00:48:12.026 --> 00:48:15.196
the pop-over table of contents
view in iBooks, I'm going to see

00:48:15.196 --> 00:48:16.996
that stuff listed there
and that's the way

00:48:16.996 --> 00:48:19.046
that it gets there using that
semantic paragraph style.

00:48:20.466 --> 00:48:22.366
Thank you, phantom
voice from the audience.

00:48:22.876 --> 00:48:25.016
>> You're welcome.

00:48:25.016 --> 00:48:25.676
[Laughter]

00:48:25.676 --> 00:48:27.806
>> All right.

00:48:27.806 --> 00:48:29.836
So let's add some more
interactive stuff.

00:48:29.836 --> 00:48:30.526
We're pressed for times.

00:48:30.526 --> 00:48:32.106
So I'm going to do this quickly.

00:48:32.706 --> 00:48:34.886
Next up, we'll set a movie,
it's very easy to do, right?

00:48:35.116 --> 00:48:36.596
If you got a movie,
slam it in there.

00:48:38.746 --> 00:48:40.676
The attributes for
the movie are limited.

00:48:40.676 --> 00:48:43.456
I can click over to
the Widget tab and see

00:48:43.456 --> 00:48:44.896
that I have the option
to show these things.

00:48:44.896 --> 00:48:48.556
The thumbnail-only which means
it would be just stay proxy

00:48:48.556 --> 00:48:49.986
on the page, and
I'll click that proxy

00:48:49.986 --> 00:48:51.646
and the movie will only
play in full-screen.

00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:53.346
But we want it to play in place.

00:48:53.906 --> 00:48:56.466
I can also choose the
poster frame that I want.

00:48:56.606 --> 00:49:00.606
That's exciting enough for me.

00:49:01.376 --> 00:49:03.346
I can choose looping
options for it.

00:49:03.346 --> 00:49:04.306
I don't want the movie to loop.

00:49:04.306 --> 00:49:07.036
It's a rather lengthy
movie, why would it loop.

00:49:07.576 --> 00:49:10.106
But there I'm done with it.

00:49:11.366 --> 00:49:14.646
Next up, I'm just going to
insert another page break

00:49:14.646 --> 00:49:16.506
to this content appears
over there.

00:49:16.506 --> 00:49:19.616
And I'll show you how to
configure an audio widget.

00:49:23.516 --> 00:49:28.546
So here we have a little
audio snippet from, I believe,

00:49:28.876 --> 00:49:32.486
the mission control commander
for the Viking missions.

00:49:33.786 --> 00:49:37.326
He's very excited about
observing the first image

00:49:37.366 --> 00:49:39.856
from Mars ever which this is.

00:49:40.556 --> 00:49:42.346
Actually, it's pretty amazing.

00:49:42.806 --> 00:49:47.136
>> How do you possibly
describe the first photograph

00:49:47.136 --> 00:49:49.856
that a human being has ever seen

00:49:49.896 --> 00:49:52.026
from the surface
of another planet?

00:49:53.356 --> 00:49:55.436
>> I would say it's kind
of contrasty and maybe,

00:49:55.836 --> 00:49:57.846
framing's not great,
but whatever.

00:49:57.846 --> 00:49:59.976
I mean, you know, at least
proud of, you should be.

00:50:00.276 --> 00:50:04.216
So that the way that you
define what the audio is going

00:50:04.216 --> 00:50:06.646
to represent itself as
on the page is, again,

00:50:06.646 --> 00:50:09.606
in the Widget tab, I can choose
to make that scrubber if I want,

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:12.546
but it's better left a button.

00:50:12.546 --> 00:50:14.066
I can also make it an image.

00:50:14.206 --> 00:50:17.986
If I wanted this whole
surface to be a tappable thing

00:50:18.276 --> 00:50:20.326
that would play that audio
clip as Patrick has it,

00:50:21.306 --> 00:50:23.986
I could just say,
make it an image

00:50:24.136 --> 00:50:25.256
and then delete that image.

00:50:30.406 --> 00:50:33.306
And now we have a clickable
thing that will play

00:50:33.306 --> 00:50:37.666
that audio clip when the user--
well, I'll deal with that--

00:50:39.186 --> 00:50:40.856
selects it on the page.

00:50:41.386 --> 00:50:44.266
So not a beautiful layout there
but you kind of get the idea

00:50:44.266 --> 00:50:46.506
and also that I'm trying to
move very quickly through this.

00:50:48.676 --> 00:50:51.276
Galleries-- Galleries are fun.

00:50:51.276 --> 00:50:53.006
They're probably
one of the best ways

00:50:53.006 --> 00:50:55.446
to make your content more
interactive as evidence

00:50:55.446 --> 00:50:57.376
by the Feynman book which
is basically just a bunch

00:50:57.376 --> 00:50:58.676
of audio clips and images.

00:50:58.676 --> 00:51:01.426
You know, that's all it takes

00:51:01.556 --> 00:51:03.216
to make the experience
truly engaging.

00:51:03.216 --> 00:51:06.926
And in case of the Feynman book,
Caltech just had all the stuff

00:51:06.926 --> 00:51:09.466
in the archives resurrected
and give it kind of new life

00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:10.936
by combining it with, you know,

00:51:10.936 --> 00:51:14.686
Feynman's magnum opus
of Six Easy Pieces.

00:51:14.686 --> 00:51:19.226
And it's pretty amazing what
it does, just through the use

00:51:19.226 --> 00:51:20.796
of simple and basic media type.

00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:24.826
For the gallery, you can
go to the pedantic route

00:51:24.826 --> 00:51:26.616
of adding the gallery and
dragging the images in

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:28.786
or you're just drag
in the folder and,

00:51:28.856 --> 00:51:29.986
boom, you've got gallery.

00:51:30.846 --> 00:51:33.386
It was a folder of
images if you had a folder

00:51:33.956 --> 00:51:36.386
of Word documents you
wouldn't have been happy.

00:51:37.056 --> 00:51:39.916
But you can see as I'm
resizing that gallery

00:51:39.916 --> 00:51:42.256
and making it fill the page,

00:51:42.256 --> 00:51:44.716
that the imagery is
doing the right thing.

00:51:45.056 --> 00:51:47.916
So we're always kind of
maximizing the content

00:51:47.916 --> 00:51:50.176
within the available space
within that canvass space.

00:51:50.176 --> 00:51:53.846
If I need to reorient or
reposition something on a kind

00:51:53.846 --> 00:51:55.386
of a per image basis, I can.

00:51:55.766 --> 00:51:57.356
But I'm pretty happy
with the way that looks.

00:51:58.136 --> 00:52:01.206
So I'm going to leave it there.

00:52:01.656 --> 00:52:07.586
3D content, we support 3D that
is rendered out using a kind

00:52:07.586 --> 00:52:09.716
of standard file
format known as Collada,

00:52:10.096 --> 00:52:11.566
it's an interchange format.

00:52:11.566 --> 00:52:12.566
It doesn't do a lot.

00:52:12.666 --> 00:52:14.996
But it does allow all of your--

00:52:15.256 --> 00:52:20.226
all of the conventional 3D
authoring tools to export models

00:52:20.266 --> 00:52:22.646
that you can use here
in iBooks Author.

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:26.726
This one doesn't have
a great background

00:52:26.726 --> 00:52:29.296
for it, let's start white.

00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:30.906
It's not going to work for
us, I'm going to quickly make

00:52:30.906 --> 00:52:34.856
that black and it's good.

00:52:35.086 --> 00:52:38.376
One thing I have to
show you before we wrap

00:52:38.376 --> 00:52:39.486
up this interactive image.

00:52:40.106 --> 00:52:41.396
So let me just create one here.

00:52:41.656 --> 00:52:43.976
I'm not going to go to the
other section to do that.

00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:50.866
Now, the interactive
image is one

00:52:50.866 --> 00:52:52.416
of our most favorite widgets.

00:52:52.706 --> 00:52:57.876
It's the one that allows you
to kind of create these very--

00:53:00.016 --> 00:53:03.296
it's a very engaging
experience just around photos.

00:53:03.826 --> 00:53:07.366
And what you do is
you set up callouts

00:53:07.366 --> 00:53:09.266
to identify features
within the photos.

00:53:09.866 --> 00:53:12.066
So I've just inserted
the interactive image.

00:53:12.066 --> 00:53:13.816
I'm going to drag over an image.

00:53:15.476 --> 00:53:20.436
There it is, all of the lunar
exploration rovers are there.

00:53:20.436 --> 00:53:22.416
The little one kind of looks

00:53:22.416 --> 00:53:24.326
like the Tech Droid
from Star Wars.

00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:25.336
Am I allowed to say that?

00:53:25.336 --> 00:53:28.466
I'm probably not
allowed to say that.

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:30.226
I said it.

00:53:30.226 --> 00:53:35.346
In order to define a
kind of special region

00:53:35.346 --> 00:53:37.606
within this image, I
can select the callout.

00:53:38.546 --> 00:53:40.646
This is already got kind
of a zoom set up for it.

00:53:40.646 --> 00:53:44.076
But I'm going to bring
this callout down here.

00:53:49.236 --> 00:53:54.996
At least [inaudible], kind
of zoom in a little bit.

00:53:55.356 --> 00:53:57.516
And now we've set a
view for the Sojourner.

00:53:57.886 --> 00:54:04.986
So we can go from our
default view to that view.

00:54:09.976 --> 00:54:12.016
So we've got a nice
interpolation.

00:54:12.196 --> 00:54:14.186
In the interest of time,
however, I'm not going to set

00:54:14.186 --> 00:54:15.586
up all of these callouts.

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:17.596
Let's just do two.

00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:32.446
Zooming a little bit, set
the view, and now we're done.

00:54:32.536 --> 00:54:33.976
We've set up our
interactive image.

00:54:35.216 --> 00:54:40.426
So two things very
quickly, pop-over widget.

00:54:41.186 --> 00:54:42.936
The pop-over widget is
a great way to supply

00:54:42.936 --> 00:54:45.336
that secondary information
when you want the user to kind

00:54:45.336 --> 00:54:47.886
of guess what the contents
maybe or be surprised

00:54:48.426 --> 00:54:49.546
when the contents are revealed.

00:54:50.156 --> 00:54:52.036
To create it, I insert one.

00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:57.006
I drag over an image
that I want to use.

00:54:57.006 --> 00:55:03.156
Actually, I don't want
that one, I want Sojourner.

00:55:03.226 --> 00:55:05.256
I drag over the image that
I want to serve as kind

00:55:05.256 --> 00:55:07.666
of the tap target, the thing
that the users going to interact

00:55:07.666 --> 00:55:09.606
with to pop the pop-over.

00:55:10.016 --> 00:55:11.556
I can double-click it.

00:55:11.636 --> 00:55:12.556
There's my pop-over.

00:55:13.936 --> 00:55:16.586
To populate it, I mean,
just drag in text,

00:55:17.056 --> 00:55:22.966
drag another image element,
position it where I want it.

00:55:25.076 --> 00:55:29.696
Sort of kind of-- sort
of kind of-- there we go.

00:55:29.696 --> 00:55:31.496
Boy, it's really twitchy.

00:55:31.576 --> 00:55:31.926
There you go.

00:55:32.636 --> 00:55:33.606
And there we have it.

00:55:34.326 --> 00:55:38.776
And then finally I'm going to
add a Keynote which I was hoping

00:55:38.776 --> 00:55:40.976
to be able to show you how
to build yourself right now,

00:55:40.976 --> 00:55:42.266
but we won't be able to do that.

00:55:43.026 --> 00:55:45.296
After a moment of
processing that file,

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:50.486
keynote is actually being
prompted in the background

00:55:50.486 --> 00:55:52.946
to create a lightweight
version of the presentation.

00:55:53.446 --> 00:55:56.816
In order to make this look a
little bit better on the page,

00:55:56.816 --> 00:55:59.706
I'm going to use another great
feature for reducing content,

00:56:00.266 --> 00:56:01.546
a footprint on your pages

00:56:02.256 --> 00:56:04.556
and that is Show
Widget As Thumbnail.

00:56:04.866 --> 00:56:07.206
And when you click Show
Widget As Thumbnail,

00:56:07.206 --> 00:56:10.056
that experience will be
represented by a proxy element

00:56:10.176 --> 00:56:10.846
that you're going to tap

00:56:10.846 --> 00:56:13.396
on before the user
goes to full-screen.

00:56:14.366 --> 00:56:18.856
And I'm going to customize that
tap element just by dragging

00:56:20.116 --> 00:56:22.736
in an image that I want
to service my proxy

00:56:23.376 --> 00:56:24.846
and then I'm pretty much done.

00:56:27.026 --> 00:56:28.776
Now two more things
before we go.

00:56:28.776 --> 00:56:31.666
When I get to this point, I
want to understand how this--

00:56:31.706 --> 00:56:34.096
how this-- what the end user
experience is going to be.

00:56:34.096 --> 00:56:35.676
So I'm going to need
to preview it.

00:56:35.806 --> 00:56:40.116
In version 1, we were able to
preview with an attached iPad.

00:56:40.116 --> 00:56:44.586
I'm going to show you
something that nobody knows yet.

00:56:44.586 --> 00:56:47.046
And I'm not going to
claim that we're going

00:56:47.046 --> 00:56:48.296
to ship it anytime soon.

00:56:48.296 --> 00:56:50.566
But I have a special build
of iBooks Author here

00:56:50.566 --> 00:56:53.196
that will allow me to preview
to iBooks for the Mac directly.

00:56:55.426 --> 00:56:59.396
So here I can click Preview,
iBooks Author kindly reminds me

00:56:59.396 --> 00:57:03.226
that I can't see portrait flow
mode within iBooks for Mac.

00:57:03.976 --> 00:57:12.346
But once it builds its
preview, we should see our book.

00:57:13.226 --> 00:57:17.086
So here's the Keynote widget
that I was going to show you how

00:57:17.086 --> 00:57:22.276
to create, but didn't.

00:57:22.406 --> 00:57:25.116
Our pop-over widget with a
bit of blown layout there,

00:57:25.666 --> 00:57:28.806
our interactive image,
and so on, you get it.

00:57:28.806 --> 00:57:34.396
So all of the elements are here
and previewable within iBooks.

00:57:34.396 --> 00:57:37.386
Again, I can't say when
we're going to ship this.

00:57:37.446 --> 00:57:40.026
But we absolutely will.

00:57:40.396 --> 00:57:42.406
Now when it comes
time to finally--

00:57:43.386 --> 00:57:45.076
to shift your book
to the iBooks store,

00:57:45.076 --> 00:57:47.206
you can do that directly
within iBooks Author.

00:57:47.826 --> 00:57:53.816
So I have another file
here I'm going to open up.

00:58:01.306 --> 00:58:03.306
I mentioned that iBooks
Author works in kind

00:58:03.306 --> 00:58:04.796
of multiuser contexts.

00:58:04.876 --> 00:58:07.706
So what you do in that case
is you have someone build

00:58:07.706 --> 00:58:08.266
the chapter.

00:58:09.326 --> 00:58:10.916
And you're like, "Great,
you got your chapter."

00:58:10.916 --> 00:58:12.206
I'm like, "Yeah, I do."

00:58:12.396 --> 00:58:14.746
You go, "OK, you
copy that chapter."

00:58:16.066 --> 00:58:19.746
And then you simply paste
it where you need it.

00:58:20.016 --> 00:58:21.556
So now we've introduced
that new chapter.

00:58:21.846 --> 00:58:22.806
It's not in the right place.

00:58:22.806 --> 00:58:23.756
I'm going to drag it here.

00:58:23.756 --> 00:58:26.806
You'll notice that the whole
time that we're composing this,

00:58:26.806 --> 00:58:28.686
this thing was reporting
that it was Chapter 1,

00:58:28.686 --> 00:58:30.746
which in fact it was for
this particular document.

00:58:30.746 --> 00:58:33.926
But when we've introduced
it into our new document

00:58:34.066 --> 00:58:35.356
because we're using
those things,

00:58:35.406 --> 00:58:37.466
the section numbering fields,
the section titling field,

00:58:37.916 --> 00:58:40.926
this thing is now properly
numbered, Chapter 3.

00:58:41.576 --> 00:58:46.336
And everything works within the
table of contents view as well.

00:58:47.716 --> 00:58:49.586
When you publish, you
hit the Publish button,

00:58:50.186 --> 00:58:54.016
iBooks Author does one thing
first, it validates your book

00:58:54.016 --> 00:58:56.226
and make sure that
you're not going to run

00:58:56.226 --> 00:58:59.226
into any errors with
the publishing.

00:59:06.396 --> 00:59:08.436
Do you ever try to type
in a room with hundreds

00:59:08.436 --> 00:59:11.176
of people looking at you?

00:59:11.416 --> 00:59:12.276
It's not easy.

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:16.216
It's going to ask you, "Is this
a new book or is this an update

00:59:16.216 --> 00:59:17.416
to a previously published book?"

00:59:17.416 --> 00:59:18.846
It is absolutely an update.

00:59:18.846 --> 00:59:20.916
Version 1 is up there
on the store.

00:59:21.366 --> 00:59:26.756
Here, all I have to do is add a
new value, increment that value.

00:59:26.756 --> 00:59:28.726
It's worth noting that you
always have to increment

00:59:28.726 --> 00:59:30.006
that value, you can't go down.

00:59:30.006 --> 00:59:31.586
Once you go up and when
it hits the bookstore

00:59:31.586 --> 00:59:33.376
at a current number,
you're stuck

00:59:33.376 --> 00:59:34.516
with that number or above it.

00:59:34.956 --> 00:59:37.056
Another beautiful thing
we've done, sample books,

00:59:37.056 --> 00:59:38.266
you don't need to
create one on your own.

00:59:38.716 --> 00:59:40.956
All you have to do is pick
a chapter from your book

00:59:40.956 --> 00:59:42.576
that you want to be the
basis of the sample.

00:59:42.576 --> 00:59:45.866
And we'll generate the sample
that is 15 pages or 20 percent

00:59:45.866 --> 00:59:47.896
of that chapter,
whichever comes first.

00:59:50.216 --> 00:59:52.666
Then you export your book.

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:56.366
So close, there we go.

00:59:56.466 --> 00:59:58.636
Little ding notifies me
that my book is exported.

00:59:59.016 --> 01:00:01.336
I'm now ready to go to
iTunes producer to finalize

01:00:01.406 --> 01:00:06.406
and ship this to the
iBooks store, again,

01:00:06.406 --> 01:00:07.976
all from within iBooks Author.

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:11.116
So that's it for the session.

01:00:11.406 --> 01:00:16.466
A few points I want to leave
you with before I get cut-off.

01:00:22.056 --> 01:00:24.046
So as we've shown it's
now, easier than ever

01:00:24.046 --> 01:00:26.256
to create this kind of
really interesting content.

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:27.576
The coding isn't required.

01:00:27.576 --> 01:00:29.026
But if you want to
bring it, you can

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:30.406
and it's going to
be very effective.

01:00:30.936 --> 01:00:33.586
Got great new widgets
that allow you

01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:35.836
to extend the interactive
experience and make stuff

01:00:35.836 --> 01:00:38.896
that is unique out there.

01:00:39.266 --> 01:00:41.546
So you can publish and make
the updates to your books,

01:00:41.546 --> 01:00:43.456
push new versions of your
books to the iBooks store.

01:00:43.756 --> 01:00:46.226
Your end users are going to get
notified directly within iBooks

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:47.406
that new versions are available.

01:00:47.456 --> 01:00:51.016
So you can continue to give
them updated experience

01:00:51.016 --> 01:00:52.896
to troubleshoot,
extend the content,

01:00:52.896 --> 01:00:54.496
add value overtime,
it's all up to you.

01:00:54.986 --> 01:00:57.636
And with all these things, we
think it's possible for anyone

01:00:57.686 --> 01:00:59.716
to become a published author.

01:01:00.086 --> 01:01:01.146
That's it for the session.

01:01:01.296 --> 01:01:02.886
Thank you so much
for joining us today.
