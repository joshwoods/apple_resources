00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:18.456
for the 2013 ADA

[ Applause ]

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:37.116
>> Good afternoon

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:37.756
>> Welcome.

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:41.066
We have a great -- great
event for you right now,

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:45.226
and we just -- we're just so
thrilled that you are here.

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:47.506
You came back after
the state of the union.

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:51.846
This is a non-technical session
so you can just relax and enjoy

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:55.056
as we celebrate some
really cool apps.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.106
>> These are exciting times
of growth and innovation.

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:02.476
>> You know, today we are
here to celebrate excellence

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:05.766
in design and innovation
on iOS and OS X.

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:08.426
>> Each year finding the
best apps becomes more

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:09.276
and more challenging.

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.036
>> There are more developers,
more apps, more technologies,

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:17.626
more ideas, more
innovation every day.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.946
>> Before we began, we
want to acknowledge you,

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:23.236
the developers who've
worked so hard to make all

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:27.406
of the amazing iOS and OS
X apps that people love

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:28.626
and that have changed
our culture.

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:33.616
>> They've changed the way that
we work, the way that we play,

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:34.946
and the way that we connect.

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:37.886
And we just -- we just want
to take a moment to thank you

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:40.866
for your hard work and anybody
else who's watching this event

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.976
once it gets on video.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:49.876
[ Applause ]

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.866
>> Tonight's winners were
selected by dozens of judges

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:55.946
from across Apple using a
variety of selection criteria.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:00.246
>> You know, this is my
thirteenth year doing the Design

00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:03.866
Awards and we have changed
the way that we judge things,

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:06.856
but we still look for many of
the same qualities in apps.

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:09.205
We look for apps
that are attractive

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:11.206
and have strong visual design.

00:02:11.726 --> 00:02:14.106
We look for apps that
have intuitive interaction

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:15.906
or really great gameplay.

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:19.076
We look for apps that have
great attention to detail.

00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:22.186
And we look for apps with
high production value.

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:26.206
We also look for apps
that are high performance,

00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:29.946
that are super responsive,
and give immediate feedback.

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:33.066
We look for apps that have
deep system integration

00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:36.526
and that take advantage of all
relevant Apple technologies.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:40.766
And finally, we look for
apps that are unique,

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:44.626
apps that bring an innovation
or new approach to something,

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:47.446
or they bring innovative
gameplay in a way

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:48.726
that we've never seen before.

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:51.156
And these are the
kinds of things --

00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:54.306
well-designed, state-of-the-art,
and innovative --

00:02:54.686 --> 00:02:58.446
these are the attributes
that bring people back again

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:01.166
and again and again
to great apps.

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.596
>> Each winner today will
receive an amazing set

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:11.216
of prizes: The 13-inch
MacBook Air, an Apple TV,

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:16.026
a 27-inch iMac, 15-inch MacBook
Pro with Retina display --

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:21.236
>> And winners will also
receive a 64-gig iPad Mini,

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:24.106
a fourth-generation iPad
Wi-Fi with Retina display,

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:29.686
a 64-gig unlocked iPhone
5, and a 64-gig iPod Touch.

00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:30.956
So basically

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:33.071
[ Applause ]

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.196
we're giving winners
pretty much one

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:36.706
of everything that Apple makes.

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:41.766
>> Oh, and don't forget,
the winners also receive one

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:43.136
of these coveted Cubes.

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:47.726
>> And you know, there's so many
new people here at the AD --

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:51.756
at WWDC this year, and at the
ceremony I bet you didn't knows

00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:53.666
that these cubes light
up when you touch them.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:56.836
They are touch sensitive and
the Apple logo glows just

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.916
like the back of your
MacBook Pro screen.

00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:01.176
So that is very cool.

00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:04.646
>> So let's get on
with our winners.

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:07.466
Just quickly, some logistics.

00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:10.006
If you are chosen as a
winner this afternoon,

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:12.706
please quickly come up through
the house and join us on stage

00:04:12.746 --> 00:04:14.446
through one of these sets
of stairs at the front,

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:15.656
and then when we're finished,

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:16.946
you're going to exit
stage right.

00:04:17.526 --> 00:04:19.486
>> We've got a lot of winners
so we need you to move fast

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:21.766
to the stage so we're not
sitting here all evening.

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:23.296
>> We're going to
begin with students.

00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:26.976
So let's start with Finish by
Ryan Orbuch and Michael Hansen.

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:36.516
[ Applause ]

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:46.000

00:04:46.226 --> 00:04:46.896
>> Here you go.

00:04:47.106 --> 00:04:47.356
>> Thank you.

00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:48.016
>> Congratulations.

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:50.246
>> Congratulations.

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:51.886
>> Why don't you come over here.

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:54.446
>> Finish is a streamlined
task management app

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:56.056
for procrastinators built

00:04:56.056 --> 00:04:57.906
by two high school
students from Colorado.

00:04:58.236 --> 00:04:59.966
It gets in your face when
you need it and stays

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.776
out of your way when you
don't to help you focus

00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:03.256
on completing important tasks.

00:05:04.196 --> 00:05:04.846
Let's take a look.

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:07.906
>> So some screenshots here.

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:09.696
So I don't know where the
other student is but --

00:05:09.696 --> 00:05:11.236
so I guess you did
all the work, yeah.

00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:13.086
>> Michael, he's at home.

00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:13.376
>> All right.

00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:14.016
Michael's at home.

00:05:14.016 --> 00:05:15.956
Well, he's going to
benefit from this anyway.

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:19.276
You know, this is an
app that manages short,

00:05:19.276 --> 00:05:20.636
medium, long-term tasks.

00:05:20.856 --> 00:05:22.716
These guys put it together
probably 'cause they're not

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:24.996
that good with that and they
are procrastinators themselves.

00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:27.716
But we thought this
was such a great app

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.146
by a couple of students.

00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:31.546
It uses numerous
iOS technologies,

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.516
integrates with Facebook
and Twitter

00:05:33.556 --> 00:05:35.966
so that you can share tasks
with other students that are

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:38.546
in your class or in your year.

00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:40.986
It looks great on
Retina display,

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:43.176
and is totally optimized
for iPhone 5.

00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:44.296
So congratulations.

00:05:44.296 --> 00:05:44.786
Great work.

00:05:44.836 --> 00:05:45.086
>> Thank you.

00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:45.696
>> That's Finish.

00:05:46.176 --> 00:05:47.226
That's it right over there.

00:05:47.816 --> 00:05:47.936
Okay.

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:57.466
>> And that's Finish.

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:01.416
Our other student winner is
mosaic.io by Ishaan Gulrajani,

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:02.796
Alex List, and Zain Shah.

00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:08.516

00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:18.826
Congratulations.

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:20.106
Congratulations.

00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:23.606
This app is built
by students from MIT

00:06:23.606 --> 00:06:25.066
and the University
of Pittsburgh.

00:06:25.406 --> 00:06:27.716
It magically connects
two or more iOS devices

00:06:27.716 --> 00:06:29.086
into a beautiful mosaic.

00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:31.636
View photos and files with
the swipe of a finger.

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:34.006
It's like having your very
own personal hypertable.

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:35.176
Let's take a look.

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:36.806
>> All right.

00:06:36.806 --> 00:06:39.186
So here's a video that we asked
these guys to put together,

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:41.236
and they had no idea that
they were doing this for us.

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:44.386
But these are self-taught
iOS developers.

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:47.146
They put a prototype for this
app together in a weekend,

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:50.316
and it creates a mosaic
across multiple screens;

00:06:50.316 --> 00:06:53.716
so you select an image, and
then it uses core animation,

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:55.886
device motion, and gestures

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:59.396
to determine the devices'
relative location to each other

00:06:59.756 --> 00:07:01.986
and which determine which
part of the image it draws.

00:07:02.306 --> 00:07:03.026
So watch this.

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:05.196
They're going to add an iPad;
now they're going to swipe

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:08.436
across the three devices, and
it will reposition that image

00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:09.926
across those three devices.

00:07:10.376 --> 00:07:11.786
So very, very cool app.

00:07:12.076 --> 00:07:12.656
Great job.

00:07:12.746 --> 00:07:13.346
Two students.

00:07:13.496 --> 00:07:14.266

00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:14.386
>> Again.

00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:17.016
>> You can go out that way.

Right over -- that's all right.

00:07:48.206 --> 00:07:49.066
Congratulations.

00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:50.116
Hi. Nice to see you again.

00:07:50.456 --> 00:07:51.106
>> Of course not.

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:54.896
>> Coda is an incredibly
innovated all-in-one editor

00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:55.706
for your web code.

00:07:56.266 --> 00:07:58.876
This new version has
added features and updates

00:07:58.876 --> 00:08:00.046
to almost every aspect

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.866
of the product including some
really compelling integration

00:08:02.866 --> 00:08:04.486
with their iPad app Diet Coda.

00:08:04.996 --> 00:08:08.856
>> You know, who doesn't
know the Panic guys, right?

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.656
And I think that they're
going to love adding this

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:13.506
to their display of ADAs.

00:08:13.756 --> 00:08:18.956
But, you know, Coda 1, five
years ago or six years ago

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:23.696
in 2007, won and ADA, and we
at the time thought it was just

00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:24.876
such an incredible app.

00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:29.136
And we felt that these
guys deserved a new ADA

00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:33.515
because Coda 2, it's been
six years in the oven,

00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:36.746
and it is just -- it
is so much stronger

00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:38.905
and it's a majoring
update to the app

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:40.025
that they had previously.

00:08:40.546 --> 00:08:41.166
And you know what?

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:42.916
More than anything else, we felt

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:45.076
that this app was
a shining example

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:49.116
of what a great Mac app is
supposed to look like and behave

00:08:49.116 --> 00:08:50.536
like and be built like.

00:08:51.176 --> 00:08:54.606
And it's a highly flexible
IDE for web development

00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:59.556
with very customizable UI;
it has an extensive use of --

00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:02.356
extensive support for plug-ins
so they can add on a lot

00:09:02.356 --> 00:09:05.936
of extra functionality; and they
support endless web development

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:11.486
technologies and languages --
ActionScript, ASP, CFML, CSS,

00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:14.856
HTML, Java, JavaScript,
and the list goes on.

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:20.476
This app is deeply integrated
with OS X, and the guys

00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:21.916
at Panic know how to do this.

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:24.386
Many of you probably
consult with them

00:09:24.386 --> 00:09:26.136
for assistance --
technical assistance.

00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:29.796
The app is built on AppKit,
as are most OS X apps,

00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:31.746
but they do everything
the right way.

00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:35.546
They're built on core animation,
iCloud, Notification Center;

00:09:35.546 --> 00:09:37.076
they use QuickLook;
they're integrated

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.526
with AirPlay and more.

00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:41.086
And probably the coolest

00:09:41.486 --> 00:09:45.366
and most innovative feature
is AirPlay, which is tied

00:09:45.366 --> 00:09:47.456
to Diet Coda on the iPad

00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:48.276
>> AirPreview.

00:09:48.406 --> 00:09:49.286
>> AirPreview, sorry.

00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:52.986
It allows you to
dynamically preview the work

00:09:52.986 --> 00:09:54.856
that you're doing, the
code that you're making,

00:09:54.856 --> 00:09:56.566
you can preview that
on the iPad.

00:09:57.306 --> 00:09:59.796
And so Coda and Diet
Coda together,

00:10:00.226 --> 00:10:01.606
they complement one another,

00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:04.436
and they provide an
award-winning OS X

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:06.466
and iOS web development
solution.

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:08.076

a game that delivers hours

It's expertly crafted in the
lo-fi retro video game style.

00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:12.336
I mean, all of the graphics are
intentionally done this way.

00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:16.336
It has engaging physics-based
gameplay mixed with humor

00:11:16.486 --> 00:11:18.986
and a really fun
soundtrack that reverses

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:20.606
as you go back up
to the surface.

00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:25.066
It embraces Game Center, makes
extensive use of Multi-touch,

00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:27.916
device motion, core
audio, and OpenGL ES.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:31.886

00:12:14.206 --> 00:12:15.976

00:12:23.686 --> 00:12:27.216
It was probably one of the

It's got outstanding attention
to detail, beautiful aesthetic,

00:12:32.876 --> 00:12:35.776
wonderful sound design
and musical score.

00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:40.126
There's some really engaging
writing, some rich typography,

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:43.646
gorgeous photography, and then
the interaction method for --

00:12:43.726 --> 00:12:47.256

00:12:49.046 --> 00:12:51.126
about them is fantastic.

00:12:51.636 --> 00:12:54.016
It's just got this great
attention to detail.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:57.436
And we loved their use of
Multi-touch, clever gestures,

00:12:57.836 --> 00:13:01.986

OpenGL ES, and so much more.

00:13:02.056 --> 00:13:05.536

it's across multiple
IOS devices as well,

but they took the
Mac app recently

00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:11.736
and they completely
rewrote this client.

00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:16.446
And they gave it a redesigned
Retina display optimized modern

00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:17.346

Great list, and there's
even more to say.

And they provide a variety
of ways to locate your notes

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.376
and to dig up the things

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:53.776
that you've stored
away in the archive.

00:14:54.366 --> 00:14:57.006

00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:04.436
of the app, and even
a Safari extension.

These guys -- this teams
and your extended team,

00:15:07.716 --> 00:15:10.046
have shown -- I think
they've set the bar

00:15:10.116 --> 00:15:12.806
for showing how you can
differentiate an app

00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:16.096
on these platforms and
do with the right way.

00:15:16.606 --> 00:15:19.456

00:19:23.946 --> 00:19:24.806
of the conference this year.

00:19:25.346 --> 00:19:26.546
>> Oh, nice.

00:19:26.546 --> 00:19:29.016
>> I blend in with the things
downstairs in registration.

00:19:29.016 --> 00:19:30.526
>> Like a chameleon?

00:19:30.526 --> 00:19:30.593
>> Yeah.

00:19:30.593 --> 00:19:31.816
>> Okay. Great.

00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:35.186

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:54.806
Congratulations.

00:19:55.336 --> 00:19:55.826
>> You guys --

00:19:56.026 --> 00:19:57.256
>> Some good Aussies
I understand.

00:19:57.386 --> 00:19:57.626
Yeah.

00:19:57.936 --> 00:19:58.316
>> There you go.

00:19:58.626 --> 00:20:00.216
>> Artists love this app.

00:20:00.376 --> 00:20:02.716
It comes packed with 48
brushes with everything

00:20:02.716 --> 00:20:05.426
from true-to-life pencils and
inks to unique digital tools.

00:20:05.716 --> 00:20:07.966
It's a complete art
studio at your fingertips.

00:20:08.426 --> 00:20:14.196
>> This app is exclusive to iPad
and iOS, and it is a powerhouse

00:20:14.196 --> 00:20:17.566
of IOS technologies using
ARC, Grand Central Dispatch,

00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:19.976
and OpenGL ES extensively.

00:20:21.456 --> 00:20:22.866
And because of that, it's able

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:26.626
to deliver state-of-the-art
performance and responsiveness

00:20:26.716 --> 00:20:28.246
with 64-bit precision.

00:20:28.766 --> 00:20:30.356
It renders canvasses --

00:20:30.356 --> 00:20:35.406
canvas sizes up to 4K x 4K at
a smooth 60-frame per second.

00:20:36.746 --> 00:20:38.256
And anything that you draw

00:20:38.256 --> 00:20:41.516
on this app can be shared
via Photoshop, given --

00:20:41.516 --> 00:20:44.426
handed over to Photoshop or
shared via Twitter or Facebook,

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:48.356
given to mail, photos, and a
variety of others destinations.

00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:52.186
And you can customize
virtually anything in this app:

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:53.666
You can customize your brushes.

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:55.686
You can customize your
different digital tools.

00:20:56.186 --> 00:20:59.686
And if that's not enough, you
can go and purchase more brushes

00:20:59.686 --> 00:21:02.196
or pencils or tools
through In App Purchase.

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:04.866
And the App does this
really innovative preview

00:21:05.156 --> 00:21:07.346
of your brushes and
pencils in --

00:21:07.346 --> 00:21:09.286
before you purchase
them in In App Purchase.

00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:13.426
It also uses Core
Bluetooth smoothly to connect

00:21:13.536 --> 00:21:15.596
with devices like styluses.

00:21:16.056 --> 00:21:20.166
This app has advanced
layer management

00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:21.386
and compositing, as well.

00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:24.606
And, you know, we just -- we
couldn't put this app down.

00:21:24.606 --> 00:21:27.136
The judges consistently
ranked it high.

00:21:27.136 --> 00:21:30.686
And it earns an ADA for
technical, aesthetic,

00:21:30.686 --> 00:21:31.946
and creative excellence.

00:21:32.036 --> 00:21:32.936

Congrats. Hi.

00:22:08.876 --> 00:22:09.886
>> Let's move that
way a little bit.

00:22:10.126 --> 00:22:12.366
>> Participate in
dogfights, protect fleets,

or attack enemy basis in
this amazing World War II air

00:22:15.286 --> 00:22:16.026
combat game.

00:22:16.476 --> 00:22:18.636
It includes accurately
re-created locations,

00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:21.356
realistic weather, and
interactive cockpits.

00:22:22.276 --> 00:22:27.116
>> And if you've not played this
game, again, like the Badlands,

00:22:27.236 --> 00:22:29.776
pick up a copy of this either
for the Mac or for iOS.

00:22:30.316 --> 00:22:32.776
It's got impressive
graphics and sound design.

00:22:33.116 --> 00:22:35.886
It's Retina enabled
and AirPlay enabled.

00:22:36.426 --> 00:22:38.596
It looks awesome on
the Mac or on iOS.

00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:41.266
And it's got amazing
OpenGL based --

00:22:41.446 --> 00:22:45.066
based capabilities and
effects that are provided.

00:22:45.436 --> 00:22:47.156
Specular masks, bump mapping,

00:22:47.236 --> 00:22:50.366
atmospheric scattering,
volumetric clouds.

00:22:50.366 --> 00:22:51.196
As he's shooting here,

00:22:51.196 --> 00:22:53.996
you're getting bullet
cartridges flying off --

00:22:54.036 --> 00:22:54.946
flying out of the guns.

00:22:55.346 --> 00:22:56.466
Supports radial blur.

00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:57.836
Shows off heat haze

00:22:57.836 --> 00:22:59.896
and refractive raindrops
on rainy days.

00:23:00.306 --> 00:23:01.286
It's amazing.

00:23:01.526 --> 00:23:03.736
This app is iCloud
enabled so as you play it

00:23:03.736 --> 00:23:04.856
across multiple devices,

00:23:04.856 --> 00:23:07.356
it knows what levels you
are at -- that you're at.

00:23:07.756 --> 00:23:10.186
And there's extensive
cross-platform Game Center

00:23:10.256 --> 00:23:13.766
support, meaning that you can
play Mac versus Mac or Mac

00:23:13.806 --> 00:23:16.826
versus iOS and do
that over Game Center.

00:23:17.506 --> 00:23:19.366
It's localized into 10 languages

00:23:19.676 --> 00:23:22.746
and this app is available
only on OS X and iOS.

00:23:34.066 --> 00:23:35.466
And that was Sky Gamblers.

00:23:36.356 --> 00:23:37.946
And so those are our
winners for today.

00:23:38.936 --> 00:23:42.366
In addition to the great price
package we discussed earlier,

00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:44.626
these winners will be
featured on the App Store,

00:23:46.136 --> 00:23:48.826
on our Facebook page,
as well as on Twitter.

>> Nice.

00:23:50.306 --> 00:23:53.406
>> But that's not all we
wanted to share with you today.

00:23:54.426 --> 00:23:58.666
>> Because every year there
are dozens of students who come

00:23:58.736 --> 00:23:59.856
to WWDC on a scholarship.

00:24:01.116 --> 00:24:03.446
>> This year the
scholarship process required

00:24:03.446 --> 00:24:05.066
that applicants submit an app.

00:24:05.676 --> 00:24:08.276
They had four days or
less to work on it.

00:24:08.276 --> 00:24:10.236
And the app was to tell
us about themselves.

00:24:10.826 --> 00:24:13.336
>> And we were so impressed
with some of these apps

00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:16.486
that we had received, you
know, that people had submitted

00:24:16.546 --> 00:24:18.956
for their scholarship,
that we wanted to show some

00:24:18.956 --> 00:24:19.866
of the best submissions.

00:24:20.256 --> 00:24:23.486
>> So we created
a special version

00:24:23.486 --> 00:24:25.046
of the Apple Design
Award trophy,

00:24:25.396 --> 00:24:27.336

only get the trophy.

Are you Louis?

00:25:19.716 --> 00:25:20.986
We're going to start with you.

00:25:21.456 --> 00:25:25.446
These three did some pretty
impressive work and we'd

00:25:25.446 --> 00:25:26.576
like to tell you about them now.

00:25:26.876 --> 00:25:27.506
>> Stand here.

00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:29.246
>> Let's start with
Louis Harboe,

00:25:29.636 --> 00:25:30.776
in the middle here I believe.

00:25:31.086 --> 00:25:33.496
Louis is 17 years old and
attends the University

00:25:33.496 --> 00:25:35.056
of Chicago's Laboratory
High School.

00:25:35.566 --> 00:25:39.336
>> Louis began developing
on iOS in the seventh grade,

00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:42.656
and he's already collaborated
on several apps in the App Store

00:25:42.656 --> 00:25:43.676
that have been featured in the

00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:45.526
"Chicago Sun-Times"
and on "Cult of Mac."

00:25:46.326 --> 00:25:48.726
His WWDC Scholarship App,
which you're seeing here

00:25:48.726 --> 00:25:51.426
on screen scrolling through it,
is called "My Adventure book,"

00:25:51.866 --> 00:25:55.086
and it presents a scrolling
list of photos and videos

00:25:55.516 --> 00:25:58.196
that tell the story or
provide details about his apps,

00:25:58.496 --> 00:26:01.936
his education, his experiences,
his friends, his family,

00:26:01.936 --> 00:26:04.966
and etc. You tap on each
one of these, they expand

00:26:04.966 --> 00:26:06.066
and provide more detail.

00:26:06.866 --> 00:26:09.736
And Louis also interned
at Square recently here

00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.636
in San Francisco, and this tab,

00:26:11.676 --> 00:26:13.746
this little photo right
there, tells you that.

00:26:14.476 --> 00:26:17.026
So pretty amazing stuff
for four days of work.

00:26:25.246 --> 00:26:27.396

Bryan Keller's work.

00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:30.176
Brian's 19 years old, attends
Marist College in New York,

00:26:30.176 --> 00:26:33.236
and is studying computer
science.

00:26:33.386 --> 00:26:36.936
>> So Bryan is really extremely
passionate about programming

00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:39.816
and he's got an app in the App
Store today called "Augmentative

00:26:39.816 --> 00:26:41.136
and Alternative Communication."

00:26:41.646 --> 00:26:44.236
And he believes that
technology should be intuitive

00:26:44.236 --> 00:26:44.906
and approachable.

00:26:44.906 --> 00:26:48.276
And the app that you're seeing
right here is just named

00:26:48.316 --> 00:26:48.976
"Bryan Keller."

00:26:48.976 --> 00:26:50.726
It's not available in the App
Store -- none of theirs is --

00:26:51.296 --> 00:26:55.046
but it presents a word cloud
that could be tapped and zoomed

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:59.166
to reveal details about his
apps, his family, his life,

00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:01.006
his school, his sports,
and his interests.

00:27:01.006 --> 00:27:03.966
And we picked it because it
had hockey I think is one

00:27:03.966 --> 00:27:04.896
of the words, right?

00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:05.826
No. Kidding.

00:27:05.916 --> 00:27:06.976
We picked up it because
we liked it.

00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:09.116
>> So that's Bryan's app.

00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:09.976
>> Good job.

00:27:15.236 --> 00:27:15.616
>> Tremendous.

00:27:17.046 --> 00:27:18.876
And finally, Puck Meerburg.

00:27:19.226 --> 00:27:20.616
Puck is 13 years old.

00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:23.856
He's from Delft in the
Netherlands, and he loves

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.146
to code, as you will see.

00:27:26.426 --> 00:27:29.056
>> So pay close attention
here, okay.

00:27:29.446 --> 00:27:32.756
Puck learned HTML, PHP, and
JavaScript when he was six,

00:27:33.016 --> 00:27:37.136
all right; he's been recognized
as the Internet Hero of 2011

00:27:37.136 --> 00:27:40.496
by the VNN, a Dutch television
network; he's presented

00:27:40.496 --> 00:27:45.206
at TEDx Amsterdam when he was
11; and he's released ten apps

00:27:45.206 --> 00:27:46.786
on the App Store already

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:51.366
that have been downloaded
200,000 times.

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:52.986

00:27:58.416 --> 00:28:02.426
I mean, the app that you're
seeing behind me is his WWDC

00:28:02.426 --> 00:28:06.316
submission called WWDC, and
it uses UIKit, Core Animation,

00:28:06.316 --> 00:28:09.176
Multi-Touch, Core Graphics to
present a comprehensive resume

00:28:09.176 --> 00:28:10.356
of his life and interests.

00:28:10.506 --> 00:28:12.026
And each section is different.

00:28:12.026 --> 00:28:12.876
This one, you're tapping

00:28:12.876 --> 00:28:14.686
on these clouds,
dragging them around.

00:28:14.686 --> 00:28:15.536
They're just kind of floating

00:28:15.536 --> 00:28:17.496
around telling you
what he dreams of doing

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:18.746
and where he plans to be.

00:28:18.746 --> 00:28:20.146
Which is at Apple I
guess one day, yeah?

00:28:20.146 --> 00:28:21.256
or something.

00:28:21.746 --> 00:28:22.026
All right.

00:28:22.686 --> 00:28:23.906
Anyway, we just wanted

00:28:24.056 --> 00:28:27.176
to highlight these three
students for amazing work.

00:28:27.276 --> 00:28:28.766
Four days of work
by each of them.

00:28:28.996 --> 00:28:29.426
Tremendous.

00:28:29.426 --> 00:28:30.016
Congratulations.

00:28:30.326 --> 00:28:30.896
>> Congratulations.

00:28:31.646 --> 00:28:35.556
We're going to have you
exit right that way.

00:28:35.556 --> 00:28:35.976
Congratulations.

00:28:46.386 --> 00:28:47.906
>> Now, one thing
I will say, too,

00:28:47.906 --> 00:28:49.666
is all ADA winners
are also going

00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:51.086
to be wearing special lanyard,

00:28:51.586 --> 00:28:53.486
so if you see these three
guys walking around,

00:28:53.596 --> 00:28:56.006
please introduce yourself
to them, talk to them,

00:28:56.006 --> 00:29:01.056
learn from them or something,
and just help them out.

00:29:01.056 --> 00:29:03.766
And also there's the
other ADA winners as well.

00:29:03.766 --> 00:29:05.776
Please acknowledge them
throughout the week and find

00:29:05.776 --> 00:29:06.836
out how they did what they did.

00:29:07.616 --> 00:29:10.216
>> So these are our
ADA 2013 winners.

00:29:10.696 --> 00:29:14.816
>> These are 11 great apps that
demonstrate technical, design,

00:29:14.816 --> 00:29:16.186
and creative excellence.

00:29:16.726 --> 00:29:18.806
>> Eleven really great
apps they set the standards

00:29:18.806 --> 00:29:20.106
that other apps should
reach for.

00:29:20.736 --> 00:29:24.866
>> And 11 really great apps that
people are going to come back

00:29:24.866 --> 00:29:29.036
to again and again and again.

00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:32.266
And like we've said in a lot
of the sessions today already,

00:29:32.336 --> 00:29:34.986
we can't wait to see
what you are going to do

00:29:35.126 --> 00:29:37.366
on iOS VII and OS 10 Mavericks.

00:29:37.366 --> 00:29:39.456
And so we look forward to
having your app featured here

00:29:39.456 --> 00:29:43.176
on stage next year in the ADA
as we will be looking for apps

00:29:43.256 --> 00:29:45.306
that exploit these
operating systems.

00:29:45.646 --> 00:29:46.586
>> Thanks for joining us.

00:29:46.586 --> 00:29:47.976
We'll see you next year.
