00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.860
Hello.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.850
So I'm Mark Kawano,
Apple's User Experience Evangelist,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.100
and today I'm going to be talking
about iOS User Interface Design.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.810
So I'll be going through some tips for
UI design on the iPad and the iPhone.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.830
Now, as you all know,
design is something that we

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.690
care a lot about at Apple.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.270
And when we design products,
our customers have come to

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.640
experience that's intuitive,
that's engaging.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.000
That's beautiful and
sometimes even a bit magical.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.700
And we spend a lot of time and energy
making sure that all of our apps

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.400
that are built into the iPhone and
the iPad and that are available on

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.160
the App Store have these attributes.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.440
And I've spent several years as a
UI designer at Apple designing products,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.840
and so I know firsthand just
how much care and consideration

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.130
goes into every design decision.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.220
And I think it really shows,
as we've kind of seen in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.090
some of these examples.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.890
We've also spent a lot of time
and energy on our platform

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.170
building a really robust SDK.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.900
And I hope you've really enjoyed the week
so far and have been able to pick up some

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.100
great tips and learn about all the latest
and greatest technologies in iOS 6.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.310
But I want to really just remind
you for a minute as you're kind of

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.830
taking in all this new information,
you're meeting a lot of new people,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.500
learning about great new APIs,
new features, new frameworks,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.170
that at the end of the day, what

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.590
What users and customers really
care about isn't the technology that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.800
you're building your product on.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.020
What they're really interested in is what
your app enables them to do and how it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.880
makes them feel when they're using it.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.330
And that's what you really want to
focus on when you're designing your

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.330
app for the iPhone or the iPad.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.970
And on Monday afternoon,
we've highlighted some fantastic

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.450
apps that are on the App Store at
the Apple Design Awards,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.960
and I hope many of you were
able to attend this event.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.720
And it really shows some of the amazing
user experiences that are only capable or

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.340
only possible on the iPhone and the iPad.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.380
So we highlighted some great apps,
such as Bobo Explores Lights,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.610
or Paper by 53, National Parks by the
National Geographic Society,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.420
Jetpack Joyride, DM1, the Drum Machine,
and Where's My Water?

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.080
Now,
these apps set the bar for those user

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.470
experiences that are just unbelievable.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.980
But really, there are so many apps on
the App Store that have great

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.740
user experiences as well.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.780
They have great design, great graphics,
really innovative features.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.260
And as developers,
I hope you're constantly going to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.480
the App Store and downloading apps,
not just in your categories,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.700
but all over and seeing
what we're featuring,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.250
seeing what other developers are really
doing that are really raising the bar

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.760
for these great software experiences.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.280
But as you know,
there's also a lot of apps on the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.130
App Store that could use some help.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.250
You know,
maybe the graphics aren't that great, or,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.030
you know, the features aren't as
innovative as they need to be.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.110
Or maybe the UI has just been
squished down from a website

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.720
or a desktop experience.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.700
Well,
today what I'd like to do is talk about

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.780
some of these common design pitfalls
that you see a lot in these iOS apps.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.620
So I've put together this list,
and this really comes from my

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.860
experience working with thousands of
developers from all over the world.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.120
And kind of seeing these
pitfalls in their apps,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.820
in their user experiences,
kind of taking away from their idea,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.660
from their creation.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.080
And so the list that I've put together
is the order that I'm going to go

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.860
through isn't necessarily an order
of importance or how much I see them,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.010
but really the order that I kind
of approach the app when I'm

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.860
doing one of the UI reviews,
such as, you know,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.740
we've got the UI design
lab on the third floor.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.960
Please go and check that out.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.670
And so when I go through these apps
with the developers one-on-one,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.840
it starts with the first impression,
then kind of playing around with the

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.340
different features and learning a little
bit more about what they're trying to do,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.560
what users want to do.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.340
And so that's kind of the order that
I'm going to go through these pitfalls.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.220
Okay, so let's get started.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.150
And the first pitfall I want
to talk about is bad app icons.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.600
You guys are all probably seen
lots of apps with bad app icons.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.020
And you know that an app icon is really
the first impression that users are

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.070
going to have of your whole product,
your whole experience.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.940
It's the first thing
they're going to see.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.480
They're going to judge
your app right away.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.820
And if you don't have a great app icon,
they're just not going to assume.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.820
They're going to assume that you also
have great features or a great UI.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.580
So here we're looking at the App Store,
and this is if you do

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.820
a search for recipes.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.000
And I bet many of you right away,
right just looking at the screen,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.800
are starting to make judgments.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.820
You're starting to say, well,
that app looks kind of interesting.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.600
These other ones, you know,
I don't know if I'm

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.820
going to check that out.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.820
You know,
the App Store is so competitive now.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.820
And this is where it all begins.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.720
This is where the experience starts.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.810
This is before anybody's
read any of the reviews,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.640
seen the ratings, seen the screenshots,
heard about any of the features.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.840
This is just the app icon.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.960
So I think it kind of goes
without saying that an app,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.030
great app icon can play a huge
part in the success of your app.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.650
And so, of course, app icons,
just like all graphics in your app,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.000
need to be beautiful.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.420
It kind of goes without saying.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.050
But an app icon has some
extra responsibility.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.840
An app icon also needs to
be instantly recognizable.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.160
And that's really important because
a user is going to interact with your

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.140
app icon not just on their home screen.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.920
They're going to first see it on the
iTunes store at various different sizes,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.650
depending on what device they're using.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.090
They're also going to see it in places
like Spotlight or inside of a folder or

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.250
in settings or a notification center.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.790
And you need to make sure that when
you're designing an app icon that it

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.200
works well at all these different sizes.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.880
And so to help you do that,
to make sure that your app icons are both

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.770
beautiful and instantly recognizable,
I'm going to go through

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.810
some tips right now.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.550
So the first tip is just to make sure
that you're focusing on a unique shape.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.000
If your app icon just has too many
shapes or too complicated of a shape,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.700
it's just going to be really
hard to distinguish at that small

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.900
size that a user might see it.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.320
It will get all muddied up.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.660
And it's just not going
to be that memorable.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.300
So some of these app icons
you're probably familiar with.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.860
And I think you can see that
they're really great app icons,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.840
but the thing that jumps
out at you is the shape.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.080
That's kind of what really
grabs a user's attention.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.740
And there are subtle details in them.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.320
There's really nice textures,
kind of the fold of the paper,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.080
all these great details.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.200
But that's kind of
supporting that basic shape.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.850
And so what you really want to do is
make sure that that shape is there,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.990
and then you're building in around that.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.260
The same thing with colors.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.100
You need to make sure that
you're carefully selecting

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.740
the colors in your app icon.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.590
It's best to stick with
a limited color palette.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.540
Maybe just two or three colors that
will really drive home your app icon.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.110
Use the colors from your brand,
maybe some colors from

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.700
the interface elements,
or if you're trying to

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.860
represent a physical object,
try to do that in a simple way.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.590
Now you can see here there's
a bunch of app icons,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.530
great use of color,
but it's really just a

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.660
couple of them that pop out,
even though with

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.060
Instagram there's that rainbow,
but it's really just the dark

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.860
shades of brown and then that dark
lens that really create the shape

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.940
and the colors for this app icon.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.640
So it's really important
that you do that.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.010
If you just have too many colors, again,
it's going to get too muddied

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.160
up at all those different sizes
that a user might see them.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.300
You also want to make sure that you
avoid using a photo for your app icon.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.960
Photos are too visually distracting.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.660
It's hard to have a simplified
set of colors and it's hard to

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.910
have a very well-defined shape.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.000
Let's say you were
building an astronomy app.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.250
It would be really tempting to
use this great photo here of the

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.000
Milky Way and take this photo,
turn it into an app icon.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I think it looks okay at this large size.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But the user that downloads this is
someone that's really into astronomy.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They've got a bunch of different
apps that are like this.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
This is not going to be that memorable.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.230
And at the smaller sizes,
it's really just going to turn

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.000
into this bluish-purple object
that isn't that symbolic.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.620
So instead, really try to focus on some
details that you can enhance,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.820
simplify the colors.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.000
And that's exactly what the designers
of the Star Walk app icon did.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.980
So they really just took that hue,
the purple-bluish hue, simplified it.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
They simplified it down and then
they focused on the constellation.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.030
And this is a great app and they
really wanted to make sure the app

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.000
icon represented and created this
really symbolic branding element.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
This is an app that actually won
the Apple Design Award in 2010.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.000
And so really try to think about what
is that object that you can really focus

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.440
in and highlight and what are the colors
around it that you can kind of just

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.000
really simplify and really focus on.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.960
Okay, the next tip is avoid
using a lot of text.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.000
Text just typically is a
little bit more complex.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.990
It's too hard to read at
all the different sizes.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.620
But on top of that,
the app store is available in so many

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.000
different countries around the world now.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.940
And if you've got a lot
of text in your app icon,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.390
you're just kind of telling
those other countries that,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.970
you know, this may not be the type
of experience for me.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
This is, you know, maybe for that region.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.340
And you don't want to cut off access to
all these different customers and all

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.000
these potential markets to make -- that
your app icon could be available in.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.310
And so I just want to kind of illustrate
the first point of just how hard

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.000
it is to read text in an app icon.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So I want to bring up a graphic here.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.950
Here we're looking at Fuzz
Hair and Makeup Studio.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.340
This is, you know,
a graphic that's probably

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.760
designed for a beauty salon,
maybe their websites or maybe their,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.830
you know, actual signage in the store.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And I think the graphic, you know,
looks okay.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's nice.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.970
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.210
And so it would be tempting
to just take this graphic,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.970
their logo, their identity,
and just turn it into an app icon.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.000
That would be something that a lot
of people have done on the app store.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.850
You know,
it's the kind of easy thing to do,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
something that's memorable from people
that are going to the app store.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.740
And again,
it might look okay at this large size,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.000
at 5'12" or, you know,
even bigger than that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.120
But it's not going to work well at
all the different sizes that a user

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.000
is going to view it on their device.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And you can kind of start to see what
happens when it gets really small.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
You just can't read any of the text.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It kind of turns into
this blobby type of shape.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It's just kind of white with colors.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.970
And it's just not really
effective as a good app icon.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.240
On the other hand,
there's some developers that

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.000
have done some really great
stuff with their app icons.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Here's an app called Quip.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
This is from Glasshouse
Apps in Australia.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.000
And this is a new Twitter client
that was just available on the iPad.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Great app for catching
up on conversations.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And so this is the logo
that they've got at the top.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
They designed this really nice logo,
Quip.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It's got that Twitter bird in the queue.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And so it would be tempting for
them to just take that logo again

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.990
and then turn it into an app icon,
right?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But it would look okay at this size.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And again, it would start to really fall
apart at those smaller sizes.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And so what they did was they
really focused on some key elements.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.800
How could we really emphasize
the shape so it's really

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.000
distinguishable at all the sizes?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And we still want to bring in the
colors from the branding elements

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.890
because this is actually some of the
colors that they use in their app.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.990
And so what they did was they
focused in on just the bird's head.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And it really created this nice shape.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Used those colors, like I mentioned,
from the UI.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.430
But it also has that kind of
connotation of what the app does

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.000
because it's got the Twitter bird.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.410
And I think it turned out really nicely.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.310
works well with all the different
sizes and that's one of the most

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.100
important things for an app icon.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.690
And this is a technique, you know,
focusing on a single element

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.760
rather than just taking your logo,
that a lot of companies have

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.200
done in their app icons.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.120
So you can see some of these brands,
many of you are probably

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.000
familiar with these brands.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.540
They didn't just take these recognizable
logos and put it into an app icon.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.020
They really highlighted some, you know,
single area of their

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.800
typeface or their kind of,
you know, trademark imagery.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.690
To really highlight their app icon.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.080
And so they still have that color
palette that's going to kind of call

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.960
them out and have that branding element.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.990
But it's a much simpler shape, you know,
either a single letter or, you know,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
a simple shape that will work
well at all these different sizes.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.310
And that's so important.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.490
What about the type of app
icons where you're trying to

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.860
represent a physical object?

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.000
Well,
if you're doing that type of app icon,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.680
it's critical that you make
sure that you're accurately

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.120
portraying the actual materials
that make up that physical object.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.440
You need to be really realistic here.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.580
So pay attention to the subtle
details and textures of fabric or

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.450
wood or paper or metal or glass,
whatever you're trying to represent.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.890
Make sure that it looks really authentic.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.870
And so you need to be careful
when you're building these types

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.180
of app icons that you're not
just applying the standard gloss.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:58.470
You need to be careful when
you're building these types of

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:14.180
app icons that you're not just
applying the standard gloss.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
And so when you apply this gloss
to these built-in app icons

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
that we have on the device,
you can kind of see that actual

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
object kind of isn't as strong
of a visual element anymore.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
It's just a little bit distracting.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
So make sure that if you
are building your app icon,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
you're really paying attention
to make sure that the gloss is

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
adding value to the actual image.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
And turning off the gloss is as simple as
just checking that pre-rendered checkbox

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
in the project summary tab of Xcode.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
And then when you submit that gloss,
you can see that it's actually

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.180
adding value to the actual image.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.680
submit the icon,
we know not to apply that gloss,

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.900
and everything will look great.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.200
There are some app icons where you want
to have gloss where you still want to

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.400
keep that checkbox selected in Xcode.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.640
These are the app icons where you're
trying to represent a physical

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.700
object or you're trying to do
something where you selectively want

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.760
to apply gloss to the actual image.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.090
And so you actually bake in that
gloss when you're actually creating

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:42.200
the app icon in Photoshop or whatever
image editing tool you're using.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.280
So as you can see, for example,
the YouTube icon,

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.290
there's gloss on just the
glass of the television,

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.630
but on the wood it kind of
falls off because it just

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.590
wouldn't make sense there.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.120
And that's the same thing that
we've done with all these other app

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.020
icons that we've created as well.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.180
So really make sure that you're
being true to the materials and

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.300
really make sure you're not getting
distracted by some of the things

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.460
like reflections and shadows that
make up a really great app icon.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.400
So the last tip I have on app
icons is just to have fun.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.220
Be creative.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.320
So developers, you guys have come up with
some amazing app icons.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.780
And, you know,
I just want to highlight some of them.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:13.860
I'm going to show you a few of them.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.640
One of my favorites here.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.090
This is Route C Pro.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.450
This is a great app icon.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.840
This is for getting around San Francisco.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.660
This is shaped like a -- or
designed like an actual bus ticket

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.200
if you're used to riding in Muni.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.910
Really effective colors.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.300
You know, alludes to what it's doing.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.030
Really love this app icon.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.120
Here's Hipstamatics.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.890
This is a famous app icon.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.130
They're mimicking the actual toy
camera that they've modeled the

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.820
effects after in their photo app.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.760
Here's Evernote food.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.040
This is a great app that
made a plate of sushi.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.340
Really creative use of this
rounded rectangle space.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.950
They really kind of
thought out of the box,

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.550
if you will.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.680
And to go with the plate of sushi,
I thought I'd show you a

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.450
mug of beer from Brewski Me.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.010
And this is a gorgeous icon.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.600
Again, really great attention to detail.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.850
You can see all this condensation
on the actual mug and the foam.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.730
And with all these app icons,
really great stuff.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.700
And the reason that they work
well is not only that they're

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.150
beautiful at this large size,
they actually do follow all of these tips

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.950
that I went through earlier where they're
really highlighting just a few colors,

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.120
a few simple shapes.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.400
And that's really important when
you're designing your app icon.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:18:46.100
[Transcript missing]

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.330
So they wanted to kind of test it around
and then they did something more bold.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.650
They really wanted to stand out.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.350
So they put it on this
bright orange background.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.280
And they realized the ship
was just kind of too small.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.240
So they increased the size of the ship,
did a bunch of different

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.660
size explorations there.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.860
And to make the ship as
big as they wanted to be,

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.840
they had to get rid
of that outside frame,

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.140
which was kind of better.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.180
It just simplified things even more.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.580
And so they were starting to
feel pretty good about it.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.440
They added some bubbles and you can see
those rays coming out of the submarine

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.180
ship in that bottom right area.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.300
you.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:23.690
The next part of their exploration
was experimenting with the background.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.700
They simplified things even more and
tested it on several different colors.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.700
These are the colors that you see
when you are playing the game.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.500
Going through different levels,
you see red water, green water, whatnot.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.770
What they saw was that to really
highlight the submarine ship,

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.700
the blue water really
kind of set it apart.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.700
It has the opposing
blue and orange colors.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.700
And it really worked well.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.700
And that's where they finally landed.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.700
And I think it turned out really nicely.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.700
If you look at this icon up close,
all these great details, those bubbles,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.320
it really looks like you're looking
in this kind of underwater graphic.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.690
Just the glow around the light,
really great attention to detail,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.700
really great looking app icon.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.610
But like I said, it needs to work at all
the different sizes.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.670
And that's how you know you've
got a truly effective app icon.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.700
And that's really what makes
this app icon pass that test.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.100
Okay.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.690
So there's a lot there to
think about for app icons.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.590
And that's probably my longest pitfall.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.700
So I'm going to go through some of
the other ones a little bit quicker.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.150
But I really wanted to just kind of
take a moment and go through some

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.720
of these details because it's so
important and can play such a big

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.700
role in the success of your app.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.700
So the first pitfall I want to
talk about is forced registration.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.660
And what I mean by forced registration
are app icons that force you to register.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.680
You've all seen apps that kind of
do this right when you launch them.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.700
They just -- you know,
there's two buttons, sign up, sign in.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.340
This is not exciting.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.700
Users hate this.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.350
What they're going to do most of
the time is press that third button,

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.700
the home button on the device.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.950
They're going to quit your app.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.700
They're going to, you know, delete it.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.700
And they're never going
to come back to it.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.230
So if you're a user and you
actually need registration,

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:09.750
it's kind of required,
maybe a banking app or even in our

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.690
WWDC attendee app where we kind
of wanted to really limit it to

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.870
just a limited number of people,
well, you know, then it kind of makes

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:18.630
sense to have a login wall.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.700
But most apps don't
have those requirements.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.390
And when you make a user register,
you're just kind of saying, you know,

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.700
they're really motivated.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.700
Maybe they will.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.700
But who knows?

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.690
So it's much better to just
kind of remove this barrier.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.610
So this forced registration
when they first started,

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:37.700
this was Fondue.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.540
This is an app that lets you
discover new restaurants and

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.630
different things that are nearby you.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:46.360
And then you can kind of take photos
and create a journal and rate all those

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.140
restaurants for your personal memory
or just if you want to share those with

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.190
your friends or the Fondue network.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.670
As most of you probably know,
this is a really competitive space.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:00.040
There's a few apps that do
something similar to this.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.800
And they spent a lot of
time polishing the UI,

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:05.340
making sure they had innovative features,
making sure their performance was great,

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.000
their database of restaurants was great,
so that they were really able

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.540
to stand out and differentiate
themselves from all the other

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.120
apps that did something like this.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.100
But what they noticed was no one
was actually seeing any of that

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.700
stuff because they would just
get to that forced registration

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.150
and they would just quit the app.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.220
So recently they had a big
update and they really focused

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.140
on the onboarding experience.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.160
And what they did was they just really
wanted to make sure that it just excited

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.230
people when they launched the app.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.180
So they've got this overview
of all the features that a

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.100
user can kind of swipe between.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.620
It's become pretty popular
on a lot of apps now.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.720
There's four cards that you
can kind of see what's inside.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.620
And actually,
I recommend you download this

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.670
app because it's pretty cool what
they've done with these cards.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.640
Each of these screens
is actually animated.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.510
And it really just goes that extra
distance in wanting to entice

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.870
the user to actually sign up.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.270
But I think the thing that I really
liked about this update was what they

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.000
did on that final card where they said,
"Okay, now you know about the features.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.800
Here's your chance to sign in with
Facebook or you can register with

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.080
your email if you don't want to use
Facebook." But there's also this really

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.700
important button that they added,
which is get a taste.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.320
And what get a taste did is
just let any user get fully into

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.420
the app and see how it works.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.150
So that's how things work.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.300
They could actually use the
GPS to see restaurants nearby,

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.070
read reviews,
even see if some of their other

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:24.180
friends or who might have made reviews,
if any of their friends

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.050
are actually using this.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.910
And then when you actually go to post
a review or you go to your profile tab,

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.940
that's the area that then they
prompt you again to sign up.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.050
And after they made this change,
the developer called me up and they said,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.370
"Well, engagement has gone up by 42%
since we made this change.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.380
That is huge in this competitive area."
And so I think it goes without saying.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.500
And so I think it goes without saying
that this was a really important change.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.880
And they've also gotten way more
positive reviews since they've,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.500
you know, really wanted to focus on
this first launch experience.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.800
So really avoid forced registration and
think about how to get your users into

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.500
your app as quick as possible so they can
see all the work that you put into it.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.000
Okay.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.500
The next pitfall, tiny controls.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.650
So this is a topic that may sound
familiar to any of you who have

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.930
heard some of my previous UI talks
at WWDC or at the tech talks or any

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.420
of the other things that I've done.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.500
But this is a topic that
I think is really important.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.920
And I think it's really important.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.470
And I think it's really important
for any of the developer

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.920
videos we have on UI design.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.690
But this is a topic that I need
to repeat because still so many

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.130
developers are designing controls
that are just so hard to tap on.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.350
For example,
I want to bring up what we could

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.070
have done with the WWDC app.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.200
This is a modified version.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.250
And as you know,
we've got so many sessions

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.350
and labs going on.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.840
It would be a strong argument to say,
well, let's try to show as much content

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.840
as we can to the user so they
don't have to scroll as much.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.830
There's just so much data.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.190
And so to do that,
maybe we'll shrink everything down.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.280
We'll take labels off.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.180
We'll make the buttons a little
bit smaller than the defaults.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.700
We'll make the table view
cells that much shorter.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.380
And it will be way faster for the users,
right?

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.950
Well, the truth is this is an experience
that's going to be really slow because

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.880
the user is always going to be tapping
on the wrong item or they're just going

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.980
to have to slow down to make sure that
they tap on exactly the right item.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.720
And so when you compare this
to the UI that we actually

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.960
shipped in the developer app,
you can kind of see that there's

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.310
not as many sessions and labs,
but it's actually going to be a way

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:17.350
faster experience because they'll be
able to tap on just the right item.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.300
It's critical that you design
your UI for a fingertip.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.590
Still,
there's too many apps that are designing

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.300
for that pixel-precise mouse cursor.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.740
So really think about
designing for the fingertip.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.960
And in the iOS human
interface guidelines,

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.660
we recommend controls to be
a minimum of 44 by 44 points.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.440
And the built-in calculator
app is a great reference

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.020
to follow for this sizing.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:47.010
So the buttons are actually
all wider than 44 points.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.180
There's nice,
adequate spacing between them.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.180
And they're all 44 points tall.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:55.580
And it's not just the built-in calculator
app that we follow this 44-point rule.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.800
It's all throughout iOS.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.140
So if you look at the nav bar,
that's 44 points tall.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.400
If you look at the toolbar,
that's 44 points tall.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.240
Now, the buttons and the glyphs in those
bars are actually smaller than 44 points

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.940
because they need to fit in that space.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.860
But the area that's actually going
to recognize the touch input,

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:18.240
that's 44 points,
and that's really important.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.100
The rows and table views
and group table views,

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.840
they're 44 points.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:31.180
The buttons in popovers on
the iPad are 44 points tall.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.800
Now, this is a bigger device,
but you're still using your finger,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.750
and so you still need to
follow all of these rules.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.400
The controls in FaceTime are 44 points.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.200
So I'm going to stop here.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.540
I'm not going to go through the rest
of iOS and kind of show you everything.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.050
But I really wanted to kind
of drive home this point that,

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.870
you know, go through your app and make
sure you're really paying

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.540
attention to all these details.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.380
Make sure that you're
designing for a fingertip.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.920
If you're designing an app that
is used by different types of

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.150
people or in different scenarios,
you might even need to

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.490
increase the size from there.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.300
Here we're looking at a great app.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.980
This is Strava Cycling.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.310
Strava has this awesome service
for people that ride bicycles where

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.640
they can find different routes that
people are going on and they can

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.720
track their GPS against time and even
compare themselves to other people

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.660
that have done those same routes.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.350
And so when a user uses this app,
they could be wearing bicycle gloves,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.130
they could be kind of tired because
they just got on or got off their bike,

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.860
rather.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.260
And so when they design that start
button that kind of logs the bike

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.240
ride that you're about to go on,
they want way bigger than 44 points.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.310
And so that button is 110 points.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.390
And so think about how your users
are going to be using your app,

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.630
what the scenarios are.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:43.410
Are they young?

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.020
Are they old?

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.720
What are the different demographics
that you need to pay attention to?

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.910
And make sure your controls
are designed for them.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.100
Okay, so that was Tiny Controls.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.300
The next pitfall is hard to read text.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.800
And this is similar to Tiny Controls.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.440
This is another thing I see so often.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.060
And that is just text
that's really hard to read.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.040
Many reasons.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.520
This is another version of what we
could have done with the DubDub app.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.310
Good thing we didn't do this.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.550
But it's got a whole bunch of colors
and typefaces to kind of accentuate

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.210
different types of information.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.880
It's just very visually noisy.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.810
We've got this gradient that's behind
each cell of the table view because we

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.280
wanted to maybe really call attention
to this app and differentiate it.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.140
We wanted to differentiate from
other just standard table views.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.580
But all of these things just
add up to this visually complex

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.960
kind of mess that you see here.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.750
Now, I have seen, to be fair,
a few apps that do a little bit better of

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:36.500
a job with that gradient treatment where
maybe it fits into that background cell.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.300
But you need to be really careful there.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.810
Usually a gradient behind the cell of
the table view creates this weird effect

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.220
when you start scrolling because you
really have this kind of moire effect,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.940
almost like when you're
looking at Venetian lines.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.360
And you get distracted
by the actual background,

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:50.980
the chrome.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.220
Instead of the actual text that's
written in each one of those cells.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.380
So you really want to simplify things.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.440
You also want to make sure
that you're avoiding mixing a

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.510
lot of typefaces in your app.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.370
Because, you know,
the screens aren't that big

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.460
on the iPhone and the iPad.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.220
And it's a really small area of space.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.950
Instead,
use subtle shading and font sizes

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.740
to distinguish the different
types of information that you want

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.160
to kind of present to the user.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.110
So here we're looking at
the Mail app on iOS 6.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.610
And you can kind of see that, you know,
we're using the standard UI kit

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.600
framework for how this gets laid out.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.050
And it really is these subtle
attention to detail around the font

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.530
sizes and the shading that really
helps the user figure out what the

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.710
different pieces of information are.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.660
So the most important piece
of information is the sender

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.180
that gets this nice Helvetica
Noia 17-point bold treatment.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.230
It really stands out.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.340
The next piece of information that a
user might care about is the subject.

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.680
So that still stays a Helvetica Noia.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.180
But now it gets bumped down a
few points on the font size.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.340
Still black.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.340
No longer bold.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.340
And underneath that is
the message preview.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.220
This is kind of a tertiary
piece of information.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.020
Sometimes you read it.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.300
Sometimes you don't really need to to get
to the email message you're looking for.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.340
Still Helvetica Noia.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.340
But it's this light gray 13-point.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.340
And you can see that, you know,
information is laid out nicely.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.480
You still know the different types
of information even with just the

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.300
standard Helvetica Noia typeface.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.300
Now, 13-point is actually the minimum
size I ever recommend you use

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.300
if you're using the system font.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.340
Because anything smaller than 13-point
is just going to be too hard to read.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.180
Users are going to need to
squint or have to bring their

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.310
device closer to their face.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.250
And you don't want to make them do that.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.630
And really,
13-point should only be used for

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.340
tertiary pieces of information.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.340
You know, really, you know, labels or,
you know, something like this.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.330
They're just getting a small preview.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.110
If you need to actually read
-- if the user needs to read

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:37.340
a lot of text in your app,
you need to go bigger from there.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.710
So actually, in mail, when we actually go
display an actual message,

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.340
it's actually 15 points.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.260
So it's much more legible
for line wrapping.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.080
And so if you've got an app where the
user is going to be spending a lot of

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:51.340
time maybe reading a book chapter or
a news article or something like that,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.340
you know,
make sure that it's really legible.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.280
You also want to make sure
that you're aligning text.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.480
And again,
you'll get a lot of these things for

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.600
free if you're using the UI kit layouts.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.020
And the alignment is really
important because it just makes

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.620
using the app a lot faster,
which is really important when

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.140
you've got these utility apps,
your user's trying to get

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.420
a task done on the go.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.890
So when there's that alignment,
it creates this nice grid that creates

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:17.750
that nice line that a user can focus
their eye on and just really quickly

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.780
skim all of the different data.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.910
You also want to do this when you've
got labels in addition to values.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.860
You need to make sure that
you're right aligning the labels

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.940
and left aligning the values.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.960
And what that's going to do, again,
is create that single line for the

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.960
user to kind of look up and down as
they're scrolling or just looking at

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.690
a single screen and find that piece of
information that they're looking for.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.000
I've seen a lot of developers
who aren't using UIKit layouts,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.840
and so what they're doing is just kind of
defaulting and left aligning everything.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.900
And it creates this weird zigzag
pattern across the screen.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.260
You know, there's no grid.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.790
There's nothing that's clean there.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.170
And every user basically has to read
every single line on the screen to find

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.180
what they're actually searching for.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.900
And it's just really slow.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.600
Okay, so that was hard to read text.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.160
The next pitfall is ambiguous alerts.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.620
Oh,
before I actually get to this pitfall,

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.210
I just want to take a minute and really
talk about the importance of testing your

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:16.120
UI on the iPhone and the iPad to actually
avoid some of those previous pitfalls.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:21.380
So a lot of times the reason why
the controls are so small and hard

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:25.880
to tap or the text is hard to read
is because in the design process,

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.020
in the design phase of
the development process,

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:34.370
the person wasn't adequately testing
the actual screen density of their UI.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.850
So, you know,
the iOS simulator is a great tool

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.480
when you're actually developing,
but now there's a lot of actually

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.880
wonderful tools that you can use when
you're actually in the design phase,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.110
before you even start
the development phase.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.930
And so there's a bunch of
apps that basically launch --

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.180
you can use them in your Mac,
and you just -- whatever

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.160
you're looking at,
you can just, you know,

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.300
beam them over to the iPhone or to the
iPad using the same wireless network,

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.920
and that UI will show up over there.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.490
And these types of tools are really
critical when you're building an app

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.760
for the different screen densities
that actually happen on iOS.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.990
And so some of these tools are great.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.870
Live View has been around for a while,
and this just is a really great tool for

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.980
just kind of streaming out over Wi-Fi,
everything that's going on.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.350
You can even kind of see animations
that are happening on your Mac onto

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.450
your actual iPhone or your iPad app.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.470
There's also Scala View now from Bajango.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.520
This is a great tool.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.880
It integrates directly with the
latest versions of Photoshop.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.530
Everything you're doing in
Photoshop actually just shows up on

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.630
your iPad or your iPhone right away.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.720
Great tool.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.820
There's also Xscope
Mirror from the Icon Factory.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.420
Now, the Icon Factory,
as most of you know, they put out great

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.260
utilities for development.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.570
And this tool has all these awesome tools
for just pixel-precise measurements.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:47.320
So you can really kind of take a look,
preview everything that's going on,

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.040
and measure exactly what
might be going wrong.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.670
And there's a new one
that's relatively -- yeah,

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:55.880
it's relatively new on the App Store,
just a few months, I think.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:55.880
And it's called Xscope Mirror.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.940
It's called Screenshots Journal.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.190
This is an iOS-only app.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.040
It doesn't have a Mac companion,
so it's not really for previewing

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.940
exactly what you're working on the Mac.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.170
But this is a tool that basically
extracts all the screenshots that

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.050
you've saved to your camera roll
on your iPhone or iPad and just

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.650
presents them in this nice UI.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.590
And then it lets you zoom in on them.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.930
And when you're zooming in,
it puts this great pixel grid on top of

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:20.920
the magnified UI so you can see exactly
what's going on on the actual device.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.380
So if there's an issue with some aliasing
or maybe a non-retina graphic managed

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.580
to get into the code or into the design,
you can kind of call that out.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.880
Any little kerning issues,
really great utilities.

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.520
And there's actually so many more
utilities that aren't mentioned up here.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.580
There's Silk Screen.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.530
There's Prototyper.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.640
There's a lot that come out,
it seems like, almost every month.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.340
So figure out a tool that
works well for your workflow.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.350
But please,
the most important thing is that you're

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:49.520
actually testing your UI on the actual
device early on in the design process.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:49.850
Okay.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.580
So let's get back to the pitfalls.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:55.880
Now we'll talk about the next pitfall,
which is ambiguous alerts.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:59.050
So, many of you have maybe
seen an alert like this,

00:34:59.050 --> 00:34:59.480
right?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.870
It's got this cryptic error message,
and it's not really helpful at all.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.930
It's just annoying.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.140
What am I supposed to do?

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:05.630
Okay.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:09.520
Or maybe something even worse,
something destructive and scary.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.400
Are you sure you want to
cancel this transaction?

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.530
Okay, or cancel?

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:14.920
What button do I press?

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.370
What's going to happen?

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.070
Again,
you're probably going to quit this app,

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.200
and I don't know what you're going to do,
right?

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.640
So, to help you really avoid some
of these ambiguous alerts,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.290
I want to go through some tips
on how to really effectively

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.070
communicate information in your app.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.260
So,
the first tip is actually just to avoid

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.430
unnecessary alerts whenever possible.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:38.570
So, really try to embed important
information directly into the UI of

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.520
your app where it makes sense.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.440
So, here we're looking at the mail app,
and what we do in the mail app is

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.570
we actually show the last time that
we were able to hit the mail server.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.250
And so, that actually gives the user
an idea of what's going on.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:52.660
And so, that's really important.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.840
And this way,
we don't need to throw up an annoying

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.380
alert every time the cellular network
loses connection or anything like that.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.990
It's just, okay,
that's the last time I got my mail.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.300
And, you know,
really try to think about in your app,

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.950
what's the important information
that you were maybe thinking

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.400
of just putting into an alert,
and think about how to embed

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.740
that directly into the UI.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.430
You want to make sure that
you're using appropriate labels.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.700
So label buttons by
their resulting actions.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.640
Resist the temptation to just use
OK and Cancel or Yes and No on

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.900
all of your buttons in the alerts.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.220
Those are just not that helpful.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.620
Usually when you see OK and Cancel,
you have to kind of map

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.040
what OK is going to do.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.190
And so you have to read the text,
and you have to be very

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.370
clear with the question.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.740
Well, with software, of course,
you can put whatever label you

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.440
want on any different button and
really take advantage of that.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.490
Here we're looking at the alerts
that you get from the reminders.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.090
And you can see that the buttons
are labeled Close and View.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.610
Remember,
alerts are just kind of jarring to users.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.020
They kind of come out of nowhere.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.230
It's this surprising thing.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.780
And they may be doing another task.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.090
They may be showing their
phone to somebody else,

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.200
some photos, or browsing the web.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.310
They might just really quickly
want to dismiss that alert.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.690
And so having these buttons clearly
labeled Close and View just leaves

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.390
any of that ambiguity out of there.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.110
Make sure that you're putting the
affirmative button on the right.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:17.740
So on iOS and OS X,
we've always had cancel on the left and

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.250
the affirmative button on the right.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.520
And this is really important.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.660
There's a lot of apps out there
that are kind of following

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.860
the Microsoft convention.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.150
They're putting okay on the left and
they're putting cancel on the right.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.210
And what that does is it kind of
messes with people's muscle memory.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.290
So maybe one of these alerts kind
of comes up and a user just really

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.480
quickly wants to dismiss it and
they'll tap that button on the right

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.880
and now it's no longer the okay
button or the affirmative button.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.150
It's now the cancel button and they may
have done something pretty destructive.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.450
So really make sure you're following
iOS conventions so that users can

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.110
take advantage of what they've
learned throughout the platform.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:39:05.600
[Transcript missing]

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.540
Okay, so that was ambiguous alerts.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.200
The next pitfall is out
of place terminology.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:13.830
And this is similar.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.940
Again, language is something that's
so critical in an app.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.680
So you want to make sure that
you're really using language

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.120
that makes sense for people.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.250
Remember that most users actually
don't care about the technology

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.850
that you've built into your app.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.100
They care about getting
something done or having fun.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.550
They care about using it.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.370
They don't care that you've adopted
this technology or all the cool stuff

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.240
that you and I get excited about.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.550
They just want to get their stuff done.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.740
So here we're looking at what we
could have done with the Settings app.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.540
Here we're looking at Settings in iOS 6.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.260
And you can kind of see that if we
maybe just didn't spend any time

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.130
on coming up with good language,
we could have gone with these terms.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.460
Cellular baseband.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.040
What does that mean?

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.070
Turn that on and off.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.860
Or other things.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.150
System alerts or other alerts.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:57.980
What's the difference?

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.200
Right?

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.000
It would be kind of just confusing.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.740
Bluetooth LA.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.300
Who cares?

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.550
That's the technology.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.560
Doesn't really matter.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.700
When you compare that to the
actual terms that we've used,

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.480
it's actually all stuff
that's very user-centric.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:13.800
You know, do not disturb, airplane mode,
notifications,

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.940
things that actually a normal user
that has no technical ability can

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:18.600
kind of make assumptions about.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.800
Oh, I think I probably know
what's in that settings area.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.980
So really spend a lot of time
on the language in your app.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.540
And we do this, again,
throughout the platform.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.930
In Maps, we talk about dropping a pin.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.200
This isn't add GPS indicator
to mapping location.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.140
You know, it's just drop a pin.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.000
we describe what's going on in the actual
interface and make sense to people.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:44.240
An important thing is throughout iOS,
we abstract the underlying file system.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.990
This is a new world with iOS.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.020
So we don't talk about files.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.360
We talk about listening to music or
watching videos or viewing photos.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.630
And when we do need to kind of reference
more of the typical file type of formats

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:02.390
in our apps such as numbers from iWork,
we talk about them exactly as they are.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.380
Again,
we just talk about these as spreadsheets.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:09.010
You won't see a command in numbers
such as new untitled dot numbers

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.400
or XLS or anything like that.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.400
It's just exactly describing the
content that the user is working on,

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.090
the actual document.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.460
Okay, so that's out of place terminology.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:25.020
The next pitfall, excessive branding.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.460
So this is something that I see
a lot from a lot of developers

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.600
that have just come from the web,
and that is you see logos everywhere.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.610
So let's say we're looking
at the DubDub app again,

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:38.360
and here you can kind of see
that we're excited about WWDC.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.200
We all know that you are as well.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.630
So let's put that logo on
every single screen in our app.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.700
Get everyone excited.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.840
They'll really know that
they're in this app.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.500
Well, that's really annoying.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.500
You don't want to do that.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.640
Remember that the reason why logos
are at the top of every web page

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.000
is because users kind of need a
way to get back to the home page,

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.960
and they may have done a search
and kind of landed at some

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.820
page deep into your website.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.290
And so by having that logo,
it just kind of identifies

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:06.140
to the user where they are,
where they've kind of landed.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.830
But on iOS, that's not the case at all.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:15.450
They've launched your app using the
actual app icon or by using Siri.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:19.300
And so they know what app you're in.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.600
Use the tips that I just went over
for the app icon section to really

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.230
make a great branding statement there.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.100
Within your app,
the best branding that you can

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.910
have is just having a streamlined
user experience where users are

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:32.070
able to accomplish their tasks.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.480
So it's much better to actually label
the screens -- label the navigation

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.900
bar by the screens that they're at.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.710
And this is really helpful if
an app has deep hierarchy and

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:44.310
there's lots of levels that a user
is going to be going up and down,

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.100
or if there's a lot of screens
in an app that kind of look

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.100
very familiar to the user.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.100
And so that's really important.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:51.960
And so that label is really going
to let them -- help them identify

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.760
exactly where they are in the UI.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.560
Okay, so that was excessive branding.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.520
The next pitfall is
uninformative back buttons.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.470
And like excessive branding,
this is a pitfall that is actually,

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:06.440
you know, very common from developers
coming from the Web.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.110
And so uninformative back
buttons are -- you know,

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.010
you can recognize them by that
back button that's actually

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.760
just labeled "back." Now that's
not a helpful label at all.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.520
Everybody knows that that button in
the upper left corner that's shaped,

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.900
you know, pointed to the left,
that's going to take them back

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.470
one level in the hierarchy.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.840
And so if you just use
the word "back," you know,

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.760
you're not adding any
value to that label.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.900
So you really want to label
these by the screen that they're

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.800
going back to appropriately.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.760
Even if the UI -- the label of the
screen won't fit into that back button,

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.530
you need to truncate,
that's still way more helpful than

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:40.460
just the word "back." So really
label these appropriately.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.340
Again, this is kind of a metaphor
that's come from the Web.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.290
In a Web browser,
the back button always means show

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.700
me the last page I was looking at.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.590
And so you can tap that and you always
know you're going to get back there.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.100
On iOS, it's actually slightly different
because it's not going to be the

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.980
last page you're going to see on
the screen that I was looking at.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.080
It is taking me back up
one level in the hierarchy,

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.160
but, you know,
maybe a modal sheet or something

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.300
else could have come up in between,
you know, me landing on this screen.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.700
And so that back isn't actually
going to take me just back.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.690
So it's much more helpful to actually
label this by where it actually goes.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:16.160
Okay, so the next pitfall:
confusing animations.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:20.390
So I've talked a lot about animations
in some of my previous talks at

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.600
WWC and some of the videos that
you can get on the developer website.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:24.790
And, you know, it's important.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.560
Animations is one of the
things that really sets iOS

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.300
apart from other platforms.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.860
We use animations all over the place
to make the experience more engaging,

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.600
more intuitive, just, you know,
a lot more fun.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.660
But you need to be careful with
animations that you're not distracting

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:41.060
from the core user experience,
from the core task that

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:42.590
a user is actually doing.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.740
And so you really need to be
careful about how you implement

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.600
animations into your app.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:49.560
You're all familiar with the weather app.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.930
This is what it looks like and
what happens when you actually

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.240
tap on that info button.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.760
It kind of flips the weather card around.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.680
And so right away that animation
kind of has introduced this concept

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.440
to the user that this is a card and
on the other side are the settings.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.440
Now, if I was to press that done button,
I'd expect that card to flip back over,

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.000
have a very symmetrical animation,
and it would make sense.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.860
But there's a lot of apps
that actually don't do that.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.920
They do something weird, you know,
so they don't finish it off.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.520
And so maybe it flips
over and then slides away.

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.800
And again,
it's one of these things just like

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.940
with alerts and language that a
user is not going to necessarily

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.410
be able to point out and say,
okay,

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:26.190
this app was really confusing because
they didn't have symmetrical animations.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.900
No, they're just going to say,
I don't know, it felt weird.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.840
It was hard to use.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.740
I didn't know what was going on.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.940
It was confusing.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.160
So really make sure you've
got symmetrical animations.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.990
Make sure you're also following, again,
standard conventions.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:41.000
I've seen a lot of apps on the
App Store that aren't using UIKit.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.900
They're kind of doing their own formats.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.900
They're using the same
formats for whatever reason.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.400
And they're trying to mimic a
lot of our built-in animations.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.920
But they're not going the full
distance and either implementing

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.230
them right or they're trying to get
creative to differentiate themselves.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.690
They've ended up creating
something that does differentiate

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.160
themselves but not in a good way.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.930
So when you tap on the cell, instead of,
you know, pushing everything over,

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.480
maybe it slides on top.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.340
And again,
these animations are introducing

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.900
these physical concepts to the user.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:10.490
So now the user thinks that possibly
all these levels of the hierarchy

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.860
are stacked on top of each other.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.850
So you can't just say,
can I just press the back button

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.060
or can I just swipe anywhere on
the screen to get back because

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:17.860
everything's stacked on top?

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.850
You just don't want to leave any of
these questions into the user's mind.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.860
You know, really stick with
animations that make sense.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.820
And wherever possible, just when you're
creating your animations,

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.350
just really think about the
physics of real physical objects.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.330
That's what we do when we're
building our animations in iOS.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:40.290
Okay, so the next pitfall and the last
one is inappropriate styling.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.320
And so what I mean by inappropriate
styling are just apps that have a visual

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:48.670
design that's just not appropriate for
the type of app or the type of content

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:51.930
that the user is kind of consuming.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.880
So I want to show you a
screenshot of what we could

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.310
have done with the Photos app.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:58.310
And instead of that black background
that you're used to seeing,

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.900
I've put it on this really
nice-looking wood texture.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.980
And I think when you look at it,
it actually looks okay.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.850
It works well.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.000
Maybe the photo,
the piles of photos looks like

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.720
it's on this antique desk.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:12.100
But as you kind of look at it more
and more now that it's been up on

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:15.670
the screen for a few more seconds,
you can kind of see that what's happening

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:19.840
is the background is actually way
stronger visually than the actual photos.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:27.180
You're taking all the kind of, you know,
the visual -- you're taking the attention

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.940
to the actual background instead of
the content that the user cares about.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.850
And when you compare this
to the black background,

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.400
which is much simpler,
you can see that the user

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.960
just really pops the photos.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.720
It makes the photos center stage.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:41.050
And it lets the user easily identify
what's in each of those different piles.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.770
So it's not only, you know,
better looking,

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.780
but it's also more effective.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.510
So a really great tip for thinking
about the visual style of your

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:51.120
app is to really think about
the type of app you're building.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:54.410
And I kind of show this graph a bunch,
which is put entertainment on one

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.250
side and utility on the other.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.600
And think about where your
app falls on this axis.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.390
Because if you figure out
where your app belongs,

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.090
you'll be able to define some key
characteristics that you can apply.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.560
It's the visual styling of your app.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.790
So entertainment apps,
they need to be highly visual, fun,

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.580
and immersive.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:15.730
But on the other side of the spectrum,
on utility apps, they need to be useful,

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.920
efficient, and reliable.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.700
And so to show you an example
of each of these apps,

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.520
I just kind of want to actually
go to the app store and show you.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.260
Here's Bjork's Biophilia.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.810
This is an amazing app in
the entertainment side.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.620
Bjork built this app as part
of her latest album as a

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.160
universal iPhone and iPad app.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.160
And it's an amazing
audio/visual experience.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.880
You're not hearing the sound, of course,
right now.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.840
But when you kind of go in,
you're just kind of

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.960
floating in this 3D galaxy,
and you get all these stars,

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.700
and it's very kind of just experimental.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.380
And this is actually
the navigation system.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.840
So you're floating around
these constellations.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.240
When you tap on any one of
those brightly colored stars,

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.910
you kind of dive in right into one
of the songs or video game type

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.970
of experiences that she's created.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.720
And in each of these
different interactions,

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.980
there's all these things
that you can discover,

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.160
just tapping or swiping.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.780
Or using the accelerometer,
depending on the interaction.

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:10.860
So a big part of this app is just
discovery and figuring out and being

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:15.390
delighted when you discover this cool
new interaction that they've built in.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:18.060
And that works really well
because this is really

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.140
definitely an entertainment app.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.740
Now imagine this type of UI on the
other side of the spectrum with

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:26.020
a hardcore utility app like mail.

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:29.520
How frustrating it would be if your
messages were floating in space and

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.160
you kind of had to discover things.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.970
You know, where's the reply button?

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.560
If I swipe here or turn --
That would just be ridiculous.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.090
With mail, users don't really care about
spending a lot of time and kind

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:41.660
of having a lot of fun with mail.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.940
Maybe they do,
but most of the time they just want to

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.720
read their messages and kind of move on.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.610
Utility tasks are something that
users want to get in and out

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.060
of pretty quickly so they can
get to their entertainment apps.

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.910
So you want to really design
a streamlined workflow that

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.500
really is reliable for them.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.700
They know where the buttons are.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.350
They're using the standard UI kit
Chrome and everything that a user

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.690
has kind of learned from iOS.

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:06.920
There are some apps that are somewhere
in between entertainment and utility.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.240
So GarageBand is a great example.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.230
So in these types of apps
where you've got a hybrid app,

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.440
apply the characteristics to the parts
of the screen where it makes sense.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.850
So the instrumentation
screen is really visual.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.290
It's fun.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.040
It's immersive.

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.500
And you can spend a lot of time
just playing the drums or the

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.500
guitars or the different keyboards.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.440
You can really lose
yourself in that task.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.250
But on the other side,
when you go to actually mix a song,

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.780
it's a completely different type of UI.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.850
The graphics are still
really nice looking.

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.070
But this is a screen that's
been designed around efficiency.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.350
So you can mix your song
as fast as possible.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.770
And if you're familiar
with GarageBand on the Mac,

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:43.060
it's a very reliable UI.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.200
It's something that you're
familiar with from that experience.

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.100
We've done the same thing
with iMovie as well.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.590
This is another app that's kind
of in between on that spectrum.

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:53.300
So when you launch the app,
it's this fun experience.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.550
You get the movie posters from all
the different things you've created.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:58.340
There's a nice animation
for the neon sign.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.030
And you get the sound of
everything flickering on.

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.080
You know, really fun,
immersive experience.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.420
But, again,
when you go to actually edit a movie,

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.380
the UI is completely different.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.840
It's all designed around efficiency.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:13.090
We could have continued this metaphor
of this movie theater and just taken

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:14.570
it into the actual editing area.

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:17.520
Maybe we would have, you know,
celluloid splices and a linear

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.610
editing machine that you'd be
kind of pressing buttons on.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.660
But that really would have gotten in
the way of actually editing a movie.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.560
The fun part of iMovie is actually
sharing movies with your friends through

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.390
e-mail or uploading them to YouTube.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.880
It's not actually editing the movie.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.830
So you don't want to necessarily
spend a lot of time in that area.

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.060
Think about these different
types of characteristics,

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:42.360
apply these to the screens where it makes
sense or to the whole app if your app is

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.740
on one side of the spectrum or the other.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:48.130
The other thing that you want to focus on
when you're designing the style and the

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:50.740
visual design of your app is the content.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.120
You want to make sure that you're
really using realism where it's

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.730
appropriate and that you're always
highlighting the content in your app.

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.740
Here we're looking at
the built-in compass app.

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.740
This is an app that doesn't
actually have a lot of content.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.740
It's actually great that we use realism.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.740
We have this wood.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.370
It's only a single number,
the direction and the latitude and

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:07.740
longitude that you're looking at.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.740
By actually designing in this realism,
that great brass and the wood,

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.990
it actually gives the user a sense
of how to use this app because

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:15.740
they just put it in their hand
and they move their phone around.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.740
It works.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:21.560
It's a lot more memorable
than just a number that would

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.240
just show up on the screen.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:26.800
Here's an app called Etude
from Steinway and Son.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.250
This is an app that's a metronome,
and so you can use it when

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:30.700
you're practicing the piano.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.980
And as you can see,
there's just a single number,

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:36.310
and so they really used realism to
kind of create this expensive-looking

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.320
tool that would fit right at home
on a Steinway and Son's piano.

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.810
Here's Thermo from Robocat.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.600
This is an app that's really fun.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:49.100
You launch it, the mercury kind of
animates up the thermometer,

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:52.200
and you can see what the current
temperature is at the location

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.900
that you're at based on your GPS.

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:56.380
Again, just a single number,
not a lot of data,

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:59.140
and so they really focused on the visual,
the background, the chrome.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:01.960
Essentially, with all of these apps,
they've turned the content into

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:06.020
the chrome itself because there's
not a lot of data coming out there.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.430
Here we're looking at
a screenshot from DM1,

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.200
the drum machine.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.200
This is one of the apps that won one
of those design awards on Monday.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.870
And this is an app that does actually
have more data than some of the

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.170
other ones that I just showed you,
but this data is actually static.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.820
It's not moving around all the
time like mail where things

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.200
are constantly changing.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:24.200
And all the content is
also text here as well.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.190
There's not photos and
videos that are static.

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.200
It's text.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.220
And so by using the graphics,
they're able to really create

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.030
this memorable experience,
and it looks like a real drum machine.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.020
It's a gorgeous app.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.200
If you haven't seen
this on a Retina iPad,

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.200
I highly recommend you download it.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.200
It is really beautiful.

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:43.730
And here we're looking
at the Voice Memos app.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.800
This is the built-in microphone
that you are all familiar with.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.600
Again, not a lot of data,
just the audio input,

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.340
and so we've turned that
into an analog meter.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.420
But actually,
when you go to actually access a voice

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:59.560
memo that you've created or saved,
the UI is completely different, right?

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.580
We don't have this continuation
of this studio metaphor to access

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.220
your different voice memos.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.490
We don't make the user put in eight
tracks or press chunky Chrome buttons

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.140
because that would get really
frustrating when you've got a

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:13.300
lot of voice memos saved in there and
you're trying to find exactly the one

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.890
that you created at a certain time.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.040
And so, again,
just like I talked about applying the

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.220
different characteristics to the type
of entertainment or utility apps,

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:23.360
you want to do the same thing with the
type of content that you have and make

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.380
sure that you're really paying attention
to the information density of your app.

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.610
OK, so I really want to stress the
importance of making sure that you've

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:33.310
got an appropriate style for your app.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.920
Don't just look at any other app that
you think is beautiful and just apply

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.200
those characteristics to your app.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:41.330
Really think about what
makes sense for your users.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.240
Okay, so that was the last pitfall.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.650
And there's so much to cover in UI design
and the human interface guidelines

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:53.480
actually goes into way more detail about
all the topics that I just talked about.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.000
It's a great resource.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.880
This is a photo that a developer sent
me of their human interface guidelines.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.110
And I love this photo because it really
shows how I imagine all HIGs should look.

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:05.640
It's used, it's printed up,
it's bookmarked.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.330
And it's actually very reminiscent of
the HIG that you would see if you're

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:11.980
walking around the offices in Cupertino.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.800
Because all of our developers
and designers are also constantly

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.700
referencing this document.

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.560
Okay, so before I wrap up,
I just want to leave you

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.640
with some final thoughts.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.780
So like I said earlier,
there's a lot of information

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.980
that's come up this week.

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:32.110
I hope you've had a chance to
learn all the greatest new tips

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:36.410
and tricks to really get your
apps kind of performing better,

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:40.060
to make all the technology
just feel wonderful.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:44.320
And we've put a lot of work into
our platform to make it really

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.300
easy for you to build apps.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.420
And so you'll hear from a lot of
people this week and a lot of just

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.960
people when you're talking about
iOS in general after this week that,

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.300
you know,
designing an iPhone or an iPad app,

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.450
it's really easy.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.700
It's an easy thing to do.

00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:58.780
And that's true.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.210
We think it is the easiest
platform to design an app for.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:06.820
But the truth is designing a
great app is extremely difficult.

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.300
And the reason why designing a
great app is extremely difficult.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:14.010
It's not because of some of the
stuff that we've covered this week.

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:16.720
It's not about, you know,
the coding techniques or the different

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.360
APIs or the different frameworks.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:22.260
It's not even about most of the different
UI tips that I've gone through today

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:26.320
or all the great resources that we
have in the human interface guidelines.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.090
The reason designing a great app
is hard is because of all those

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.970
different decisions you're going
to need to make throughout the

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:35.610
process and getting agreement by the
different team members that you have.

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:40.060
And so you really want to make sure
that you're spending all of your time.

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:41.850
Focusing your efforts.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.070
You want to determine just the essential
features in your app and really spend all

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:48.470
of your time just polishing those bits.

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.100
When you try to do too
many things in your app,

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:54.000
you're just not going to
set yourself up for success.

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:58.130
Now, I can't think of any app on the app
store that is successful because it's

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:00.440
got more features than everybody else.

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.740
But I can think of the
most successful apps.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.800
And when I look at them,
it's because they made the hard decisions

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.730
about what features not to include,
which users that aren't

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:09.860
as important to them.

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.580
They're the apps that really do one or
two things better than everybody else.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.400
And if you're able to do that,
if you're able to have just one

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.750
thing or two things that are better
than every other app in that space,

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:23.620
you're going to really set
yourself up for success.

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:26.800
And then you'll be able to
build on that and add some of

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.920
those features in app updates.

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.200
Okay, so here's my email.

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:34.520
Please get in contact with
me if you've got specific

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.300
questions on the UI of your app.

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:40.140
And always constantly reference
the human interface guidelines.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.200
Thank you very much.
