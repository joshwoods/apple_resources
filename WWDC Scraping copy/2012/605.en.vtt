WEBVTT

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.040
All right.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.150
So my name is Scott Stevenson.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.400
I'm a software engineer on iAd Producer.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.490
And I'm -- we've been working really
hard to do some really great stuff,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.350
and I'm thrilled to show it to you today.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.370
So let's get right into it.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
So when we start out today,
I want to talk about a story.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.110
And this story is about you.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.130
And maybe right now you're working
on a mobile website or a desktop

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.660
website or maybe mobile advertising.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.940
And you might be working with jQuery or
Prototype or maybe some Flash content.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.240
And you're going along every day
kind of building up your skills.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.510
And one day your boss comes
into your office and says,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.900
hey, I've got some great news.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.110
We've just started this new project
that I want you to start on right away.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.050
And we're going to be building an iAd.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.350
So two things might go through
your mind at this point.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.410
First, you're thinking, wow,
this is really cool.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.990
I've seen these iAds,
and they're highly interactive,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.300
very animated, really using cutting-edge
WebKit technology.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.910
But the other thing that
might occur to you is,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.790
you know,
maybe I don't know how to build an iAd.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.750
So you might be thinking, well, you know,
am I going to have time to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.270
figure out how to build an iAd?

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.380
I might have to read some documentation,
and you might be a little concerned.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.240
Am I going to have time to learn it and
then also make the ad I need to make?

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.720
So what I want to tell you is
that by the end of the talk,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.820
two things.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.350
One, you're going to realize that
you absolutely can do this.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.940
And the reason is that iAd is
built on concepts and standards

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.390
that you're already familiar with,
such as HTML5 and CSS.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.040
And the other thing is that iAd Producer,
I'm going to have convinced you that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.410
not only is it really easy to use,
but you're going to be eager to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.070
go download it and give it a try
because it's a lot of fun to use.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.430
And we're going to show you how it works.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.690
by looking at what an IAD is.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.190
And as I mentioned before, iAds are rich,
interactive ads.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.820
And this is maybe a little bit different
than what you might see on a website,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.570
for example.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.600
If you see sort of a static banner
image on a website and you tap on it,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.240
you're sort of tossed out
to the advertiser's website.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.760
And iAds are different.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.430
So really what we're trying to
do here is we're trying to apply

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.060
the same level of quality that
we have for iPhones and iPads,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.820
which are best-of-class devices,
and we want to apply that to advertising.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.760
So we really want to make the best
possible experience for the user for ads.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.420
And here on the screen,
you can see an example of this.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.100
This is one of our sample ads
called Space Tours to Mars.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.240
And it really pushes the edges of what
you can do with WebKit and what you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.020
can do with iAds and iAd Producer.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.880
And as I say,
it's all built on WebKit technologies.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.060
And really, iAds are like mini-websites.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.940
So again,
where many advertisements on websites,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.600
you might tap on them and
you're sort of tossed out,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.370
and that's the end of your
experience with the ad,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.280
iAds are really immersive.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.540
And you're in them for a while,
and as you can see on the screen,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.520
you're looking through, playing games,
looking at different images.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.980
looking at different images.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.220
So it's really,
it's a comprehensive experience.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.210
And the other thing that's
really important about iAds

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.520
and sort of a differentiating
factor is that when you tap,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.620
when the user taps on an iAd
at the bottom of the app,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.380
they're not taken out of their app.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.060
They're not, you know,
tossed out of context.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.540
Whenever they're done with the iAd,
they hit the close button and they're

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.090
dropped right back into where they were.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.670
So it's a really great,
fluid user experience.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.680
And just to, let's take a quick
look at what an iAd is.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.220
At the bottom, of course, we have WebKit,
which is powering this whole engine.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.200
And on top of that,
we have this framework called iAd JS.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.200
And iAd JS is a really,
really fantastic JavaScript framework.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.480
It's built on some of
the concepts in UIKit,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.590
which is the framework used
to build native iPhone apps.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.690
And a lot of those concepts have
been sort of applied to JavaScript.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.910
And on top of iAd JS,
we have iAd Producer.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.220
So iAd Producer,
a couple things that you should know just

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.670
right off the bat about iAd Producer,
it's designed to be an expert ad creator,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.860
iAd creator.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.830
And we've invested a lot of time in
sort of adding all the functionality

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.400
that you'll need to make a
really great iAd and performance

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.480
tuning the ads that we generate.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.610
And we think you'll really
be pleased with the results.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.070
And we've also gone above and
beyond and tried to make the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.730
experience such that you're,
realizing there's a

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.960
lot of really built-in,
fantastic features, built-in magic.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.400
And we refer to this
as magic for magicians.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.490
So,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.030
When you start playing
around with the app,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.600
you realize, wow, there's some really
fantastic animation features,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.030
some really mind-blowing results.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.760
But the thing I want to emphasize
here is that you're not locked into

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.360
the features that we've provided.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.170
And that's what I mean
by magic for magicians.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.840
If you're an expert, if you know CSS,
if you know WebKit,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.320
you can just extend what we've provided
and sort of make it even better.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.590
And the last thing I want to
emphasize here is that iAd

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.630
Producer is really designed to
be a full-cycle development tool.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.260
So what that means is it can
help you through the entire

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.620
process of the initial concepts,
the prototyping,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.560
getting things onto the screen,
adding animations,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.840
customizing some of that stuff,
and then performance tuning

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.900
and ultimately deployment.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.870
So it's really designed to
help you through the entire

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.140
process from start to finish.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.500
So that's a look at what
iAd Producer is providing.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.590
Let's look at what some of the
features are that deliver this.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.920
So the first thing you'll notice
when you launch iAd Producer is

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.920
that it feels very familiar.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.460
And the reason is we've based it on
a lot of the same concepts of other

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.750
Apple apps that you're familiar with.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.410
So you're going to sit right
down and start a new project,

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.410
and you're going to kind of
instinctively know what to do.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.790
In addition to being really easy to use,
we've made it really easy to

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.460
get really fantastic results.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.580
So it's not just sort of
the essentials are easy,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.830
it's that the really great
stuff is easy as well.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.920
And we realized that once you've added
some of the objects from the object

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.190
library and you've added animations,
you may want to go a bit beyond and add

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.290
some custom animations or custom logic,
and we make that really easy as well.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.830
So here's a screenshot of iAd Producer.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.070
It's showing again our sample
space tours to Mars ad,

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.300
which you can open for
yourself and look at.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.370
And here's a screenshot
of the animation feature,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.810
which I personally think is one of
the best features of the application.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.680
It's really fantastic.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.550
If you've worked with
WebKit animations before,

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.410
the results are great,
but you really have to know

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.450
JavaScript really well.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.420
And if you're using iAd Producer,
we just sort of do the hard work for you.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.660
There's also an event system
that we'll be talking about and

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.400
Chi Wa will be demoing for you.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.310
We have a comprehensive object library,
so a lot of the things

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.840
that you would need,
we just sort of have ready

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.940
right out of the box.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.930
Some other handy things,
an object list which shows you

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.930
all the objects on your page.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.600
And finally, we have an analytics editor,
the screenshot you see here.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.980
And this is important because
it allows you to easily add the

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.390
required analytics to your ad so
that advertisers can understand how

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.040
the ad is performing on the network.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.700
So that's a bit about
the built-in features.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.530
And as I said,
we realize that you will want

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.820
to customize ads very often.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.880
To do that,
you would use the iAd JS framework

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.960
sort of as your basis.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.100
That's the way that you can easily
add new behavior and new content

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.190
to your ad programmatically.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.250
You can also add custom CSS styles
and custom CSS keyframes.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.730
So again,
we have a fantastic animation system

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.410
that is really super easy to use,
but if you're one of those magicians,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.120
you're able to add your own animations
just by importing a CSS file.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.310
And we provide a code editor built into
iAd Producer so that you can just sort of

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.660
jump right in and edit the stuff in line.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.570
However,
if you have an editor you really like,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.210
you are more than
welcome to use that one,

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.050
and we'll just bring the content
back in when you're done editing it.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.490
In addition to the main iAd
Producer app on the Mac,

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.360
we also have a companion
iOS app called iAd Tester.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.330
And the most important role that
iAd Tester is fulfilling is that

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.230
it's allowing you to test the
ad live on an actual iOS device.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.900
And this is really important
because as you're testing the ad,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.910
as you're working on it
on your high-end laptop,

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.730
high-end desktop,
obviously the performance characteristics

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.350
are a little bit different with a machine
like that compared to a mobile device.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.140
Mobile devices have more constrained
resources because they're handheld.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.100
In addition to testing
the ad on the iOS device,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.140
you can also use iAd
Tester in the simulator,

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.880
which is really great if you're making
a bunch of sort of quick changes and

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.790
you don't necessarily want to go back
to your iOS device every single time.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.090
And in both cases,
whether you're using iAdTester on

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.600
an iOS device or on a simulator,
you can use our built-in

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.640
remote web inspector.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.970
And this is great because it helps
you understand sort of how the ad is

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.440
performing in real-world circumstances.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.140
So that's sort of a high-level
overview of the features.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.240
Let's choose one particular set of
features here that's really interesting.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.020
It's the animation system and
the built-in object library.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.490
Let's look a little bit closer at that.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.640
And what we're aiming for here
is that you're going to start,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.740
you're going to sit down at iAd
Producer and you're going to

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.920
start adding images and animate,
excuse me,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.320
objects and animations to your page.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.060
And we want you to walk away
with the impression that you can

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.190
make world-class rich media ads
without having to write code.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.120
It doesn't mean you're
not allowed to write code.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.740
It doesn't mean that you
would never write code.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.190
It's that you don't need that
to see really great results.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.100
If you have something
custom you want to add,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.480
you're welcome to write code.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.300
So let's start by looking at actions,
and when I talk about animations,

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.350
really I'm talking about
actions and actions are broken

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.730
into two separate categories.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.730
First category,
our visual animation effects.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.110
As you see on the screen here,
this is the spaceship flying

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.280
around and spinning out.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.600
So a lot of these things would
be like rotations and fades,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.160
drop effects, that kind of thing.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.300
And then we have a second
category of actions that we

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.820
think of as functional actions.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.580
And on the screen here,
you can see we've used an action to set

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.080
to allow the user to set the current
image as their iOS device wallpaper.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.920
And the great thing about
this is that you're basically

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.800
adding interaction to your ad,
again, without having to write any code.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.000
We've done all the hard work for you.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:47.910
This is really, really great.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.900
In addition to one-off actions,
sort of animations and

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.000
functional actions,
we also have a concept

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.500
called action lists.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.230
And the way to think of action
lists is they're precisely

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.770
timed groups of actions.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.940
So a really good example of
this is if you want to do a page

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.720
build-in or a page build-out,
you would create an action list that

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.410
has all those individual animations
and you can time them all together so

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:13.570
they look really smooth when you're
transitioning from one page to another.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.700
And just to sort of put your mind at ease
if you're looking at this and saying,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.450
ooh, what if this isn't doing
exactly what I need?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.060
If you create an action list,
you actually have the capability

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.270
using iAd JS to control the
action list in JavaScript.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.740
So again, we allow plenty of
room for customization.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.850
Now you might be thinking, okay,
this animation system is great,

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.720
these actions are great,
but how do I launch these things?

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.360
What do I have to do to actually
get these things running?

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.640
Well, we thought of that,
and we added a convention in

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.950
here in iProducer called Events.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.250
If you're familiar
with JavaScript events,

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.420
the concept is very similar.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.800
We added a few things on top just
to make it more convenient and make

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.920
it integrate better with iProducer.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.020
But essentially the system that we're
offering here is like code-free coding.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.730
So remember before when I showed the
wallpaper and the user tapping the

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.940
button and set the user's wallpaper?

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.300
Well, that's what's going on
here with the event system.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.100
So in this particular screenshot,
I have an example of when this

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.510
user event touch up inside,
which is the UIKit parlance

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.920
for the user's tap the button.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.900
I've decided on touch up inside,
I want to play a video,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.780
and you're off and running.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.530
And you can also start individual
actions or you can start entire

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.750
action lists based on user events.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.410
And if for some reason you don't
see the exact action you want or

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.200
you don't have an action list sort
of situation that you want to use,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.360
you also can use an event to
just launch arbitrary JavaScript.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.200
So at that point,
the doors are just kind of

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.650
blown off in this feature,
and you can do whatever you need

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.920
to do based on a user event.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.990
So, of course,
actions and animations wouldn't

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.960
be really useful if you didn't
have anything on a page.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.510
So we have a built-in object library
that has a lot of content that you

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.310
would need right out of the box.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.020
And it works really, really well.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.810
And we've divided conceptually the object
library up into four major categories.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.730
The first, of course, is the essentials.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.600
And these would be like buttons
and text fields and sliders,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.000
all those things that you
just know you're going to need

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.760
just sort of as a foundation.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.610
In addition to that,
we have a whole set of media views.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.130
So,
if you're playing back video and audio,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.680
this is great because you don't
have to worry about which version

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.640
of Safari the user is running.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.850
We handle all those details for
you and make sure everything's

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.260
buffered and all that kind of stuff.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.540
So it's really, really easy to use.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.360
We also have a set of views
that are collection views.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.990
So a really good example of this is
if you have a series of movie posters

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.180
that you want to show to the user,
perhaps to let them set their

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.240
background image for one of them.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.480
The collection view will allow you to
see the background image of the user.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.500
So you can see the
background image of the user.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.460
And then you can also use the
collection view to just sort of

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.540
dump in a bunch of images and
swipe through them and very easy to

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.860
display a large amount of content.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.980
The fourth category is this category we
kind of think of as specialized views.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.860
And a really great example
of this is our WebGL view.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.470
If you haven't seen WebGL before,
the results are fantastic.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.670
It's a 3D model inside of a web view.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.080
And it's really, really impressive.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.230
But the catch is that typically,
if you're using WebGL content,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.770
you have to be an OpenGL programmer
and you have to know JavaScript.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.650
So typically, it's really,
really easy to use.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:11.720
So if you're using WebGL content,
you have to be an OpenGL programmer

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:11.860
and you have to know JavaScript.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.400
So typically, it's really,
really easy to use.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.040
It's pretty hard to get up
and running with this stuff,

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.380
but we've made it really easy.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.580
All you have to do is open the object
library and drag in WebGL view,

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.200
then add your 3D model
and it will just work.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.290
It's fantastic.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.820
So this is the email I got this morning.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.230
So this gives you a preview of the
app that I'm going to build here.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.190
And I already have iProducer installed.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.160
You can download it from
developer.apple.com.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.200
Let me double click to launch.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.460
So on the welcome screen,
you'll be asked to choose either.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.660
iPhone or iPad.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.530
I'm going to choose an
iPad for this project.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.400
But the technique I'm going
to show you is going to work

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.650
as well on an iPhone project.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.640
So what you're seeing here
is an overview of an iAd.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.690
On this side,
you see a banner placeholder.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.550
When a user clicks on a banner,
they will be lead to a splash page where

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.740
they will see a quick introduction.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.830
And then after that,
they will be automatically

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.560
guided to the menu page.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.740
From there,
they could explore one of the pages here.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.780
So like what Scott mentioned earlier,
an iAd is kind of like a mini website.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.930
So before I get started,
let me go to the Inspector panel

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.860
and set the minimum required
iOS version to be 5.0,

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.530
so that I can show you one
other cool feature later on.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.020
And let's get started with the banner.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.760
Let me double click on the placeholder.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.480
And what you're seeing now
is the template chooser.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.440
On the top here is a template
for the standard banner.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.360
The bottom is for the full screen banner.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.060
I'm going to choose a
blank standard banner.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.100
This has been created for me and
let me double click to edit it.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.340
Right now it doesn't have anything on it.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.020
So what I'm going to do is
to import some image asset.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.250
To do so,
I could go to your top menu bar.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.270
Under file,
there's an import asset option.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.220
So my asset is already there.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.460
I'm going to choose this folder.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.910
So the asset library just
opened up and it showed me the

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.840
list of assets I just imported.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.380
So I'm going-- like
this is a banner logo.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.490
I could just drag it to the banner.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.980
So as I position this image,
like the alignment guide is show up to

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.850
help me position the image precisely.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:49.020
And I can also do a multi-selection
and then drag it to the

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.970
banner and it will just work.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.660
So I added all my image assets.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:01.260
Let me go set the background so
that it matches more the branding.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.420
I could do that by going
to the inspector panel.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.240
And there's a background inspector here.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.580
So I don't want color field anymore.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.600
I want to change it to gradient.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.570
And I don't want linear either.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.000
I want radio.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.570
Let me change the color to white
on this one and coffee on this one.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:23.760
Thank you.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.120
So at this point,
we have a banner pretty much ready.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.080
Let's take this further
by adding some animation.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.610
To add animation,
let me highlight the object

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.020
that I would like to animate.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.010
And let's see.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.700
You can add animation by
going to the action panel.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.050
And there's a plus button here.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.700
Clicking here will show you
the list of action that you can

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.700
apply to the highlighted object.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.050
I'm going to add a pop-in animation.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.960
And it just shows you a
preview of the animation.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:16.860
You can look at the animation again
by dragging the yellow two-tip here.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.300
Or you can, there's a play button here,
you can also click on it and

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.100
look at the whole sequence again.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.920
As you may notice,
right now the animation is

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.280
happening one after the other.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.310
I could make them happen at the
same time by highlighting the action

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.000
and drag them on top to the other.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.730
And let me do a preview.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.600
So all actions are starting
at the same time now.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.250
So that's it for my banner.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.040
Let me go back to Overview.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.120
And I'm going to build the content page.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.150
I'm going to choose a blank template.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.710
So the very first thing I want to do is
to set the image background to this page.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.920
Let me go to the Inspector panel.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.800
And right now, it doesn't have anything.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.120
I'm going to choose Image.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.790
And the background should be this one.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.280
Cool.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.540
So let me go back to my asset library.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.820
Among the assets I import earlier,
there's a 3D model

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.680
that represents Cupcake
International's signature cupcake.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.840
And I could just-- like an image asset,
I could just drag it to the page.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.740
It's so kind of small.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.160
Let me resize it.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.470
And the 3D model just magically
got rendered using WebGL.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:51.260
And you don't have to write a single
line of code to do the rendering.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.100
At this point, let me simulate it and
show you how it works.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.320
Before I do that,
let me change this to iPad so that

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.910
we can look at the whole thing.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.800
So here's our beautiful banner.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.500
If I tap on it,
it will show me the content page.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.740
I could drag it around to look at
the cupcake at a different angle.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.870
I could go up and down.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.770
And if I do a pinch,
I could zoom it in and out.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.450
So at this point,
we have an interactive object,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.220
and you don't have to write
a single line of code.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.340
You don't have to know
anything about WebGL,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.140
and you have an interactive
object at your fingertip.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.900
That's pretty cool.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.090
Thank you.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.940
So we have a really cool object.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.540
Now let me add a tweet button so that
people can spread the word about it.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.160
To do that,
I'm going to the object library.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.020
You can do that by clicking
the object button here.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.000
I'm going to choose a button.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.010
And I'm going to move it to the bottom.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.320
To make it a tweet button,
I will go to the Inspector panel.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:07.500
And under the Event Inspector,
I see that there's no action currently

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.000
associated with TouchUp Inside.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.860
If I click on the drop-down menu,
it will view the list of actions

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.640
that I could associate with it.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:23.170
For this purpose,
I'm going to add a Compose Tweet action.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.100
It showed me a list of options
for this particular action.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.900
I'm going to set a default message.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.780
Cupcake is coming to town.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.320
So that should be our tree button.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:44.780
And let me work on the aesthetic of
the button by changing the background.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.150
So I already have a sprite
image for this button.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.790
Oh, let me first remove the default text.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:59.440
And now we can set the image background.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.300
And that's our normal style.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.180
We also want to set
the highlighted style.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.760
We can do that by clicking on this
drop-down menu and select Highlighted.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.850
And we also wanted to show us an image.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.500
Since this is a sprite image,
we change our background position

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.670
by double-clicking on it.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.520
And we can just drag it and get
the right background position.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.520
So our tweet button should be ready.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.760
Let me simulate and
show you how it worked.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.450
The tab and hole will show
me the highlighted state.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.100
And it will launch the tweet sheet.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.760
And I could type in some message here.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.240
And if I click send,
the tweet will be on its way.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.730
So that's it for my demo.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.390
I just showed you how to
build an interactive page

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.990
and animate a background,
all without writing a

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.650
single line of code.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.730
I'm going to bring Scott back,
and he's going to show you

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.560
more about iAd Producer.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.930
So that was awesome.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.680
Thank you, Chi Waai.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.580
By the way, when you later on go down,
download iAd Producer,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.660
definitely try out the WebGL stuff.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.760
It's really, really awesome.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.880
And the thing,
we don't have time to demo today,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.310
but is particularly impressive
is you can actually animate those

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.310
things using the animation system.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.310
So it's tons of fun to play around with.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.290
So let's move on.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.380
So what we've looked at so far is
sort of adding your basic object

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.320
library items to the page and
adding some animations to those

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.310
things and just tweaking the styles,
the things to get the

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.380
basics up and running,
the essential things you'll need.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.790
And we realize, though,
that you're going to probably want to

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.760
customize some of the things that we
have built in and add custom behavior.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.130
So how do we go about doing that?

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.630
You're thinking, hey, this stuff's great.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.860
I want to add custom control.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.710
Or, excuse me, add customization.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.850
And one of the ways you'll do
that is by using JavaScript,

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.580
of course.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.610
All of iAd is built on JavaScript.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:24:56.200
[Transcript missing]

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.790
And iAd View,
there are sort of two high-level

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.480
responsibilities it has.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.400
First is to control the presentation
of the content on the page,

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.350
and the other is to intercept user
events and dispatch them appropriately.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.670
So again, remember when I talked about
the event inspector and when

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.680
Chi Wa showed you the event inspector,
that entire machinery

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.080
is handled by iAd View.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.080
And when you want to go above and
beyond the presentation and the event

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.240
handling that's built into iAd View,
we also offer a property

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.960
on iAd View called layer.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.120
And potentially this is a little
confusing because obviously there

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.440
are a lot of things called layers.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.180
You know, there's Photoshop layers and
there's core animation layers.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.710
But in this case,
specifically what we're talking about

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.800
with iAd View is the layer property
is the DOM element on the page.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.970
So if you're a web developer
and you're used to,

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.450
you know,
interacting directly with DOM elements

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:46.250
and you want that level of control,
all you need to do is get a reference

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.580
to the iAd View and the layer
property will be that DOM element.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.700
So it's really, really handy.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.830
And something to keep in mind, too,
is that we've set up a really

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.010
handy syntax to get a reference
to all the views on your page.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.280
So what you can do is you add
a button or you add an image

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.180
view to your Canvas page,
select it in a Canvas,

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.090
and if you open the inspector,
you see a text field at

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.960
the very top called outlet.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.210
When you set that outlet,
you automatically have access

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.420
to that outlet in code using
the syntax on the screen.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.020
This, that view controller, that outlet,
and then the name of the view.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.900
And just as an extra convenience,
when you open one of the

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.790
code files we generate,
you'll see in the comments of

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.300
that code file the entire list of
outlets that are available to you.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.920
So that's really easy to do.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.740
And just as a side note,
this isn't just a convenience,

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.380
but it's also potentially much
faster than sort of crawling

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.340
your way through the DOM using,
you know,

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:37.730
looking for a particular ID or class.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.250
This is really the way to do it.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.740
So in addition to JavaScript,
you have a lot of customization

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.000
options using CSS.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.090
and and

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.100
The way you do this is you can
bring in just a regular CSS file.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.060
It doesn't have to be special
in any particular way.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:57.130
Drag a CSS file into the asset
library as shown here on the screen.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.600
And the CSS file can contain
one of two types of content.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.020
The first can just be custom styles.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.310
So, you know,
you could create a custom class that has

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.040
some custom CSS styles that you want.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:12.080
And the message here is not that,
you know, we offer a lot of editing

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.920
opportunities in the inspector.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.810
So you can change the font,
you can change fonts

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:17.950
and colors and images.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:18.870
Chi Wai showed you some of that.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:19.580
He'll show you more.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.800
But we don't expose every single
CSS property in inspectors,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.500
obviously, because there's so many.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.330
So if you have something
really custom you want to do,

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.080
again, if you're a magician,
you can do that.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.250
You can add that to your
CSS file and bring it in.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.060
And in addition to styles, you can also,
as I mentioned before,

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.580
add custom keyframe animations.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.430
So here in the screenshot,
you can see we brought in

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.950
a CSS file and we've said,
I'd like to use the

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.720
keyframe set particle shift.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.690
And that does some really super
fancy spaceship animation.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.530
And the other major point here is
that in addition to sort of bringing

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.560
in a static file and setting a class
on one of the objects on the page,

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.600
you can also just update CSS properties
live in JavaScript the same way

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.620
you would do if you were doing
kind of lower level JavaScript.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.930
And again, you would use the,
when you had a view reference,

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.640
you just get access to the layer
property that I mentioned before,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.790
which is the DOM element,
and you would just set those

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.740
CSS properties the way you
would on any other DOM element.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.490
So it's really, really handy,
really easy to use.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.790
With that, I'm going to bring up our
demo person extraordinaire,

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:16.020
Chi Waileau, and he's going to show you
how to customize your project.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.780
Hello again.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.930
I'm back to show you how to
customize your iAd with your

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.800
own JavaScript and CSS code.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.990
As you may notice,
when Scott took the stage,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:31.180
I added a few pages to our project,
and there are two new pages here.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.530
So there's a teaser page.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.600
It's a promotion page Cupcake
International want to show

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.420
before the shop is open.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.800
The other page is called Launch.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.980
It's a buy a dozen get a dozen
free page and we only want to

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.110
show it after the shop is open.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.340
Back to this page we worked together.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.300
I added this new button
called Gap Promotion.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.910
Depending on the view date,
we want to route the user to either

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.340
the teaser page or the launch page.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.970
And we're going to write a
little bit of JavaScript code

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.060
to take care of that logic.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.280
To get started with coding,
there's a Code button here.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.390
If I click on it,
it will launch the code editor

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.830
Scott showed you earlier.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:28.540
On the left here, on this side,
you will see the list of

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.580
possible files you can edit.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.780
Under banner is the file that scope
under banner that only apply to banner.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.800
Under ad unit is the one that
apply to other content pages.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:46.100
Global.css is the CSS style sheet
that got applied to all content pages.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:53.630
Global.javascript is basically the same
idea but applied just to JavaScript.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.430
We have a couple lines of code here.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:05.800
Open date here basically defined
the open date of the cupcake shop.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.800
Right now it's set to be 2013.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.800
And current date basically defined
the current view date of the ad.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.800
Now that we have the valuable setup,
let me go back to the application.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:25.820
And we want to set up the buttons
such that on TouchUp Inside we

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:30.800
could route to either the
launch page or the teaser page.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.560
To do that,
let me go to the event inspector.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.800
On TouchUp Inside, we want to choose X.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.590
to choose to execute some JavaScript.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:47.670
And if I click on this arrow button here,
it will take me back to the code editor.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:52.400
And on TouchUp Insight,
we would like to execute

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.900
this line of JavaScript code.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:59.600
The first part is basically--
the first part is the function

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.440
that handled the page transition.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:07.870
And the second part basically
handled the logic that switches

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.420
between launch page or teaser page.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.510
That should get us set up already.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.970
And let me simulate and see how it works.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.030
Since the open date is set
to be sometime in 2013,

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.460
clicking on the Get Promotion button
should take me to the teaser page.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.860
And here it is.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:37.320
And let me test the other use case
by setting the date to be maybe 2010,

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.460
so that it's in the past.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.120
So it will guarantee
to show the other page.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.270
Let me simulate it again.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:51.420
So clicking here to show me the launch.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.430
So here's our launch page.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.640
So here's our JavaScript customization.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:02.270
Now I'm going to move on to show
you how to customize your CSS.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:07.240
And again,
so what we want to do here is to

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:12.360
apply image texture to this title.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.270
First, let me go to the inspector.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:21.460
And under the property,
we want to set something for the

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:27.050
CSS costume so that we could use
it in our CSS selector later.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:33.810
And I'm going to just say cupcake title.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.100
And now I can go back to my co-editor.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.460
We can open up global.css.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:46.340
And this will be the CSS style
we want to apply to the title.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.400
And it used to do the
background image texture for me.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.920
And let me simulate
and make sure it works.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.920
And here it is.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.320
So that's it for my CSS customization.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.580
I'm going to bring Scott back,
and he's going to talk about

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.000
performance and optimization.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.150
Thank you.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.170
Okay, that was awesome.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.860
Thank you, Chi Waai.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.800
So as we're sort of advancing
through our project,

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.130
we're working on our iAd,
so far we've got some of the

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.800
basic concepts on the page,
we've got some objects and some

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.430
of the animations up and running,
and then we've customized

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.720
by adding some custom code,
as Chi Waai showed you,

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.800
to show a different page
based on the current date,

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.280
and then also customizing some of
the CSS using a special CSS property.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.930
And now we're at the point
where we've got sort of the

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:43.690
basic parts of the ad running,
and we've got customization,

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:47.380
and now we want to start looking at
tuning performance and ultimately

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.950
deploying the ad on the network.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.310
So the thing that you want the user
to think when they're using the ad,

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.270
and really subconsciously,
is that you want them to feel like

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:58.000
it's a very fluid user experience,
that it's very fast,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.590
and it's a gratifying experience
because they're not waiting for anything

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:03.580
to draw on the screen or download.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.870
And in order to do that,
there are three main

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:10.750
things to keep in mind.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:14.780
The first thing is memory consumption.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.040
You really want to minimize
memory consumption.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.910
And we're going to talk about some
of the ways that you can do that,

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:23.530
but ultimately it comes down to
how many views you have on the

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.200
page and what their content is.

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:29.210
The second tier is drawing performance.

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.550
So you really want to be conscious
of the drawing performance.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.740
Again, because they're mobile devices,
they don't have the same caliber

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.910
of performance as a dedicated
laptop or desktop device.

00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:40.120
So there's different
performance characteristics.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.640
And in particular with drawing,
what you really want

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.990
to do is think about,
what can I do to not draw?

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:46.780
What can you do to avoid
drawing altogether?

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.700
Because the fastest drawing, of course,
is the drawing you never do.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.740
And then the third thing,
in addition to memory

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.780
and drawing performance,
is fetching.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.590
And again, because iAds are
network-connected content,

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.550
and as the user proceeds through the ad,
they're downloading

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:03.280
more and more content,
you want to keep in mind that every

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.740
time you load new content onto a page,
every time you arrive onto a page,

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.170
there's an HTTP connection
that goes out to the iAd server

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.200
to download that content.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.650
And the more times you have to go
back to the server and get something,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.390
the slower the performance is.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.660
We're going to look at some of the
details of how to mitigate that.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.180
But that might sound
kind of intimidating.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.290
There's a lot of things to keep in mind.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.280
Those are potentially some
pretty intimidating problems.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.670
But I have some really good news for you.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.450
We've worked really,
really hard to solve the

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.900
big problems for you.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.820
So out of the box,
there are three things we

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.440
handle for you that you don't
have to worry about at all.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.270
The first is that we minimize
and concatenate all the

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.760
scripts in the project.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.190
And the really awesome thing about this
is that it's not just the stuff that we

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.920
generate as part of making the project,
as part of generating that code.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.760
But it's also anything you've brought in.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.540
So if you've added your
own JavaScript code,

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.750
you've brought in a custom
game or something like that,

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.300
we will concatenate and minimize
all the scripts for you.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.070
You don't have to worry about it.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.100
It's just completely off the table.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.780
The other thing we work really hard
to do is make sure that all the

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.660
images are preloaded appropriately
by default for every page.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.190
So a really good example of this is,
again,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:15.640
going back to the image gallery control,
we make sure by the time the

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.140
user arrives on the page that
the first image is loaded.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:22.180
The first image in that image gallery
is already visible to avoid any kind

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.360
of flicker or anything popping in.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.730
So we're really smart about
realizing which things we need to

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.880
preload appropriately if you're
using the built-in object library.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.440
The third thing we do is we monitor
which views are on the page.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.020
And we're really careful to set
the display property to none for

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.040
any view that is no longer needed.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.460
So this is great because it, again,
reduces memory usage.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:47.540
And it also avoids redrawing that view
when it's really not needed anymore.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.520
So that dovetails nicely into
your part of the equation.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.260
What do you have to think about
in terms of performance tuning?

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.690
Well, one really easy one is to keep
in mind that when you're bringing

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.340
in assets into a project,
you've got assets from an artist

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.950
or maybe you're working on assets,
one of the things you should really

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:08.260
keep in mind is that there's a hard
limit on pixel size of an image.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.720
And in this case,
it's 2,000 pixels in either dimension.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.220
So 2,000 pixels high, 2,000 pixels wide.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.310
If it's bigger than that,
you're actually going to exceed

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.000
the limitations of OpenGL.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.060
And you'll get a tiling effect.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.410
It's not a very pleasant user experience.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.160
You want to work really,
really hard to make sure

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.400
you don't exceed this limit.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:28.590
The other thing that's
important to think about is,

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.540
in this, you can see on the screenshot,
we've got 24 cupcakes on the screen.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.200
And initially, it might seem, wow,
it would be really flexible if each

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.200
one of these is a separate image,
each one of these is a separate cupcake,

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.040
because then you don't
have to worry about,

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.660
you can manipulate them in animation,
that sort of thing.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.740
But the thing you want to keep in
mind is that if there are 24 cupcakes,

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.560
you have to download 24 cupcakes.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.920
And that, again,
goes back to that fetch consideration,

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.720
where you don't want to be grabbing
a whole bunch of little images.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.180
So when you have an opportunity,
such as in the screenshot,

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.560
to combine them,
that may be a really good decision.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.240
Now, there might be a little bit of
a contradiction here between,

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.520
well, don't make a really big image and
don't have a bunch of little images,

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.120
but it really is,
there's a balancing act,

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.730
and you want to do some performance
tuning to figure out what's right for

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.390
each particular page in your project.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.560
And finally,
remember how I mentioned that we're

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.780
really careful to remove views from
the page using display none when we're,

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.500
you know, in the built-in object library
when they're not needed anymore?

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.440
If you're adding custom
views to your page,

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.440
you want to make sure
to do the same thing.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.030
Again,
the great thing about this is if you

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.940
know a view is no longer needed and you
can just kind of toss it off the page,

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.380
it's not going to take any memory
and there won't be any drawing

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.820
implications for that view.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.100
So at this point, we've, again,
put together the essential

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.520
parts of our project,
added objects and animations.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.240
We've customized the JavaScript and
added some custom CSS properties.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.050
And we've sort of moved into
the performance tuning part of

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.320
our project and addressed some
of those performance concerns.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.240
And Chi Waai is going to show
you a demo about that so you can

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.400
get kind of a better grasp on it.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.520
But following that, we're ready to launch
our ad on the network.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.360
You know, this is really exciting because
we get to see the payoff of the

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.590
thing we've been working on.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.300
We get to push it out to millions
and millions of iOS users.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.800
And it's really the exciting part of the,
one of the most exciting

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.460
parts of the project.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.860
exciting parts of the project.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.860
But what do you have to do at this phase?

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.180
Because we want to be really
conscious of the user experience,

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.600
we want to make sure that we
follow all the steps to get a

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.380
really great result on the server.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.160
So the six steps to keep in mind,
they're pretty simple.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.950
The first is just to double
check as a really rough cut.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.130
In iAd Producer,
you want to check the validations

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:27.480
window to make sure there weren't any
oversights such as maybe you accidentally

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.360
added an image that's just a little
too big or you're missing an object.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.980
We'll help you visualize those
particular issues really easily.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.780
You just go to the window menu
and choose project validation.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.570
And you can see if there are any
sort of rough cut validations

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.300
you want to take a look at.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:47.050
And I cannot possibly overemphasize
how important the second step is.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.050
This is the single most
important item on this slide.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.980
As you're working on
your project continually,

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.320
but particularly right at the
end when you're ready to deploy,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.650
you really, really want to do a ton of
testing on an iOS device.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.360
And again,
I cannot understand how important it

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.010
is to keep in mind that the performance
characteristics are different,

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.040
not just on the device itself,
the memory and the drawing performance,

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:11.350
but also you really want to make sure
that the performance is great over 3G or

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.800
4G as well as Wi-Fi because you can have
a much different experience depending

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.460
on network latency and the availability
of cell towers and that sort of thing.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.660
So this is really, really important.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.090
The third thing, just to sort of state
the obvious probably,

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:26.670
you need to have an IAD account
so that you can upload your

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.270
content to the IAD test server.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.840
And once you've established that
account and you've tested locally and

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.780
you've checked all the validations,
you can go ahead and upload

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.420
the ad to the iAd Test Server.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.370
And you can do that right
from within iAd Producer.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.320
Again,
it's a full-cycle development tool,

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.900
so we handle that right in the app.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.730
And once you've done that,
you've completed uploading the ad,

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.100
we'll send you an email.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.620
And the email will contain a link
to that ad on the test server.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.910
All you need to do is open that
email on your mobile device,

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:55.760
tap it, and just, again,
make sure you have iAd Tester

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.790
installed on that device.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.820
Tap that URL,
and we'll just load that ad up

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.700
live right on your iOS device.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.650
So it will be the exact same
experience as the user will have

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.690
when they view the ad on the network.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.860
So, again, you're just testing to make
sure this is going to be a

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.960
really fluid user experience.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.330
And I just want to quadruple
emphasize here that not only

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.340
are you testing the iOS device,
you know, maybe on your Wi-Fi connection,

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.540
but go out into the wild and
make sure that out on a 3G

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.130
connection or a 4G connection,
you're getting the performance

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:24.890
you expect because that's,
again,

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.730
really important for the user experience.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:32.330
So to sort of give you the specifics
and show you how this works in

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:36.030
the final stages of your ad,
I'm going to bring Chi Waai Lau back up.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.820
And he is going to show you
performance and deployment.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:40.800
Right there.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:45.390
I'm back to show you how to benchmark
your iAd and get ready for deployment.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.020
So at this point,
our ad looked pretty solid.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:53.420
And it's time to measure how much
memory is using and monitor the

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.760
network traffic and make sure it's
not like-- make sure it's optimized.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.170
To do that, let me simulate my IF first.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:15.050
To measure the memory usage of this iAd,
I could go to the Activity Monitor,

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.400
which comes with all Mac OS X.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:23.070
And the process we would like
to listen to is Ask Sheet.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:28.230
So under this column, with memory,
it will give you an estimation how

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.500
much memory the iAd is consuming.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.060
So right now it's around 67,
which is good.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.700
So we want to keep it
under 100 megabytes.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:41.760
Now I want to show you how to
monitor the network traffic.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.000
Now let me go back to the app.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.260
Under Windows, there's a debugger option.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.900
So it launched WebKit Inspector.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.680
It's the same inspector you see
from Safari or WebKit Nightly.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.090
So for those who have done
a lot of web development,

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.420
this should be really familiar to you.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.850
And there's a network tab here.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:11.170
And it shows me the list of things
you have downloaded for my iAd.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:14.780
But it only applied to the first page.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.700
Let me clear it.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:26.370
and start recording by clicking
here and if I go back to my ad,

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.560
I will click the promotion button
and it will open up the promotion

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:36.270
page and I could see all the
network traffic on that page.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.320
There's a lot of things
being shown up here.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:41.930
Let me just filter it by images.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.540
And currently there's 12
different images being downloaded

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.380
for this particular page.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:52.170
And as Scott mentioned earlier,
it spawned a lot of network requests,

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:57.030
which could potentially be
really bad for people willing

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.640
to add over a mobile network.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:05.410
We can optimize it by compositing all
these mini cupcakes into just one image.

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.480
Let me go ahead and do that.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.540
First, I'm going to remove
the individual images.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:19.030
And I already have the
composite image ready.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.080
I'll just drag it in.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:27.240
So it used to look identical.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.130
Let me go back and simulate.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.660
We don't want to look at that.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.380
Let me clear that and start recording.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.060
And go to the promotion page.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.750
Filter by image.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.250
And we reduce the number of
network requests by compositing

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:55.000
all the images into just one image.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.310
And we only have one request.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.700
So that means there's less overhead
coming from downloading images.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.110
That's pretty good.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.290
And now it's time for us to share
the ad so that the campaign manager

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:15.260
could take a look at it and we could
test it over 3G or other environment,

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.240
different devices.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.200
To do that,
we can go to the export option.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.800
And there's a upload to
iAd test server option.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.000
And it will ask you for your iAd account.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.140
And once you type that in,
it will basically send you the ad.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:39.140
And then the iAd to
Apple-owned test server.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.100
And it will send you
an email in response.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.080
And the email looks like this.

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.190
It contains the link to your iAd.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.370
And if you open the link
on your iPhone or iPad,

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:58.570
it will basically show you the ad
just as people look at the ad live.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.320
So that's it for deployment.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.570
I'm going to bring Scott back,
and he's going to sum

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.100
up our presentation.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.030
Thank you.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.890
So here we are at the end
of our little journey.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.210
We've moved through the entire
process of creating our ad.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.690
We've added the content
that we want to the ad,

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:20.240
added animations to them,
so all those results

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.470
are really fantastic.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:24.560
Customized it with custom
JavaScript and custom CSS.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.600
You saw how easy that was to do.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.580
Tuned the performance and ultimately
uploaded the ad to the test service

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.700
that we can test on an iOS device live.

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:33.750
So that's great.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:38.030
And I think you can probably see at this
point that it really is very easy to use,

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:39.380
very easy to use.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.600
It's very easy to just jump
in there and try things out.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.040
And I bet all of you will want
to go to developer.apple.com

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.600
today and give it a try yourself.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:49.820
So just a few last
thoughts to leave you with.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.360
Like I said,
just go ahead and download iAd Producer.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.040
If you have an iOS developer account,
super easy, developer.apple.com.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:01.420
And built into the iAd Producer disk
image are a bunch of sample projects.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.370
And it's pretty much the
ones you saw here today,

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:07.980
the Space Tours to Mars ad and
a variant of the Cupcake ad.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.150
And those are really helpful
because we've worked hard to hit a

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.020
bunch of different areas of iAds.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.420
You can download those,
see how they work, and apply those same

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:16.430
concepts to your own ads.

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.240
And after you've had a chance to
download iAd Producer and try it out,

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.390
let us know what you think.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.250
You know, we're really interested in
what is working well for you,

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:27.210
what we should improve on,
what we should, you know, work towards.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:31.400
And to do that,
you can email our friend and colleague,

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.680
Mark Malone.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.340
He's the iTechnologies Evangelist,
mgm at apple.com.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.460
There's a whole bunch of documentation.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.840
I've just highlighted one of them here.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.180
It's the iAd Producer help at
help.apple.com slash iAd Producer.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
And there are iAd Forms
and iAd Producer topics on

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.100
the Apple Developer Forms.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.000
And that is it.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.320
Thank you very much for coming.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.120
I really appreciate it.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.580
And I hope you enjoy iAd Producer.
