WEBVTT

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.100
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.540
Good morning.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.100
All right.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.200
Welcome to Session 311,
Building and Distributing

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.100
Custom B2B Apps for iOS.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.820
My name is Dave Rahardja.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.050
I am a software engineer in the
iOS apps and frameworks team.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.120
All right.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.740
The success of iOS in
business has been phenomenal.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.510
It looks like everywhere
you go these days,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.880
you see an iPad or an iPod
Touch or an iPhone being used.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.090
Anywhere from doctors' offices
and law offices to retail,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.370
the service industry,
and even inside airline cockpits,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.530
you see iOS devices everywhere.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.680
And a great,
large part of our success is thanks

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.700
to the great business-oriented
apps that you develop.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.360
These apps change the way we
work and do things that were

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.100
not even possible before.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.730
There are several great ways that
we provide for you to get your apps

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.700
into the hands of the end users and
the businesses that you are serving.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.210
We've got the App Store.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.000
It's the largest collection
of curated apps anywhere,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.840
and it's super simple to use.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.050
Everyone has it on their iOS device.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.080
Now the apps in the App Store are great,
but they tend to appeal

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.540
to a broad audience,
right?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.660
Some businesses require apps
that are a little bit more

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.680
specific to their industry.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.670
And for them,
we have an enterprise in-house program.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.900
Some of you may have heard of this.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.160
It's a program where an enterprise
can develop their own apps.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.900
and distributed within their
organization without review from Apple.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.420
So these are two great ways to
deliver business apps to your clients.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.940
But today I want to talk about another
way to distribute your business apps

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.090
that you may not have heard about.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.050
It's called Custom B2B.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.040
So let's talk about
that for a few minutes.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.940
Custom B2B apps are apps that are
tailor-made for a specific client.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.030
They are available exclusively
to clients that you select.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.830
All right?

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.550
Let me say that again.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.800
You can make these apps
available only to select clients.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.900
They are available for
purchase exclusively through

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.840
the Volume Purchas program.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.530
And we'll talk about
that program in a minute.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.640
And they're hosted by Apple.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.800
So you don't have to think
about how to distribute this.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.670
We take care of the distribution
and hosting for you.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.140
Let's look at some examples
of what B2B apps can be.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.690
Here's an App Store app.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:31.800
[Transcript missing]

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.040
You can make one of these
apps for a specific client.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.810
It may not be suitable for the App Store,
but it certainly is very powerful

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.230
for the client that you're serving.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.370
Here's another example.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.980
This is a sales catalog or
a product catalog here for a

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.860
heavy equipment manufacturer.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.680
You know,
you can tap a button to watch a video,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.590
you can get a brochure
mailed to yourself,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.800
et cetera.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.360
With a bit of customization and skinning,
you can turn this app into a sales tool

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.340
for a completely unrelated industry.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.900
Custom colors, custom parts, etc.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.180
Another example.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.540
Here's an interesting one.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.830
So we have a manufacturer
of power equipment.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.220
And they have independent distributors.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.170
And they want their distributors to have
an app that shows them the latest parts

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.170
catalog with a great amount of detail.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.070
This is a proprietary
database that they have.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.430
And this is a great way to deliver
parts information to their distributors.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.670
But they don't want to make
this available in the app store.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.190
And they can't really use the
enterprise in-house program

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.180
because their distributors are
not part of their enterprise.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.920
So B2B apps are great for this.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.840
They make an app for B2B.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.760
They allow the distributors
to download it.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.280
And we distribute it to them.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.980
Very convenient.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.900
Here's another example.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.740
This is a nurse station application,
maybe at a hospital or a clinic.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.640
When you target an app towards a
specific industry like healthcare,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.900
there are peculiar concerns to that
industry that you need to take care of,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.590
such as privacy, data protection,
policies, and so forth.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.060
may not be a good fit
for the store maybe,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.820
but great fit for a B2B app.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.900
You can solve a particular niche
industry's concerns with your app.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.860
And one final example,
here's a really cool app.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.560
This app delivers papers
for board meetings.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.900
As you can imagine,
there are very sensitive

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.830
information in board meeting papers,
and this app can manage the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.350
data protection on them,
you know, security, availability,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.400
et cetera.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.580
Again, a great example of building an app
to address a very particular niche

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.960
industry or niche need that will be well
served by the apps that you produce.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.640
So those are some of the examples
of B2B apps and what they can be.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.350
I'm sure you guys can come up with
some examples right now in your mind

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.570
about how you can develop an app
for a particular client or industry.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.450
In short,
B2B apps solve a client's specific need.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.770
All right.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.900
Now that we know what B2B apps are,
let's walk through the process of

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.400
delivering them to your end users.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.440
So there are four steps
that you need to go through,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.720
and we'll walk through all of them.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.100
First, you've got to develop your app,
obviously.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.530
After you do that,
you need to submit your app

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.170
to our distribution for us
to distribute your apps.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.440
Third, you need a way for your
clients to purchase those apps.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.400
And we'll talk about that.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:19.180
And finally,
you actually have to distribute

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.180
these apps to the end users
in your client's organization.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.000
You're responsible for the
first two parts as a developer.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.540
The clients will take care
of the last two parts.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.470
But we'll walk through all of them so
that you know what to say to your clients

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.480
and you know what you can expect them
to ask you during this whole process.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.920
And it pays to know a little bit
about the distribution method so

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.930
that you can target your app so
that it can be distributed easily.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.530
So let's go through them.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.500
All right.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.500
Let's talk about developing a B2B app.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.720
Well, for the most part,
developing a B2B app is just

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.570
like developing an App Store app.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.680
You use the same tools,
the same great technologies that we have,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.860
Xcode and the API and the iOS SDK,
same thing.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.700
So what's different?

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.980
The difference, of course,
is that your apps are

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.690
tailored to a specific client.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.230
You're aiming to please a
smaller segment with your app.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.500
So, you might have some custom
look and feel to your app,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.950
You may have to deal with a custom
workflow that your client desires,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.190
and sometimes you have to deal
with server infrastructure that

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:38.490
is custom or peculiar to your
client's business operations.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.600
So here are some strategies that
you can adopt to make your app

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.230
more successful as a B2B app.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.310
First, modular, modular, modular, right?

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:58.390
Design your app in a modular way so that
you can adapt it to your next customer.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.440
So if you have custom views,
make sure they're skinnable or modular.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.590
If you are using a custom backend,
make sure that's modular.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.140
Use the Model View Controller design
extensively through your code.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:21.900
Make sure that both your models and your
views are reusable for the next client.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.300
And here's an interesting tip:
Encapsulate your server protocols.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.550
So if you have a particular
server you're talking to,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.820
Think about, don't let the protocol
seep in through your code.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.580
Build an abstraction layer to isolate
that protocol from your model and

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.640
your views and your controllers.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.980
So that when you get to the next client,
maybe all you have to do is

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.720
use the same app and have it
talk to a different server.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.660
And an abstraction layer will help you
to unplug the old server architecture,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.390
plug in the new one, and off you go.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.810
So build modular, modular, modular.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.800
And here's an interesting note.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.050
When you're building an app for a client,
they're entrusting you with

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.490
their business information.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:13.530
More often than not,
their business information has some kind

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.030
of security stipulation attached to it.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.600
So, here's a tip:
build in data security from the start.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.170
Don't wait until the end and
kind of try to work it in.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.070
Use server authentication to make
sure that whoever is using the app is

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.890
actually authorized to access the data.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.040
Use the keychain.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.700
Do not store passwords
in a plist on disk.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:39.400
Don't do that.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.250
It's a bad idea.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.540
The keychain is an encrypted
place to store your credentials,

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.130
so your passwords, certificates,
identity certificates,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.180
and other kinds of credentials.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.450
So use it.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.720
Use it to your advantage.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.170
It's got a really nice API,
and it's the best place to

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.060
put the secrets in your app.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.780
and Data Protection.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.540
Some of you may not be familiar.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.520
may not be familiar with the
data protection technology

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.150
that we offer on iOS.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.300
Data protection on iOS
involves encryption down to

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.700
the block level in Flash.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:24.160
Using an algorithm that involves the
user's passcode in the encryption.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.560
So until the user types in
their passcode on the device,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.030
it is really,
really hard to read that data on disk.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.780
So use data protection and choose
the highest level of data protection

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.590
that you can live with in your app,
and you'll be great going forward.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.940
And you'll give your client a
confidence that you're going

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.020
to keep their data safe.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:52.240
And finally, it goes without saying,
collaborate with your client.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.640
Make sure you understand their needs,
make sure they understand

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.700
their workflows,
and build something that can transform

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.900
the way that they work and enable them
to do things more efficiently or do

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.250
things that couldn't be done before.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.650
So that's all there is to
it for the develop part,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.240
right?

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.200
It's basically the same as
developing for an App Store app.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.380
Except that you keep in mind that
this is going to be used by a

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:23.250
particular client with specific needs,
and another client may come in a little

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.500
while later after your app has been a
big hit and everybody hears about it,

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:32.990
and you better be able to port that
app easily to the second client.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.970
That's the takeaway.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.550
So now that we know how
to develop a B2B app,

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.010
let's talk about app submission.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.640
Submitting a B2B app is very similar
to submitting an App Store app.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.710
You use iTunes Connect.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.950
Except you check this checkbox
here that says this is a B2B app.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.290
When you do that,
this form opens up below it.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.310
And here's a place where you
can enter the Apple IDs for the

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.500
clients that are allowed to access
this app or to purchase this app.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.400
These are your clients' Apple IDs.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.610
You have to have at least one,
but you can have as many as you want.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.690
You can add and remove
Apple IDs over time.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:23.960
There's no limit.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.100
So you can make your app
available to someone and then

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.370
not available to them later on.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.370
You can do that.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.270
So only these people that have
their IDs listed here can see

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.920
your app in their VPP store,
and your app will not be visible

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.260
in the general app store.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.360
Next, you select the price tier.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.970
And this is the price that the
client pays for every license

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.350
of your app or every copy of
your app that they purchase.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.070
Now, some of you are familiar
with our policy on B2B apps.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.900
We have a $9.99 minimum
price per copy of the app.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.220
Well, today,
I am very excited to announce to

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.740
you that we're getting rid of that.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.430
No minimum price.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.990
All tiers are available, including free.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.800
Here are some notes about your B2B app
submissions that you can keep in mind.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.250
Number one, once B2B, always B2B.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:43.170
You cannot take an App Store app and
turn it into a B2B app or vice versa.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.010
You could submit it multiple
times under different app IDs.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.940
You can have an App Store version
and a B2B version.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.590
But the app ID that you use for a
B2B app will always be a B2B app.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.060
Your app will be reviewed.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:04.020
So provide us with a test account
and some login information so that we

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.690
can actually login and test your app.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.660
Now, you might have to work with your
clients to set up some kind of

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.380
server account or something,
but we need that so that we can

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.740
walk through your app and review it.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.760
I don't know if you know this,
but B2B apps update just

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.790
like app store apps.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.240
So when you create an
update to your B2B app,

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.110
submit it the same way
that you did before,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.360
you know, specify that this is an
updated binary to that old one,

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.470
and when that gets through
and it gets hosted,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.180
your clients will see a badge
on their app store icon.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.340
And, you know, it's the same process
that you're familiar with.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.120
You tap update and they
get the updated version.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.120
Very straightforward.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.540
It's a great way to deliver
your updates to your clients.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.680
Now, I don't know if you guys know this,
but promo codes are actually

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.480
available also for B2B apps.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.140
And here's a little trick.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:10.720
You can give a promo code for
the B2B app to someone who is

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:10.720
not on the list of Apple IDs.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.840
So let's go through that again.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:17.580
You can request promo codes for
your apps and give it to someone who

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.260
is not on your list of Apple IDs,
which means that now they

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.830
can test drive your app.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.400
: Right.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.540
They can download one copy or one
license and test drive your app,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.940
and if they like it, great.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.100
You can add their Apple ID,
and then they can buy it in volume.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.320
So that's how you submit a B2B app.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.520
It's the same process as
submitting to Apple Store,

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.690
to the App Store,
and you check that box that says B2B app.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.320
and go from there.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:56.190
Remember that your apps are only visible
to the people that you list on the list.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.680
All right,
let's move on to what your clients can

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.580
do once you've submitted your B2B app
and it's made available in the App Store,

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.900
in the B2B Store.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.790
Purchase.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:13.790
The secret to purchasing a B2B app
is the Volume Purchas program.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:21.300
This is a program that's available to
any business that has a DUNS number.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.720
And, you know,
most businesses have a DUNS number.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.860
There's a very easy online setup.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.360
It just takes minutes.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.360
You verify online.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.970
And you get to choose an
Apple ID that the enterprise uses

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.600
for purchasing apps in volume.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.790
It's really very simple.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.240
You can purchase B2B apps using
the Volume Purchas program,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.550
but you can also purchase App Store apps
at the same price in Volume,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.160
at the same price as the App Store,
and you can buy it in

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.630
any quantity at once.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.660
So let's see what that looks like here.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:05.160
So this is what your clients will see
when they log into the VPP portal.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.470
They'll see a web page
that says Business Store.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.100
There's a little search bubble up there.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.660
You can type in any keyword and it
will find the apps in the App Store.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.480
But I want to highlight something to you.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.240
Your B2B apps are highlighted,
highlighted front and

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.940
center on their page.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:27.820
So they get to see your apps right
there in their VPP portal page.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.040
So you click on one of those apps,
and this is what you see.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.870
You get a sheet just like, you know,
the iTunes App Store.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.400
And in that box up there,
they can enter the quantity

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.640
that they want to buy.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.620
Click Continue.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.700
and they've got to pay for it.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.720
We take several forms of payment.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.900
We take credit cards.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.780
We take P cards or procurement cards.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.850
And we take PayPal.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.040
And at the end of the payment process,
they get a link where they

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.070
can download a spreadsheet.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.160
So let's see what's on
the spreadsheet here.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.700
On the left, these are redemption codes.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.900
They're like the gift card codes or the
song codes that you're familiar with,

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.700
except they redeem one license
or one copy of your app.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:26.060
So how many licenses they purchase,
that's how many codes they get.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.600
But look on the right here.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.690
This column has URLs.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:39.160
that if launched on an iOS device,
will automatically redeem that code.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.890
And as well,
you can see up there that says redeemed.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.850
They can track which redemption
codes have been redeemed so over

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.290
time they can see how much they've
consumed and how much they have left.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.400
The Volume Purchas program is
currently available in the US,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:01.580
but today I'm glad to say that we're
opening up to nine additional countries.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:16.610
So Canada, UK, France, Italy, Germany,
Spain, Japan, Australia,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:23.610
and New Zealand will
get the VPP store soon.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.330
All right.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.260
So that's how your clients
purchase your B2B app.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.670
They use the VPP,
the Volume Purchase Program portal.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.420
Your apps are featured right up front,
and they can buy any volumes they want,

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.140
and they get the
redemption codes and URLs.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.890
Now that we know how the
client purchases the app,

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:50.010
Let's talk a little bit about how
they can distribute those codes

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:53.100
that they have received from you.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.050
So let's talk about distribution.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.840
There are four ways,
four main ways to distribute

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.530
these codes to their end users.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.150
The first, obviously,
is you just type it in.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.300
You type in the code on the device,
you can redeem the code.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.560
You're familiar with this.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:17.990
It's just like redeeming an iTunes
gift card or a free song card

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:17.990
that you might have received.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.740
This is very simple, but, you know,
it takes manual effort.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:30.300
The second way to do it is to use
a -- to send the URL to the device.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.960
You can send it using an e-mail.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.940
You can put an e-mail with the URL there.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.400
They tap on it.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.750
They get an app installed.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.750
You can send it via SMS.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.830
Or here's an interesting way to do it.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:48.750
Some enterprises have
created an intranet website.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:22:00.100
[Transcript missing]

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.780
The user can tap any of these
app icons and it launches the

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.310
URL and that installs the app.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:16.070
You can put URLs in there
that will install B2B apps

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.630
App Store apps and enterprise
in-house apps that are hosted by

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.600
the enterprise on their own servers.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.260
So it's really convenient.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.090
A lot of enterprises have done this.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:32.370
It's a very easy way for the employees to
browse through all the available apps and

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.100
they'll do the right thing in the end.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.120
A third way of doing this is really cool.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.700
It's MDM, Mobile Device Management.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:50.180
Now, if you don't know what MDM is,
it is an API that allows third-party

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:56.220
enterprise device management
server to manage a whole bunch

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.400
of iOS devices over the air.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.680
This is really great for enterprises
that want to enroll a lot of people

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.100
but don't want to touch every device.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.600
You have to self-enroll and you
can manage the devices that way.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:14.900
So using MDM,
you can deliver the redemption

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:21.600
codes to the device over the air
and in a server-initiated way.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.380
So here's an example.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.770
The user will get a pop-up
like this that says,

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.600
"Oh, you got an app coming.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.550
Would you like to install it?"

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:39.000
You know, the type, tap Install,
enter the Apple ID and password there.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.460
And the app is installed.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.930
It's super convenient.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:51.800
As well, if you do this using MDM,
the enterprise has controls about --

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.420
that relate to when the apps are removed.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.300
So they can make a policy that says,
you know, I want to remove this app now.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.120
Just take it off the user's device.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.710
Or say you can set a policy
that says don't back up the

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:06.270
data in that app because it
contains sensitive information.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.520
So that excludes that app
from the user's backup set.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.060
A lot of cool things you can do with MDM.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.170
Now the fourth way is one that
maybe not many of you know.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.230
Maybe you do.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.810
This is a very popular download.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.730
Apple Configurator.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:29.860
So Apple Configurator is an app that
we launched about three months ago.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.900
And it has been met with great welcome.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:39.780
It is a way to configure a
lot of iOS devices at once.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.220
and to manage them over time.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.980
Right?

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.600
It's USB only,
but you can plug a whole bunch

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.760
of them at the same time.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.980
And it can do really cool things.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.460
It can activate your device.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.260
It can configure it.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.680
It can install apps on it.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:08.380
And you can use that as an unboxing tool
for an enterprise purchased equipment.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:15.360
And you can also set it up so that when
the device is again seen on the USB port,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:19.990
it restores the configuration
on the device to a known state.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.200
Right, so that's great for retail,
for example.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.590
You hand out something to the floor,
it comes back,

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.900
it gets restored to a known state.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.810
So, Apple Configurator is really cool,
and I want to highlight this today

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.420
because there are some modes of
operation that may give you some ideas

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:43.600
about B2B apps that you might develop,
because it allows the iOS device

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.670
to be used in situations that you
might not have thought of before.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.310
So let's go through that and
see if you agree with me.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.040
Let's talk about Apple Configurator.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.730
So this is what you see when
you launch Apple Configurator.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.510
As you can see,
there are three main silos here.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.830
In general,
there are three major categories

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.630
of things that you can do
with Apple Configurator.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.820
On the left, you have Prepare Devices.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.220
Like I said,
you can set up a configuration,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.130
unbox your device, plug it in,
puts the configuration in there,

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:25.130
puts Wi-Fi in there, VPN, whatever,
restrictions on the device.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:31.360
It installs apps, automatically redeems
app codes on the device.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.530
Very convenient for that.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.260
In the middle column, there's Supervised.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:43.600
Now, Supervised devices is something that
we introduced in 5.0 and in iOS 5.0,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.440
and we have enhanced greatly in iOS 6.0.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.730
Supervised devices are
basically company-owned

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:58.010
devices that you can control to
a greater extent than you could

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.640
and I will be talking about how
you can bring your own device.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:06.780
And we'll talk about that
in a few slides down,

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:06.780
but it's a very cool mode that
you can put your iOS device into.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.280
And finally, there's assign.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.500
Assign devices is also very cool.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:17.000
You can actually associate a user
profile with an arbitrary device.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.620
So,
let me talk about that a little bit more.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.800
Let's say you have a classroom
and you have a pool of iPads.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.080
A student checks out an iPad.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:27.650
Uses it.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.200
Brings it back to the pool.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.470
When the iPad is brought
back to the pool,

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:36.500
configurator will grab all the app
data and configuration from that

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.890
iPad and store it on his hard drive.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:45.000
When the student comes back the next
time and checks out a different iPad,

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.600
Configurator takes that configuration
and puts it back on the new iPad.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.970
So it's as though they got the same iPad,
but it's not really.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.210
It's a different iPad that
looks exactly the same as

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.600
their iPad from the day before.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.190
So this is great where you have to
have a check-in/check-out system.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.870
So in some environments,
you have to assign a device to

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.070
somebody who's responsible for it.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.910
At the end of the day, check it back in.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.900
But they don't want to
buy an iPad for everyone.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.740
So this is a great solution for that.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.160
All right.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.810
So as you can see,
Apple configurator is good for managing,

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.940
is great for managing a
lot of devices at once.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.820
Mass configuration.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.280
Here's an example where these
are actually iPod touches.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.360
In a retail environment,
you check it out,

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.280
use it on the sales floor,
end of the day, bring it back.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.650
The configuration is restored.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.400
As it's recharging,
it can be used the next day.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.400
Now, imagine your app running there.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.430
So that's a new opportunity
for you as B2B developers.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.700
Apple Configurator can also manage
your app distribution for you.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.930
So Apple Configurator can
import that spreadsheet that

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.700
you saw a few slides back.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.610
They'll import it in.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.400
It installs the apps automatically.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.010
You can tell it, you know,
every time I plug in a device,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.490
install these apps, done.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.090
It will do it as you plug it in.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.460
And here's an interesting
thing that it can do that you

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.540
can only do on Configurator.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:30.430
It can redeem your app codes,
your redemption codes,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:34.290
against the device instead
of against an Apple ID.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.590
All right, let me say that again.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:45.020
It can redeem your app redemption
code on a per-device manner,

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:50.500
not on a per-Apple ID manner,
which means you don't have to

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:50.500
put an Apple ID on the devices.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:02.410
This is really powerful for no-touch
installation and for retail or education

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:09.020
or healthcare environments or hospitality
where you don't really want to type

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.500
things in on a screen to install an app.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.420
All right.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.270
So supervised devices,
let's talk about that.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.100
It's really cool.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.870
Supervised devices are
enterprise-owned devices,

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:22.480
right?

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.730
In contrast to bring your own device.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:29.240
So this is devices that are
bought by a company for its use.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.400
You can only supervise
a device at activation.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:38.260
Right, so you have to erase the device
or something or unbox it,

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.350
activate it into a supervised state.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.920
A supervised device will
not pair with iTunes,

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.140
which is a big deal in some cases.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:55.780
It will only talk to the computer
or the host that supervised it.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.680
Once you supervise a device,
you get access to a whole list of

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.280
capabilities that were not there before.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.010
Global HTTP Proxy, for one.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:13.420
You can funnel all the
HTTP and HTTPS traffic on the

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.360
device through a single proxy.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.700
Important for education,
important for healthcare.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:26.300
iBookstore, iMessage,
and Game Center from your device.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:30.570
And you'd like this one,
you can prevent app removal.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.290
With supervised devices,
you have access to a really

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:44.910
cool mode that we introduced in
iOS 6.0 called Single App Mode.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:57.060
This is a mode where the app takes
over the entire device experience.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.850
You cannot exit it using the home button.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.290
If you power it,
if you reboot the device,

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.100
it comes back to that app.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.700
You can't get out of it.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.130
You can get out of it by plugging
it back into the configurator

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.100
and taking it out of that mode.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.700
So here's a good example
for single app mode.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.840
It's a sales floor application,
so people can browse a sales catalog

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.000
right in the retail environment.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.430
You know people like to push buttons.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.440
And now you can lock
them into the app and,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:31.290
you know, you'll be assured that
there's no way out of the app.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.180
Single app mode, really powerful.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.190
Your app could be there.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.960
So I would like to invite
right now Todd Fernandez,

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:47.000
the project manager for the configurator,
Apple configurator, to give you a little

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.940
demo of what it can do.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:48.940
Todd?

00:32:53.900 --> 00:34:50.000
[Transcript missing]

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:55.100
And this is where if you have
devices that are out on a duty cycle,

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.430
whether they're going to guests in
a museum or a restaurant or hotel,

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.150
or maybe retail point of sale systems,
where a shared device is used by a

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.310
guest or an employee and then comes
back and you want to make sure it's

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.460
in the right state before it goes
out to the next guest or employee.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:15.630
Configurator will do that
automatically when you reconnect

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.630
the device via USB to that Mac.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.900
And finally, building on top of those
shared supervised devices,

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.970
the assign workflow allows you to
personalize those shared devices

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.100
for particular individual users.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.870
And I can add users and groups here,
either entering them manually or,

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.860
more likely, you can import them directly
from your directory,

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.200
whether it's open directory
or active directory.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.160
And main configurator,
when it sees that device

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.830
and checks it back in,
it will back up the user's data so that

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:46.130
the next time the user needs a device,
it can restore whichever physical device

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:50.890
it is to look exactly like that device
was the last time that user used it.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.210
All right, well,
let's get down to the business

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.820
of the demo and switch
back to the Supervised tab.

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.670
And I want to show you how
you can use Configurator to

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:01.460
help distribute your clients,
to help distribute your great

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:04.300
Custom B2B apps out to their end users.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:08.110
So as I mentioned,
I've got two supervised devices.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.300
And I've got a number of apps that
I've imported into the configurator.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.200
I've got free App Store apps
like Adobe Reader.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.460
I've got paid App Store apps
like Angry Birds.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.200
I have an Enterprise app.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:24.360
And as you can see with Angry Birds,
there seems to be something amiss here,

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:29.170
and that zero there is I do not have
any VPP redemption codes that would

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.240
allow me to distribute Angry Birds.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.260
However,
if you look down here in Numbers,

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.370
I actually have three codes,
which means I can install

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.360
Numbers on up to three devices.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.520
And I want to show you
how easy it is to do that.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.810
I have Goodreader here,
and it's just as easy as clicking the

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.060
plus button and selecting the app.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.900
It will import the app into Configurator,
which will warn me if I haven't

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.420
dismissed the warning alert
that I've imported a paid app,

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.360
and in order to distribute it,
I need to import redemption codes.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.590
It's really easy to do that too.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.200
I can just click on this lozenge
that shows me I have zero codes,

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.750
brings down the redemption code sheet,

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:16.670
And I can select my spreadsheet,
and if you can't see that, preview.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.690
This is just like the
spreadsheet that Dave showed you.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.710
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.640
And when I import that,
Configurator imports the codes

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.040
and will show them to me here as
well as as I start redeeming them.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.260
In fact, there's one in here that's
already been redeemed.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.250
There it is.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.490
So Configurator will show you
which ones have been redeemed,

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:40.100
and once you've assigned them to devices,
it will show you which device

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.480
that app has been distributed to.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.960
So great,
now I can see that I'll be able to

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:48.310
install Goodreader on my devices.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:50.790
And let's see.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.660
So now I want to show off some
of those features that Dave just

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.440
highlighted on supervised devices.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:00.880
And I've got something that is very
similar to the types of Custom B2B apps

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.650
that you may want to create.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.860
There's a Four Seasons app.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.740
I want to install that on my iPads.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.320
And I want to install a configuration
profile which is going to disable

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.040
Game Center and disable iMessage.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.950
As Dave mentioned,
these are two new restrictions

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:20.400
that are available in iOS 6
but only on supervised devices.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.580
And just with those two check boxes,
I've said that I want to update the

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:28.340
configuration for these devices to have
that app and that configuration profile.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.790
I click the Apply button.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.480
And I'm going to switch over
to the camera so you can see

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.030
what's going on on the device.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.590
And you may have just noticed,
Messages and

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:43.100
Game Center just disappeared.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.220
And if I switch over to page two,
there's my Four Seasons app.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:53.000
It's just that easy to configure
however many iPads you have

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.760
or iOS devices in general to
have the configuration you want.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.000
Let's come back to the Mac.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.400
And Dave also mentioned another
great new feature in iOS 6,

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.550
the ability to lock the iOS
device into a single app.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.170
This is again a great
pairing with Custom B2B apps,

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.940
including something like this hotel app,
if you want your guests only to

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.000
have access to that particular app.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.520
So that's a really quick tour
of how Apple Configurator

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.690
can help you distribute apps,
whether they're Custom B2B apps,

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.700
your clients to get them
out to their end users,

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.480
and hopefully buy lots
more copies of your apps.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:31.700
And one thing I wanted to mention,
if Dave's description and this

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.450
demo piqued your interest,
Apple Configurator is available

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.510
for free in the Mac App Store.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.420
There it is.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.560
And I hope you'll download
it and check it out.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.650
Thank you very much.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:49.770
Thanks, Todd.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.640
It's really cool.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.410
So Apple Configurator.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.710
It's really good.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:01.890
When you have a lot of iPads,
a lot of iPod Touches, a lot of iPhones,

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.930
use Apple Configurator to set them up.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.120
It's a great experience,
simplifies the life of the IT person or

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:16.890
whoever is in charge of setting this up,
and it helps you to maintain the

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.070
configuration of the device over time.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:18.070
It's important.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:23.880
We offer Supervised Mode for
enterprise-owned devices and gives you

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.590
access to all kinds of new restrictions
and capabilities that weren't

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.050
there with Bring Your Own Device.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.800
Single App Mode.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.480
A great way to showcase your app.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:45.250
And I hope you agree this represents
a new business opportunity for you as

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:51.100
developers of B2B apps to serve retail,
medical education,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:56.100
kiosk mode type things,
and a lot of other industries that

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.200
you are going to come up with.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.580
I cannot wait to see the
awesome apps that you're going

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:05.160
to produce for the B2B market.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.660
So that is Custom B2B.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.420
All right,
let's summarize by saying these are apps,

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:25.600
B2B apps, are apps that solve a
client's specific needs.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.540
You submit your app
through iTunes Connect,

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.060
just check that box.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.340
You can make your app
available only to your clients.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.700
It will not be shown in
the general App Store.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:42.390
You can add and remove
these Apple IDs over time.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.650
They can be purchased through
the Volume Purchas program.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.480
Very easy to get set up,
available to most businesses.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:55.930
It's easily distributed to end users,
including mass configuration

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:59.200
using Apple Configurator,
where you can redeem the

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:07.750
redemption codes against the
VPP Apple ID instead of having to

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.750
type in Apple IDs on the device.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:13.390
And it's a new business opportunity
for you to take advantage of.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.060
Here's some more information.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:18.940
Developing for B2B up here,
a little overview of that.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.490
Here's the VPP portal that
you can send your clients to

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.500
for them to get signed up.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.210
And of course the AppRoll
Developer Forums is a great

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:31.190
place to solve your problems
and talk to each other,

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.200
other developers.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.020
All right.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.090
Thank you very much for attending.
