WEBVTT

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.330
Good morning.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.540
I'm Randy Ubillos.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.800
And I'm Sam Roberts.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.700
And this morning we're going to talk
to you a bit about iPhoto for iOS.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.900
So this should be pretty fun.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.960
This is something that we
don't get to do all that often,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.520
which is to talk about a little
bit of the behind the scenes of

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.740
one of the products that we make.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.100
So this year, as you probably know,
we introduced iPhoto for iOS,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.520
and it was a complete ground-up,
fresh start of iPhoto done for iOS and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.540
done to take advantage of multi-touch.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.240
And that provided a lot of
different considerations than when

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.440
we do things on the desktop side.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.840
So--and it was a lot of opportunity
to do things in a very new way,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.600
which was pretty exciting.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.640
So we're going to talk about
this morning two things.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.490
First one,
we're going to talk about kind of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560
a few different pieces of the UI.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.520
And where we kind of started and where
we ended up and how we got there.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.200
And the process we use to refine
parts of the application and to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.350
hopefully give you some insight
into that and into ways that you can

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.760
use that in your own applications.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.370
We do this for every part of every app,
down to the smallest dialogue and to

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.800
the main parts of the application.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.420
We do this on a continuous basis,
all kind of all over the app.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.490
And then the second part,
we're actually going to talk about

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.320
how some of the animations were done,
how we put together the layers,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.620
how we set the animations up to
accomplish some of the things

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.920
that you see in iPhoto for iOS.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:06:54.300
[Transcript missing]

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:01.280
Now, contrast is interesting because
contrast is taking the left half,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.960
the parts below the middle and
the parts above the middle,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.450
and bending the middles of
those portions either toward the

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.440
center or away from the center.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.540
Anybody who's familiar with doing
this in something like Photoshop,

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.960
you'd use an S-curve and
you'd bend the S-curve.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.490
And what that has the effect of
doing is moving the lower and upper

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.040
brightnesses of the image either toward
the center or away from the center.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.430
But what we found was that all of these
things laid out along a single line.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.400
We had dark adjustments on the left,
bright on the right,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.740
brightness in the middle,
and then contrast in the

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.750
two halves between that.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.460
So we could lay these
out on a single line.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:51.100
So what the first kind of design revision
was to take and still have the histogram

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.800
over on the side and laid this out.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.960
And we said, OK,
you can touch this upper part

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.200
of the histogram and pull it
down to do highlight recovery

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.440
and up to do white point adjust.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.920
You can do shadows and black point by
touching the bottom of the histogram.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.710
You can touch the center of the
histogram and bend it up and

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.040
down to do a brightness adjust.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.800
And you can touch either of these
two areas and do a contrast adjust.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.000
Now, that reduces the number of
points where you're touching.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.010
But it also had the interesting
side effect that now we have no

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.640
affordances on this histogram.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.760
And people would look at it and say, oh,
that's a nice histogram.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.100
And oh, no,
you can adjust the brightness here.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.810
How do they know that?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.890
This went too far in the other direction.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.230
We actually didn't have anything
that was obvious to adjust.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.130
Now,
the other thing here is that we have--

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.780
this is a photo editing application.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.940
And you'll notice the photo is
occupying maybe 70% of the screen.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.280
And this is a really important point.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.200
With any kind of application,
whatever the main focus

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.890
of the application is,
you want that to occupy as

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.080
much of the screen as possible.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.950
It's one thing on a desktop application
when you've got expecting someone to

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.900
be working on a 20 or a 23 or 27-inch
monitor where there's plenty of room.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.050
Well, on mobile devices,
especially phones, but even the iPad,

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.380
there's not as much screen real
estate as there is on the desktop.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.660
So you want to use that very carefully.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.590
And you want to give up screen real
estate that you could put towards

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.460
the primary focus of the application.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.690
You want to give that up very cautiously,
only as needed.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.690
So we looked at this and said, OK,
we really-- what would be nice here is

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:47.360
if we took this space over on the side
and didn't use that for the histogram.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.700
If we took the histogram and instead
put it down along the bottom.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.480
And you can see we have
the same histogram,

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.320
kind of the same areas to touch on there.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.230
But what the nice thing is about
this is it gives us a nice,

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.520
big, giant image.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.580
And it makes it so you can
see your image a lot better.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.990
Now we had this control
down here at the bottom,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.900
and like the other ones that I've shown,
we had a histogram in it.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.900
And so we kind of stepped back and said,
"Okay, why do we need this histogram?"

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.020
A lot of photography applications
have a histogram in them,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.900
and, you know, why exactly do we need it?

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.900
What's the important parts here?

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.880
Well, a histogram shows you some
interesting things about an image.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.850
Like I said before,
this tells me that this image

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.900
has some brighter blue parts,
and the red and green parts

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.530
are not quite as bright,
which is interesting,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.890
but it doesn't really help you in
terms of adjusting or fixing the image.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:48.590
The part that's actually interesting for
fixing or adjusting the image is actually

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.900
just the end points of the histogram,
where those end points are.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.830
What that tells you, on the left side,
that tells me how close to black

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.900
are the darkest parts of my image.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.780
And on the right,
how close to pure white are the

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.890
brightest parts of my image.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.700
This is actually what's useful in
terms of image editing on an image.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.190
So given that, we said, "Well,
we don't really need to

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.900
show the histogram at all.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.900
We just need to show the ends
of what would be the histogram."

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.600
So taking all that together,
what we did is we combined

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.900
everything into a single control.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.900
We've got a single control that
has marks on it for 0% and 100%.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.900
On the left side -- or sorry,
in the center,

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.900
we put a brightness control.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.900
On the left side,
we put a single control.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.750
When I drag this control to the left,
I'm doing black level adjust.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.760
When I drag to the right,
I'm doing shadow recovery.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:57.890
And the initial position of that knob is
where the left end of the histogram is.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.900
We do the same thing on the right side.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.900
So highlight recovery is dragging left.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.890
White level adjust is dragging right.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:11.850
And the initial position of that knob
shows me the right end of the histogram.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.100
So we've been able to
combine those six -- well,

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.620
brightness in the center,
but the six controls into the two

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:24.900
on the two ends and put them in
a much more usable configuration.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.890
Then we also took the contrast
knobs and put those in kind of

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.900
the corresponding areas to where
they correspond to in the image.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.540
And then we also -- the one thing
that I talked about initially that

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.840
we haven't shown so far is clipping.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.450
How do you show when an
adjustment the user is going

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.260
to make is clipping the image,
is cutting off some of the darks

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.900
or cutting off some of the lights?

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.900
We actually do that by -- when the
knob is dragged into that range,

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.900
since the knob represents the edge of
the brights and darks of the image,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.900
when we drag into the end zones,
they glow red as you drag into them.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.620
We do that all on a single control.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.370
And so what we're able to do is put
this all down into the lower toolbar

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.900
and have a single control that gives
all these different operations.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.340
Let me just give you a quick demo of how
that actually works in the application.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.680
We'll switch to an image here.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:28.060
So we have this image,
and if I bring up my exposure control,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:34.020
you can see that the ends of
the control are not all the

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.890
way at the 0 and 100% marks,
because this image does not--

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.600
actually has a reduced range.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.170
The blackest parts of the
image are still kind of gray,

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.680
and the brightest part of
the image is not pure white.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.500
But I can grab these controls.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.870
If I grab the control here
and move it up or down,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.500
when I move it down,
I'm adjusting the black level down.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.100
As I move into the end area,
you'll see that it starts to glow red,

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.000
because it's not necessarily
incorrect for someone to

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.750
clip off some of the blacks.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.940
They may want to do that.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.170
You just want to warn them that
this is an area where they have

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.900
to make a creative decision.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:15.000
And when I grab the right side,
I can bring that up to white.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.490
And so you can actually see
the difference between the

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.600
original and the changed one
as I've made those adjustments.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.550
Now,
let me come down to another image here,

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.100
which is really dark.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.800
And you'll notice on this image,
the darks go all the way to black,

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.410
all the way to the left,
so the knob starts out all

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.060
the way there at the left.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:40.630
And the brightest parts of the image,
the lights and such,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.570
actually go all the way to 100%. So here,
if I grab the left-hand knob

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.930
and I drag it to the right,
what I'm actually doing

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.800
is shadow correction.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.070
I'm not just bringing up the black level,
I'm doing a shadow correction.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.330
The nice thing here is that
from the user's perspective,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.980
they just get to think about
the dark parts of the image

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.760
should be darker or lighter.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.870
And we do the right math underneath
the covers to achieve that.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.300
We don't force the user
to make the distinction,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.600
oh, in this case,
I need to use this slider.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.370
In this other case,
I need to use this other slider.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.020
We merge that all together into a
single control and make it really

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.930
easy for the user to do that.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.010
So next thing I want to
talk about is brushes,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.230
because we've got some nice
brushes in the application.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.440
So initial sort of stab at
this was something that would

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.080
look more like what a sort of
desktop-like experience might be.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.500
We started out with, well,
you can add these different bricks

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.860
for the different operations.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.670
You can add a brick
for lighten or darken.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.810
But that makes the user have
to make those decisions as they

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.710
go along and then actually add
those bricks in as they work.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.400
And it complicates the UI quite a bit.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.990
So second stab was to just take the
brushes that the user would most likely

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.820
want to use and just make those available
all the time so that they can just touch

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.360
on one of the brushes and start using it.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.500
Well, that's an improvement,
but once again,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.760
we have the issue here that the
image is not as big as it could be.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.040
So if we take those controls and
move them down along the bottom,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.310
that's better.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.450
But now we're in a situation where
we have these icons down here,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.950
and we're trying to represent in these
icons that these are painting operations,

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.820
and we're trying to make
up icons for things like

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.990
lighten and darken and repair,
and it can be hard to

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.360
get those to stand out.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:45.680
So the thing that we came to was,
as you may have seen,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.460
we've got these nice brushes that pop up.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.540
And these are very
familiar looking to a user.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.290
One of the nice things here is that
we decided that it was okay while

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.590
you're selecting a brush to break
the boundary of that lower toolbar.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.800
As the brushes come up,
you can see that the lower toolbar

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:01.800
is the boundary of the lower toolbar.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:01.800
And you can see that the lower toolbar
is the boundary of the lower toolbar.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:01.800
And you can see that the lower toolbar
is the boundary of the lower toolbar.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:01.850
And you can see that the lower toolbar
is the boundary of the lower toolbar.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.150
And you can see that the lower toolbar
is the boundary of the lower toolbar.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.430
The brushes go up above the toolbar.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.520
We dim out the rest of the
interface to make the brushes pop.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.600
The user makes a selection,
and then the brushes

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.560
tuck down into the UI,
down into the bottom bar there.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.500
Another thing that we did with
the brushes was multi-touch is

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.660
really powerful for painting.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.330
It feels really good to use your
finger as you're painting on the image.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:31.580
But in a lot of painting applications,
there are a bunch of controls for things

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.170
like like the opacity of the brush,
the size of the brush,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.380
the softness of the brush,
and that just complicates the experience.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.060
So we step back and said,
how can we make that easier?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.780
Well, first off,
if we say that the size of

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.160
your finger is constant,
then we can just say when you zoom in,

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.420
then your finger stays
the same on screen,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.420
but now occupies a smaller
portion of the zoomed image.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.520
So brush size is simply
done by zooming in.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.260
And in fact,
one of the lesser known features

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.550
of the app is that if you pinch
together to zoom all the way back

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.800
out to seeing the entire image,
if you pinch beyond that where

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.350
the image kind of shrinks down and
hold it there for half a second,

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.440
the image will actually
snap a little bit smaller.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.080
So it actually lets you make the image
even smaller so you can make your

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.280
finger work even on an even larger area.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.850
Subtitles by the Amara.org community
So that was our way of allowing the brush

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.180
to have a lot of different range to it.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.180
The other thing we did is we set the
brushes up to operate fairly lightly,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.910
and they overlap each other.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.590
The brushes keep,
as you rub your finger back and forth,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.500
they keep adding to it.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.530
So instead of having a lot
of paint applications where

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.560
the brush is very strong,
you make a swipe and then you end up

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.840
having to erase almost immediately
and then turn the brush down.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.710
We set them to work very softly.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.000
So the idea is that when you're
going to change somebody's face,

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.370
you just rub over it a few times.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.300
It feels very natural.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.000
You rarely have to go back and erase.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.630
The other thing you run into
with a painting application is

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.980
that if you're trying to get
something right along an edge,

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.530
the problem you run into is that your
finger is over the top of the edge that

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.780
you're trying to get right up against.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.020
And we looked at different
solutions to that,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.030
like putting a circle around where your
finger was so you could kind of see it.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.320
But that all felt like we were just
sort of band-aiding the problem.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.110
Subtitles by the Amara.org community
And what we ended up solving

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:29.000
was down in the lower right we
have this detect edges button.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.120
We wrote some code that
actually when you turn that on,

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.430
wherever you touch,
we pick up the color and lightness

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.440
of the spot you touch on and we
restrict painting from that point,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.800
for that stroke,
to only affect things within a certain

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.540
range of that lightness and color.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.360
So what it means is you can
touch down on something.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.740
It's sort of like automatic
color within the lines.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.380
And you can just run your
finger back and forth very

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.960
quickly and it stays just fine.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.360
And then you can adjust on that color.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.260
So we let the application figure
out where the edges are instead

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.480
of forcing the user to do that.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.860
So that was some of the solutions
we used for the paint function.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.010
So next up I'm going to turn it
over to Sam to talk about color.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.120
Good morning.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.340
Thanks for waking up early with
us to talk about iPhoto for iOS.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.140
Color is a really important part
about manipulating an image,

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.160
and there's a lot of ways to do it.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.690
And some of the lessons that
we learned when we created this

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.270
feature for iPhoto for iOS,
I think some of these lessons might be

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.840
able to apply to some of the amazing
apps that you guys are working on.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.360
So I'd like to share
some of that with you.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.360
Like I said,
there's a ton of ways to adjust color.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.000
If you use Photoshop or any sort of
professional image editing application,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.600
you know there are loads
and loads of tools.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.440
And presenting our user,
especially the iPhoto user,

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:53.360
with a ton of tools to adjust color,
that was the wrong approach.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.370
Our users, we knew they could get quickly
sort of overwhelmed with

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.050
a whole bunch of controls.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:02.340
So our first challenge with
color was to step back and say,

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.060
"Okay, well,
what are the most common things,

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:10.160
what are the most common color needs
that our users have?" And we narrowed it

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.230
down to more or less these four controls.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.040
The first one is overall color,
saturation, how much color do we want?

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.440
And then we sort of found three
other areas that were really common.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.360
A lot of people would say, "Well,
I want the blue sky of my image

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.540
to be a little bit different." Or,
"You know, the skin tone of this image

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.540
just looks a little off.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.380
I want to be able to
adjust that." And then,

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.240
of course, also the greenery.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.230
So that was the first step was to say,
"Yes, we have a ton of controls,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.770
but do we really need them all?

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.800
A ton of functions?

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.960
No, let's find the functions that work
for the 80% case." This is something

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.280
that we say a lot to ourselves.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.780
What's the 80% case?

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.920
Let's solve for that.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.200
Let's not try and figure out one thing
that's going to work for everyone.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.800
So this was our first stab at color.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.530
And it's OK.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.680
The controls are few,
but the controls are actually

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.940
a little bit technical.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.000
As you can see,
for each one of these areas,

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.040
you sort of had to move on two axes
to sort of adjust the luminance and

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.210
then the amount of that color space.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.060
That was cool, but that was a little bit
complicated for a user.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.840
So our next step was to say, OK,
let's take those four good ideas

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.450
and let's simplify those controls.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.620
Let's do some smart
math behind the scenes.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.360
I'm a designer,
so I let the geniuses do the math,

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.200
and I just designed the controls.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.230
And they figured out a way to say, OK,
well, less saturation means this,

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.700
more saturation means that.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.450
So we got it into sort of one,
you could say,

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.760
axis for each one of these controls.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.530
So this is significantly simpler, right?

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.140
If I want more color,
I simply drag left or right on

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.820
the saturation control over there,
and I can adjust the color.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.320
So now we're starting to get somewhere.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.670
Now we have sort of an easier experience,
which is what our customers want.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:56.810
But as Randy said before,
we still have a problem with this design.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.320
This is a photo editing app.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.220
The user started this app because
they want to play with their photos.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.960
But we're giving them all of this Chrome,
all of this UI,

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.280
that's sort of getting in the way.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.140
I really want to drive this home.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.800
You guys are making great apps.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:15.940
And the main purpose of your app
should always dominate the screen.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.970
Your users didn't buy
your app for the Chrome,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.780
for the controls that you created.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:25.380
They bought it to be able to do what
they want to do with their content.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.380
This was really central.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.890
So as soon as we sort of realized that,
we got that image much

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.130
bigger on the screen.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.620
Gosh, this felt so much better.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.100
We put those same controls
down along the bottom.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.160
Now we're really talking.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.510
I've got this big image, simple controls.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.680
Here we are.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.040
But--

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:49.720
The benefit of continuing to push
our UI brought us to a place that

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.190
we wouldn't have seen otherwise.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.340
Something that we
constantly say is simplify,

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.660
refine, repeat.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.890
Simplify, refine, repeat.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.890
That's really important.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.840
If we hadn't have kept doing that,
we wouldn't have gotten to this.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.100
Because we realized something.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.820
As soon as we had that big image--
I was using the app one day.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.340
And they said, you know,
I just want to edit

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.200
this part of my image.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.940
And I was pointing to that
part of the image and I said,

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.140
"Wait a minute,
we have a touchscreen interface here.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.060
We have an amazing piece of hardware.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.460
We've got a nice big photo.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:26.060
What if I could just point to the
thing that I want to edit and I could

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.780
edit it right on top of the image?"

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.540
If we had a smaller image,
that wouldn't be realistic.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.030
If we had complicated controls,
no one would ever try to do that.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.940
But now, you just simply tap on
a part of the image,

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.420
drag, and you get to adjust the image.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.200
It's really simple.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.320
And as you do that,
you can see at the bottom there,

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.350
the controls of sort of the
area that you're tapping appear.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.380
In other words, they show you sort of an
educational aspect of the UI.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.300
It says, OK, if you drag up and down,
you can adjust the saturation.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.390
And if you drag left or right,
you can adjust the blue skies.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.590
And we repeated that, of course,
for each control.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.810
So if I tapped on some
of those green areas,

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.160
you would get the green control
at the bottom highlighted.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.760
And then you could just
drag left and right.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.430
Put some controls on top of your content.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.410
That's where people want to go.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.520
That's where you should
put some of your controls.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.760
And speaking of repeating,
we were able to bring this idea

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.520
back to the exposure controls that
Randy was showing you earlier.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.920
So you could simply tap on
a dark area of the screen.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.530
Or a dark area of the image.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.020
And drag up to adjust your shadows.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.920
This is where design that's simplified,
refined, repeat, keep doing that,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.390
can get you to a space where
the UI almost disappears.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.480
And there's very little space
between the user and the content,

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.240
the function that they want to do.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.560
So I want to show you how
this color control works.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.810
So can we get the iPad up?

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.160
Great.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.790
So let's go over,
let's clear out the controls.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.910
Let's go to my color controls.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.750
And here we have an image.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.990
You can see the controls have
come up on the bottom there.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.090
And I could drag these down at
the bottom very easily and adjust

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.300
the amount of color in my image.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.350
But the cool part is I can say,
you know what,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.870
I want that blue sky to be better.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.320
So I can just tap on the blue sky,
my control comes up.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.600
Now there's a little bit of subtlety
that I want you to notice here.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.970
You can see there's two axes.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.780
But we didn't want to complicate
things by having both axes

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.000
available all the time.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.680
So once the user starts
to move in a direction,

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.200
you're going to see the other arrow sort
of disappear and the arrow that I chose

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.100
sort of move with me and then fade away.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.330
So, for example,
I'm going to drag to the left and

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.940
you're going to see the saturation
arrows sort of fade away as I do that.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.850
And now I'm adjusting the blue of
that image so I can get a nice,

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.600
deep, beautiful color.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.590
This is the power of putting the
control right where the user is.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.600
So I can see that the user expects
it right on top of the photo.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.600
So let's try it again.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.590
This time we're going to
do some exposure work.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.490
Let's see,
where's that good lighthouse photo?

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.510
Let's play with this one.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.600
In fact,
let's reset the exposure on this one.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.600
And that bottom area you
can see is a bit dark.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:17.020
So as you would expect,
I can simply tap right on that area

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.480
and drag up to fix the shadows.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.400
It's really simple.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.600
It's really simple and it almost
feels magical to the user.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.600
And that's what we want.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.550
We want an easy to use, fun interface.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.600
Just tap on your image.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.600
It's really powerful.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.600
So that's the color controls.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.300
So let's talk about effects.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.000
I love effects.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.380
I take mediocre photos,
and those photos look awesome

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.560
with some really great effects.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.760
Let's be honest, we all do that.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.160
So effects are really important.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.490
There's a couple of other people
here who take mediocre photos.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.590
Great.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.250
So the first thing that we started
with with effects was a bunch of

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.640
really beautiful-looking effects,
right?

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.700
So some really nice vintage looks,
some black and white,

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.170
some really creative sort of
manipulations with the color.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.620
Really gorgeous, gorgeous effects.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.700
And we set ourselves up
with three challenges.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.180
This is something that you guys
should be doing with any piece

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.540
of UI that you're presented with.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.090
Figure out, all right,
how can I make this great?

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.190
What are the challenges?

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.200
What can I set as the
goal as I create this UI?

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:31.610
Okay, so the first challenge-- well,
the first challenge was actually,

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.180
you know, pretty simple.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:38.000
We wanted to say, okay,
how can we get all of these amazing

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.140
options available to the user?

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.700
So I'm gonna give you guys a quiz.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.660
And you're all smart.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.700
You're all very smart.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.200
I'm willing to bet you're
gonna get this right.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.700
Let's say I have 24 amazing effects,
all right?

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.690
In fact, here they are.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.190
There's a grid.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.830
You can see there's six of them here,
and you can see just the

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.700
bottom of the next seven,
eight, and nine effects.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:59.700
Here's my question.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.980
Which six effects are
gonna be the most popular?

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.100
Yeah, these six.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.930
Presenting our effects as a grid
wouldn't have helped the user.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.600
So that was one of our first
sort of big challenges,

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.720
was to figure out how do we get all these
effects to the user in a way that they're

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.450
going to be able to see all of them.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:24.650
We couldn't expect that they
would explore around and see,

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.370
oh, okay, well,
I found the 45th effect and I love it.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:26.370
We couldn't assume that.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.620
The next one, and actually,
this was the hardest one,

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.950
and I really encourage you to do
this as you're creating your apps and

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:37.740
creating a piece of UI for something,
for a function that might be complicated.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.440
And this one I can blame on Randy,
actually.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.740
Randy said, "Okay, Sam,
you can design this UI,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.560
but here's the requirement.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.020
I want the user to be able to
choose an effect and refine

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.610
that effect in 10 seconds."

00:29:54.400 --> 00:31:19.400
[Transcript missing]

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.120
But it would have also
given us complexity.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.900
Power and complexity,
that's not what we're after.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.680
What we want is simplicity and power.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.120
So why is this complicated?

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.890
Well, it's three sliders.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.930
But not only that,
the user would be required to

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.520
understand that you had to balance
these three sliders to always equal 100.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.580
So it's not like they could
just adjust one slider.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.740
They'd have to be constantly adjusting
all three to get the look that they want.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.440
And guess what?

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.450
There's a ton-- you guys
are math geniuses-- there's

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.120
a ton of options out there.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.680
And it would take forever for them to
see all of the different possibilities.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:56.390
So we said, OK,
how do we solve this problem?

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.090
Well, with those three channels,
we sort of plotted the

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.040
possibilities out on a graph.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.630
We said, "Okay, well,
here's a whole bunch

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.440
of really nice looks.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.120
We'll plot them on a graph,
draw a line between them,

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.340
almost like a timeline." And that
actually turns out a lot of really,

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.610
really great options.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:15.640
Okay, so just sort of left and right,
you can see the different options.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.640
We take that, actually make that the UI.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.990
So, in fact, one swipe from left to right

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.980
brings you through all of the black
and white mixing possibilities.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.620
So what did we do?

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.380
We took three controls that you
had to understand the balance of,

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.770
put them all into one control,
and allowed the user in just a few

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:42.560
seconds to swipe back and forth and see
over a hundred different mixes of this.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.540
In fact,
we called this the happy accident UI.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.360
I always go through this and find one
that I never would have thought of,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.520
and I love the look of it.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.380
So this was taking a
complex idea and really,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.880
really simplifying it down
into one easy to use control.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.120
And this control worked elsewhere.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.890
So for example,
we have another one called Aura.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.850
Aura's a really neat effect.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.220
It allows you to sort of
highlight the strong colors in

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.740
your photo or sort of demote,
you could say,

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.130
those same colors in your photo.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.040
And so again, we took that same sort of
plot the monograph idea,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.380
creates a bunch of different images,
and then of course,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.270
you can simply swipe in
between them and get over a

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.090
hundred different permutations,
a hundred different options

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.480
of that same effect.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:23.360
One control.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.520
One control.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.300
Hundreds of possibilities that
you can see in just a few seconds.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.850
This is the kind of UI that people love.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.430
It's so easy to get a great result.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.340
This is what every piece of
UI that you guys are working on,

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.670
every single piece,
strive to make it as simple as possible.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:44.020
I promise you,
your users will love you for it.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.220
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.360
There's a few effects, well,
you can't really fade between,

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.060
for example, vintage effects.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.680
And you're right.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.840
We don't fade through vintage effects,
but the good news is,

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.670
the same piece of UI can be
used in sort of the same way.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.600
For example, we have four options here.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:03.180
We just call this sort of a discrete
version of the effects card,

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.900
and you can swipe left or right.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:10.560
And in this case,
you're selecting a specific effect.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.340
OK, so we figured out how
to refine the image.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.440
So that was the first challenge.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.980
Now, if you remember,
one of the other challenges was, OK,

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.100
well, how do we present all of these
options so we don't ask the

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:22.680
user to scroll through a bit?

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.910
Or through a big, gigantic grid,
or through a list that we can't

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.440
assume that they're going to do?

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.000
Well, the answer is actually
already in front of us.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.890
As you saw at the top
of the screen right now,

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.230
in fact, there's a card that came across.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:38.340
We used that card idea and created
sort of like a swatch book.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.130
So when the user goes into effects,
they're presented with a

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.190
swatch book of effects.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.000
And you can see little previews in there,
which is great, but you can also see sort

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.500
of the category name.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.400
And even better, that category,
the card that you click on,

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.520
folds back down.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:57.550
And to the bottom of the UI,
and that becomes the UI that you use.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.340
So now we've solved the second problem.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.860
The first one was how to refine.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.620
The second one was, OK,
how do we get all these options in front

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.300
of the user as quickly as possible?

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.410
All right,
so the third one was a timing issue.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.960
So let's do a demo and let's
see how easy we have it.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.440
So let's find a nice image.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.240
Let's go with this one.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.690
And I'm going to clear the effects out.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.400
Okay, so let's bring up the effects.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.650
You can see that this animates up.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.040
And by the way,
stay tuned because Randy's going to

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.700
come back up and talk to you about
some of the fundamentals of animation

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.700
and how he got some of these really
nice little UI animations to work.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.700
Really, really useful.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.700
So I presented with my different options.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.700
I think I'll choose black
and white for this one.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.680
And watch this.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.700
In one swipe, I can see all the different
versions of black and white.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.630
In fact, here's the one right here.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.580
I love it.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.700
I can even tap and get a nice vignette.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.550
I can even do some on-screen controls,
just pinch on top of the image

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.700
to get a stronger vignette.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.700
And now I've convinced
myself that I'm Ansel Adams.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.700
Now that was less than 10 seconds, right?

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:08.700
This is why you guys should
keep looking at your controls.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.670
The controls that you think are good,
keep going until they're great.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:14.700
I promise you.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.670
Your users are going to thank you for it.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.700
All right, let's try one more photo.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.700
How about this one?

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.700
This is a fun one with the elephant.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.650
I'm going to choose a different effect.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.030
And by the way,
I can just open up the cards by just

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.690
tapping on the little hinge here.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.690
Again, Randy's going to explain that.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.700
We'll choose the aura effect,
and I can drag left and right.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.700
I can bring it to the left to
sort of mute some of those colors.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.700
Or if I bring it to the right,
something kind of neat happens.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.700
It just highlights those strong colors.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.840
So by the end of it,
I'm only showing you those beautiful

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.700
silk fabrics on top of the elephant.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.700
So that's effects.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.610
We think effects turned out pretty cool.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.100
All right, so let's go back.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.900
Thank you.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.180
Let's go back to the slides.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.990
And let's talk about moving
from the iPad to the iPhone.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.990
You guys are eagle-eyed,
and you notice that every comp that

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.680
we've shown you has been for the iPad.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.840
And indeed,
when we started with this project,

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.440
we wanted it on the iPad with a big,
amazing screen.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.860
But then there was the point
where we said to ourselves,

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.550
"Guess what?

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.340
I take a lot of pictures with my iPhone.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.940
I think we need to have
this app on the iPhone."

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.600
Now,
different apps should be thinking about

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.640
this a little bit differently when
you go from one device to another.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.340
Not every app should do the same thing.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.900
So I want to talk to you about why
we made the decision that we made.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.350
We could have gone down
the path of saying,

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:39.240
this is a great app.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.260
We want it on the iPhone,
but there's just too much stuff.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.460
Let's make it a simple app.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.240
Maybe we'll change the
UI to make it really,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.640
really, really simple.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.100
And, you know,
users will just have to go find an iPad

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.660
if they want some of the cooler stuff.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.160
Like, nah, we won't do brushing or
any of those effects.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.560
You know,
the truth was is that iPhone is one of

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.470
the most popular cameras on the planet.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:02.660
There's a lot of people who want to edit
their photos right on that same device.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.240
So the option of saying,
let's do a dumbed-down

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.360
version for the iPhone,
it just wasn't realistic.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.150
So we had sort of a
challenge in front of us.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.950
How can we get all of this power,
all of this power,

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.640
down on this tiny little screen
that can fit in your pocket?

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:23.920
Well, if you've been listening to me,
you've been hearing me say, "Simplify,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.490
refine, repeat." You'll probably
hear it a few more times,

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.020
just so you know.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:32.800
That process has many benefits,
and one of them is that when

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.860
you move from one device and you
need to bring your application

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.840
down to a different device,
you're going to have a much easier time

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:42.100
if you've simplified those controls.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.490
If you have complex controls that
you can just barely fit on the iPad,

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.040
you're going to have a problem
when you get to a smaller screen.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.240
Since we had gone through this process
of getting these controls simple,

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.340
we had actually a surprisingly easy
time getting it to work on the iPhone,

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.340
and it's really powerful.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:05.280
Every single feature that's
on the iPad is on the iPhone.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.750
So, how did we do it?

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.530
Well, there were actually a couple areas
where we had to rethink things.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.620
So, for example,
you've seen the tool controls

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:12.790
on the iPad at the bottom.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.760
You have this little tool bar.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.150
You can see there on the left,
those are your, you know,

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.610
sort of tools that you can select.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:19.350
And then when you select one,
those tools sort of

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.240
flip over on the right.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.480
Well, on the iPhone,
we don't have enough room for that,

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.700
so we had to think of
something different.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.970
So there's those tools for the iPad.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.320
On the iPhone, what we did was we sort of
had a collapsible tool bar,

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.160
you could say.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.200
So you can see the little
control on the left there,

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.290
the little sort of tool box icon.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.980
You tap the tool box and
the controls come out.

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.490
You select a control and they go away.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:46.440
So this was sort of a simple--we
realized that the answer wasn't

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.880
particularly complicated.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.880
We just needed to make sure that
we were doing the right thing.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.030
Cramming a whole bunch of controls on the
iPhone would have been the wrong thing.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.200
Some of the other areas where we had a
little bit of a challenge was portrait.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.290
So on the iPad,
we have controls that work in

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.540
both landscape and portrait.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.500
We knew that we needed to have
the same thing on the iPhone.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.100
On the iPad and portrait,
we still have a pretty

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.990
good amount of space.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.150
So for example,
these really great exposure

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.160
controls that Randy showed you,
they can fit on the iPad

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.200
in portrait mode just fine.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.360
But on the iPhone,
there just wasn't room for them.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.400
We didn't want our users to have to,
you know, use tiny little fingers

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.470
to get things to work.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.020
So the solution actually
wasn't very complicated.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.520
We split the controls up.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.860
So for example, there's three at the
bottom that you can see:

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.490
highlights and shadows,
then the brightness,

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.110
and then the contrast controls.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.450
You tap one of those,
an overlay comes up above it,

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.520
and you get that very control.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.620
We did the same thing on the
color controls on the iPad.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.460
We have those great
sliders at the bottom.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.400
We just split them up onto the phone.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.290
The reason I want to show you guys
this stuff is because I don't want

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.920
you to force your users to relearn
a UI when they go to a new device.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:01.850
If they go from an iPad to an iPhone,
don't ask them to relearn something.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.260
Use the same ideas.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:07.460
If the exact same control won't fit,
use something that they're going

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.310
to know how to use right away.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.740
Now the final one that I want
to leave you with was brushes.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.440
So brushes,
we love the brushing feature and we

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.140
absolutely had to have it on the iPhone.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.890
And we could fit those brushes really
beautifully in landscape on the iPhone,

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:25.400
but in portrait was really the problem.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.880
So being the designer that I am,
I went through a whole bunch of options.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.030
I had them sort of fanned
out in different ways.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:35.040
I had them,
a kind of strange rotating option.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.090
I had them angled at a different way.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.660
I had all these options and I walked
into Randy's office and I said,

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:44.700
"Okay, well I have a couple solutions for
you for this problem of showing

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.790
brushes when you're in portrait.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.660
I want to show them to you."
And Randy looked at me and said,

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.330
"Oh, I already solved that."

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.740
You solved it?

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.440
Can I go home early?

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.290
What does this mean?

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.650
What do you mean you solved it?

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.980
He said, "I just put him on the left."

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:22.400
[Transcript missing]

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.900
So I want to talk a little
bit about animation design.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.060
And we're just going to start
out with the toolbar and actually

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.100
jump right back to a demo.

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:41.090
So what I'm going to do here,
switch back to the demo machine,

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:47.610
is I happen to have a special version
here that has a magic WWDC demo switch.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.260
And you guys don't have that?

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.100
So what I'm going to show-- now,
here's a feature some of you

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.930
may or may not know about.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.060
I'm going to double tap
here with three fingers.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:01.060
And I can then zoom in
and pan around in the UI.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.310
This is turned on through
the accessibility settings

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:05.600
on the phone and the pad.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:09.400
And it can be really useful for
zooming in on your UI and taking

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.270
a look at different parts of it.

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:14.920
Another thing-- I don't know
if you can see this or not.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:18.010
This is something-- I bought a couple
of dozen of these and passed them out

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.030
to all the engineers and QA on the team.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.020
This is a little 10x magnification loop.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.220
You can pick these up online
for a couple of bucks.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.680
Passed them out to everybody.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.720
With the high resolution
screens that we're dealing

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:31.430
with on iOS and now on the Mac,
these are invaluable.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.320
Put them up on the screen,
peer through it,

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:38.040
and you can see exactly right down to
those tiny little pixels what's going on.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.580
This is another way to do it as well.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:44.250
So let's choose a different image here.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.280
So let me just show you
on the toolbar here.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.510
So toolbar kind of rotates around.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.890
We actually went to a bit of work.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.020
What I've done here
with that magic switch,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.320
this slows down all the
animations by a factor of 10.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.000
So when I go ahead and tap
and show the tool here,

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.120
you'll notice the tool rotates.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.420
And it doesn't just rotate.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.060
It actually rotates and
then goes a little past and

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.320
kind of ratchets into view.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.090
So those little details,
when it's at normal size,

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.710
you don't really notice it,
but it definitely adds to sort of the

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:19.810
realism of this sort of 3D look that
we were going for in the application.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:46:40.000
[Transcript missing]

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:45.200
Now let me go ahead and give
you a demo of the brushes.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.540
And another feature of this special
version that I have here is that

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:56.790
what it does is it's actually
going to move the brushes up.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.370
and so you can kind of see
how they all go together.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.990
Now,
one of the things we've turned on here,

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:08.900
one of the options on a CA layer is
a border color and a border width.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:13.330
And so you can enable that and it
can be very helpful to allow you to

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:17.260
see where your layers are on screen,
even if they have large

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.900
transparent portions of them.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.610
You can see how far they extend
and it can be a real time saver

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:24.900
and problem solver to work with.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.180
But in this case,
it actually lets you see

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:28.900
what's going on there.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.900
Now, if I touch on one of the brushes,
there's several things that happen.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.850
There's the center point
down at the bottom,

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:37.900
which we actually just animate the
center point from the original position

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.900
from the nib up to a central point.

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.900
We change the angle of each brush.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.070
And then on the text,
you'll notice the text stays perfectly

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.830
horizontal as the animation is happening.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:53.880
So we're just applying the opposite angle
to the text as we perform the animation.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.890
So when I tap on one of the brushes here,
the text stays together,

00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:59.900
the anchor points just move out.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.410
And then we actually
change the view ordering,

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.600
or we change the clip to bounds
property on the toolbar and

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.900
the ordering of that view.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:13.290
So when we tap on one of
these to start the animation,

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.930
we bring it to the front and
then animate the center points

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.900
together as it comes up.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.900
Like that.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.540
Now,
one of the things that you'll notice,

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.660
when I tap on one of these brushes,
there's actually a

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:25.890
subtlety to the animation.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.900
So I'm going to tap on the lighten brush.

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.190
And as I do that,
the one I've tapped on is actually

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.900
going to get a little bit bigger.

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.900
It's going to pop as it's coming down.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.810
And the shadow is actually
moving accordingly.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.030
So as I touch that,
you'll notice that lighten brush

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.900
actually extends outside the
boundary of the other layer there.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.040
So there's actually this extra
animation that's done when you

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.880
touch on a brush to confirm that
that's the one that you touched on.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:54.900
But there's a complexity there in that
we've got two different animations going.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:58.710
And one animation is the one
that's changing with the angle.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.900
And the other one is that
pop effect that happens.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.970
We can go back to the slides.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:08.340
So there's actually a
really easy way to do that.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.640
You let Core Animation do
the work for you.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.150
So if we had this one view
with the animations on it,

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:18.180
if I tried to put two different
sets of animations on that view with

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.360
potentially different durations,
different offsets in time,

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.890
that can be really complicated
to work that all out.

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:27.510
The easy thing to do is to
simply insert another view.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.610
Now, this is a view just
for geometry purposes.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.450
There's no drawing that
actually takes place in this.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.430
But what it means is I can put
one set of animations on one view,

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.700
the other set of animations
on the other view,

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:42.280
completely different durations,
different offsets in time,

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.260
and just let it run.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.410
And Core Animation will do
all the work of combining

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:46.820
those things together for you.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:52.070
And you can extend this to as many views
as you want to do compound animations.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:56.780
So let's go back and to the demo machine.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.380
I want to show you one more thing here.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:06.000
So I'm going to go ahead
and switch over to effects.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.560
Now, so on the effects,
we've got something similar in here,

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.670
where the effects are actually going
to come up to a different position than

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.130
normally that you'd have in the UI.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.690
And we have the same red
outlines around the views.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.500
One of the nice things about
Core Animation is that it makes

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.500
it really easy to take real
world objects and animate them.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.600
We've got these cards,
and we set them up.

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:30.600
We just set the anchor point
at the point where that pin is.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:35.330
And then when we set an angle,
the card rotates right around the pin.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.480
So if you lay out the animations
such that they're similar to the real

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.340
world object in the way it moves,
it makes it much easier to

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.390
actually perform the animations.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.560
Now, we've got a couple of things here.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.890
If I select one of the cards,
like the first card, the artistic card,

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.240
you notice all the other ones fall down.

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.700
And this is a detail that you
don't normally see in the UI.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:59.200
The resting position of all those
cards is not all straight down.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.360
It's slightly off.

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.900
They're offset from each other.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.040
And what that does is it gives
you that nice little kind of

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:09.560
fanned effect at the tail ends of
the cards right around the pin.

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:14.290
And you get a very realistic sort of
effect by just being careful about where

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.640
the resting position is on the cards.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.570
Now, if I bring the cards up,
one other subtlety that I want

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:26.190
to show you here is that when
I choose a particular card,

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.200
when a card deck folds like this,
it folds in two parts.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.990
So when I touch on a card,
you've got the cards collapsing together

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.760
and then the other cards moving apart.

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:41.050
So we just had to split the
animation up into two pieces.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:44.110
One piece animates all the cards
that are going together in the stack,

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.180
and the other one animates all the
ones that are going down below.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:50.080
And we just set the timings on
those so that they look like they're

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.750
moving at about the same velocity.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:57.450
So it looks like the user is just sort
of fanning a card stack all at once.

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:02.880
So that's some of the
animation that we did.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:06.880
One last thing that I want
to talk about is some stuff

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:10.230
that we did for the UI layout.

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:13.990
One of the things on the UI layout
is that we said that it's hard

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:18.030
to know exactly how your user may
want to work with your application.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:21.370
Some users want to see
this grid on the side.

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.480
Some users don't.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.880
They want to have the
image as large as possible.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:30.820
Some users may want to dedicate more
space to the grid and some less.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:36.210
So we allow you to grab the top of the
column and change the number of columns.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.390
This is really well received by users.

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.760
But one of the things about making
a choice of putting something

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.830
like the column on the left,
the grid column on the left,

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:49.730
is that's sort of a bias towards
left-handed or right-handed people.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:52.880
And so some people are going to find it
very convenient and some people won't.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.250
And then there are just people
who like to have the grid

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:56.340
on one side or the other.

00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:59.280
So we said, okay, fine,
we'll just make it so you can

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.480
grab the column and move it
and swing it to the other side.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.880
And so the user has complete control
over how the interface lays out.

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:09.400
Now, there are a couple of details here.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.010
When we swapped the user interface,
we found that the grid button was

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.840
the only one that was in the grid.

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:15.040
And so we wanted to make sure
that the grid button was the

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.040
only one that was in the grid.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.950
And so we did that.

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.960
And then we swapped the user interface.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.500
You'll notice that up in the top toolbar,
we have some controls.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.960
We have a grid button that we
want it to be next to the grid.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.750
So when you swap the
interface to the other side,

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:35.740
those two groups flip around and
the grid button stays near the grid.

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.690
And the same thing happens
down at the bottom.

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:37.690
The tools stay

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:41.460
Now, another detail here is if
I switch over to Portrait,

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.100
one of the things you'll
notice here in Portrait,

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:47.400
we set it up so that you can adjust
the size of the grid down here.

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:50.040
And when you've got a grid
that you can see several rows,

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.380
it makes sense for us to do
the scrolling up and down.

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.870
But we wanted this to come
down and get to a single row.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.460
Well, when you get to a single row,
scrolling up and down

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.290
doesn't work very well,
because you'd only be seeing

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.520
a portion of two rows there.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.970
So as soon as we get to a single row,
we start to go left and right.

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:12.820
But as soon as you pull this up--
oops-- as soon as we pull this up,

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:14.600
then we go up and down.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.380
So it's making sure to take care of
all those little details of how the

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:23.360
interface is going to be used by all
your different users is really important.

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:31.520
So to wrap up,
Sam talked before about simplify, refine,

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:32.040
repeat.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.920
And this is something that
we can't stress enough.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:37.460
You need to keep doing
this over and over,

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.080
and then do it some more.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.810
Another important thing is to come
back to things with fresh eyes.

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:43.820
We do that all the time.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.190
You get really focused
on a particular problem.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.830
You're doing this refinement.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:49.660
Put it aside.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.920
Work on another piece.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.820
Then work on another.

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.000
But make sure to go
back to the first one,

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:57.560
because you've learned things
along the way that you now want

00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:00.330
to apply back to that first thing.

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:02.330
Another big one,
and this is a term that comes

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.250
out of sort of the finance world,
is sunk cost.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:10.780
The amount of effort that you've put into
something in the past is not the reason

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:12.790
for it to go into your application.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.930
The fact that you just spent
two weeks coding something,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.220
that's not the reason for that
to make it into the application.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:22.890
The reason for it to go into the
application is because it's the

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:25.070
right thing for the application.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.010
It's a very easy trap to fall into.

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:32.720
I'm sure we've all done it.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.380
You just spent two weeks
writing something really cool.

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:38.080
The back of your head, you know,
maybe it's not exactly the right thing.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.720
There's a little bit
better idea someplace.

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.370
But you just spent two weeks on this.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.860
Well, your competitors aren't
going to care about the two

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.120
weeks that you spent on that.

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.640
You shouldn't care about those two weeks.

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:51.870
You should do what's right
for your application.

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:56.100
And that leads to,
you should be throwing away good work.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.390
Because this means what's
left is great work.

00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:03.410
And great work is what
you want to strive for.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:09.820
And what that leads us to is,
in your application, good enough isn't.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:12.780
Great is what you should be shooting for.

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.600
Thank you very much.
