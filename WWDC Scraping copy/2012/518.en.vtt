WEBVTT

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.400
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.950
My name is James Craig.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.020
I'm a member of the
Apple Accessibility team.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.690
What you're going to see
here is years of work,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.900
a culmination of years of work
by a lot of different people,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.460
and so I'm really thrilled that I get
to be the one to share it with you.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.270
So first off, who here by a show of hands
knows or thinks they know what

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.570
I mean by the term accessibility?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.300
Okay, good number.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.000
Some of you are probably
content publishers,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.750
and you may be aware that
you need to make your content

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.690
compliant or accessible,
and you're not really

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.400
sure what that means.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.730
And so we're going to cover some of that,
figure out how to test with VoiceOver,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.070
figure out where your problems
are so you'll know what to fix.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.250
and some of you are developers.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.160
This is a developer conference after
all and so you may already be aware of

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
accessibility and certain techniques but
you're not really sure which ones are the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.740
right ones to use in certain situations.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.180
So we're going to give you a bunch
of examples and talk about how to

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.600
make your book content specifically
as accessible as possible to as

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460
wide an audience as possible.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.110
But accessibility isn't really
about code or compliance or

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.530
techniques to use or even testing.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.550
Accessibility at its core
is really about people.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.170
And that includes people who may be
using a computing device for the first

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.490
time in their life and even if they
don't consider themselves disabled,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.170
maybe they don't see as well as
they used to or maybe they don't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.910
hear as well as they used to.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.900
It includes people that may be accessing
course content or watching a video,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.190
even if that means that they need to
watch it with the captions turned on.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.830
And still,
it means people that just want to

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.620
access the same content and have
access to the same tools and read the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.540
same books that everyone else does,
even if they don't have the same

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.240
abilities that everyone else does.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.310
And I'm not talking about
small numbers either.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.820
50 million people in the US alone,
worldwide numbers are

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.830
unknown but obviously larger.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.640
Some of you may think,
"I don't really relate to that.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.870
I don't know anybody with a
disability." Chances are you're

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.900
wrong and you just don't realize it.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.560
Colorblindness, for example,
is one of the more common disabilities.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.680
It affects, in the male population,
about 8%. That's 1 in 12.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.900
Just looking around the room
and given the stats of the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.970
Developer Conference this year,
there's probably quite a few people in

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.360
the room here that are affected by this.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.700
Out of that 50 million,
31 million have a hearing impairment.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.700
10 million people have
a vision impairment.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.700
And I'm not talking about
people that wear glasses,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.020
I'm talking about people with
severe non-correctable vision

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.530
impairments like usually people
who are blind or legally blind.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.840
And so I'm glad I get a chance to
talk to you about iOS today because

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.680
it's had accessibility features built
in since iOS 3 for three years now.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.700
Captions going farther back than that.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.320
And we've done a lot of hard work.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.600
We're trying to put in a lot of the work
so that you don't have to do everything.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.460
And some of the features are a screen
reader for people who are blind,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.990
Zoom for people with low vision,
captions and LED flash and custom

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.940
vibrations for people who maybe
have hearing impairments and

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.530
more features for people with
physical motor impairments and most

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.130
recently with learning impairments.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.770
and the disability
advocacy groups love us.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.140
We get quotes like this one from RNIB,
which is a blindness

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.160
advocacy group in the UK.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.700
When it comes to embedding accessibility,
Apple set a standard in recent years.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.960
That's pretty amazing.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.360
We love to hear stuff like that.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.280
And iBooks is no exception.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.500
It's had accessibility built in since
the original release with the first iPad.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.130
and this is a quote from Bradley Hodges
of the American Foundation for the Blind.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.330
"I believe that accessible iBooks
will be viewed by future generations

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.760
as one of the landmark events
in the lives of the blind." Now,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.830
how huge is that, right?

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.170
That's a great responsibility.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.070
It's a great responsibility for us,
but it's also a great responsibility

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.280
for you as the content publishers.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.550
Now, I said that iBooks has
accessibility built in,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.700
but there are a few things that
you need to do to make sure

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.720
your content is 100% accessible.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.480
And that's what we're
going to cover today.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.780
So, first off, we're going to cover basic
HTML accessibility in EPUB books.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.880
We're going to cover how to use
VoiceOver to test your books,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.020
both EPUB and iBooks author books,
so that you can know

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.500
where the problems are.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.160
I'm going to show you some new features
of iBooks Author for accessibility.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.420
And we're going to talk about how to
make custom HTML5 widgets so that you can

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.970
embed rich interactive web applications
inside your iBooks Author books.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.150
So, has anyone here used EPUB before?

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.700
Familiar with EPUB a little bit?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.810
It's the most common e-book standard.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.230
Novels, for example,
most of the ones that you would

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.900
buy on the iBook store and EPUB.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.850
And you don't need to know anything
specific about the file format other

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.830
than it's basically a zip folder.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.170
It has a couple metadata files,
but most of the content

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.900
inside of it is web content.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.970
So, it's HTML pages,
one or more HTML pages,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.300
and all the resources
that go along with that.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.300
So, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.570
One of the things I want you to keep in
mind about images is that some images

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.970
look better on certain backgrounds,
dark backgrounds, light backgrounds.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.940
Some images have transparency.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.500
And if you're lucky like us,
you'll get a design team that takes

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.670
care to make sure all of the images
that are transparent or should be

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.140
transparent are transparent so they
look great on all different backgrounds,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.970
whether that be black or white.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.380
But there's always multiple
versions of the images.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.590
Or maybe there's a, you know,
someone's made a mistake with an image.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.490
or maybe it was intended
for another context.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.820
This one, for example,
looks great on white.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.790
But because of a transparency error,
because of a transparency issue,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.900
it wasn't maybe intended
for a black background,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.550
it doesn't convey the same meaning.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.780
It may be completely legible
on different backgrounds.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.260
That's one of the things
I want you to test.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.190
Let's take a look at an iBook.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.760
This is our sample iBook.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.940
It's about astronomy.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.940
And I

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.340
It has some great images of space here.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.140
Let's see what they look
like on a dark background.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.470
I'm going to switch it to night mode.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.890
Sure enough, it looks great.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.860
These are space images.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.520
There's no transparency in here.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.700
In fact, they look even better
on the black background.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.880
So we don't have trouble here,
but if you're looking at your books,

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.300
double-check them in
all different themes.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.400
But I'm more concerned about people
that can't see the images at all.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.080
If you have a book, like a textbook,
like this astronomy book or maybe a

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.400
story like Winnie the Pooh where the
images are an illustrated children's

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.200
story where the images are an
important part of the content,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.150
then a reader who can't see those images
would be missing a big portion of it.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.370
VoiceOver already does a great job of
reading the text that's on the screen,

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.810
and so we need you to give us a
little bit of information about

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.970
the content of those images.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.480
So the way that you would
display an image in HTML,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.610
this is kind of the bare minimum.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.600
You have an image tag with a
source attribute that points to the

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.700
file name of the image resource.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.000
Accessibility is important enough that
this wouldn't even be valid at EPUB.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It wouldn't be valid HTML.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.250
Accessibility is important enough
that the alt attribute is actually

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.900
a requirement for validation.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.890
So you wouldn't even be able to push this
book up to the iBook store at this point.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.270
And so some publishers know about this
constraint and they do this to fix it.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.560
They give it an empty alt attribute.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.580
And this is okay in some circumstances
if it's a purely decorative

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.900
image like maybe a decorative
horizontal rule between paragraphs.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.400
That's okay.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.400
But chances are most of your images in
your books are actually content images.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.020
And so sometimes we catch people
doing something like this,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.200
alt equals image,
which is not really any better.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.420
In fact, it might be a little bit worse.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.750
And the fact that it doesn't
give us any kind of information,

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.120
we'll see alt equals illustration or alt
equals photograph or alt equals chart.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.080
Maybe chart's a little bit better,
but it still doesn't

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.420
give us the full picture.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.750
It doesn't give us any useful information
about the content of the image.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.260
And so what you need to do is actually
provide a human-readable sentence or,

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.020
you know,
short phrase that describes the content

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.610
of the image in enough detail for the
user to get the point of why it's there.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.990
And that allows an accessible book
to go from something like this to

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.460
something more like this where the
images are actually read out as text

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.080
and that allows the reader to paint
a picture in their mind of the book

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.270
author's intention which is really
what books are all about anyway.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:09.450
And so to show you how this
works in iBooks with VoiceOver,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.970
I'm going to bring up
Jason Barry to the stage.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.800
Jason?

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.770
Thank you.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.800
As James said, my name is Jason Barry.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.800
I'm a technical writer on the
developer publications team.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.290
And part of my job is to make
sure that content that we publish

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.800
can be accessible for everyone,
regardless of ability or disability.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.650
Not because it expands our reader base,
which is nice,

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.800
but because it's the right thing to do.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.800
So first I'm going to show you
how to enable VoiceOver in iOS.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.550
Then we'll talk about some basic
VoiceOver gestures and how to

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.390
use those gestures in iBooks.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.800
So we'll go over to my iPad here.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.790
VoiceOver can be turned on,
can be found in the Settings app.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.090
and the general pane near the
bottom under Accessibility.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.440
And here you'll see all of the assistive
technologies that iOS has to offer.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.130
These settings help people with vision,
hearing,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.100
learning and physical impairments.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.120
We'll be talking about VoiceOver today.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.030
Here I have settings
specific to VoiceOver.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.500
I can do things like
adjust the speaking rate.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.960
I can also turn on or off hints.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:26.500
Hints provide more descriptions to
elements that the VoiceOver cursor is on.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.840
And it's great if you're new to
VoiceOver or trying to learn VoiceOver.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.070
But since I already know
how to use VoiceOver,

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.980
I'm going to turn it off.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.730
So here we can turn VoiceOver on,
but I'll show you a tip on how

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.580
you can quickly turn VoiceOver on
and off from anywhere in iOS.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.680
Let's go back to the Accessibility pane,
and at the very bottom,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.440
there's a setting for triple-click Home.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.610
Now if I select VoiceOver,
by triple-clicking the home button,

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.800
I can toggle VoiceOver on and
off from anywhere within iOS.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.340
And this is great,
especially if you're testing VoiceOver.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.630
So let's go back to the home screen.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.760
I'll show you some basic
VoiceOver gestures.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.310
We'll turn VoiceOver on by hitting the
home button three times like we just set.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.020
Landscape, VoiceOver on, Messages.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.240
And here you'll see this
black rounded rectangle.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.500
That's the VoiceOver cursor.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.170
And VoiceOver will read anything
contained by that VoiceOver focus.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.390
Now VoiceOver changes the way
that taps and gestures are

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.800
interpreted by the screen.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.690
You'll see as I drag my finger,
VoiceOver, instead of activating an app,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.780
it will read it aloud.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:39.960
New stand folder.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.900
Zero items.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.690
This is helpful because it prevents
accidental touches and gives

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.400
VoiceOver users the freedom to
navigate the screen without worrying

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.920
about accidentally touching
something that they didn't mean.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.000
You'll see as I drag my finger
around that the cursor follows it.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.100
Reminders.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.000
Clock.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.770
Photo booth.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.900
FaceTime.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.300
There are other gestures I can
use like the one-finger swipe.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.290
When I swipe to the right,
it goes to the next item,

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.500
and when I swipe to the left,
it goes to the previous item.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:16.440
Camera, Maps, YouTube, Clock, YouTube,
Maps You'll also notice that the

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.210
VoiceOver cursor automatically
wraps around the edge,

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.300
and it goes to the
second row of apps here.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.450
It treats all items like a linear list.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.940
So let's use iBooks now.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.000
I'll tap on it.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.800
Doc, iBooks.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.090
And once the VoiceOver cursor
is over something,

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.280
I can double-tap anywhere on
the screen to activate it.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.200
iBooks, Library, Button.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.800
So I can use my finger to
explore and read line by line.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.030
Page 3 of 12.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.760
Diameter of approximately
100... several months.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.740
Jansky eventually... fixed object,
come back to the same

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.390
location in the sky.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.600
Now, you'll see here I'm near
the end of the page.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.880
When I continue reading,
VoiceOver will automatically turn the

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.250
page for me to ensure a continuous
and smooth reading experience.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.850
I'll use the two-finger swipe
down gesture to restart reading

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.410
from my current position.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.620
Come back to the same
location in the sky.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.840
Thus Jansky suspected that the
hiss originated well beyond

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.290
the Earth's atmosphere and
by comparing his observations

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.240
with optical astronomical map.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.550
And I can use the two
finger tap gesture to pause.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.840
And here we have an image,
and this e-book is really

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.390
great because the alt text is
specified inside the image.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.540
So the description will be read
aloud when we encounter it.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.410
Again, I'll use the two-finger swipe
down gesture to start reading

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.140
from our current position.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.620
His observations with
optical astronomical maps.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.400
Jansky concluded that the radiation
was coming from the Milky Way galaxy

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.970
and was strongest in the direction
of the center of the galaxy in

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.980
the constellation of Sagittarius.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:48.450
Image.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.870
The very large array,
an interferometric array formed

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.870
from many smaller radio telescopes,
each dish 25 meters in diameter.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.170
The range of frequencies in
the electromagnetic spectra...

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.740
And a two-finger tap to pause.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.100
So now this book is
accessible to everyone.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.590
Now I'll pass it back to James,
who's going to talk more

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.420
about iBooks Author.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.440
Thanks, Jason.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.260
So let's cover what
we've learned about this.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.860
First of all, view all your images in
all different contexts,

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.740
different themes.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.190
Make sure they look right.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.330
Make sure they read as well and
are legible in all contexts.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.000
Label all of your content
images as you would in HTML.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.500
Now, this is for content images.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.900
This is real human readable text.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.500
It should be localized if you have
different versions of the books.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.600
And test your books with VoiceOver.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.430
Now,
this is really critical and I'm going

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.990
to come back to it over and over,
but it's an important

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.590
part of the picture.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.690
So let's talk about iBooks Author.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.900
It's released earlier this year
and we think it's a game changer.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.430
It allows content producers
and book designers to create

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.260
rich and engaging content.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:06.340
We have some beautiful examples on the
iBooks store such as this one by E.O.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:06.930
Wilson.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:13.100
And you can embed interactive controls
like this video or HTML5 widgets like

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.510
this one in the bottom right corner.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.930
But there's still some things that
you'll need to do to make sure your

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.450
content is as accessible as possible.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.020
The first thing I want to talk about

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.510
is adjustable font sizes.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.180
Now, you don't have to do
anything special for this.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.360
This is built into iBooks.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.650
I just want to tell you how it works.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.720
If you're familiar with using iBooks,
there's a toolbar button to allow

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.840
you to adjust your font size.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.390
In iBooks Author Books,
we allow a lot of design control for

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.000
the content publisher and the designer.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.280
You can add sidebar content like
this or you could drop a video in

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.040
between multiple columns of text.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.800
If the user were to
resize their font here,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.270
the layout wouldn't look as
intended by the content publisher.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.700
And so we have an innovative design
solution that allows control and design

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:10.340
from the publisher but also allows
readability for all users no matter what

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.300
their reading font size preference is.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:17.070
So when you turn the device to
portrait orientation and the font

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.700
size toolbar comes back and you can
adjust the font size to whatever

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.190
your comfortable reading level is.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.850
Again,
you don't have to do anything special.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:26.260
It's built-in.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.690
I just want you to know how it works.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.560
Color concerns is another issue
that you'll have to think about,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.580
especially because we know
people are going to be embedding

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:40.490
charts and graphs and other rich,
beautiful, interactive material.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.700
This is an example of what not to do.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.250
As I mentioned before,
about 8% of the male population

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.580
has a form of color blindness.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.680
Those of you who may be familiar
with it may know that red and

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.280
green is the most common form.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.800
The ability to differentiate between
blue and orange is also one of the types.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.290
And so this information is
presented only with color.

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.300
So the key thing to remember
here is not which colors you use,

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.300
but don't present
information with color alone.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.950
So this is how it may look to someone
with a particular vision impairment.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.460
And there's a lot of ways,
I mean obviously this is ridiculous,

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:18.880
right?

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.150
Doesn't make any sense at all.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.520
But there's a lot of ways that we
can retrofit this and some of it is

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:27.140
the way you design the chart and some
of it is maybe a little bit in the

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.000
colors that you choose based on value.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.680
For example, we could make a darker blue,
for example,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.490
so even though the orange was there,
it was lighter.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.740
But that's not going
to work for all users.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.530
And so the critical bit that we added
to this retrofit was that we added the

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.300
percentages to the key here as well.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.580
Now, this is a design afterthought.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.490
There's a lot of ways that we could
redo this to make it even better.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.760
But the critical bit here is that even
if you took away the rest of that chart,

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.350
The user can still see the point
of the information from this.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.070
Now, to give you a better example of

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:24.100
[Transcript missing]

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.970
and the designers used red and green.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.990
It's the most common form of
color blindness that prevents some

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.320
users from seeing red and green.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.000
It's okay to use color.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.740
Color is inherent in our culture.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.340
It means stop and go.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.200
It means right and wrong.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.560
In this case, it means incorrect answer,
incorrect answer.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.170
But in addition to that color,
they backed it up with something else.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.290
So there's a checkmark on the green,
correct answers,

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.150
and there's an X on the red,
incorrect answers.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.400
Another thing that you
want to keep in mind,

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.570
especially if you're
embedding video in your books,

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.810
is captions and subtitles.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.140
So I've got a video that I want to play
for you and I want you to tell me by,

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.600
or just think about what it might mean.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.700
This video makes no sense,
especially talking head videos.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.000
They make no sense because all
of the content of this video

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.200
is conveyed through the audio.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.670
So, obviously,
captions are a requirement for

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.830
people with hearing impairments,
people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.100
but they also provide a lot
of universal design benefit.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:36.020
So there may be a student who's in
the library and they're reviewing

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.690
book content and they want...

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.540
They want to view the video but they
don't want to disturb other people

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.220
and they don't have their headphones.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.010
Or you may be riding the bus home and
you have your headphones but due to

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:52.360
the noise of the crowd or the noise of
traffic you can't hear it over the den.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.110
So keep that in mind and think
about how it benefits all users,

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.600
including those with disabilities.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.740
The last thing I want to
mention is descriptive labels.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.110
This is just like the alt text
that we talked about in EPUB.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.340
Except in iBooks Author,
you do it a different way.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.840
So here we have a photo of Jupiter.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.140
You can see that there are swirling
gas clouds in the great red spot.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.380
Instead of writing the alt text in code
or the alternative description in code,

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.390
we have this widget inspector
and down at the bottom we have

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.940
the accessibility description.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.180
This is where we're going to
put in some text that describes

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.860
this image such as "Wide shot of
Jupiter with squirreling glass

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.810
clouds including the great red spot.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.920
A storm so large it dwarfs our own
Earth." That gives the user a good

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.330
description of what's on screen here.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.100
Likewise,
if we have a widget such as this one,

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.240
there are multiple pieces to this widget.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.530
So one accessibility
description would not do.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.820
So we've got the drag targets and the
drop targets and the background image.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.840
And if you look down in the
accessibility description,

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.930
there's this pop-up menu.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.170
And if you click it,
it allows you to select each different

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.690
item in this widget and give an
accessibility description for each.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.540
and so I'm going to bring Jason back
up to the stage to talk about how

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.170
that works and show you iBooks Author.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.380
So here I have a textbook that
I created with iBooks Author.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.280
It's really cool and I can't wait
to publish it on the iBook store.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.220
But I haven't yet tested
for accessibility.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.210
So what would happen if a
VoiceOver user tried to read my book?

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.260
Well, let's find out.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.860
I'll turn VoiceOver on.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.010
VoiceOver on.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.010
iBooks.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.010
Section 1.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.320
And the text can automatically
be read aloud by VoiceOver.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.170
But what happens when the
user encounters an image?

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.800
000015027267 Medium, Image.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.870
It sounds like gibberish.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.000
That's because we haven't added
any accessibility descriptions

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.190
in iBooks Author yet.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.860
Let's go on to the next page.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.060
I'll use the three-finger swipe gesture.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.170
Page three,
WAI is part of the local group

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.970
of... And two fingers to pause.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.900
Since VoiceOver helps people
with visual impairments,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.950
and we're looking at this video now,
we're talking about captions which really

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.930
helps people with hearing impairments,
I'm going to temporarily

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.490
turn VoiceOver off.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.540
VoiceOver off.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.650
Let's play the video.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.120
Firing Chain is armed.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.840
Sound Suppression Water System activated.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.870
T-minus 13, 12, 11.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.490
The video looks great,
but if I had a hearing impairment,

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:38.000
I'd have no idea that there was a
speaker talking in the background.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.190
I'll show you how in a moment
to remedy this problem.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.300
Onto the next page we have
an interactive quiz widget.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.560
I'll turn VoiceOver on.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:51.250
VoiceOver on: Landscape.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.770
VoiceOver on: iBooks.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.360
WAI is part of the local group of...

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.400
And like the image,
I haven't yet added an

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.040
accessibility description.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.700
So if I was a VoiceOver user
and I encountered these image

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.940
thumbnails at the bottom,
it would read something like this.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.670
Quiz.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.310
Image 1 label.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.360
Image.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.360
Image 2 label.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.240
Image 3 label.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.750
Image.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.370
Again, not very helpful, not descriptive.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.580
I have no idea what these are images of.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.990
And on to the next page.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.800
Page 5, Interactive Model,
Interactive 1.1,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.640
Explore Our Solar System.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.200
We have a custom HTML widget.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.800
Now,
to show you the features of the widget,

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.400
I'm going to turn VoiceOver off.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.300
VoiceOver off.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.140
and I'll open it up here.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.400
Now custom HTML widgets are a
great way to add personality and

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.120
character to your books and make
them stand out above the rest.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:45.560
So here we have a grid of 12 planets.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.470
I can just tap on one and
a modal dialogue appears.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:54.880
I can scroll through here and see
more images of this planet or read

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.810
a brief synopsis at the bottom.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.540
And when I'm done,
I can just tap this button down here

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.330
and return to the grid of planets.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.960
But I haven't yet made
this widget accessible.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.600
So what would happen if a
VoiceOver user tried to use this widget?

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.900
It would sound something like this.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.100
VoiceOver on iBooks.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.770
Sun 1 JPG.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.100
Image.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:20.630
Sun 1 JPG.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.060
Image.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.080
Sun 2 JPG.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.780
Image.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.800
Sun 3 JPG.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.470
Image.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.160
The sun.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.360
The sun is the star at the
center of the solar system.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.360
So two things are going wrong here.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.640
One is that VoiceOver is reading the
content that's on the modal dialogues.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.640
It doesn't know that
that's hidden from view,

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.440
so we have to explicitly
tell it that in our code.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.380
You can see the outline
here is on the text,

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.200
which is actually hidden from view.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.660
And secondly, we haven't specified any
alt text for our images,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.030
so it's just reading the file name.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.700
And that was that Sun 1 JPG, Sun 2 JPG.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:01.390
We'll need to add some
more descriptive text.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:01.390
So I'm going to switch over to my Mac.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.090
Turn VoiceOver off here.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.360
VoiceOver off.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.980
And now we have the same copy of
the iBook that I just showed you

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.560
on my iPad here in iBooks Author.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.100
All right, so how do we go ahead
and make this accessible?

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.840
With iBooks Author, it's really easy.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:22.280
All you do is select the image and
go up here to the Expector panel.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.770
And the last inspector,
the widget inspector

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.510
under the layout tab,
I have a place called

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.040
Accessibility Description.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.820
And anything I type in here
will be read aloud by VoiceOver.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.730
So I'll go ahead and paste in some text.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.080
Now onto my video.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.440
We want to add captions to this video.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.590
Now, creating captions is outside
the scope of this demo.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.530
But I have a video right here
with captions already embedded.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.910
So I'll just go ahead and drag that
right on the video placeholder.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.150
You'll notice too that
when I drag a new video on,

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.260
it automatically resets the poster frame.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.850
So if we go back to the Interaction tab,
we can drag this adjustment right here,

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:15.410
this slider, to the frame that we desire.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.030
onto our interactive widget.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.400
Adding accessibility to this is just
like adding accessibility to an image.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.280
I'll click on it.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.500
And down here,
you'll see a new drop-down menu.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:36.210
This will allow me to specify a unique
description for each label and target.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.190
When it says image one label here,
that's referring to this first thumbnail.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.720
This is the image label.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.900
And two and three and four respectively.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.160
And their targets are above.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:47.900
That's what these are.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.590
And I can drag this anywhere
on the image that I deem fit.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:58.540
So let's go ahead and type some things.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.230
Some accessibility
descriptions right inside here.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.500
Again, I'm adding a description to
this first thumbnail here.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.580
So I'll go ahead and type in a gaseous
giant characterized by its red spot.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.730
And for its target,

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:22.000
I'll type in Jupiter,
the fifth planet from the sun.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.980
Now, it's important that you don't give
away the answer in your descriptions.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.800
And what I mean by that is
notice that in this example,

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.490
I didn't say Jupiter in both
the label and the target.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.650
Because VoiceOver will
read the description aloud,

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.320
it will say Jupiter to both.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.170
And the point of this
widget is to quiz the user.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.190
And that's no fun if
I give away the answer.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.350
So instead I just wrote a gaseous giant.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.730
I described the image instead
of calling it by its name.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.740
and finally we have
our custom HTML widget.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.110
We'll touch on that in a bit.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.340
Great.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.040
So I just made my book a
little more accessible.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:03.400
So I'll save my work and then hit the
preview button to transfer it to my iPad.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:05.400
Now,
I've already gone ahead and done that.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:11.130
So we'll switch over to the iPad
and I'll load up the accessible

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.300
version that incorporates the
changes you just saw me make.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.960
So now let's turn VoiceOver on.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.450
VoiceOver on.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.230
iBooks.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.700
Section 1.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.080
So how does our image sound now?

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.240
A radio telescope on the
lookout for developers who

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.600
don't label their photographs.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.000
Image.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.860
Much more descriptive.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.600
On to the next page.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.190
Page 3.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.190
WAI is part of the

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.650
Let's play our video.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.990
I'll turn VoiceOver off,
like I said before.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.840
VoiceOver off.

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.600
And play the video.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.630
Firing chain is armed.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.500
Sound suppression water system activated.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.140
T minus 13, 12.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.590
But wait, our captions aren't showing up.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.300
That's because closed captions
are disabled by default.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.660
We'll have to re-enable them in settings.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.260
So I'll double tap the home button
to bring up the app switcher.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:15.180
And in settings, Under the video tab,

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.860
is closed captioning.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.820
And I can just switch that on.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.170
Now when I go back to my book, I

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.000
You can restart the video here
and you'll see the captions.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.000
Firing chain is armed.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.850
Sound suppression water system activated.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:37.420
T-minus 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.910
Go for main engine start.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:44.230
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.600
Zero and liftoff of
Space Shuttle Atlantis,

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.080
reaching the crest of its
historic achievements in space.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.240
I love that video.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.100
Now we have our interactive quiz widget.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.210
Now, as a sighted user,
I can gather just by looking at it that

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.900
I'm supposed to pick up these thumbnails
and drag them to their respective images,

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.010
their respective drop targets above.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:18.080
And part of the feedback that I get
when I initiate a drag is very subtle

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.400
and I want you to pay close attention.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.400
Look at all the little things
that happen when I start dragging.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.530
The thumbnail grows,
turns semi-transparent,

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:33.400
and when I approach a drop target,
that target grows and turns blue.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.400
And this feedback helps me
understand the state of this widget.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.900
But how can I take advantage of that
visual feedback if I couldn't see?

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.790
Well, VoiceOver changes the visual
feedback into audio feedback.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.640
Let me show you what I mean.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.990
I'll turn VoiceOver on.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:54.470
VoiceOver on.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.470
iBooks.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.470
WAI is part of the local...

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.930
And now when I select an image thumbnail,
not only will it read the

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:03.370
accessibility description that
I inputted with iBooks Author,

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.390
A dark, desolate rock,
far from the light of its nearest star.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:08.600
Image.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.990
But if I had hints enabled,
it would say something like

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.850
"Double tap and hold to drag."

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.140
So I'm going to do that
and it will announce to me

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.700
where the drop targets are,
where I'm supposed to drag this image.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.530
So I'll do the double
tap and hold gesture.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.510
started dragging a dark, desolate rock.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.180
Drop targets are above.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.440
I'll just move on up.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.060
On Mars, the fourth planet from the sun.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:34.170
On Jupiter,
the fifth planet from the sun.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:40.540
On Pluto, the Ninth Planet,
until its excommunication from

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:40.540
the planetary community in 2006.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.320
Stop dragging a dark,
desolate rock far from the

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.000
light of its nearest star.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.900
So with that audio feedback,
I can understand I have a

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.440
gathering of where I am and how
to navigate with this widget.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.890
But you might be thinking to
yourself that I have a bias

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.470
because I can see the screen.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.980
So what I'm going to do is
turn on the screen curtain.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.220
And screen curtain is
a VoiceOver feature.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.460
It's all about privacy,
so a VoiceOver user doesn't feel

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.400
that someone's overlooking their
shoulder and looking at their screen.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.400
and you can turn on screen curtain
with a three-finger triple tap.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.630
Screen curtain on.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.650
So now we can't see the screen,
but I can still use the

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.770
VoiceOver gestures that
I taught you earlier.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.600
I'll use the one-finger swipe to the
right to select the next image label.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.360
The red, rocky surface of a planet.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.720
Image.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.560
Sounds like Mars to me,
so I'm going to pick it up.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.420
started dragging the red
drop targets are above.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.420
And move my finger up.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.120
On Pluto, the ninth planet,
and on Jupiter,

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.580
the fifth planet from the sun.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.570
Still too far out.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.540
On Mars, the fourth planet from the sun.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.540
There we are.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.680
Now I'll lift my finger.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.580
Stop dragging the red,
rocky surface of a planet.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.120
And swipe to the right
to check my answer.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.410
Check answer button.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.490
Correct answer.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:04.390
Clear answer.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:04.600
Button.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.600
Great.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.340
So I just got the audio feedback
that I indeed got the correct answer.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.440
And when I turn screen curtain
off... Screen curtain off.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.840
You can see that I did and
that the button changed from

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.440
check answer to clear answer.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.010
Now I'm going to pass it back to
James who will tell you how to make

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:24.190
custom HTML widgets accessible.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:26.290
Let's cover what we've learned.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.470
Again, font size adjustments are
already built into iBooks.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.540
You don't have to do anything special.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.190
Don't convey meaning with color alone.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.700
Just to repeat,
we're not saying don't use color.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.560
That would be ridiculous.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.990
Color is a great learning tool.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.960
We're just saying make sure
that the ability to perceive

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.360
color is in a requirement in
order to access the information

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.400
that you include in your books.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:49.500
You want to add captions or subtitles
to a video where appropriate.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:55.040
Obviously, any time you have information
conveyed through the audio channel,

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.130
you want to make that available to
people with hearing impairments,

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.930
but also benefits people who may be
in a situation where they can't hear

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.990
due to some technical constraint.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:08.130
Add alternative text
for images and widgets.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.940
And test your books with VoiceOver.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.400
We wouldn't even have known where
to start to fix these problems if

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.420
we hadn't tested with VoiceOver.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.600
And we wouldn't even have known
if the changes had worked unless

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.490
we had gone back and tested
after we made our changes.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.260
So let's talk about that
custom HTML widget that he

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.460
showed at the beginning.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.040
Anybody here familiar with widgets?

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:34.180
Anybody developed a dashboard
or iBooks widget before?

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:34.180
Okay, a few.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.230
Like EPUB, it's not the same file format,
but like EPUB,

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:41.330
it's basically a folder of content.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.490
In that folder,
there's some metadata files like a plist,

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:48.820
but it's mostly HTML content again,
so images and CSS and

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.460
JavaScript and HTML pages,
one or more.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:58.380
And like HTML, or because it's HTML,
all of the accessibility techniques

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.600
that you know about HTML still apply,
so labeling images with the alt

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.800
attribute still works and labeling
form elements with the label tag

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.700
and the for attribute still works.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.640
But HTML only goes so far.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.400
It was originally designed
for static documents.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.000
More recently, people have been using
it for web applications,

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.100
but there's some semantics
that get lost in there,

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.350
and HTML5 is fixing some of that,
but there's still some places

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.890
where HTML falls short,
and that's where ARIA comes in.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.740
It's a W3C specification and
it allows web pages to declare

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:37.130
themselves as applications and
give additional semantics about

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.760
the parts of their application.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.480
Like this thing is a button and
it's disabled or this thing is

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.660
a slider and its value is 64% or
this thing is hidden from view now,

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.670
this thing is a dialogue.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.700
So let's talk about how to use it.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:56.390
First of all,
we're going to assign semantic roles.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:02.610
So on the front of this planet
widget or solar system widget,

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.860
we have the sun and the
moon and ten planets,

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.600
including the I planet or planet X.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.100
And each one of these
things represents a button.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.640
But as Jason will show you in the code,
it was just a meaningless,

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.100
semantically meaningless div
with a class affront on it.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.100
And so we're actually going to
add role equals button to that.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.290
And this will tell WebKit, rather,
to send that information to

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.240
the accessibility API and
VoiceOver can read that and

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.370
understand that this is a button.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:35.200
Likewise, on the back side of this,
we have these dialogues,

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.640
but they're just another div,
and it's got more content in it,

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:42.090
but we want to associate this with
the type of application dialogue.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.250
Now,
there is no HTML attribute for dialogue.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.600
There used to be one that was about
dialogue or discussion between people,

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.100
but I don't even think
that's around anymore.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.850
We're talking about
application dialogues.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.210
So the next thing you want to do is
update your states and properties.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.160
So in addition to the fact
that this is a button,

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.550
we also want to give it
a label such as the moon.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.160
And remember, at this point,
the dialogue that's on the

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.800
backside is actually hidden
from view to the sighted user.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.350
And so we want to make sure that
VoiceOver knows that as well.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:14.630
So we're going to say this
dialogue or these dialogues that

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.300
are out of view now are hidden
via this ARIA hidden attribute.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.580
Now when we show that dialogue,
we have to update the state.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.340
And so we're going to dynamically
change that hidden state to false,

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.700
making it shown.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.300
It's already in view because
we showed it with some CSS,

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.530
but we're also going to make sure
that VoiceOver can see this now too.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.090
and likewise the buttons that are
on the front are now hidden from

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.540
view so we want to make sure that
VoiceOver knows that those shouldn't

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.060
be accessible at this point.

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.360
So we're going to set those to be hidden.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:51.780
The last bit of the chain is
that you want to manage focus.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:57.690
Now when we have this button
on the front and we tap,

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.940
there's an animation that occurs
and so a side user can see,

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.630
oh hey, now we're on this dialogue.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.140
But the VoiceOver cursor is just going
to hang out on that button still.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.440
So what we want to do is
move it into the dialogue.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.990
So we're going to focus the first
element in the dialogue such as

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:15.340
this image and the VoiceOver cursor
will come along with it.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.890
And likewise, when we hide that dialogue,
we want to focus the trigger element

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.440
or the element that it came from.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.130
So they click the moon button and
they were in the moon dialogue.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.780
So when they dismiss the moon dialogue,
they should go back to the moon button.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:32.120
And it reorients the user and lets
them know how this application works.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.060
The next thing that I want you
to know about ARIA is it's really

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.130
good at retrofitting old content.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.400
So for that class up front,
we could have re-architected

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:43.960
the application.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.660
We could have changed this to
use a button element in HTML.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:48.460
But we don't have to.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.940
ARIA allows us to go back in.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.660
You may have inherited code before
that didn't have certain features.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.310
And so it allows you to easily go
back in and change things so you

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:59.350
don't have to gut your application.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.890
You can also set these properties
using the DOMSetAttribute method.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.580
A lot of people ask me,
how do I know when I'm supposed

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.360
to update these ARIA properties?

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.160
How do I know when I add one of
these attributes or remove or

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.340
change one of these attributes?

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:20.060
A good indication is if
you're changing element style.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.110
In this case,
if you change a class name to something

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.920
like hidden or if you change a style,
especially if it's something like a

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:34.400
meaningful class name like highlight or
active or focused or selected or hidden,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.000
that's usually a good indication that you
want to update an ARIA attribute as well.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:42.180
And so in this case,
we're going to update the

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.340
ARIA hidden attribute to true.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.830
Now, I mentioned managing focus.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.610
The key thing to keep in mind is
that VoiceOver cursor focus is

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.240
not the same as keyboard focus.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.870
iOS doesn't really have this concept
of keyboard focus except in a couple

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.300
places where you can type in text.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.530
And so when I'm talking about
managing focus here on iOS and iBooks,

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.740
I'm talking about just moving
the VoiceOver cursor around.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:41:43.700
[Transcript missing]

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.810
We'll be editing the HTML and
JavaScript of this widget

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.160
to make it more accessible.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.960
But first, I want to familiarize
you with this widget.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.600
So right here we have a
div with a class in front.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:01.490
And that's represented by these
planet icons that you see here.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:06.010
Now when I click on one,
this modal dialog is represented

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.940
by the class of Back.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.060
Alright, so what do we want to do?

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.870
How do we want to go about
making this accessible?

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.890
Well,
we want to be able to use the one-finger

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:22.000
swipe to the left and right to move the
VoiceOver cursor from planet to planet.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.990
Then when a planet is activated,

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.100
We want to be able to shift
focus to this modal dialogue

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.460
and then hide the planet buttons
because they're no longer in view.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:37.420
And likewise,
when the modal dialogue is dismissed,

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.390
we want to give focus back
to the grid of planets.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.650
So let's look at our code.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.470
I'm going to go here and
paste in a couple attributes.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.600
Let's talk about each one.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.840
First, I'm assigning this div
with a class of front,

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.200
the role of button.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:00.890
And what that does is tell VoiceOver that
this is indeed a button and it has

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:03.260
further action when I activate it.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:07.310
VoiceOver will read this
aloud to the user as well.

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.560
I'm also giving it a tab index.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.480
Since divs aren't natively focusable,
I have to manually specify a tab

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.820
index so that I can programmatically
give focus back to this element.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:22.740
And then finally,
I'm adding an ARIA label attribute.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.580
And whatever value I put here
for the ARIA label attribute

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.970
will be read aloud by VoiceOver.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:34.990
I can go through my code here and just
go ahead and make it more accessible.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:42.520
I've already done add the role
of button to the other planets

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.780
for the sake of the demo.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:50.590
We also want to add the role
of dialogue to the back.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.300
This way VoiceOver will read the
contents of the modal dialogue aloud.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.990
We're also giving it the
aria-labeledby attribute.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.010
Now this is similar to the aria-label,
but instead of specifying

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:06.300
a string of text,
I instead reference another element.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:12.300
This is actually the ID of an element,
sun_h1, that I've specified here.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.790
And here you can see that I have the sun.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:19.070
Just another way to make
your widget accessible.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:27.240
And again, I can go through my code
and change it up here.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.350
Make it a little more accessible.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.510
All right.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.390
Let's head over to our JavaScript.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:41.200
Now, I have some functions that
I've written ahead of time.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:41.200
And I'll just

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:43.800
Paste it into my code.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.800
Now, I call this function
updateButtonAccessibility.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:51.100
What it does is it gathers all the
elements with the class of front,

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.290
it loops through them,

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:57.370
and then sets the ARIA-hidden attribute
to either true or false depending

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.700
on the Boolean value that I pass.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:03.730
So what this allows me to do is
update the ARIA hidden state of all

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:07.650
the planet icons so I can either
hide them or show them to VoiceOver.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.650
Similarly,

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:15.390
I have a function that I created
called UpdateDialogAccessibility.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.780
And it's just like the
function I went over before,

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.040
except now I can pass
in an optional element.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.500
And when I do,
it will only update the ARIA hidden

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.210
attribute for the element that I pass.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:35.020
If I don't pass in an element,
it will find all of the

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:35.020
divs with the class of back.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.170
loop through them and set each attribute
to either true or false depending

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.200
on the Boolean value that I provide.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:47.100
And then finally I just have some
simple wrapper functions here.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.600
So you can easily follow along.

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:55.450
Now what we want to do is
when the widget initializes,

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:59.740
we want to hide the modal dialogues
from being read aloud because they're

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.740
not visible to the sighted user.

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:07.240
So at the end of my init function,
I'll just go ahead and

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:11.170
call this function here,
VO hide dialogues.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.010
Great.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:15.100
Now let's go back to the
dashboard and view our changes.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.560
I'll switch over.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.920
Tap on the widget and hit
Command-R to refresh the widget.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.800
Now I'll turn on VoiceOver by
hitting Command F5.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.140
Widget our solar system.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:30.360
Our solar system widget.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.770
Widget the sun button.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.380
Great.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:37.520
Now I can swipe using my finger.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.230
Mercury button.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.340
Venus button.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.790
Earth button.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:45.590
But what happens when
I activate one of these buttons?

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.740
Press Earth button.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.840
You can see that the VoiceOver cursor
is still on that Earth planet icon

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.140
that's currently hidden from view.

00:46:55.150 --> 00:47:00.010
That's because we need to tell our
widget through JavaScript explicitly to

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.640
transfer focus over to this modal dialog.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.520
And you can see as I continue to swipe,
the cursor still jumps from

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.240
planet button to planet button.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.300
The Moon button.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.840
Mars button.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.190
All right, so let's go back to
our code and fix this.

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:14.560
I'll turn VoiceOver off.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.350
VoiceOver off.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.210
Now here, I have an event listener.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.310
And this fires every time
that a planet icon is tapped.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.280
And right here,

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.840
I have a timeout that fires
when the animation completes.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.500
So this is a great place
to put some more code.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.480
What I'm going to do is just paste
in only three lines of code here.

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:46.420
First what I'm doing is that I'm showing
the modal dialogues to VoiceOver because

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:47.990
they're currently in view.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:52.540
Next, I manually transfer focus
to the first image that's

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.990
represented by a class of pic.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.990
That's this image right here.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:02.780
Finally,
I hide the buttons from VoiceOver.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.280
That's the Planet buttons
that are no longer in view.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:13.800
And likewise,
I'll need to do a similar action

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.340
when the modal window is dismissed.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:20.340
So here I'm doing the opposite.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.370
I'm showing the buttons
to VoiceOver because

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:24.640
they're coming into view.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.180
and I'm giving focus back to the
planet from which I left off.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:36.130
So when I dismiss this modal dialogue,
the VoiceOver cursor will

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.700
come back down to earth.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.440
and then finally,
I want to hide the modal dialogues

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:45.960
because they're no longer in view.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.100
Great.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:53.060
Now let's save this,
head back to our HTML, and finally,

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.600
I'm going to add some alt text to
make these images more descriptive.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.970
So I'll just paste over here.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:06.190
And what it's doing is, as you can see,
adding some more descriptive

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.400
descriptions here.

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:10.670
And I'm also manually specifying
a tab index because image -- the

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.220
image tag isn't natively focusable.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:19.710
And I'll go through my code and go ahead
and do that everywhere an image occurs.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.920
Now, I've already done that
for the other planets,

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.040
and I'm sure you got the idea.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:30.560
Now, I'll save my work,
go back to Dashboard,

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:36.330
Refresh the widget and turn on
VoiceOver by hitting Command-F5.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:37.880
Widget our solar system.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:38.880
Our solar system widget.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.040
The sun button.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:47.050
Mercury Button, Venus Button,
Earth Button, the Moon, Mars Button,

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.100
Jupiter Button, Saturn Button.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.240
And now when I activate it,
the focus switches to the back.

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:55.960
Press Saturn button.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.250
You are currently on a button.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.100
To click this button,
press Control-Option-Space-Saturn

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:00.940
with six items.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.570
Dialogue,
artist rendering of Saturn and its rings.

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:03.820
Image.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.960
And I can swipe through and see all
the images here on the back side.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.540
A pale, striped,
gas giant with stunning rings.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.140
Image.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:14.520
Close-up of Saturn showing huge
storms in its atmosphere and dramatic

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.170
shadows cast by and on its rings.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:16.760
Image.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.170
Now that's much better.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.900
I can also read this
synopsis at the bottom.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.690
Heading level one, Saturn.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.400
Saturn is the sixth planet from
the sun and the second largest

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.780
planet in the solar system.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:27.160
After.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.980
Use the two-finger tap to pause.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.600
And now I can return
to my list of planets.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.860
Back to list of planets button.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.400
Press back to list Saturn button.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:41.340
And you'll notice that the
VoiceOver cursor comes back to

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.080
the planet from which we came.

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:44.450
You are currently on the button.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.560
To click this button,
press VoiceOver off.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.100
I'll turn VoiceOver off.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.860
Now I'll pass it back to
James who will wrap up for us.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.190
So let's review what we've learned.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.900
Standard HTML accessibility
techniques still apply.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.310
You can still label your images with the
alt text if you need to label something

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:09.200
that represents an image or a button or
something that's not natively in HTML.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.630
You can add the aria-label attribute.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.710
And like I said, HTML only goes so far,
so there is no dialogue element.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.490
There is no -- well, until recently,
there was no slider element.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.880
So there's a lot of places where
ARIA can update the semantics of

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.960
your application where HTML cannot.

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:30.370
You want to manage focus.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.010
So any time your
application state changes,

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.750
as it did when we flipped from
the front of those buttons to

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.340
the back of one of the dialogs,
you want to move focus in

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:42.120
so that VoiceOver knows that
that event has occurred too.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:47.540
and test, test,
test your books with VoiceOver.

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:52.580
So that's an overview of
accessibility in iBooks.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.870
Some of the takeaways that
I want you to walk away with

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.120
are that books are for everyone.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.680
Education is a great equalizer and
that benefit of education through

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.670
books should be available to all people
including those with disabilities.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.740
Likewise, accessibility is for everyone.

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.810
Sometimes it has the stigma of
it's just for a small group of

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.860
people so I shouldn't be doing this.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:20.040
As you saw in the example
of closed captions,

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:24.500
there can be a lot of benefit
besides the necessity that is

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.720
needed for people with disabilities.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.630
Accessibility is for everyone including
those with disabilities but not

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:34.360
limited to those with disabilities.

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.260
And adding accessibility
to books is really easy.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.560
For the most part,
we were just adding alternative text.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:42.460
So we added alternative text
to the images and the widgets.

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:45.590
And in a similar way,
we added alternative text to the

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.210
video when we added captions.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.380
Even the complex example
of the HTML5 widget,

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:56.190
the complexity in that was
actually creating the widget.

00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:00.500
Making that widget was a bigger deal.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.740
Adding accessibility was relatively
trivial once we figured out what the

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.240
problems were and what we needed to do.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.150
We did that by testing with VoiceOver.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.240
I can't say this enough.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.290
It would be completely ridiculous if
any of you developed a Cocoa application

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:15.340
and never built it and ran it.

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:19.930
Or if you designed a web page and had
all your CSS animations coded and never

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:22.570
actually loaded it up in a browser.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.340
But we see people do this all the time.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.260
They'll make changes for
accessibility and they'll never

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.590
go back and test it in VoiceOver.

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:30.590
So this is absolutely critical.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.950
If you have more questions,
you can contact Vicki Murley, who is our

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.940
Safari Technologies Evangelist.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:38.980
You can find out more about
VoiceOver and other Apple accessibility

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:44.940
products on apple.com/accessibility,
including videos on how to use VoiceOver,

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:52.750
including the trackpad commander,
which is a feature that Jason was using

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.180
on the Mac that makes the Mac trackpad
work like the iOS touchscreen does.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:54:01.330
You can find out more about ARIA at
the W3C website and feel free

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:01.330
to post on the developer forums.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.980
A few related sessions that happened
earlier in the week that you can

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.640
go back and review the videos on
iTunes are Accessibility for OS X,

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.570
Building Books with iBooks Author,
Accessibility for iOS, and HTML, CSS,

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:15.730
and DOM for Book Authors.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:17.260
and that's it.

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:20.500
So thank you all for making the world
a more accessible place for everyone.
