WEBVTT

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.230
Good morning.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.090
Thank you for coming.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.600
My name is Ricardo Cortes and
I work on the iTunes Store,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.900
the iBook Store, and the App Store.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.100
First off, welcome to WWDC.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.600
It's day four of WWDC.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.820
I hope you're enjoying the conference.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.660
Monday's keynote was pretty sizzling,
if you ask me.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.460
This is the fifth year in a
row for this presentation.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.320
Believe it or not,
we started back in 2008,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.420
just before the App Store launched,
and we've been doing it ever since,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.190
updating you on the app
distribution process,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.110
app reporting, and app setup.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.470
And this year is no different.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.100
We're going to walk you through
updates to iTunes Connect Mobile,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.330
iTunes Connect, and Application Loader.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.520
These are the three tools that are
used by you guys to submit your apps,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.760
track your apps, and make changes to your
apps on the App Store.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.220
We have four areas that
we want to cover today.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.570
A what's new area,
we'll be talking about contracts,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.140
general iTunes Connect workflow
changes in the last year,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.220
and iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.770
Our second main area,
tool support for iOS 6 and Mountain Lion,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.340
the features you heard on Monday,
including routing apps and Game Center.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.340
In-App purchase changes,
we have a slew of changes for you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.730
in the area of In-App purchases.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.180
and as always, some best practices,
common pitfalls, i.e.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.390
ITC gotchas.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.970
Okay.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.560
What's new?

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.230
First up, contracts.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.930
If you haven't noticed,
this past Monday we rolled out

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.980
some new agreements both on the
iOS and OS X side for the free/PLA

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.180
agreement and for the paid.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.120
On the paid side we have
new App Store territories,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.380
which Tim mentioned in his keynote.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.260
We have In-App Purchas/Apple
hosted content.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.070
We have new custom B2B tiers.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.640
We're introducing tiers 0 through
9 for custom B2B developers

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.000
and new custom B2B territories.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.100
On the OS X paid side,
we have also the paid territories

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.860
and the hosted content.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.140
For the PLA, we have routing apps and for
the OS X side for the PLA,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.100
we have In-App Purchas hosted content.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.060
In terms of custom B2B,
we have nine new territories

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.270
in addition to the US.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.330
They are Canada, UK, France, Germany,
Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.220
and Japan.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.610
We have 32 new territories that are
coming to the App Store with those

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.660
agreements that I mentioned that
are now live in iTunes Connect.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.750
And with the 32,
we now have a total of 155.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.460
And here they are.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.900
Okay,
we're going to quiz you on those later.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.140
Okay, that's contracts.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.190
So you want to go into iTunes Connect,
agree to the latest free or paid

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.140
as it's relevant to your app,
and agree to those contracts.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.300
They're live now.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.300
iTunes Connect changes.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.660
As you know,
the new iPad has a Retina display and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.500
those screenshots for the iPad with
the Retina display are now optional.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.500
You can provide high-res screenshots
for your iPad app now in iTunes Connect.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.040
However, on the iPhone side,
if you haven't noticed,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.400
we now require Retina display
screenshots for all of your iPhone apps.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.660
We also have additional states,
additional details for when

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.770
your app is stuck in the
missing screenshot app state.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.540
The screenshot changes,
here they are without the location bar.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.660
And if you were paying
attention on Monday,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.530
there was a new iPad,
or new MacBook Pro that was announced.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.440
We'll be adding support
for those screenshots soon.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.040
When your app is stuck
and missing a screenshot,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.010
we now give you an indication
of which localization you

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.860
need to add the screenshot in.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.070
We have some large app icon
changes that are coming in July,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.120
so take notice.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.420
On the iOS side,
we're going from 512.512 to 1024.1024.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.890
If you recall, the large app icon is
what's used in the store,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.710
both on the device and the desktop.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.300
On the iOS side,
you deliver this screenshot

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.740
through iTunes Connect.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.560
On the OS X side, commensurate fashion,
we're going from a

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.640
512.512 to a 1024.1024.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.550
And that's delivered in the
ICNS file in your app bundle.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.220
On Newsstand,
both for the issue cover art and for

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.220
the default cover art that's supplied,
the long edge is moving

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.460
from 512.512 to 1024.1024.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.100
And those are supplied either in iTunes
Connect or in the Newsstand Atom feed.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.540
Again, those changes are coming in July,
so get ready.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.040
You also have a privacy URL that's now
available to all your iOS and OS X apps.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.060
It's optional unless you're
using In-App Purchases of type

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.360
Auto-Renewable or Free Subscriptions.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.660
Here's a screenshot in
iTunes Connect where you can

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.060
provide your privacy URL.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.940
That privacy URL will then show up in
the store when you're browsing your apps.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.070
We have 10 new languages
we're adding to the App Store.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.820
These are now live.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.530
They are below.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.230
We also have the ability for
you to change your default

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.800
language at the app level.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.270
This allows you to choose a
default language that is displayed

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.620
when looking for a localization,
when the device has been set

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.580
to a particular language.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.980
Okay, iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.320
iTunes Connect Mobile was announced
a couple years ago here at WWDC.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.160
Since then, we've done a 1.1 and a 1.2.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.240
The current version is 1.2,
and today we're

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.870
announcing ITC Mobile 2.0.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.310
First off, if you had noticed in 1.1,
1.2, you can't find all of your apps.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.860
We're changing that with 2.0.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.990
With 2.0,
we have a detailed app inspection

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.510
view for all of your apps,
regardless whether they're

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.860
on sale or not on sale.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.670
In addition,
when you get a push notification

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.420
for any of your apps,
when they change status,

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.930
you can swipe that push notification
and it'll drop you right into the

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.640
app inspection view for that app.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.300
We've added custom reviews,
allows you to search for all your reviews

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.460
across all your territories quickly.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.750
And a new feature to ITC Mobile called
Favorites allows you to organize

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.600
your favorite apps to find
them quickly on the device.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.400
And version sign-off and rejection.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.860
Version sign-off allows you to
release the binary on the go

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920
within iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.210
So if you get a push notification,
your app is ready and it's been reviewed,

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.760
you can swipe, drop right into iTunes
Connect Mobile and approve it.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.750
Similarly, if you know there's a bug and
you need to reject it quickly,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.760
you can do that as well.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.340
We have a reworked Sales and Trends view.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.400
The UI has been updated.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.410
And if you don't want everyone
in your company seeing

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.230
your Sales and Trends data,
you can now use the roles that

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.710
are in iTunes Connect to prevent
viewing of those Sales and Trends

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.660
data right there in the app.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.100
And with that,
I'd like to bring up Jason Fozback,

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.500
Engineering Manager of iTunes
Store Content Delivery.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.500
He's going to walk you through a
demo of iTunes Connect Mobile 2.0.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.500
Jason.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.920
Thank you, Ricardo.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.220
This looks familiar to most of you.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.840
We're going to go ahead and log
in here to iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.760
I'm just going to walk you
through the new version,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.000
give you a demo here.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.260
So for those of you that have
been using iTunes Connect Mobile,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.520
this will look very familiar to you.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.520
We've made it, you know,
changed colors a little

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.510
bit and everything.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.150
But this should look very familiar.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.760
You can look at different
intervals for your information,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.190
get graph and sales and unit data.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.700
Now,
one of the things you may notice here

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.900
is that you can't actually see unit
and sales data on this particular

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.040
graph because we're logging into Apple.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.140
And we didn't actually want to
show you that information yet.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.470
So we're obfuscating
things a little bit here.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:45.450
So, you know, as Ricardo mentioned,
we now have granular user role

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.870
access to this application.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.200
So by default,
the current version of iTunes

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.000
Connect Mobile lets your legal,
admin,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.890
and finance users use the application.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.590
With this new version,
everyone that has an iTunes

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.200
Connect account can actually
use the application.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.390
and with that, you know,
some people will have the Sales and

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.640
Trends view and some people will
not and some people will have both.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.950
So, one of the new things you'll notice
here on the application is at the

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.740
bottom we have a tab called Manage.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.270
I'm going to go ahead and tap on that.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.780
and we have a new view here where
you can see your recent applications.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.550
And for those of you
who use iTunes Connect,

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.650
this will be very familiar to you.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.330
Every time you log in and
you go to manage apps,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.260
you see your recent applications
that you've most recently used.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.140
This is an analog to that.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.140
We show 24 instead of, you know,
just 10 of each type.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.560
And you can see -- you'll see the icon,
the type of the application,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.640
and the version.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.270
And if you have multiple versions,
as you see with iTunes

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.370
Connect Mobile here in the upper right,
you'll actually see the pending

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.560
version and any statuses for
the different applications.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.200
So let's go ahead and
drill into one of these.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.990
I'm going to click on iMovie here.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.220
and this is a detailed inspection
view that you'll see for a

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.750
particular application where
you can see basic information,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.340
your icon,
you can see your sales and trends

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.240
data here at the bottom if you
have access to sales and trends.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:18.350
You'll notice we have a version
display here in the middle left

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.710
and I'll go ahead and tap on that.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.140
And we can see some basic metadata
information here about your application.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.090
You can go ahead and take a
look at your status history.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.720
So if you want to know when your
status changes were and who approved

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.440
them and when they happened.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.700
You can also inspect the different
languages and the different metadata

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.440
for each of the languages you have.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.940
So I'm going to go ahead
and click on French here.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.910
And we can take a look at the
French metadata for our application.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.290
So over here on the middle right,
you see we have the customer

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.160
ratings and reviews.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.080
So right on the go,
you can take a look and see

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.020
what your latest reviews and
ratings are for your application.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.990
Go ahead and take a look
at some reviews there.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.000
And you can actually change
the country and view specific

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.700
country information if you'd like.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.900
Now, in the upper right here,
you'll notice we have something

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.600
called Add to Favorites.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.500
And we've introduced this new feature
where if you use an application a lot,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.250
you can add that to your favorites.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.400
Now, what does that mean?

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.230
It means that you as an
individual will have access to

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.000
that application across device.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.490
So I've added this to my favorites.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.390
Now, if I log in on my iPhone,
I'll have that application

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.300
available as well.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.000
So if I work on certain
applications or want easy access,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.700
I can just quickly add that.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.200
So I'm going to go ahead and navigate
back here to the Recent view.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.660
And I'm going to click on Favorites.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.940
and they're my favorites.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.660
So you can see iMovie there at the top,
which I added, and a few others here,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.890
which I happen to like.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:53.940
So there's also a button
here at the top on the left,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.080
or right, excuse me,
where you can edit your favorites and

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.080
you can rearrange them if you want.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.140
Delete them, add them, whatnot.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:04.620
So here's my favorite application,
iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:04.620
I'm going to go ahead and log into that,
drill down into that one.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.800
Now if you'll notice here in the
middle left with the versions tab,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.240
we actually see both versions,
not just one version.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.640
So with iTunes Connect Mobile 1.2,
we added push notifications.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.840
So every time a status change
happens to your application,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.300
you can get a push
notification on your device.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.240
With this new version of
iTunes Connect Mobile,

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.710
you can tap on that push notification,
drill right down into the application

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.390
to this view for your app.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.740
and you can push it live
right there if you'd like.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.640
So let's go ahead and take a look at
this pending developer release and

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.650
you'll notice there's a couple of
different buttons there on the top.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.000
One is to reject the binary.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.150
So if I'm on the go and someone says,
"Hey, there's this bug.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.210
We need to reject our
application," we can right on

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.450
the go there reject the binary.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.760
It's not something you
probably want to do very often,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.410
so we actually ask you to
re-authenticate just so you don't

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.580
accidentally reject your binaries.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.400
and you'll notice here at the top
there's this release this version.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.580
So I'm sure most of you out there
in the audience would love to

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.200
have access to this latest app.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.780
So I'm going to go
ahead and click on that.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.300
and you'll see there,
release this version.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.620
So let me go ahead and release it.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.460
So just to be clear,
I'm using iTunes Connect Mobile here

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.060
to release iTunes Connect Mobile.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.700
So with that,
iTunes Connect Mobile will be available

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.540
shortly after this demonstration.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.350
Ricardo?

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.260
Thanks, Jason.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.970
A little bit of inception for you guys.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.330
That's iTunes Connect Mobile,
available shortly after

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.200
this presentation.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.940
Okay, Section 2, what's new?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.540
Let's look at iOS 6 and Mountain Lion.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.990
First up, routing apps.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.280
As you know,
on Monday there's a new Maps app.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.070
And Routing Apps is a feature of
iOS 6 that enables you to integrate

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.310
your app with the Maps app.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.950
It allows third-party apps
to offer routing options or

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.750
directions within the Maps app.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.810
Apps with coverage in the area that
you're currently in are preferred.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.380
And you're given an option,
if the app isn't on your device,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.920
to download another app from the store.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.320
There's a GeoJSON file that's
uploaded in iTunes Connect.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.110
This is how the Maps app figures
out the apps that are relevant

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.160
in your current location.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.140
Here's a screenshot of Routing Apps.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.880
On the top section, you see two apps,
WWDC Transit and CA Transit.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.500
They're relevant because
I'm here at WWDC.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.340
And these are the apps that are located
on my device that are being present first

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.380
as the Maps app has found them using the
GeoJSON file that's present in the apps.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.450
On the bottom,
I'm also presented with some other

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:01.360
apps that are relevant in my location
area for directions from the store.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.870
I can also alternatively
download those from the store.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.640
Okay, Game Center.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.340
Game Center is new with OS X.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.110
It's been around since iOS 4.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.550
With OS X,
it introduces the possibility of true

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.860
cross-platform play between iOS and OS X.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.940
Here's a screenshot of
Game Center on OS X.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.390
Now there's a whole slew
of implementation choices

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:29.960
you can go through.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.790
We're going to cover three today.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.440
We have standalone
OS X support or iOS support,

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.420
cross-app or cross-platform
invites or matchmaking,

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.860
and cross-app or cross-platform
Game Center data sharing with

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:46.860
leaderboards and achievements.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.140
Okay, standalone support, option one.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.790
You implement GameKit for iOS or OS X,
and your app does not

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.810
depend on any other apps.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.900
It depends solely on the versions
that are part of that application.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.760
So either on iOS or OS X,
you leverage the compatibility

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.360
matrix in iTunes Connect,
and you select the versions that

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.460
are compatible with each other,
but not cross-app.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.000
This allows you to develop an
OS X and then if you want you

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.390
can add cross app support later.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.090
It's very easy.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.970
Cross-App to allow multiplayer
matchmaking or invites.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:34.340
The compatibility matrix has
been updated in iTunes Connect to

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.430
allow for not only iOS to OS X,
but also iOS to iOS if

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.430
you have a free or a paid,
or OS X to OS X.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.430
Any combination works.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.430
Let's look at an example.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.030
Today, I have Touch Fighter 2.0.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:48.090
It's gone through three revisions: 1.0,
1.5, and 2.0.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.090
And they all play with each other.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.080
Now I'm introducing
Touch Fighter 1.0 on the OS X side,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.930
like many of you might be doing
with OS X and Game Center support.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.700
So what would the
compatibility matrix look like?

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.830
So today, before this presentation,
Touch Fighter 2.0 was

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.800
able to play with 1.0,
the 1.5, and the 2.0.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.750
But now we're introducing
Touch Fighter 1.0 and OS X.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.490
The 1.0 doesn't work
with the OS X version,

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:19.800
the first version,
but the 1.5 and the 2.0 does.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.400
So we want to take this example
and this table and we're going to

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.940
drive it home with some examples.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.890
In iTunes Connect.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.800
You log in, you select TouchFighter
2.0 on the iOS side,

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.800
and you indicate the
compatibility first for that app.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.630
Here I'm choosing the 1.0, the 1.5,
and the 2.0 as we just saw on the table.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.430
Next up, for the same app,
Touch Fighter 2.0 on iOS,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.950
we're going to look at
the Touch Fighter for the

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.020
Mac version and select the 1.0.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.110
Now, one thing to note,
when you're playing around with Sandbox,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.900
let's say you're new to
OS X or generally in iOS,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.380
the apps on the left side are
all compatible in the Sandbox.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.220
You don't have to worry
about compatibility.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.500
It just works.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.380
However, when you go to production,
that's where things matter and that's

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.140
where the version indications that
you mark on these pages will be used.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.400
The third option is data sharing.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.400
This introduces a new concept called
Game Center Grouping in iTunes Connect.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.340
If you saw Dan Kurtz's
presentation yesterday,

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.320
which I highly recommend,
he goes over a lot of the GameKit details

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.600
on implementing GameKit for OS X and iOS.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.480
And there he talked
about grouping as well.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.500
This allows you to group your
leaderboards and achievements.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.120
And one thing to note,
we do support backwards

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.040
compatibility here.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.340
So you've got old leaderboards or
achievement identifiers that you're

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.100
posting scores to on iOS 4 or iOS 5.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.070
The scores will roll up
automatically to those grouped

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.080
leaderboards and achievements.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.060
The end result is unified view both
on iOS and OS X for Game Center.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:04.300
Okay, Game Center today, before grouping.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.370
You have an iPad app that
earns an achievement.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.600
It's sent up to the
Game Center Cloud for Touch Fighter.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.250
And when you go into Game Center,
it's reflected accordingly

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.510
there on the app.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.200
Let's say you have another app.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.840
It can be an iOS app,
in this case an OS X app.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.660
It also earns that achievement,
goes up to the cloud,

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.540
and it's reflected on the OS X side.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.850
But there's no sharing
of the achievements.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.680
You notice the achievement was earned
on one side for the iOS side and on

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.180
the other side for the OS X side,
and they were segregated.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.290
With grouping,
we go ahead and iTunes Connect,

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.470
we specify a grouped
achievement identifier of

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.520
group.touchfighter.perfectscore.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.880
And then we update our app to post
score to that grouped achievement.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.000
And then on the iOS side,

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.720
You post a score and it's
reflected accordingly on

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.320
both the iOS and OS X side.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.790
And the same thing when you post from the
other apps that are part of the group.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.100
Okay,
let's try this one with some examples.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.890
So I have Touch Fighter 2.0 for
iOS and Touch Fighter 1.0 OS X.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.260
Same example we've been looking at.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.630
We have a leaderboard,
touchfighter.leaderboard,

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.110
both on the Mac and iOS side.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.260
There's the identifiers.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.670
And we go ahead and group it in
iTunes Connect and we give it a

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.170
grouped leaderboard identifier.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.490
Second example, Touch Fighter iOS,
again with Touch Fighter 1.0

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.530
and OS X side.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.020
We've got support for the
Level 1 in our iOS version,

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.520
and we've introduced support for
the Level 1 on the OS X side.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.600
We go ahead and group it.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.410
We post those scores to
group.touchfighter.level1.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.300
But let's say that the level two isn't
quite ready yet on the OS X side.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.470
We've got a bigger real estate,
we've got a lot of other things

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.260
that we want to put in the
level two on the OS X side.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.140
That's okay though.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.260
You can still go into iTunes Connect and
you can prepare this grouped leaderboard,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.930
give it a grouped identifier,
and start posting scores

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.880
to that grouped identifier.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.100
One thing to note on leaderboards
is when you're merging them

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.920
or grouping them together,
you need to be sure that you need to

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.540
group appropriate leaderboards together.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.160
For example, a time-based leaderboard and
a points-based leaderboard

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.180
will not play with each other.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.160
And we have validations
to help you with this.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.060
Similarly, on the achievement side,
to drive it home further,

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.470
we have Touch Fighter 2.0
on the iOS side,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.960
Touch Fighter 1.0 on the OS X side.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.750
We've got single game achievements
of Touch Fighter dot Perfect Score,

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.040
and on the Mac side,
Touch Fighter dot Mac dot Perfect Score.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.760
We group that achievement in iTunes
Connect using the new grouping UI,

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.200
and we start posting to that
Perfect Score achievement.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.120
and 100 Wins isn't implemented
yet in the OS X side,

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.450
but we go ahead and we group that,
give an identifier and start posting

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.940
to that identifier regardless.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.940
Here's what the UI looks like.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.900
In iTunes Connect,
you have a single game option

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.180
or a group of games option.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.250
Now, when you're using Game Center,

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.240
The grouping UI is now available
as of Monday in iTunes Connect.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.170
You can go ahead and start
merging and grouping your

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.600
leaderboards and achievements.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.620
One thing to note,
especially if you're playing

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.460
around with Mountain Lion,
is if you're grouping your leaderboards

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.340
or achievements and you have a bug
fix for another different reason,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.000
you'll want to ungroup it first,
submit that bug fix,

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.790
and then come back into
iTunes Connect and group it.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.540
and with that,
I want to bring up Dave Van Tassell,

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.760
Senior Software Engineer, iTunes Store,
iTunes Connect.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.700
He's going to walk you through the UI and
Game Center changes in iTunes Connect.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.720
Dave.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.390
Thank you, Ricardo.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.780
As you've heard,
there's a couple of new ways to enhance

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.300
your customers' Game Center experience
using iTunes Connect.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.290
So let's go ahead and
take a look at them.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:08.140
Log in here to iTunes Connect,
manage my applications.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.770
We have our two apps,
our Touch Fighter for iOS and

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.310
Touch Fighter for the Mac.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.490
and we want to make our Touch Fighter for
the Mac compatible for multiplayer

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.850
compatibility between the two.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:27.070
So it's the same location as cross
app as compatibility was before.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.400
Scroll down here to the bottom.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.900
We click the Multiplayer Compatibility.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.510
And we can see those
versions for this app.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.160
What's new now is we can come
in here and add a second app,

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.000
Touch Friday for iOS.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.330
If you've played around with
this already in iTunes Connect,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:48.240
you'll notice that this screen
does not allow you to select

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:48.240
other versions of that app.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.000
Currently we're in Sandbox only.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.980
When Mountain Lion ships,
we'll be able to come in and select

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.750
these versions for other apps.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.440
So TouchWriter 2 for iOS,
we're going to select

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.430
our 1.5 and our 2.0.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.020
Now we can see that Touch Fighter for
the Mac is compatible with

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.010
all of its own versions,
including this one,

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.920
as well as Touch Fighter 2 for iOS,
only versions 1.5 and 2.0.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.320
And at this point, I'll be able to,
in sandbox mode,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.780
all those versions between those
two apps will be compatible.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.310
And when this version
of my Mac App goes live,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.900
then in production I'll be able to
have the cross-app compatibility

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.110
with TouchWrite for iOS.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.490
and that's cross-app compatibility.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.800
Now we want to share our leaderboards
and achievements between the two apps.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.000
So we're on Touch Friday for the
Mac and we click Manage Game Center.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.670
I've set up some leaderboards
and some achievements.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:59.020
for this app.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080
And I want to move it to a group.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.080
Click on Move to Group and
I have the option of creating a

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.080
brand new group or attaching it
to a group that already exists.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.080
I've already created the iOS group.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.080
So I'm going to go ahead and
attach this Touch Fighter group.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.920
My next step is to merge all
of my existing leaderboards

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.570
and achievements into the group
leaderboards and achievements.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.850
Now this first one here is a time trial.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.000
My existing group doesn't have
any time-based leaderboards,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.400
so my only option is to create a new one.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.890
However, with leaderboard and level one,
they match with some

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.740
existing leaderboards.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.130
So I have the option of selecting
existing group leaderboards

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.790
that I'd like to select from.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.540
I come down here and
I have my perfect score.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.540
My existing iOS app had two achievements.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.700
However, I know this one matches
with perfect score.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.560
I'm presented with a screen to just
kind of confirm what I've been doing.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.680
I have my leaderboards and
achievements on the left-hand side

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.500
and how they are mapping to group
leaderboards that already exist.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.440
Leaderboard to leaderboard,
level one to level one.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.600
My Mac app didn't have a level
two leaderboard and it's showing

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.360
me that there was one in the
group but I didn't match it.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.030
And the time trial for my Mac,
although it didn't exist

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.220
previously in the group,
it does now.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:12.220
So now it shows up on the group site.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:14.960
My achievements are the same.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.160
There was no 100 wins on this app,
so there's a space.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.440
Let me know in case
I meant to do 100 wins.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.500
Kind of reconfirms how my merge went.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.340
Perfect score to perfect score.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.860
All changes are accurate.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.720
Click Save.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.590
Now I can see my group display.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.000
I can see Touch Fighter for iOS,
Touch Fighter for the Mac.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.810
I can see all leaderboards and
achievements for the group.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:44.200
and that is how you do game sharing
with leaderboards and achievements

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.940
and cross-app compatibility.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.100
I turn the time over to Ricardo.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.440
Thank you, Dave.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.350
That's Game Center in iTunes Connect,
the new grouping, merging UI.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.680
OK, what's new in In-App Purchases?

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.390
First up is In-App Purchase
hosted content.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.330
First off,
if you haven't seen Daniel Feldman's

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.360
presentation yesterday on
selling products in StoreKit,

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.980
I highly recommend it
to download the video.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.550
It walks you through all of the
features of In-App Purchases,

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.640
how to implement an iOS side,
how to implement on the OS X side,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.110
especially In-App Purchase/Apple
hosted content.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.810
In-App Purchase-Listed Content is new
for iOS 6 and Mountain Lion and is

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.180
optional for new in-app purchases.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.250
It pertains to the
non-consumable type only.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:48.200
and allows Apple hosted content to be
delivered with your In-App Purchase.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.200
There's a size limit here of two gigs.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:53.360
An example would be as new game levels
are purchased with In-App Purchases,

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.220
you can deliver the maps to go
along with those game levels

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.190
from Apple and not your servers.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.890
You set up In-App Purchase
hosted content in iTunes Connect.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.140
There are two additional states
that go along with in-app purchases

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.940
that are hosted with Apple.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:17.690
Waiting for upload because we haven't
received your archive yet and processing

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.690
upload when we receive the archive and
we're processing it for the App Store to

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.690
go along with your in-app purchase.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:23.040
You develop and test your hosted
content locally in the latest Xcode.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.360
And then you can deliver-- sorry,
you prepare the archiving Xcode as well.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.630
And then you can deliver an
application loader or Xcode.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.440
In iTunes Connect, there's a new Boolean
hosting content with Apple.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.740
You indicate yes.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.870
This then is reflected on the SK product.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.970
The Boolean will be true for
that SK product and you'll know

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:50.160
that that hosted content lives
with Apple or that the SK product

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.160
actually has hosted content.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.320
iTunes Connect has been updated to
give you some information when the

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.990
In-App Purchas has hosted content.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.500
and Application Loader allows you
to deliver in-app purchases with

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.090
hosted content along with the
archive that is built in Xcode.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.340
Let's take a look at Newsstand.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.110
Newsstand was announced last
February with The Daily.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.210
Free subscriptions.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.100
They allow free publications
with no auto-renew period.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.160
We have subcategory support
which we just rolled out.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.230
This improves the marketing
and discoverability of your

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.710
newsstand publications.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.600
and free trial support.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.350
Enables trying before buying
and when the free trial is over,

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.220
the customer's billing period
will automatically begin.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:59.410
Screenshot of iTunes Connect and
additional subcategories that

00:28:59.410 --> 00:28:59.410
are available when you're
using free subscriptions.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:28:59.410
Sorry, when you're using
newsstand subscriptions.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.520
Here's a shot of the device,
of what it looks like to browse

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.500
by these new subcategories.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.300
It makes finding these
subscriptions much easier.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:15.140
And the indication in iTunes Connect that
you want to offer a free trial.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:27.360
Finally, we've made some changes in the
tool and workflow area for iTunes

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:27.360
Connect and Application Loader.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:28.780
to support In-App Purchases.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.980
Last year, as a reminder,
we announced Application Loader

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.170
support for In-App Purchases.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.170
You can set up individual
In-App Purchases with their

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.640
screenshots or you can use a
tab-delimited spreadsheet to ingest

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.900
and deliver all the screenshots and
the metadata to the iTunes Store.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:52.520
We just saw the new support for
In-App Purchas hosted content.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.240
We also have sorting by status.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:58.170
This allows you to find problematic
In-App Purchases quickly.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:05.300
A new feature that we're announcing
today is called Catalog Reports.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.740
Catalog Reports are a new downloadable
tab-delimited report in iTunes Connect.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.320
The format is easily ingestible.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.880
It's tab-delimited, you can download it,
and you can use any automated

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.620
system you want to parse it.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.220
It gives you a wide glance
across all your In-App Purchases,

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:24.630
including the localizations, the tier,
and other information that's relevant.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.350
In addition to the In-App Purchas report,
we're also announcing an apps report

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.480
that will be available for download.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.250
Like the In-App Purchas report,
it gives you a glance of

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.480
all your applications.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:38.130
So if you've got 5,000 apps,
they'll be all there for you to review.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.180
and coming soon we're going to
have a Game Center report in

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.080
the Catalog Reports section for
Leaderboards and Achievements.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.220
And with that, I'd like to bring Aloke
Bhatnagar on my team.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.800
He's the engineering
manager of iTunes Store,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.610
iTunes Connect.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.500
He's going to walk you through some
of the In-App Purchas tool changes.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.120
Aloke.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.800
Thank you, Ricardo.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.030
Hello, everyone.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.540
So as Ricardo mentioned,
we made quite a few enhancements in the

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:14.380
In-App Purchase area in iTunes Connect,
and I'm going to walk you through those.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.870
Let's start with
In-App Purchas content hosting.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.080
Go into iTunes Connect,
click on Manage your applications.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.450
Choose our favorite app,
Touch Fighter for iOS,

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.080
and select Manage In-App Purchases.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.280
As Ricardo mentioned,
that in-app purchase content

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.000
hosting is available only for
non-consumable in-app purchase types.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.710
So let's go ahead and create
a new in-app purchase.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.530
Select non-consumable.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.910
Give it a reference name.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:08.600
[Transcript missing]

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.140
and Hit Save.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.060
Now, for those of you who work
with In-App Purchasers,

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.160
there's absolutely nothing different
with what we've done so far.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.280
But here's where the difference starts.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.640
We offer a new section called
Hosting Content with Apple,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.000
and you can choose yes or no,
depending on whether you want

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.890
Apple to host your content for you.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.450
There's also a new Review Notes section
that's optional in case you wanted

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.260
to give any notes to the reviewer,
like login information

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:44.660
or any other information,
you can go ahead and send that.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.190
So let's go ahead and add a screenshot.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.000
For now I'm going to say
no for the hosting content.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.190
Go ahead and hit save.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.580
As you can see,
everything's normal so far.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.260
We've hit the ready to submit state.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.780
Oh, by the way,
we've also added sorting by status now,

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.340
which is convenient if you
want to quickly look up an

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.690
in-app purchase of given types.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:20.510
Now let's go back into the
In-App Purchase we just created.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.040
Hit Edit on the In-App Purchase Details.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.060
And choose Yes for the
hosting content with Apple.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.140
As soon as I hit save,
you're going to notice that the

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.200
status will move from ready to
submit to waiting for upload.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.740
Now there's In-App Purchas ready
in a state where I can go into

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.300
Application Loader or Xcode to go
ahead and deliver a package against it.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.920
And that's In-App Purchas
content hosting.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.740
Now let's quickly go
back to our home page.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:52.210
As Ricardo mentioned,
we'll be releasing today catalog reports.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.900
Now what exactly is a catalog report?

00:33:55.010 --> 00:34:01.890
Think of catalog reports as a
snapshot of your data at the

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.290
current time in tab-delimited
format so that you can easily ingest

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:04.290
into your automated processes.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.460
So let's go ahead and
take a look at that.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.720
As you can see,
I requested a few already.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.620
We have catalog reports for in-app
purchases and the app and apps,

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.790
so you can download either one.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.190
Let's go ahead and download one of these.

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:23.460
As you can see,
this is a very easily ingestible format,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.350
and we'll do that by
dragging this into numbers.

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:36.200
This is a little bit larger.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.000
And it contains data like Apple ID,
reference name,

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:44.960
product ID for your in-app purchases,
add-on type, any relevant information

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.180
that you want to see,
all the way up to the current price tier,

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.600
whether it's cleared for sale or not.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.880
Sorry,
these columns are not auto-expanding.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.440
The app name data and any
localizations if you had any.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.900
So how do I get a catalog report?

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.050
You go ahead and request a new report.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.020
Select from apps and app purchases,
what the heck, we'll just take both.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.010
Request new reports.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.280
Now as you can see,
they are in the ready to process section,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.370
in the ready to process state,
and within a couple of hours,

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.860
they'll get processed and I'll get
an email saying that they're ready

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.800
to download and they'll be available
for download just like over here.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:36.200
And that's Catalog Reports and this
is releasing today for everyone.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.060
For the last part of the demo,
as Ricardo mentioned,

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:46.180
in Application Loader,
we have a new From File option

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:51.040
now where you can mass ingest
IAPs into iTunes Connect.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.100
So in order to do that,
you create a new package,

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.110
choose New From File.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:05.050
And this is a simple tab-delimited
text file that contains all

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.150
my in-app purchase data.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.830
Going to go ahead and hit open.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:17.710
and as you can see, it's ingested all the
In-App Purchase data,

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.710
including price tiers,
whether it's clear for sale or not,

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.710
and the screenshots.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.830
Let me just scroll
through that real quick,

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.120
make sure everything's okay.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.600
And for non-consumable types,
you can also go ahead and select the

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.300
content hosting packages for this.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.520
And that is Application Loader.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.510
Back to Ricardo.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.600
Thank you, Aloke.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.560
All right.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.470
If you're not paying attention,
now is the time to do so.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.910
We have something unplanned in our
little hidden agenda and we want

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.670
to talk about something new today.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.800
It's called XML Feed Support.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.930
I'd like to bring up Dave Makower,
my peer, Senior Engineering Manager of

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.670
iTunes Store Content Import,
to tell you all about it.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.370
Thank you, Dave.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.500
Thank you, Ricardo.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.620
Again, my name is Dave Makower.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.180
I manage content import and asset
management for the iTunes Store.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.520
And I'm here to tell you about
our new XML feed support.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.140
So let's start by taking a
look at what In-App Purchase

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.220
data entry looks like today.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.810
You have a few options.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:34.730
You have manual data
entry in iTunes Connect.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:35.960
Or you have...

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.700
Manual Data Entry in Application Loader.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.010
Sends a theme here.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:48.480
There's also, as you just saw,
New from File in Application Loader,

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.990
which allows you to bulk
import in-app purchases.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.940
And this kind of gets to the
motivation for XML feed support.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.400
So a GUI is fine if you have a few items.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.780
But what if you have 100?

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.940
What if you have 1,000?

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:11.520
Using an XML feed is going to work
better if you have many items.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.590
And additionally,

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.840
Being able to do it from the
command line facilitates bulk data

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:21.440
management and allows integration
with your existing automated systems.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.140
Here are some of the features
of our XML feed support.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.800
For In-App Purchase,
we support iOS and OS X.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:35.360
We support all In-App Purchase
types subject to existing

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.760
App Store policies about those types.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.180
We support interval pricing,
which is the way in which you

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.740
set up sale windows over time,
varying your price over time.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:50.040
For Game Center,
we also support iOS and OS X.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:55.700
And we support uploading and updating
leaderboards and achievements.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.660
So general features of
our XML feed support.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.440
You can upload localized metadata.

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.840
There is synchronous validation,
so if you get something wrong,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.160
you're going to know right away.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.100
There's also command
line metadata lookup.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:17.390
So from the command line,
you can look up XML that you can then

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.350
edit and send back in through the feed.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:25.310
And we'll be publishing a
fully documented XML spec.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.490
So here's how it works.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.610
You start by creating
what we call a package.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:35.540
A package is just a directory
with a .itmsp extension.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.530
It's got a metadata.xml file in
there and optionally some assets,

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.870
for example, screenshots.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.200
Or you can use the command
line to look up the metadata.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:48.940
The package will get created
for you automatically.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.700
And then you can edit the looked up XML.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.690
And then you use the command line
to upload the package to Apple.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.660
So here's what it looks like.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.710
For In-App Purchase, this is an example.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.070
and I'll zoom in on a
couple of features here.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.400
So we have the vendor ID,
we call it vendor ID.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.530
This is your ID, you are the vendor.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.840
This is your identifier for this app.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:20.990
So this is your SKU,
what you call SKU in iTunes Connect.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.900
Then we've got some basic metadata
about the In-App Purchase.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.710
Product ID, Reference Name,
Type is consumable in this case.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.270
Then you've got this product block
and this is where you declare your

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.350
pricing and availability data.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:43.030
We've got some localized metadata.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.430
And reference to review
screenshots which are in the

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:50.640
folder with the metadata.xml file.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.790
So that's In-App Purchas.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.470
Here's what it looks
like for Game Center.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.170
Again, we've got a vendor ID,
that's the SKU of your app.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.120
And here's an achievement.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.800
with basic metadata
about the achievement.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.110
The achievement ID, the reference name.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.960
In this case, there's some points there,
and this is a reusable achievement.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.500
Again, we've got localized metadata and
I'll zoom in on one part of this

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:25.740
to show you that localized metadata
actually has a localized image there.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.290
and here we have a leaderboard,
some basic metadata

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.440
about the leaderboard.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.590
Localized metadata.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200
and that's pretty much it.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.700
So this is all coming this fall,
but we can show you a demo now.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.770
And that's what I'm about to do.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.910
And I'm going to start by
going into iTunes Connect.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.860
I'm going to go to
Manage Your Applications,

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.640
Touch Fighter 2 for iOS,
Manage In-App Purchases.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.190
Now here I have my 100 missiles.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.900
And you'll see that I have
one row in this table here

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.040
for pricing and availability.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.730
The price tier is tier 3.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.860
It was effective as of May 23rd.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.030
And there's no end date.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.800
So this is the price
tier for now and forever.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.800
So the next thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to go into the command line.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:40.810
and I'm going to look up
the metadata for this app.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:47.600
has created the package for
me on the desktop there.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.320
Show package contents and we
have our metadata.xml file,

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:55.860
which I'm going to drag onto Xcode.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.730
This is what we just
retrieved from the server.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.400
You see I have the pricing
and availability section,

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.000
the products as I pointed out before.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:07.100
And there's one interval.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.490
This corresponds to that
one row in the table we saw.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.790
The start date is listed as of today,
and as this comment points out,

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:19.590
that's because in metadata lookup,
you're always looking at a snapshot

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:20.700
from today into the future.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.440
There may have been
intervals in the past,

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.660
but they're not really interesting
for import and they're not

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.360
interesting for metadata lookup.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.770
So we're going to put this on sale.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.550
We're going to have a July 4th sale.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:38.520
I'm going to stick
another interval in there,

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.120
if I can find the right spot.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:42.120
Which that is not the right spot.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:55.350
So this interval has a start date of
July 4th and an end date of July 5th.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.580
We're going to bring it
down to price tier one.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.490
Now there's an ambient interval here

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:19.300
[Transcript missing]

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.600
So the next thing I'm going to do,
having edited that,

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.220
is use the command line to upload it.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.800
So the package was uploaded successfully.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.370
So here's where I need
to kill a little time.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:42.740
Because this is an asynchronous process.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.960
Why is this an asynchronous process?

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:48.440
This is the same system
that's importing music,

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.930
videos, books, your apps,
all the content that we

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.130
sell in the iTunes Store.

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:58.110
So we don't want to make you
wait while you're in a queue

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:01.100
along with that other stuff.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:04.060
So the first part of the process,
accept your package,

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.780
make sure it's valid,
and then we take it in.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.750
And then we're going to import it.

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.940
So I'll take a look over here
and see if it's imported yet.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.550
There we go.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.960
Thanks very much.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.280
So that's coming this fall.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.340
And I will now turn to
be back over to Ricardo.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.040
So two points on that.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.800
One, there's a gentleman that
filed a wrist injury radar.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.270
I'm not sure if you're in the audience,
but this is for you.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.150
And we do listen to all the radars,
so file them if you have enhancements

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.140
that you'd like in our tools.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.300
Secondly,
we have tons and tons of content

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.890
that we import every day.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:53.550
Daily TV shows,
thousands and thousands of songs,

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:54.560
terabytes of data.

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:58.060
So those imports that Dave sent
got behind some of that stuff

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.160
that was probably higher priority.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.130
Okay.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.180
XML Feed Support.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.290
That's coming this fall.

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:10.800
Some best practices, some ITC gotchas.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.910
App delete mistakes.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.200
Once your app is deleted, it's gone.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.220
No, really, it's gone.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:21.270
So don't complain when it's gone.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:26.210
And so is the app name.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:26.290
So be careful when you
want to delete your app.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.410
Edit your Bundle Identifier.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.090
This is just news in case
you haven't heard about it.

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:33.610
If your app has not been
submitted to the store,

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:37.590
the binary, you can edit your Bundle
Identifier before doing that.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:43.830
Six months is the limit for reserving
your app name in iTunes Connect.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:45.340
In-App Purchase Submission.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.900
The first time you submit in-app
purchases for your application,

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.170
they must travel with a
binary for app review.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.940
Subsequent submissions can use
the ad hoc submission process.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.800
And when you go to submit them,
on the version update page,

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.560
you'll want to select the
in-app purchases appropriately

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.890
that travel with that binary.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.060
Meaningful descriptions.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:09.170
You should highlight your app's features
and summarize your hardware requirements.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:12.520
Direct your customers to
your support URL for in-depth

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:18.610
requirements on your CPU,
RAM, video cards, etc.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.440
Beta Trial, invite-only apps are
definitely considered betas

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.510
and they will be rejected.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.390
For providing a demo account,
make sure the demo account

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.910
works for the entire app,
not just for a portion of it.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:34.620
Registration.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:38.450
You can't prompt a registration page
to collect information from the user

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:41.570
unless you have account-based features.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:46.410
Your support URLs, your marketing URLs,
and your privacy

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:49.360
URLs should be functioning,
they should work,

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.600
and they should be relevant
to your application.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:57.580
Category, it's necessary to choose a
relevant category for your app.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.900
Web Content.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:04.180
You should avoid building 100%
web views in your application.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:07.540
Compatibility.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.110
If you have an iPhone-only app,
it needs to be tested in

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:11.570
compatibility mode on the iPad.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:14.600
If it doesn't work on the
iPad in compatibility mode,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.970
it will be rejected.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:25.980
The In-App Purchase Type,
please choose correctly.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:25.980
Auto-renewable, non-renewing, consumable,
non-consumable,

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:25.980
or if you're using a newsstand.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:31.440
Some import errors that we
commonly see that you get an import

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:33.700
error email for post delivery.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:39.560
We often see missing values in these
Info.plist entries for the CFBundleIcon,

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:45.040
CFBundleIconFiles,
and CFBundleIconsArray.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.550
In terms of your equity
signing for document storage,

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.750
Important to note that the first key,
Ubiquity Continuum Identifiers,

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.860
is actually an array and it's
prefixed by your team ID from

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.600
the WWDR Developer Portal.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:06.610
And the second is a string prefixed by
your team ID also from the WWDR Portal.

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.390
Invalid signature, we often see this.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:13.290
This happens mostly because of an
expired or revoked certificate.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.840
You submit the binary to us,
we send you an email saying

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:17.220
it has an invalid signature.

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:21.180
If you get one of those emails,
you'll want to check this first.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.580
and Malform Frameworks.

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.040
We often see code signing
issues with frameworks.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.580
On the OS X side, you want to see the
Developer OS X Programming Guide.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:36.610
It has a very strict structure on
how you need to organize things for

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:36.610
your file structure for signing.

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.060
And that's our four areas for today.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:47.160
For more information, Paul Marcos is our
Application Services Evangelist.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.660
iTunes Connect Developer Guide,
as always, is available on iTunes

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.240
Connect at apple.com.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:54.950
This video will be posted at
developer.apple.com/videos,

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:57.440
especially for those that are
using the Game Center grouping UI.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:00.440
I highly recommend you walk
through the examples and the

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.200
demo that was given today.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.920
And of course,
the dev forums at devforums@apple.com.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:08.420
Selling products with StoreKit,
highly recommended.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:11.110
You check that one out from yesterday,
especially if you want to use the

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:13.720
Apple or In-App Purchase hosted content.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.440
That was from Daniel Feldman.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.790
That will be available on video.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:22.040
We have tools and services APIs for
iTunes affiliates here at 11:30.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:24.500
Building great newsstand apps,
manage subscriptions

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:25.340
with In-App Purchase.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.600
It's also an In-App Purchase session.

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.510
And building and distributing
custom B2B apps if you're interested

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.040
in the custom B2B program.

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:33.790
In summary,

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.710
Play around with the Mountain Seed
and get your app ready for

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.440
In-App Purchase hosted content.

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:41.190
The Sandbox is ready now
for In-App Purchase hosted

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:44.480
content and so are the tools,
Application Loader and iTunes Connect,

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.520
as well as Game Center.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.560
The Game Center grouping,
as we mentioned,

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:52.840
the UI is available for merging
your leaderboards and achievements.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.690
The grouping in OS X will
go live with Mountain Lion.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.360
Because we have backwards
compatibility to iOS 4 and iOS 5,

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.240
those go live too.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:05.010
So you'll have grouping on both platforms
without iOS 6 when Mountain Lion ships.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:07.540
and you should start
implementing iOS 6 support.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:12.180
Again, In-App Purchas hosted content,
that sandbox is live now.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.700
And iOS 6 binaries will
be accepted in the fall.

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.020
Thank you and have a
good rest of your week.
