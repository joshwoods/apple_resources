WEBVTT

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.200
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.940
My name is Jeff Watkins,
and I'm an iOS engineer

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.040
on the Game Center team.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.940
And today, I have the pleasure of talking
to you about some of the

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.640
new features in GameCenter.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.310
Now, as you would expect,
there are a lot of things

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900
under the covers that are new.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.200
We've accelerated authentication,
so now your players can get

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.320
into the game a lot faster.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.740
We've also accelerated things like
submitting scores and achievements,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.900
so they take fewer system resources.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.630
But really, that's the sort of thing that
you've just come to expect from

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.660
us with each rep of the software.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.200
So they don't merit any more talking.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.820
But we've talked to you guys a
lot over the last year or so.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.490
And whether you're a veteran of the
game industry and you've been making

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.800
games since I was actually good at them,
like back in Dig Dug days,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.490
or you're brand new to
building games for iOS,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.230
you all have one thing in common.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.620
You're the reason I can't get
my iPad back for my daughter.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.160
And it's really quite fantastic
what you guys are doing with games.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.820
They're really, really amazing.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.080
The sorts of things that you
guys are doing on these little

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.440
devices is just incredible.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.500
It's the sort of thing that you'd
have to take a workstation from

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.820
five years ago to have done,
and now it's on a little phone.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.190
It's really amazing.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.960
And the fact is,
these are really fun games.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.820
And you're looking for something to set
your games apart from all the others.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.410
You're looking for an edge.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.450
You're looking for something that's
going to make your game a success.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.090
But I hope you're looking
for something more than that.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.040
You're looking for something to
make your game a huge success.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.990
Now, there are a lot of factors that
go into making a game successful.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.550
You've probably heard lots of things
about successful applications all

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.960
throughout the conference so far.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.250
But there really are three
specific things that we want to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.830
talk about in terms of games that
we think are really critical to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.830
the success of all of your games.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.530
The first of those is discoverable.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.460
Your game has to be discoverable.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.400
And by that,
I mean people have to find it, right?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.260
If they don't find the game,
they're not going to download it.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.400
If they don't download it,
they won't play it.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.460
If they don't play it,
they won't have fun,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.460
they won't tell their friends,
and more people won't

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.460
experience your game.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.020
Second, your game has to be polished.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.660
And this goes way beyond 3D graphics and
fancy sprites and immersive 3D sound.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.650
There's a basic level of functionality
that all players expect now,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.300
and your game has to support that.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.180
And finally, your game has to be fun.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.180
If it's not fun,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.790
That's all over.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.960
You're going to have to go back to
the financial industry and write

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.710
stock trading software and cry
yourself to sleep every night.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.660
So those are the three things
we're going to talk about today.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.320
Now let's dive right in with number one.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.600
Discoverable.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.520
So what do I mean by discoverable?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.040
If you think about how
you learn about games,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.300
you learn about games from your friends.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.420
And we think that one of the
best places to learn about

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.440
games is through Game Center.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.020
Game Center is fantastic for games.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.250
You wouldn't expect me to say that
since I am a Game Center engineer.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.170
But the fact is Game Center is terrific.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.040
We've got 130 million players.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.720
Now, those people aren't just signing
up for the latest social networking

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.720
craze and then doing nothing.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.860
They're out there, they're playing games,
they're having a

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.440
tremendous amount of fun.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.830
In fact, they're playing so many games
that they're submitting 5

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.280
billion scores every week.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.640
That's a mind-blowing number.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.160
It's actually amazing to me, frankly,
that these folks get anything

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.020
done because they're having so
much fun playing your games.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.630
In fact, we all play your games a
little bit too much too.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.910
So, 5 billion scores,
130 million players.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.720
Of the top 100 games,
67 of them are Game Center games.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.500
And we find that Game Center games
cluster near the top.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.080
So Game Center games are
typically rated higher and are

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.610
downloaded more than other games.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.660
So those of you who have
games in Game Center,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.540
you know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.740
This is a fantastic party.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.200
Folks are out there,
they're playing games,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.260
they're having a lot of fun.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.900
Those of you who don't have
games in Game Center yet,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.740
dude, what are you waiting for?

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.210
This is the thing you've
got to take advantage of.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.740
So how does a party get started?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.020
Well, it all gets started with
game recommendations.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.850
You want to have some
games on your device.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.350
And the best way to get games, we find,
is to recommend games that

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.570
you already like playing.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.710
So, for example,
later we're going to talk about Aideen,

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.820
and she's a racing fan,
she has stock car racing games,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.460
sailboat racing games,
and now she's branching

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.320
out to space racing games.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.860
So naturally,
if there's a new racing game out there,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.570
we're going to recommend
the racing game to Aideen.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.880
But also, we'll recommend games to Aideen
based on the games her friends play.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.470
So her friend Bill loves Railroad Empire,
so naturally you're going to

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.810
recommend that game as well,
because it only makes sense that

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.970
the games that your friends play,
you might want to play with them.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.040
Now, friends, pretty important deal,
especially if they're going to

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.320
get game recommendations for you.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.800
So friend recommendations are also
an integral part of Game Center.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.040
Now, we'll recommend friends
by the games you play.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:25.590
So to Aideen, we'll recommend players
that also like racing games.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.590
But we can also now, in iOS 6,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.640
We can recommend friends based
on your Facebook profile.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.900
So you can link your Game Center account
with your Facebook account,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.540
and right away you can find all
of your friends from Facebook,

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.330
you can find their Game Center profiles.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.790
And we think this is a great way
to get players' friend graphs

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.790
up and running very quickly.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.620
Now, friends are really important.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.630
Every afternoon special you've ever
seen drums that into your head.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.540
Friends are your lifeline.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.820
They do everything for you.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.190
If you think about how you and your
friends interact regarding games,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.340
you can see why friends are so important.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.100
When my team and I are
hanging out playing games,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.840
we don't just play the game.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.680
We talk about the games we have played.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.270
In fact, most of the games that I enjoy
playing with my family,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.540
I discovered because of my friends.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.490
And so friends are crucial to
the discoverability of your game.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.050
So friends tell friends about games.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.980
It's that simple, right?

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.570
Baked into Game Center from day one
has been the ability to tell your

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.340
friends about the games you're playing.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.040
All you have to do is
tap that little button,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.340
up comes an email sheet,
you address it to some of

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:45.340
your friends and whoosh,
now they know.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.690
That's a good start.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.560
And in iOS 5, we added in-app rating.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.370
So previously,
you had to ask players to pop off

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.150
to the app store and rate your
game and maybe write a review.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.950
But now, right after they finish playing
and they've had a great time,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.080
they bring up their leaderboard to see
how they compare against their friends,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.090
and right there they can rate your
game and let everybody in the app store

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.360
know what a great game you've built.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.730
Now, this is pretty critical, right,
because you can imagine we recommend

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.090
games that are five stars before we'll
recommend games that are one star.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.260
Now, we can't hide it.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.020
Up there in the top right-hand corner
is a brand-new feature in iOS 6,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.440
the Facebook Like button.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.000
Now,
if your players have Facebook accounts,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.370
they can tap on the Like button,
and that will send a

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.990
message off to Facebook,
and in their friends' news feeds,

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.980
they'll see the fact
that you like this game.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.910
Now, when their friends tap on the link,
we'll take them directly

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.720
to the App Store,
and they can download your game.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.710
We think this is a fantastic way
for your players to spread the word

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.170
about what a great game you've built.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.280
Now, your friends,
when you're playing games and

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.800
you're talking about games,
we don't stop at just telling

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.990
each other about new games,
do we?

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:19.960
If your friends are
anything like my friends,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:19.960
they kind of, shall we say,
brag about their scores.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.330
And it makes me feel a little bad
because I'm a terrible game player.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.430
But we wanted to take advantage of that,
right?

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.220
Because this is the sort of
energy that players already have.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.540
They're already doing this activity.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.660
So let's give them the facility to
do that right inside Game Center.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.770
So here you'll see the brand-new
score and achievement detail.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.730
And right there is the share button.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.570
All your players have
to do is tap on that.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.930
and they'll get the system-wide
UI activity view controller.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.790
And from there,
they can share their scores

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:04.520
and achievements via email,
via iMessage, via Twitter or Facebook.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.580
In this case,
I'm going to tap on Facebook.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.890
Up comes the system
composed sheet for Facebook.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.830
We've prepopulated that with
information about the game they're

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.920
playing and a link to Game Center.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.770
When the player taps post,
all of his friends' devices will

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:28.080
see the update to their Facebook or
Twitter or any other social network

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.350
stream with the information about
the liked and the shared score.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.580
So that's great, right?

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.210
We could bring them to the App Store,
but that's not really

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.340
how we wanted to do this.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.340
So when they tap on that link,
we'll actually bring them into

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.610
Game Center and we'll show them
the achievement or the score

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.840
that the player has shared.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.900
And when they tap on that link,
we'll actually bring them

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.060
into Game Center and right
there from inside Game Center,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.680
if they don't already have the game,
they can download the game.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.280
Plus, if they're not already
friends via Game Center,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.190
there'll be a button there to
send a friend request so that now

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.180
they'll have found another friend
via their social networking.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.600
So shared scores and
achievements are great,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.030
and that's part of the equation.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.340
But my friends don't stop at
sharing their scores with me,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.280
much as I wish they would.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.590
They also go on to challenge me
to try and beat their scores.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.200
And so we've built that
right into Game Center.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.090
Challenges are gonna be huge.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.150
Now, the important thing that you're
probably asking yourself is,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.240
jeez, how much code do I have to write
to take advantage of challenges?

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.300
I won't kid you.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.140
You can write code to take
advantage of challenges,

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.520
but you don't have to.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.930
Out of the box in iOS 6,
every game that supports scores and

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.240
achievements supports challenges.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.160
Now this is gonna be big.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.240
As you saw this morning, Jetpack Joyride,
they did a great job of integrating

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.740
challenges in just a few days.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:01.290
And we think it adds a much richer
degree of immersion to the game.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.550
So the way this works is we tap
on the challenge friends button

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.960
and up comes the friend picker.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.950
Right there,
I can pick some of my friends

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.360
to send the challenge to.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.960
And I want to call your
attention to something.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.330
You'll see that we've broken
this off into two parts.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.700
We have the friends who play the game,
of course, but we also have friends

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.180
who don't play the game.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.750
And that's actually critical.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.190
Because you can send challenges to
friends who don't play the game.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.880
And when they get the
challenge notification,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.540
they can tap on the banner or bring
it up in the notification center and

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.780
they'll get taken right to the app store.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.740
They can download the game and then bam,
they can start playing

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.810
and beat the challenge.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.820
So once I've picked my friends,
then I get a chance to send

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.950
a little personal message.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.800
In my case, it's almost always snarky.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.750
But I click send or tap send.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.570
And off it goes.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:01.600
The push notification goes to my friends,
and they get the banner that comes down.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.850
And lo and behold,
they get an opportunity to jump

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.240
inside the game and start playing.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.880
So challenges are really a big deal
because they take a single-player game

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.880
and they raise it up to the level of
a multiplayer game because it brings

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.380
their friends into the equation.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.400
We think it's going to be a
great feature for your games.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.820
Now, multiplayer is a big deal, as well,
right?

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.820
People like playing
games with other people.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.550
And that's why we all get
together around a board game and

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.960
spend far too much time there.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.580
And multiplayer invitations are
also a critical aspect to the

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.730
discoverability of your game,
right?

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.980
Because if you think about it,
one of the things that happens

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.020
a lot is someone will say,
hey, let's go play this game.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.320
Right there, you don't have the game,
but you're going to go play

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.970
and you're going to have fun.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.910
So, Aideen, as I said,
she's a big racing game fan and

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:05.840
she wants to play the latest space
pylon game with her buddies Bill,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.850
Claire,

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.600
sets everything up,
brings up the matchmaking interface,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.700
sends out the invitations.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.960
Bill gets the invitation.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.100
Claire and Deirdre get the invitation.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.500
But they're not big gamers.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:24.580
So from the invitation,
we take them to the app store where

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.040
they can download Space Pylon.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.170
And the moment they download it,
they get brought into the

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:28.170
game and they're ready to go.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.070
So, as happens very frequently
in cases like this,

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.200
Claire knocks their socks off.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.760
She wins handily.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:39.760
For some reason, she's just naturally
good at racing games.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.390
What happens in cases like this, right?

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.390
Somebody says, "Hey, no fair.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.900
Let's play that again." Well,
I'm happy to say we now support a

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.520
really easy way to just kick off
a brand new match and all you have

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.670
to do at the end of the game is
you call rematch with completion

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.980
handler and the moment that's done,
you've got a new match all set up,

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.710
ready to go,
and your players can continue to

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.960
play and continue to have fun.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.160
And remember, the more fun they have,
the more likely they are to

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.400
tell their friends about what
a great game you've built.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.290
So in iOS 5, we introduced turn-based
multiplayer gaming.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.150
And this is really a great way
for players to play games because

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.940
there's a lot of times when you only
have a few minutes to play a game.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.140
Maybe you're in line at the bank
or picking up the kids or whatever.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.190
You've got a few minutes.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.430
You take your phone out or your iPad out.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.360
You take the turn that
you've got earlier today.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.440
And you can just have a little bit
of fun in the time that you have,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:47.450
put your phone away, and then you go.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.720
So let me recap exactly how
turn-based multiplayer works,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.000
and then we'll get into some of
the new features we've added.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.670
So remember, in iOS 5,
Aideen would send out the invitations,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.400
and before Bill, Claire,
and Deirdre even get the invitation,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.840
she gets to take her turn.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:13.200
So when she's done with her turn,
she passes the turn off to Bill.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.500
Now, it turns out that Bill's
hiking out in Yosemite,

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.140
so he doesn't get the notification.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.770
And in iOS 5, that's it.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.020
The game will now stand here
until Bill goes into the game,

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.260
discovers he's got a turn,
and continues on.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:37.600
The sad thing is that Claire and
Deirdre don't get the invitation,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.380
they don't get to download the game,
they don't get to have fun.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.500
So one thing we've heard loud and clear
from developers is that this is not the

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.930
experience they want for their games.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:54.540
So we've added turn-based
timeouts in iOS 6 so that now,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.510
after a period of time that you specify,
Bill's turn will time out

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:57.510
and it will pass to Claire.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.180
Claire can take her turn,
and now your game has

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.740
a number of options.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.180
You can choose to simply drop Bill from
the game and continue on with,

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.800
like, three players.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.640
Or you can give someone,
perhaps Claire or Aideen,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.740
the opportunity to invite
someone to replace Bill.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.920
Maybe you want to invite Edward and
keep on going with a four-player game.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.290
Or as we're going to do,
we're going to rearrange the participants

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.010
so that Bill gets another chance.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:33.040
and Claire then passes the turn to Bill,
and it turns out he's at a restaurant,

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.900
they have free Wi-Fi, lo and behold,
he gets the turn notification,

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.210
and so instead of spending
time with his family,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.570
he starts playing the game.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.800
When he's done,
the notification passes to Deirdre,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.890
she gets the invitation,
she downloads the game,

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.020
and she starts playing.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.530
So turn-based timeouts are
really a big deal to ensure

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.460
that everyone gets to play.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.690
And by ensuring everyone gets to play,
you ensure everybody gets

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.020
to download the game.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.320
The way you take advantage
of this couldn't be simpler.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.400
There's a new ntern with
next participants API.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.200
You call that and you pass
in an array of participants.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.980
That array is all the
participants in order that they

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.740
should take their next turn.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.370
And we recommend that the player who
just finished his turn be added to

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.540
the array perhaps as the last player.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.700
And the reason for that is that's
the only way you can ensure

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.300
that if everyone times out,
the turn passes back to someone

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.560
who at least was present.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.490
And at that point, then,
perhaps your game can kick it

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.920
off again or do something else.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.840
You can specify a timeout period.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.970
We have a number of constants.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.820
I believe we have, like, one day,
one week, one month, one millennia,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.940
that kind of thing.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.940
And also, naturally, the match data.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.620
Also in iOS 6,
we've added the ability to save

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.000
match data during the turn.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.300
And this is really critical if you
have a game that has multiple phases.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.500
Or perhaps let's say you have like a
trivia game where with each question,

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.940
the same player gets to keep his turn.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.380
And as he answers each question,
you save the match data,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.510
the notification goes out
to all the participants,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.240
and everything updates.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.640
So that's turn-based timeouts.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.350
And we think this is a real critical
element to preventing abandoned games.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.510
And an abandoned game, of course,
isn't a fun game.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:36.140
Now, as you heard,
Game Center is now available on Macs.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.980
And this is fantastic, right?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:44.290
The same environment that
everybody is familiar with,

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:50.650
those 130 million players,
now they can play games

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.750
on their OS X devices.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.750
And they can play multiplayer
games amongst their friends.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.640
And they can also play multiplayer
games on their iOS devices.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.280
Wouldn't it be great if they
could play all together?

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.220
Well,
that's what game groups does for us.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:08.630
You can group your games by any
logical group that you see fit

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:15.780
so that your iPad games and your
OS X games can play together,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:21.440
your iPad version and your
phone version can play together.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.660
And if you have themed
versions of your games,

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.690
maybe you have the Alliance version
of Space Pylon and the Armada

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:35.550
version of Space Pylon,
normally, Aideen and Bill can play,

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.470
you know, by themselves,
but now with game groups,

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.010
they can actually race
together on common courses.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.360
So Aideen will fly the Alliance ships
and Bill will fly the Armada ships,

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.780
and they can race together
to see who's better,

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.830
Alliance or Armada.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:50.840
And if you have themed
versions of your games,

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:50.840
maybe you have the Alliance version
of Space Pylon and the Armada

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:50.840
version of Space Pylon,
normally,

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:50.920
Aideen and Bill can play by themselves,
but now with game groups,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:50.950
they can actually race
together on common courses.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:50.960
So Aideen will fly the Alliance ships
and Bill will fly the Armada ships,

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.000
and they can race together
to see who's better,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Alliance or Armada.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.820
Now,
because Aideen's such a huge racing fan,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.820
after she plays against
Bill a couple of times,

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:02.310
she's going to want to download
the Armada version of the game.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.580
And it would be kind of a drag if
some of the scores and achievements

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.460
that she's earned weren't able to
be passed over to the new game.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.980
Well, fortunately,
Game Groups solves that problem.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.130
So when she downloads the
Armada version of the game,

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.270
the scores and achievements that
you've defined to be in common

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:31.170
amongst these different versions will
automatically appear in that version.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.540
So perhaps she gets an achievement
for going through the tutorial.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:40.150
She doesn't need to do that
again for Armada unless there is

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:40.150
a specific tutorial for Armada.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.720
So this is a great way for your
players to move between games,

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.060
play their games with other friends,
and discover new games.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.770
Because, for example,
if they're playing the game on their Mac,

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:02.570
they can send an invitation
to their friend regardless of

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.430
what device that friend has.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.430
And if the friend is on an OS X device,

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.080
They get a notification there.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.030
Perhaps they don't have the
game yet on that device.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.590
They can download it from the
Mac App Store and they're good to go.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.630
So all of these things are really
important ingredients that go into

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.220
making your game discoverable.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.970
Friends telling their friends,
sharing their scores,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.280
challenging their friends
to beat the scores.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.350
This is all going to get the word out
about what a great game you've built.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.710
So, next, I want to talk about polished.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.160
Polished games are the sorts of
games that really do stand out.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.740
They're the ones that people talk
about and they comment about the neat

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:51.650
particle effects and the immersive sound,
but they also comment on the fact that

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.480
it just has the features they expect.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.250
So they come to realize that now
they can share their scores and

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:02.340
they can challenge their friends,
and they don't want to leave your game.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.680
You've built such a great game,
they don't want to change -- they

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.840
want to swap out to a game center,
they might get distracted

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.340
and just not come back.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.960
So right inside game center,
you can bring all of the game center

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.560
features right inside your game.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.620
And that's going to be a
critical function for you guys.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.820
But it starts even earlier than that.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.130
It starts with authentication.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:28.620
Because that's the first experience
your players have with your game.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.020
And we didn't want to get in the way.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.700
We didn't want to pop up splash screens
or alerts or anything like that,

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.660
for the vast majority of the cases,

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.410
All they'll see is the
usual Game Center banner.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.350
Pop.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.470
And they're good to go.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.740
Now, if your game is the Lucky Game,
that's the first one on their

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:54.200
device that they've ever played,
they'll get a welcome screen like this.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.520
They'll have the opportunity
to pick a nickname,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.310
maybe find some friends
via their contacts,

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.060
and they'll be good to go.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:07.120
As soon as they click tap done,
we'll log them in just

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.190
as we would anyone else,
and they're ready to play.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.670
Now, we heard from you guys that
authentication wasn't perfect,

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.400
right?

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.030
I mean, consider the following scenario.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.240
You've got this dungeon crawl,
and you're running from a monster.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.020
Up ahead is this pit of boiling acid,
and all of a sudden, whoosh,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.640
welcome to the game center.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.410
What do you do?

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.440
The game is still running.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.740
You have no idea.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.510
Well, fortunately, in iOS 6,
we've changed the way authentication

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:41.070
works just a little bit,
and we'll cover that in a moment.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.240
Some of your players, though,
they're going to opt out of game center.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.270
You have to be prepared for that.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.340
In the integrating game center talk,
we go into a lot greater depth

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.510
for how authentication works,
including some of those

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.030
errors that you'll encounter.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.820
And those folks who've opted out,
they'll get this little dialogue box.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.440
They can come back any time
just by launching game center.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.080
So the way it all works now --

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.920
is in your application did finish
launching with options method.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:14.540
You'll grab the local player,
set up an authentication handler,

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.820
and then call authenticate.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:21.400
Now, the actual authentication
handler is pretty simple.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:28.500
The first thing you'll notice
is we pass a view controller.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.620
And this is actually critical to solving
the problem that you guys highlighted,

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.000
which was, hey, I don't know what to do.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.080
I don't know how to pause my
game when you put up your UI.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.310
So now we'll pass you
this view controller,

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.680
and at the time that's
appropriate for you,

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.900
you can pause the game,
present the view controller,

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.750
and give the player the opportunity
to sign into Game Center.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.190
Now, keep in mind,
until you present the view controller,

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.620
you can't submit any scores,
you can't submit achievements,

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.280
you can't look up challenges,
you can't do anything with Game Center.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:07.060
So do take that opportunity to pause the
game and present the view controller.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.410
And when the view
controller's been dismissed,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.870
we'll call your
authentication handler again.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.730
And in most cases,
the player will be authenticated,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.980
and all you want to do is
go ahead and enable the

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:21.980
Game Center features for that player.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.180
Now, one thing to be aware of is we'll
also call your authentication

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.640
handler each time your game
comes back to the foreground.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.100
And the reason we do that is because
during that intervening time,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.200
the players may have changed.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.900
So Aideen may have handed off her phone
to a friend to let her play the game.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.010
Her friend logs into Game Center,
launches, comes back to the game,

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.710
and when we call your
authentication handler,

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.700
it's incumbent upon you to discover, oh,
look, it's somebody new.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.740
Put aside Aideen's game and
get ready for a new one.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.030
This is a really simple change that
you can make to all of your games.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.830
Now, the unified experience
is brand new in iOS 6.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:13.710
We've revamped all of the
in-game UI that you'll see,

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.710
and it starts

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.060
As you saw earlier,
we've got the in-game rating,

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:23.770
we've also got the Facebook like button,
and the standard leaderboards

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.360
that you're familiar with.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.800
But when your players drill
down into those leaderboards,

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:36.440
they can drill down further into their
scores and their friends' scores,

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.570
and they can share them
and they can challenge them

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:37.570
right from inside your game.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.740
And this is exactly what they're going
to come to expect from all games.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.700
So it's important that
it be in yours as well.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.140
Obviously, we have the same facility
for achievements.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.130
They can drill into their achievements
and challenge their friends and

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.420
share those achievements as well.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:03.520
Now, you wouldn't expect us to leave
challenges out of the mix because

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.160
they're such an important feature.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.640
So now they can drill
into their challenges,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.400
they can either dismiss them,
or if your game supports the

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:17.100
challenge delegate methods,
they can actually tap on play now to

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.720
launch the challenge and off they go.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:23.900
So this is a great set of features
that you can take advantage of.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:28.230
And the truth is,
it's only about three lines of code.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.760
So strip the comments out of here,
and it's really,

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.360
really simple to bring up
the unified experience.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.920
First,
you want to grab the view controller.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.990
There's just one of them.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.660
Then you set a delegate.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.600
And the only reason for the delegate
is to let you know that the view

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.320
controller has been dismissed.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.380
There's nothing more you need to do.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.350
Finally, you present the view
controller and you're good.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.490
So you get all of that rich functionality
with just three lines of code.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.830
Now obviously,
these features are all built on

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.820
APIs that you have access to.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.800
So you can build out all of
this functionality yourself,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.970
or you can take advantage
of what we've already built.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.970
Leaderboards, if you want to show a
specific leaderboard,

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.120
it's really easy.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:27.080
Three lines more code, you tell us, hey,
let's show some leaderboards,

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.080
the scope of the leaderboards,
and then which leaderboard to show.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:34.710
Similarly, achievements and challenges
are a single line extra code.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.550
So I think you'll find that taking
advantage of the new unified experience

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.190
is a really easy addition for your game.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.950
Now, naturally, we didn't want to just
stop with leaderboards,

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.360
achievements, and scores, right?

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.380
Because there's so much
more to Game Center.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.620
There's all of that
multiplayer experience.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:01.900
And so in iOS 6,
we've completely revamped the

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:01.900
multiplayer matchmaking experience.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.430
First of all, we streamlined it.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.900
So now you start off with the maximum
number of players that you specify.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:13.240
And this really helps your players
get in and get playing right away.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:18.570
Because if all they want
to do is play the game,

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:18.570
they just tap play and they're playing.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.130
And they can remove players fairly
easy just by tapping on the X.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:29.090
They can add new players back in
by tapping on the resulting square.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.620
Then they can invite their friends
simply by tapping invite friends,

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.860
and we have a new friend picker that
gives them the option to just tap,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.520
you know, three times,
they get exactly who

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.280
they want in the game,
and tap next to send a

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.140
personalized message.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.380
Or they can pick players that
they've played with recently.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.020
Now these don't have to be friends.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.600
They're just people that they
played this game with recently.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.680
So if they auto matched last
time and they just want to

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.910
play with those folks again,
they don't have to, you know,

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.310
send friend requests and
do all that rigmarole.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.610
They just jump back in,
pick the same people,

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.130
and play a new game.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:12.950
And finally, what we think is going to be
a huge deal for everybody's

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.170
game is local multiplayer.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:20.340
Now, you've always been able
to invite local players,

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.220
but you had to do all the work.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.810
Buried deep down in the APIs was
the GK session stuff and you

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.080
could find out who was out there.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.440
But it was a bit of work.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.870
Now we've built that right into
the multiplayer matchmaking APIs so

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.640
that you don't have to do anything.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.940
The theory being, hey,
Bill is on his way to

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.790
Yosemite in the backseat,
his two kids would love to play a game,

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:43.460
right?

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.230
Before, the game had to be coded
to especially handle that.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.850
Now every game can handle that.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.730
I think this is a big deal,
especially when it comes

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.880
to party circumstances.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:01.110
Now, bringing up the multiplayer
matchmaking experience is a

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.320
little bit more complicated,
but then again, you'd expect it to be,

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.790
right?

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.400
First,
you have to tell us about your match.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.240
What's the minimum number of players?

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.400
What's the maximum number of players?

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.960
And there's some other options.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:18.390
If you're interested,
you really should go to the

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:18.390
multiplayer gaming session on Thursday.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:24.040
After that,
you create the view controller.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.080
You set your delegates so that you can
know about some of the matchmaking events

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.860
that will occur before the game starts.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.220
And then, obviously,
you want to present that so that

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.570
your players can interact with it.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:38.280
And that's it.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:41.630
When you're done there,
your delegate will get a callback saying,

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.300
"Game's ready," and off you go.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.190
You get dropped right into the game.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:52.190
You can use the same multiplayer
APIs you're familiar with,

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.650
and your game goes.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.240
That's the baseline level of polish
that we think every game is going to

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.060
require in order to be successful.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.180
You'll need to be able
to send challenges,

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.860
share scores, and multiplayer matching
with local players.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.790
It's going to be great.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:18.150
All of these things combined
together allow you to focus

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.460
on what's really important.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.100
And what's really important
is building a fun game.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.100
Right?

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.210
I mean,
that's why people play your games.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:32.190
Now, there's a lot of things that we've
seen that go into making a fun game,

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.290
but one of the ones that we'd
like to highlight today is the

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:41.120
games that focus on players,
scores, and achievements.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.450
From the very beginning,
they're the ones that wind

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.040
up being the most fun.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.590
If you think about games like
Jetpack Joyride and Temple Run,

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:55.100
as you're running through the game,
as you're flying through the lab,

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.560
what do you see?

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.930
You see these little banners with
your buddies' names on them because

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.640
you've just passed their distance.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.330
And that gives you the
immersive experience that

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.870
really draws you into the game.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:14.060
And we'd like to challenge you to
go a little bit further than that.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.610
We'd like to take advantage of
something you heard about this morning,

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.660
the context on a GK score.

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:25.740
This really is an
underused bit of goodness.

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:30.040
You have 64 bits that
you can do anything with.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.750
Any crazy idea that pops into your head,
this is your data.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:37.190
So let's look at a couple of things
that we were able to think of,

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:41.420
and I'm sure you'll come up
with something even better.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.380
So first of all, we've got space pylon,
right?

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.990
Wouldn't it be nice if we
took two bits and encoded the

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:50.510
color scheme of the spaceship?

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.600
Well, we still have 62 bits to work with,
so let's take another four to six bits

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.890
and encode the style of spaceship.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.440
So now I know whether I'm
flying the Alliance fighter

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.540
jet or the Armada Raider.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.710
All there in the scores.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.870
And that gives me a lot of power
as I'm showing my leaderboards.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.850
So, maybe at the end of the game I can
show up all the players who are

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.200
doing a little bit better than me.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.400
All my friends, right?

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.900
I mean, this is a pretty common
experience in games.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.320
Here's your score,
here's the guys who are ahead of you.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.890
Well,
wouldn't it be great if your players

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:35.220
could tap on those scores and they
could see exactly the ship configuration

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:41.880
or the player class or the weapons or
whatever that makes sense to that score?

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.270
Wouldn't it be neat if they could say,
"Oh, I could get that and I bet that

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:48.730
would help me play the game."

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:54.980
Now, 64 bits is a lot,
but it's not everything, right?

00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:01.080
You can't encode all of the data that
they did this morning in 64 bits.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.060
It's just not possible.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.480
So what you can do is you can
collect all of the telemetry,

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:15.360
all of the random number seeds,
all of the data that you needed to do to

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.210
create that experience and save it off
to a server somewhere as a ghost lap.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:22.700
And then you can replay that
information at any time.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:28.360
So instead of just seeing, oh, look,
he was flying a red Alliance fighter jet,

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.710
I can actually see the path that
he took around the course that

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.220
helped him get such a high score.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:42.020
Now, scores and context,
that's pretty cool, right?

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:46.100
And there's great things that you
can do by putting just a little bit

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:50.820
more information into the scores so
that you can pull it back out later.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:58.820
But where it gets really cool
is when you add challenges,

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.250
as you saw this morning.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.250
Because scores and context and challenges

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.320
That's pure awesome.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.610
The sorts of things that we saw this
morning with the ghost lap as Adam and

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.540
Joe were competing right there,
that's fantastic.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.640
We'd love to see you guys take
advantage of things like that.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:22.890
And I know it's a little
bit extra work on your part,

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.070
but it really is going to give a
great experience for your players.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.550
So instead of getting my
challenge to finish the course in

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:34.220
under 3 minutes and 15 seconds,
in any old fighter that I want to fly,

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.590
wouldn't it be great if your
players could have the option of

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.740
flying in exactly the configuration
that the challenger flew in?

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:46.050
It would really enrich
the experience for them.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.640
Now,
game groups are another key technology

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.320
that you can take advantage of.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.860
to make your games just
that more immersive?

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:01.790
So for example, Aideen flies Alliance and
Bill flies Armada.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.350
Great games.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.120
They play together,
they can fly on common racecourses,

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:07.760
right?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.250
But wouldn't it be great to give
Aideen the experience of playing

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.970
Armada in a multiplayer setting?

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.900
And the way you can do that,
and encourage Aideen to try out

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:25.250
the Armada version of the game,
is take advantage of player attributes

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:30.340
when you set up the matchmaking,
so that Bill is the host,

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:37.020
and when the game gets connected,
Aideen is sent all of the assets,

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.300
so that she has the opportunity
to fly one of the Armada Raiders,

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.100
and fly on one of the
cool Armada racecourses,

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.430
with all the alien buildings
and the whole nine yards.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:54.940
This is a great way to expose players to
games that they might not otherwise have.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.010
All part of the game
group that you've built.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:03.980
And we think it's going to be a great
way to expose people to your games.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.010
So those are just a couple of
Game Center ways that you can

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.220
enhance your games and make
them a little bit more fun.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:17.890
There's a couple of other technologies
that you might have heard about

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.390
this morning that we also think
are a great way to raise the bar

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.390
on the fun level of your game.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:23.640
The first is Airplay.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.080
Airplay is a perfect match
for turn-based games.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.050
If you think about it,
when you're playing a board game,

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:36.070
you've got this big public experience,
the board.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.460
Maybe you're playing Railroad Empire,
and you can see the routes that

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.660
your buddies have all claimed.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.630
You can see whatever special
actions are in effect.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:50.260
There's all this public information,
but then there's the private information,

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:50.720
right?

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.720
That's the information on your device.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.850
And maybe that's your special actions
or your special abilities or the

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:58.570
routes you're trying to complete.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.950
And it's a perfect match here.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:05.660
Only one device has to be
broadcasting to the big screen,

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:09.660
and you don't have to worry about
frame rates or anything else like that,

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:13.660
because by and large,
it's a pretty static display.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.020
Fantastic fit.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.360
Now, also,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.340
Party games like this are a
great fit for local multiplayer,

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:26.050
right, because all it takes is one person
to start up the game and everybody

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:27.440
else can just jump right in.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.030
Don't even have to know they're there.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.050
They can just jump in, play the game.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:34.320
Fantastic for party games.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.480
The other big one, frankly, is iCloud.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:42.040
How many times have you
been playing a game,

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.470
you've gotten lots of power-ups,
you've bought special

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.630
equipment for your ship,
then you move over to your iPad,

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.290
and it's gone?

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:56.240
It's not just long-running
games that have game state.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:00.580
Sure, in your dungeon crawl,
you want to save exactly where you

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.980
are in the dungeon and what monsters
you killed and what loot is where.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:09.050
But it also is really important
for short-running games.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:13.670
So it's a great idea at any point
that your game is complete to save

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:19.000
that information up to iCloud so
that it's available across devices.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.500
So when I go home and I play on my iPad,

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.620
I get all of the same achievements
and power-ups and coins and everything

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:31.640
else that I've been playing with all
day long instead of doing my work.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:37.910
And the key to all of this is you
want to use the ID of the game

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.290
group as the index on iCloud.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:47.970
Because that will give you a common
index across all of your games so that

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:47.970
they can all access the same data.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.580
So those are a couple of things
that we want you to think about

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.080
when you think about how can
I make my game even more fun.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.150
Now, naturally,
you're already building fun games or

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:03.800
we wouldn't be having this discussion.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.940
But there's so much
more that can be done.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:14.630
There are great technologies that you
can take advantage of Game Center and

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.390
then focus on all the other great
stuff you'd like to add to your game.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:23.900
Naturally, like I said,
there's this base level of polish that

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.420
you're going to want every game to have.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.170
And we think Game Center is a perfect
way to take advantage of that.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.960
And of course, Game Center,
it's the key to making

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.180
your game discovered,
right?

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.790
There's lots of players out there,
130 million of them.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:46.860
They're sending in 5 billion scores.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.440
They're going to tell their friends
about what a fun game you've made.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.880
And those friends are
going to download the game,

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.550
they're going to tell their friends,
and you know the rest of that.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.300
So if there's any more
information that you need,

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.420
naturally you want to
contact Alan Schaefer.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.620
He's a great guy.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.500
He'll hook you up with the best folks.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.700
There's great documentation
on the website.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.930
And I really would encourage you
to check out the developer forums.

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:19.260
I know I find it very helpful
when I'm doing Mac development.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:23.160
And we have some really awesome
sessions coming up this week.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.530
First of all,
you want to go to the integrating

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.300
with GameCenter session because
that will go into really deep dive

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.550
on scores and achievements and
exactly how to hook into challenges.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:40.580
Because there's great things you can do
with challenges that don't come for free,

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.790
but they're so cool.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:49.210
Next, check out the What's New in
iTunes Connect because that's

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.170
how your game is defined,
right?

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.640
That's where your game
groups are defined.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.880
It's where you set up
your Game Center enabling.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.260
And there's some new stuff there.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.560
And, you know, it's kind of tricky.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.060
Multiplayer gaming with
Game Center on Thursday,

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.540
great thing to take advantage of
if you have a multiplayer game or

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.910
if you're thinking about adding
multiplayer to your existing game.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:14.270
There's a lot of new stuff there
that I didn't even get to talk about.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.410
And finally,
if you're thinking about porting

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.880
your iOS game to OS X or if you're
an OS X developer and you just want

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:28.940
to get a little bit more familiar
with how it all works on Macs,

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.480
definitely check out the
Building Game Center games for OS X.
