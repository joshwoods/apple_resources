WEBVTT

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.870
Good morning!

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.600
I hope you all are
having a good day so far.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.760
Welcome to Publishing
with the iBookstore.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.950
My name is Kristi Gillis.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.540
I've worked in publishing
for more than 10 years,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.740
and at Apple, my team manages worldwide
publisher support.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.140
It is absolutely a pleasure
to be with you guys this

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.100
morning to talk about books.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.370
Publishing with the iBookstore is
the first of five presentations

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.720
about books at this year's WWDC.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.640
In the next hour,
we're going to focus on four

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.940
key areas of the book business.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.980
First, iBooks and what's technically
possible with books.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.140
Second, we're going to talk about how you
get started with the iBookstore.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.640
Third, we'll talk about delivering
books to the bookstore.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.410
And what you can expect from
the book approval process.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.920
And finally, last but not least,
we're going to talk about how you market

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.750
your books and reach your readers.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.480
It's my hope that at
the end of this hour,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.600
you're going to leave inspired by the
possibilities of books and determined

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.900
to become a bookseller with us.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.160
Because publishing is big business.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.900
In 2010, publishers based in the
United States grossed $27.9 billion.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.730
Now, it used to be that to grab a piece
of this pie and to participate in

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.160
the publishing space required a
tremendous amount of fiscal investment.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.400
You needed to have a printing
press to print your books.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.520
And when your books were ready to go,
you needed to have some tractor

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.700
trailers to go and to pick them all up.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.330
Then, they needed to go to your
physical distribution center,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.330
so you needed to have a warehouse
to hold all of your books.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.910
Then, when a customer placed an order,
you would need to have someone to pick,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.930
pack, and ship those books.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.740
They need to get on another truck and
make their way across the country.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.300
Sometimes they'd even
need to ride on a boat.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.440
And then they find their way
onto the shelves in a bookshop,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.520
where hopefully someone found them,
fell in love with them,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.700
and took them home.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.760
Because if not,
they could begin making their way

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.040
back to you as inventory returns.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.870
They get back onto another truck,
and they come back to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.690
your distribution center.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.300
This is sort of the old way.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.950
I'm very happy to say
that times have changed.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.840
Now to publish all you need
is a great idea and a Mac.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.390
The iBookstore ecosystem
begins with iBooks.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.460
iBooks is Apple's
revolutionary app for readers.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.400
So it enables readers to look
at books that contain video,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.020
audio, and even interactivity.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.990
Readers are able to actually
work within the books themselves.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.140
iBooks also allows readers to design
their own libraries of content.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.620
And you can see here, here's my shelf.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.640
This is, I've named it Kristi's shelf.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.190
Pretty creative name.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.140
But if, like me,
maybe you want to put your cookbooks on

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.260
one shelf and your novels on another,
you're able to do that.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.480
You're able to build
collections of books.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.500
And then as a reader,
when you need more content,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.780
you simply click through the
app directly to the iBooks store

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.580
where you can browse our holdings
and make additional purchases.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.440
Now yesterday in the keynote address,
Tim shared with us that there are

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.350
400 million App Store customers.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.510
These are App Store customers
with credit cards on file.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.620
And what I'm delighted to say
this morning is that these are

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.370
also iBooks store customers.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.330
These are readers who are here,
they're in the store,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.490
and they're waiting for your books.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.480
So let's get into it.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.460
So let's get into how we reach them.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.520
And to get us started,
we want to start with iBooks and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.480
talk about the books themselves.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.480
So to lead us in that discussion,
I'd like to introduce Al Canestraro,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.420
head of iBooks Engineering,
to tell us about books.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.290
Hi, everybody.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.480
I'm the engineering manager for iBooks,
the application.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.590
We've been working really hard for the
last two years to make the most fully

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.480
featured book reader on the planet.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.460
And what I want to show you
today is a little bit of a story.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.710
What I want to show you today are
some of the ways that you can enhance

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.460
your book to make them stand out on
the iBooks store and make a great

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.460
way for you to reach your customers.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.460
So I want to show you three
different book types today.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.440
The first book type is
called a flowing book.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.460
And it's probably the one
you're most familiar with.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.680
It contains mostly text but
can be enhanced in ways that

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.140
were impossible with print.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.160
The second book type
is a fixed layout book.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.850
And those are perfect if you're starting
with a layout or you're starting with an

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.850
aspect ratio that you need to respect.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.730
And it's backed by WebKit.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.600
So you can do things like animations
and interaction and JavaScript,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.510
which of course you can't do with print.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.400
And the last book type I'm going to show
you today is called a multi-touch book.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.600
And these are created with the
amazing iBooks Author app on the Mac.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.620
And they're the fastest way and the
easiest way for you to go from a concept

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.210
in your head to a finished book to
something you're selling on the store.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.100
So let's take a look right now.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.770
So this is my bookshelf.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.000
Not quite as extravagant as Kristi's.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.190
We're going to first look
at The Hobbit by J.R.R.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.100
Tolkien.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.100
It's a flowing book.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.210
When I tap on it, it opens up to the last
page I was reading,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.100
or in this case,
it's my first time opening it,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.100
so it's the first page of text.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.950
If I tap the page,
I can show and hide the controls.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.790
If I tap on the edges of the pages,
I can actually turn the page,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.600
or we have a beautiful page curl that
tracks my finger if I want to drag.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.880
Now, a flowing book is really about
making the reading experience

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.650
great for the customer.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.480
So we've added a lot of customization.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.700
If I tap on the A's in
the top right corner,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.990
you'll see a set of customization
options for the user.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.710
I can make the text bigger.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.230
or smaller.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.180
I can even change the fonts.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.110
If I tap on the fonts button,
here's an example of Cerevec,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.490
which is a really slick modern
font that we ship with the app.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.160
I'll show you a page with text.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.250
Or if you prefer a more classic look,

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.470
Back to the fonts menu,
I can tap on Athalos,

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.130
which is a really classic
book reading font.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.090
We can also change the theme.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.380
So let's say you're reading in bed.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.620
And you want to get rid of the backlight.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.120
You want the text to stand out.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.320
If I tap on night mode...

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.630
The page goes black and
just the text stands out.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.220
Or sepia if you like a
warmer background color.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.540
We can even go full screen.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:23.910
If you're the kind of reader
that wants to get rid of all

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.690
the distractions on the page,
let's go into full screen mode and

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:26.690
you'll see the book trim goes away,
and there's nothing on the

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:26.690
page but the text itself.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.710
So of course, just like print books,
let's go to the next page,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.520
we can include images in a book.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.000
But what we can do here
that you can't do in print,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.920
if I double tap, I can actually pop that
image out of the book,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.290
zoom in and look at all the detail,
scroll around.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.480
If I double tap, it goes back.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.480
And then I can actually

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.250
I can add bookmarks by tapping on the
bookmark button in the top right corner.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.350
So let's look at the table of contents.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.980
So if I go, if I tap on the table of
contents button in the top left,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.720
it takes me to a page that has the entire
structure of the book under contents.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.780
It also lets me view
my bookmarks and notes.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.300
Let's go take a look at a bookmark
that I've taken previously.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.800
So this takes us to a page
that has embedded audio in it.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.400
This is where you can
take books beyond print.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.150
In this case,
the publisher actually chose

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.380
to include clips of J.R.R.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.030
Tolkien himself singing
the songs from The Hobbit.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.700
So let's hit play and hear how it sounds.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.700
Chip the glasses and crack the blades,
blunt the knives and bend the forks.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.700
That's what Bill Burbaggins hates,
smash the bottles and burn the corks.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.690
That's pretty cool.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.950
If you're a Hobbit fan,
you know that the book

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.280
is filled with songs,
and now you can actually understand

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.600
how he meant them to sound.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.700
I'm not going to demo much
more on the flowing book,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.680
but I want to tell you that
there's a lot more available.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.510
So VoiceOver, for example,
iBooks is fully accessible,

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.620
just like the rest of the iPad.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.700
Visually impaired users can have
their book read to them by the iPad,

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.030
but it relies on you as a content
producer to make sure that

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.040
you're doing things like adding
alt tags to your images or

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.900
closed captioning to your videos.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.220
And a couple weeks ago we
announced something great.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.110
In the last few months we've been
working on adding EPUB3 support,

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.200
and we're the first reader
to announce EPUB3 support,

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.450
support for the new
standard inside of iBooks.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.300
Thanks.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.700
So along with this comes a
number of new features as well.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.110
One of them is inline footnotes.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.850
So if you want to add a footnote
to your text and not take people

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.550
out of their reading context,
you can do that.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.510
And you get this little pop over
that comes up and shows you the,

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.800
the footnote that you want to,
to point out.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.530
Or physical page numbers.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.960
So let's say I'm in class and the
teacher has assigned me The Hobbit,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.420
and she says turn to page 55.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.440
Well, it doesn't matter what font
size or font I'm reading at,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:08.550
I can still get to page 55 by tapping
on the search button and typing 55.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.380
And we've also added the ability
to have online video and audio.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.570
So if you want to host additional
pieces of content on the Internet,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.240
you can still make those
available inside the book itself.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.180
So that, that is a flowing book.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.910
The next type of book I want to show you

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.220
is called a fixed layout book.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.960
So let's go back to the library
and take a look at that now.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.770
So fixed layout books are perfect
when you want to start with an

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.370
aspect ratio or a particular layout.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.490
This is perfect for things
like children's books or

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.380
cookbooks or picture books.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.050
I'm going to tap on the second book
called Ellie's Lost and Found Sounds.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.670
So as it opens up,
you'll see some controls at the top,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.100
but what's more interesting
is if you look at the page,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.880
there's actually
animations happening here.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.930
Like I said,
this is completely backed by WebKit,

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.640
so anything you can do
with CSS animations,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.830
JavaScript, gestures and interactivity
is all available to you

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.640
inside of a picture book.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.300
This text is even selectable.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.000
So in this case,
the publisher included fonts

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.680
with their book and shipped them.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.310
If I double tap on the word "followed,"
you'll see it's actually live text.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.550
Now there's several elements on this
page that are interactive as well.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.690
So you'll see Ellie on the left here
is kind of growing and shrinking,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.250
and there's a little button
that says tap to hear Ellie.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.590
So let's tap her.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.760
It's kind of a sigh or
a groan or something.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:50.590
On the right page there's a
few other interactive elements,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.910
so let's tap on those.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:52.960
And they each make sounds.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.910
There's even a bee that I can drag,
and as I drag it, it makes a sound,

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.690
and I can drop it off anywhere I want.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.870
So cute stuff.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.220
Now there's another feature
in Read Aloud Books,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.940
sorry,
in fixed layout books called Read Aloud,

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.400
that we introduced actually
right here last year at WWDC.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:24.990
And that allows you to include a narrated
voice along with the book that reads

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:24.990
the words on the page to the reader.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.520
If I tap on the page to
bring up the controls,

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.850
you'll see an audio
button in the top right.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.300
If I tap on that, we have some options.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.340
There's a big start reading button there.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.740
When I tap that,
notice that each of the words are going

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.810
to be lit up on the page as it's spoken.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.420
One day, Ellie followed a sound.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.570
We can scrub to another page,
and the book will

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:50.570
actually continue reading.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:58.010
She discovered that sounds can
be like keyholes to other worlds.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.920
So this is a fixed layout book.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.710
There's one other thing I want to point
out about this book in particular,

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.860
is that the author that created this
book actually started by building apps.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.080
And what they found is that all of
the features that they were looking

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.800
for in interactivity inside an app was
available to them inside of a book.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.830
And they were having a little bit of
trouble getting noticed in the app store.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.800
But as soon as they made a book
that stands out as much as this one,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.280
they've become very successful with it.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.010
So back to our library.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.420
There's one last book type
that I'd like to show you,

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.520
and that's a multi-touch book.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.610
Now, we launched these in January,
along with the amazing iBooks

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.540
Author app that allows you to
create a book from scratch and

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.500
publish it straight to the store.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.240
We focus on textbooks and education.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.400
But what we've found over the
last few months is that people

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.460
have created some amazing things
that went beyond our expectations.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.120
This last book I'm going to
show you is "American Grown" by

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.660
none other than Michelle Obama.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.590
When I tap it, it opens up.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.260
And it goes straight into
a beautiful intro movie.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.670
Now, when I swipe left and right
in a multi-touch book,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.670
I'm actually navigating
each of the chapters.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.230
or down at the bottom I can
swipe to get through each of the

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.870
individual pages in a chapter.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:49.860
If I pinch on any page,
I can zoom it in to full screen.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.030
And you get these beautiful layouts.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.680
One of the other really cool features in
these is if you want to highlight text,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.410
I can actually just use
my finger as a highlight.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.760
No tools.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.790
I just press down on any piece of text.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.970
Oops.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.790
Press down on any piece of
text and start highlighting.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:19.230
If I then tap that highlight,
I can change the color or add a note.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.270
This book is cool.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.590
Now, what makes multi-touch
books really amazing are the

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.360
widgets that you can embed.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.900
On the right here,
we have an example of an image gallery.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.260
Now, if you've used iBooks Author before,
you'll have noticed that it's

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.310
extremely easy to create these things.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.620
You just drag your images in,
and this piece of content

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:44.900
is created for you.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.180
So if I pinch to zoom
in to the image gallery,

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:52.200
I get a full-screen image as
I swipe with the captions and the

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.940
thumbnails down at the bottom.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.490
As I swipe through each image,
I can see it in full screen.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.580
And when I pinch to zoom back out,
the last image I was looking at

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.600
is now shown in the book itself.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.490
Now, that's just the beginning.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.600
I'm going to show you some of
the things that they've done with

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.520
this book that are pretty amazing.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.380
I'm going to go to some
bookmarks that I've made.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.520
So this is a page that's a gallery
of some of the widgets that

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.680
they've included in this book.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.530
We're going to first look at time lapse.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:30.070
There should be no surprise that we,
of course, allow you to include audio and

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.600
video in a multi-touch book.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:36.000
Here's a time lapse of
the White House garden.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.300
Pinch to zoom back out.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.400
If I go to the previous page,
there's a couple more.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.950
This one's an HTML,
interactive HTML widget.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.220
And here's a dial that gives
me some ideas about how to save

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.740
money and cook my own food.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.560
Here's one.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.290
Have a plan.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.960
Plan my meals for the week before
I head to the grocery store.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.810
I actually do that.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:06.940
That's a good one.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.470
It saves me from spending
money at fast food.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:11.800
So let's close this one.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.890
I want to show you one last widget
here that actually blew me away.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.640
I never even considered that
this was possible in a book.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:26.150
But we'll tap on the Twitter feed.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.150
And here's a live Twitter feed
right inside the book.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.980
So that is a multi-touch book.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.200
Those are the three different types
of books available to you in iBooks.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.110
Think about which one
is appropriate for you.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.400
But what I want to encourage
you to do is create books,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.520
sell them in the iBookstore,
and extend your reach.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.110
Show the world that the next
great story is interactive.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.720
Thank you.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.400
Thank you, Al.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.600
So now that you've had the
opportunity to see a little bit

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:04.970
about what's possible with iBooks
and with the books themselves,

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.970
let's delve into distribution
and get back to those 400 million

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:08.970
readers and talk about how we're
going to connect with them.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:16.920
The iBookstore exists on the iPod Touch,
the iPhone, the iPad, and also within the

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.900
iTunes desktop client.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:28.010
So regardless of your
reader's browsing preference,

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.300
they're able to peruse the store
and find the content that they want.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.650
I've spent a lot of time
working with publishers,

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.180
and I know that they face distribution
challenges every single day.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.260
My team's job, and honestly,
my job here today and at the conference,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.590
is to make sure that I'm alleviating
those challenges so that you can

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.390
bring your books to market quickly
and efficiently with no pain at all.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.750
So,
we really want to focus on four key areas

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.880
of the distribution process this morning:
getting started,

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.560
the book submission and approval process,
book submission best practices, I mean,

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.430
we want to make sure that you have
some key takeaways from this session

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.430
to guide you through the book business,
and finally, marketing your books.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.850
And I'd like to start talking
about distribution with the story

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.440
that is one of my favorite stories
of my time at the iBookstore.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.440
And this is a story about the government
of New South Wales and Australia.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.420
And a particular distribution
challenge that they faced.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.370
They needed to provide educational
materials to farmers located

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.440
in remote areas of the outback.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.640
Now, some of these farmers live hundreds
of miles from the nearest physical

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.380
bookstore or from a library.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.340
So, that team really faced
a difficult challenge.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.440
How could they get this
information to those who needed it?

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.720
They decided that digital books
provided the medium that they

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.400
needed to reach the farmers.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.440
And then, so they created these fantastic
books that look really beautiful.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.510
And then, they leveraged the power of the
iBookstor to actually get the

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.440
content to those who needed it.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.670
And ultimately,
their distribution strategy

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.370
didn't just stop with Australia.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.440
They began selling their content into
other markets throughout the world,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.450
including the United States,
so that farmers worldwide now

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.440
have access to this content.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.350
And they were able to do that because
the iBookstor is a global marketplace.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.330
There are 32 iBooksstores open worldwide,
including Australia.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.440
So, whether,
like the team in New South Wales,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.080
you have a specific challenge that
you need to face where you need to

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.440
reach a remote corner of a country,
or maybe your novel is really fantastic

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.430
and you want to make sure that readers
in Spain are able to read and enjoy it,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.280
the iBookstor has a solution for you.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.440
So, how do you get started?

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.320
Let's talk about that.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.440
That seems important.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.440
Like, what's the first step?

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.440
First, sign up for the store.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.860
Then write and create your content.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.450
Now, it may seem counterintuitive
that I'm telling you,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.020
don't start with book creation.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.920
Start by signing up for the store.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.340
But I have a very specific
reason to ask you to do this.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.430
And that's because,
as a publisher with the iBookstore,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.690
you gain access to book creation
resources that Apple doesn't

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.530
make available anywhere else.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.630
So within iTunes Connect,
I think many of you probably know

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.520
iTunes Connect from your developer work.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.050
There also is a version of
iTunes Connect for booksellers.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.680
And that's where we include a
lot of fantastic information.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.560
And I want to focus on three
key resources this morning.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.880
The first is our iBookstore Asset Guide.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:32.640
I think of this guide as the
blueprint to great book design.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.950
This is where we include
everything we know about building

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.020
beautiful books for iBooks.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:41.680
So maybe you want to design
a great flowing book,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.840
like The Hobbit that you saw earlier.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.700
And you want to include
some audio or some video.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.320
The specifications for doing
that are included in this guide.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.820
Maybe you really want to
create a children's book.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.940
And you want to design
something like Ellie.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.240
You want to go the path of fixed layout.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.280
Again, the Asset Guide is your source
for the specs that you need.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.820
We also include information
on some things about the

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.140
way the storefront works.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:10.080
For example, you've probably seen book
samples in the iBookstore.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.880
We tell you how we create those
in the iBookstore Asset Guide.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.520
It's a fantastic guide.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.600
Definitely, you need to download it
and take a look at it.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.180
The second resource are samples.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.380
We give away two EPUB samples
in iTunes Connect.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.960
And we also give away a
JavaScript library that's

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.360
specially designed for iBooks.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.460
Now, you saw some flowing books.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.900
You saw fixed layout.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.020
Know that we have a sample of both.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.980
So if, like me, you learn by doing,
make sure that you

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.440
download those samples.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.340
Open them up.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.540
Look at the code.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.380
Immerse yourself in the best
practices for book design.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:51.600
And finally,
last but certainly not least,

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.140
I want to introduce you to BookProofer.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.220
BookProofer is a Mac app that
was designed by Al's team,

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.700
so designed by our
iBooks engineering team,

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.140
especially for our book partners.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.810
And what it does is it helps you
proof your EPUBs and essentially test

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.160
on devices as you're coding them.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.580
And I want to take you through
a little bit of how that looks.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.830
So here's Ellie,
and you can see here I have

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.370
Ellie on BookProofer on my Mac,
and I'm ready to test,

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.840
and my iPad is tethered to my Mac.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.410
Maybe I would also want
to test later on my phone,

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.300
tether the phone to the device.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.190
So I place my EPUB of
Ellie into BookProofer.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.400
What iBooks will do is it'll create
a proof of the book on my bookshelf.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.280
And you can see here there's a banner
going across the upper right-hand

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.710
corner of the cover to tell me
that this is the proof of my book.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.360
So to open the proof,
you simply click into the book

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.040
and open it like any other book.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:50.340
And then you'll see your
book render within iBooks.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.160
So what's great is as
you're tweaking your HTML,

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:57.430
you're changing up your CSS,
you're able to see real-time what effect

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.200
those changes are having on your book.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.280
So certainly,
certainly take advantage of BookProofer.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.410
So to sort of wrap up the
getting started process,

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.880
now we've talked about some
of the key resources you need.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.980
I just want to touch briefly on
what you need to go through our

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.740
signup flow and to get started.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.710
First thing to say is signup is free.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.220
You start with a one-year initial term,
and we have some options

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.060
for auto-renewal thereafter.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.850
You do need an iTunes Store account
or Apple ID to get started,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.290
and as developers,
I want to make sure that you guys know

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.540
that this needs to be a unique ID.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.880
It can't be the same as what
you use today in the App Store.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.990
And last, you need a U.S.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.730
tax ID.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.990
This is what we do to verify that
you are who you say you are as you

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.010
go through our application flow.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.320
And that's getting started.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.540
It's really that simple.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.200
So now that you have an agreement,
you're starting to design your content,

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:00.500
I want to talk about the book
submission and approval process.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.320
We're going to spend a lot
of time talking about this

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.800
because it's absolutely
critical for our book partners.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.780
I think that when you get into the
delivery process for books and you

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.920
start focusing on submitting your book,
it's easy to get lost in the details.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.620
And what I mean by that is
you're working with XML.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.400
You're thinking about things like image
dimensions and sizes and specifications.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.000
But what I really want to
say this morning to you guys

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.470
is at the end of the day,
your job when delivering a book is to

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.300
build a really compelling product page.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.550
You want to tell your readers what's
special about that book that you design

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.430
so that they click through and buy it.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.440
So to talk about this a little bit more,
I wanted to show you guys the

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.500
product page for American Grown,
which Al demoed earlier.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:49.510
Now, there are two things that
Random House has done here that

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.200
I really want to call to your attention.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:52.300
The first is the book description.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:57.790
You have about 2,000 characters for
your description with the iBookstore.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.650
Don't simply write,
"This is my great book." I mean,

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.020
I think all of us think
our books are great,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.460
right?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.330
Tell me what's really
special about the book.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.710
Use those characters.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.820
Build out that real estate on the page
so that readers are drawn in and know

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.190
what to expect when they buy your book.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.660
If you look at the leading sentence here,
Random House leads off by telling us that

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.200
this book is about our children's health.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.200
Now, that sounds really important to me.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.100
It draws me in.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:26.200
I want to know more.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.070
I want to explore further.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.660
And they've also shown me what's
special about the book with screenshots.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.120
Screenshots are a relatively
new feature of the iBookstore.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.990
They launched in January of this year,
and I know you guys know

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.610
them from the App Store,
so you're already a

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.340
little bit ahead here.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.540
But, you know, if your book has video,
it has audio, it has interactivity,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.500
show the readers what
they can expect to find.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.900
And then that way,
they're enticed to buy,

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.620
they may even skip the sample process
and go directly to that buy button.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.680
Make sure that you're really
focused on your product page.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.280
So you may be thinking, well,
that's great, Kristi,

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.680
but how do I actually do that?

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.000
So let's talk about the actual
technical pieces of this.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.620
Starting with metadata.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.250
I sometimes feel like metadata
is one of the less glamorous

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.000
aspects of delivering content.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.780
Maybe no one gets that excited about it,
but I'm here to tell you that

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.560
it's a big foundation for having
a fantastic-looking product page.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.690
And actually,
metadata errors are the number

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.860
one source of delivery issues that
I see in publisher-supported Apple.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.840
So make sure that you don't get
caught by any of those pitfalls.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.780
And so let's start out by talking
about using proper casing.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.850
It's a bookstore.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.520
You want to make sure that
you're using great grammar.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.750
If your book's in German,
capitalize your words the way

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.240
that you should do in German.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:49.960
If it's in English,
follow good rules for English.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.100
choose an appropriate
subject or store genre.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:28:01.800
So if you've written a really creepy,
gory, really scary horror novel,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.540
don't put it in the kids'
section of the store.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:09.110
Because one, as a parent,
I'm probably not that excited about my

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.000
child being frightened by your creation.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.020
And two, as a reader of horror,
I really wanted to be scared tonight,

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.030
and I can't find your book because
I'm not looking in the kids'

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.150
section for Bram Stoker's Dracula or
for your version of Dracula.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.390
So help us merchandise your book.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.690
Tell us where it fits in the store,
and we're going to show

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:28.790
you how to do that.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.670
Identify the language of your book.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.810
If I want to read your book in Spanish,
I need to know that it's in Spanish.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.240
If I want to read in French,
I need to know that it's in French.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.080
It's that simple.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.240
Write a comprehensive
description for your book.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.900
We've talked a little bit
about this with American Grown.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.760
Definitely tell us what's there
and what makes the book special.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.530
Include target audience data.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.990
So what we mean here is that we
want you to tell us the age group

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.600
that's appropriate for the content.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.730
So there is a big
difference between Ellie,

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:09.220
who you saw earlier,
a children's picture book, and Twilight,

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.790
which is a young adult
novel about teen vampires,

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.580
and I think everyone's
pretty familiar with that.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.170
You know,
make sure that as we're merchandising,

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:18.170
we know what kind of book you've sent us.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.840
Provide series detail.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.060
If you're writing books in a series,
make sure that I know where to start,

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.780
that I know the order of the series.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.880
I would have been pretty disappointed
if I had started with Sookie

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.610
Stockhouse book number four,
because a lot of surprises

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.310
would have been ruined for me.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.430
Make sure that you're telling us
about your series information.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.580
And finally, proofread everything
before you send it to us.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.350
Make sure that that data is flawless,
because you want to be beautifully

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.440
represented in the store.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.200
And that's metadata.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.060
So let's talk about images,
marketing image.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.990
This is the front cover
image of your book,

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.470
and it's required for
delivery to the store.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.680
So you have to send us one of these.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.770
Now, there are some technical
specifications for this,

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.640
specific file types and sizes
that you need to adhere to.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.930
But what I want to make sure that
you're thinking about is having

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:15.720
a really attention-grabbing,
beautiful cover for your book.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.540
When I'm going through the search
results in the iBookstore as a reader,

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.910
and I'm thinking about
what I want to read next,

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.760
grab me with your art.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.900
Make me want to go into that product
page and see what your book has to offer.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.200
And again, screenshots.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.230
You need to take
advantage of screenshots.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.010
These are fantastic for
highly illustrated text.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.230
You can give us up to five per book,
and you can order them

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.220
any way you'd like.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.700
So you can tell us the story of
the book and bring your reader in.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.880
Draw them in by telling them
the story with screenshots.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.930
And finally, you need to give us a book.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.810
It would be a little bit hard for someone
to read your book if we didn't have it.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.320
We work with two file
formats in the iBook store,

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.860
and I'll show you both
of those earlier today.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.170
First, we have multi-touch books,
and these are books

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.440
created with iBooks Author.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.140
Second, we have EPUB, including EPUB 3.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.840
Now, as you're designing your books,
you're going to be using those creation

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.120
tools that we talked about earlier,
but you need to bring a strong

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.200
editorial eye to your content.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.050
I mean,
what kind of book are you writing?

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.100
If you're writing a novel,
maybe an EPUB flowing

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.080
book is perfect for you.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.400
But if you're creating a
highly interactive textbook,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.830
chances are you need the widgets
offered by iBooks Author,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.480
and you'll want to use
that to create your book.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:41.460
Now, we believe that book creation and
design is such a deep topic that we've

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.570
dedicated four additional sessions
at this year's conference to it.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.580
So we'll talk a little bit about
those at the end of the session,

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.910
but I just want to mention, now, I mean,
this is not all that you're going to

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.800
get in the world of book creation.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:58.710
So once you've got everything together,
you've built your package, please test.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.770
You guys are developers.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.880
I know you know how to test things
before you deliver them to us,

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.170
but we wanted to focus a little
bit on some of the best practices

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.960
we can recommend for testing books
before you deliver them to the store.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.590
So first, test on devices.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.080
You want to make sure, you know,
take a walk in that reader's shoes.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.540
Make sure the book functions as intended.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.080
Make sure that you're looking at it
from both the portrait orientation

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.010
and also the landscape orientation,
so that as your reader,

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.900
I have a great experience regardless
of how I like to use my device.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:37.330
Use BookProofer to test your EPUBs,
and also look at iBooks Author's

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.580
preview feature for multi-touch books.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.360
Take advantage of the tools we
give you so that testing is easy.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.040
If you need to make a change to a
file after you've delivered it to us,

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.640
please do regression testing.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.880
I mean, I know you guys do this
every day with your apps.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.140
It's really no different from books.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.470
If you make a change
in part A of your book,

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.590
make certain that you didn't break
something further down the line.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.800
And finally,
think about navigation for books.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.990
There is a table of
contents feature in iBooks.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.920
You need to make sure that your book
is constructed so that as a reader,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.120
I'm able to easily navigate
through your content.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.830
Also, make sure your links work.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.810
Don't take me to a dead end.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.260
It's really that simple.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.180
You always, always need to develop
with your reader in mind.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.400
So today,
we wanted to give you a few of our

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.180
recommendations for how you can do that.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.180
Beginning with accessibility.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:40.310
Both the iOS and iBooks have a
ton of features to enable really

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.060
accessible content on Apple devices.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:45.160
You should make sure that anyone
who wants to read your book

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:45.160
has the ability to do that.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.010
The iBooks or asset guide talks a
lot about EPUB and how you can make

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.100
sure your EPUBs are accessible.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.200
iBooks author comes with built-in
options to allow you to create accessible

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.160
features in a multi-touch book.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.080
Take advantage of this.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.990
File size.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.280
So your books can be up
to two gigabytes in size.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:09.120
But just because you can do it doesn't
necessarily mean that you should.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.900
As you're adding video, audio,
sort of heavy elements,

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.140
really take a strong editorial approach.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.380
You don't want to be a blind eye to
whether they really make the book.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.980
Because you don't know where someone's
going to be downloading that book.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.050
They may not have a fantastic connection.

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:28.050
Really think about file size and think
about your reader as you build your book.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:28.870
Fingers.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.620
So it may seem strange
to see fingers up here.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.170
But this goes back to interactive books.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.470
Now, if I'm a child who just got Ellie,
you know, my motor skills may not

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.020
be as developed as ours.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:44.200
So think about that as you're
designing hot zones for your books.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120
Length.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120
Length should work.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.230
That's really -- that's it.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.120
Speed.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.320
The iBooks or asset guide offers a
lot of guidance about how you can

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.980
have a book that performs really
efficiently and quickly on the device.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.700
Make sure that you're taking
advantage of all of those places

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.140
to improve book performance.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.810
It can be as simple as
substituting a JPEG for a PNG.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.140
It can be really that easy.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.660
Text.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.850
They're books.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:15.100
We get a lot of complaints when
books have misspelled words.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.400
Or bad grammar.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.490
Or maybe the text is
overlapping on pages.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.890
Your QC process and your
development process needs to

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.070
be really focused on the text.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.050
And finally, zoom.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.930
This is about image quality.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.440
Our devices are capable of
rendering art beautifully.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.170
Make sure that when someone's
pinching and zooming,

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:40.910
as Al showed you, that the image doesn't
become blurry or pixelated.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.590
Make sure that your reader is having
a really great experience with images.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.060
So once you deliver your book to us,
you've gone through all of these steps,

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.940
you've thought carefully
about your reader,

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.600
your book will go through
quality control at Apple.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.700
Every book goes through review.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.000
And it's a pretty simple process.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.540
We put the book on an iPad.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.060
We test it.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.140
If you have widgets,
we're going to test them.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.220
We're going to make sure that they work.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.720
If we find anything wrong,
we'll issue a ticket to you.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.360
You can get tickets by email.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.980
You can also access
them in iTunes Connect,

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.740
as you see here in step two.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.150
There's a ticket history module that
will list out all of this information.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.800
If something goes wrong,
all you need to do to get

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.680
yourself back in a review queue
is to re-deliver the book.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.950
And again,
make sure you've tested the book again

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.580
end-to-end before you re-submit to us.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.270
When it comes back in,
we're going to put it on an iPad again.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.240
We'll check it out.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.980
If everything's okay,
it goes right out to the store for sale,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.240
as you see pictured here in step four.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.620
Now,
thinking about the book approval process,

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.860
it seems only fitting that we should
share with you some of the top

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.720
reasons why we see books rejected.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:54.140
We really wanted to make sure that we
gave you guys some great best practices.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:59.990
One, omitting the custom preview from
multi-touch books and read-allowed books.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.230
Some of our more complex formats
require our book partners to

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.680
provide the sample that the
customer receives from the store.

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:10.230
Two, making sure that you're looking
at the requirements in the asset

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.700
guide and that if you need to
deliver one of these books,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.010
make sure you're providing a sample.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.930
Book image is larger
than 2 million pixels.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.380
So Al touched a little
bit about WebKit and how

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.780
WebKit interacts with iBooks.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.530
To make sure that your
book functions correctly,

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.810
we need to make sure that the
interior images of the book are

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.800
smaller than 2 million pixels.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:38.220
If you send in images larger than that,
we'll actually reject them

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:38.220
at the time of delivery.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.980
and complete table of contents.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.480
Again, book navigation is key.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.820
If there are 50 chapters in the book,
make sure that the table of

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.860
contents shows me 50 chapters.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.620
Don't just give me one or two.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:55.150
As a reader, I'm going to be pretty
dissatisfied with that experience.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.210
Incorrect subject or
classification schema.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:02.520
Well, you'll see a little bit more
about this in a few moments.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.940
But again, help us merchandise your book.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:11.890
If it's a cookbook,
tell us it's a cookbook.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:11.890
If it's a sci-fi novel,
tell us it's a sci-fi novel.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.270
Poor image quality.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.840
We've touched about this a little bit.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.500
Make sure your images look great.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.890
Misusing Apple trademarks.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.640
I mean, this is pretty simple.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:27.490
Just make sure you're aware of the rules
for using any Apple trademarked names.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.020
Compound authors and metadata.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.220
This is a really common one.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.310
So if Al and I were to
write a book together,

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.970
the author wouldn't be Kristi
and Al smushed together in

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.540
one field in the metadata.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.360
I should get my own billing,
and Al should get his own.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:44.360
You want to make sure that you tell us
who contributed to that work clearly.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.480
Asset mismatch.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.220
This is pretty simple as well.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.110
Make sure that the
jacket that you give us,

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:53.450
the marketing image you give us,
matches the book file itself.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.720
False advertising.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.030
Don't promise the reader something
they're not going to get.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:00.890
They get upset by that,
and it results in customer

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:03.000
complaints and sometimes refunds.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.560
So you want to make certain that you
give them exactly what you've promised.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.220
And finally,
incorrect language and metadata.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.640
We've talked a lot about language,
but the iBookstore is global.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.610
We need to know what language
that book is prepared in.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.090
So this is a lot to take in,
and what we wanted to do

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:23.330
this morning is show you just
how to put it into practice.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.100
So to do that,
I'd like to introduce Ryan Lynch,

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.620
our global operations
manager for the iBookstore,

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.680
and he's going to take us
through delivering a book.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.410
Thank you, Kristi.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.010
So I'm going to talk about delivering
and managing your books in the

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:41.920
iBookstore with our two tools,
iTunes Producer,

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:46.070
an OS X app for managing delivery,
and then iTunes Connect,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:50.410
which I think most of you are already
familiar with for managing your content

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.930
after you've delivered it to us.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.360
So first, iTunes Producer.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.110
So I've already loaded
it up here on my Mac.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.660
And you'll notice here that I've got four
main options for creating my content.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.200
The first is opening a package.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:09.900
So I'd do that.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:16.590
I'd open a book that I've already created
or already delivered so that I can

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:16.590
update it and re-deliver it to the store.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.860
The second is I can create a new
package or a new book from scratch.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.720
So I can do that either one at
a time with the new book or,

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.550
on the other side, new from a file.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.510
So iTunes Producer gives you
the ability to deliver 10,

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:36.300
20, 50 books at the same time if
you want via a spreadsheet.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.450
And that is available in the
File menu of iTunes Producer.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.560
I'm not going to walk you
through that right now,

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:48.190
but if you do choose this path,
be sure that you fill it out

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:52.650
completely and exactly as it is
demoed in the sample document.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.490
The last option is looking up metadata.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.810
So if you've already delivered
a book to the bookstore,

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.050
you can use your Apple ID,
which is the identifier of

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:10.090
the book that we assign,
your vendor ID or ISBN.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.940
You put it in here,
it'll pull down a metadata that

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.770
we actually have on the server.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:18.660
You can make updates and
then re-deliver that to us.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.000
For the purposes of this demo,
I'm going to open a package

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.310
that I've already created.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:27.200
So here we are.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.390
You'll notice that it's divided
into three main sections.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:32.400
The first is the book metadata.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.220
The second is the assets or the EPUB and
the files and that kind of thing.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.250
And the third is the
validation and delivery step.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.630
So we're going to start with the book.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.320
So I just want to point
out a couple things.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.020
Most of this is fairly self-explanatory.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.090
But here, the publisher name,
the publisher is the seller that we

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.890
actually show in the bookstore itself.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.240
So we don't put imprint in the store.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.150
If you want your name to be E.O.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.970
Wilson, you want your name to
be Ryan Lynch Books,

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.590
Inc., make sure you put that
there and that's what the customer

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:07.520
will see in the store itself.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.080
As Kristi said,
series name is quite important.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:16.340
That actually helps us understand
where to market your book and how

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.030
to market your book in the store.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.340
So if it is part of a series,
please provide that to us.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.800
And finally on this,
I want to touch on the description.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.000
So Kristi said make a good description.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.060
Well, that's really quite important,
but here you can use things like italics,

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:32.480
bold.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.040
It doesn't take HTML.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.340
So put in as much as you
can and make it as nice.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.790
It's a standard text editor.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.320
So let's move on to the next tab here,
categories.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.700
These are the subject categories
that Kristi touched on.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:52.700
I need to add one to my book,
and so I have an option of one of

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.320
three subject category systems.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.220
These are ones that are used in
the book industry by standard.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:03.740
So BISAC is for North America,
BIC is for UK and Australia,

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.820
and CLEEL is for France.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.310
They're all the same, essentially.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.250
Pick the one that you're
most familiar with.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:17.460
So I'm going to choose BISAC,
and my book is about art,

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.670
and it's tattooing.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:23.170
It's not vampires or something
crazy like that like Kristi

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.610
was talking about earlier.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.890
You'll notice that I have this
primary checkbox marked here.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.950
That's important to check for one genre.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:35.830
That's going to be the primary
category that we apply to your book,

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.380
and your book will appear under
that category in the store.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:46.030
You're welcome to provide
as many as you'd like,

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.030
but only one primary per category system.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.260
So let's move on to the third tab,
authors.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:54.020
I've already put in two authors here,
but you can add as many as you'd like.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:59.340
These are roles like editor, illustrator,
author, contributor, et cetera.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:04.240
You'll notice that I only
have one selected as primary,

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:09.480
so only one will appear in the
store as the author of the book.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.590
If I want to have more
than one author as primary,

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:12.590
I would add another author.

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.800
So I'm going to add myself,
because I did a lot on this book.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.850
So I put in my first and last name,
and then we have this

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:22.000
thing called sort name.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.380
And sort name provides us the
information to be able to order

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.900
the book in the bookstore and
also on the user's bookshelf when

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.710
they decide to order by author.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:38.280
So this is generally last
name comma first name.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.160
And I'm a primary author.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.400
It's as easy as that.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.860
So let's move on to the fourth tab,
target audience.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.770
So I've already added
some criteria to the book.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:51.220
I have interest age and years.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.070
It's 13 and up.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:55.200
It's meant for adults,
very straightforward.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.210
But again, this really helps us to market
and merchandise your book.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:05.360
So if you have a title that's targeted
at young adults or juvenile fiction,

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:09.340
which is the K12 set,
you want to make sure that we

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.560
have the age information that's
appropriate for your book.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:17.010
Next, let's move on to related products.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.950
This is interesting for you if you
have a print version of your book,

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.260
or if you have other books in a series.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.720
You provide us those ISBNs here,
and the users can search

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.350
for the ISBN in the store.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.100
It also works for the ISBN that
you provide for your book itself.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:37.440
So if they go into a physical store,
they see a book, they get the ISBN,

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.220
the title, whatever,
they can come back to the iBookstore,

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.470
search for it, and find your book.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.940
So this is a good thing to do
to help promote your title.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:49.070
And lastly with the metadata,
let's look at rights and pricing.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.020
You may be familiar with
this in the land of apps,

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.540
but we do things a
little differently here.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.900
We actually ask that you provide
pricing for your book per country.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.840
So you have to add each country
individually to the title.

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.260
I've already added two,
but I want to show you

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:07.750
something that makes it a little
bit easier to manage that.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:09.810
And that's called Add Territory Group.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.240
It's this button right at the
bottom of my country lists.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.740
If I were to click on that,
it provides a list of territory groups,

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.240
and I can add a new one.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:25.800
I commonly sell my books in Canada,
France, and, oh, let's say,

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.730
Czech Republic.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:32.810
So those are the normal book
countries in which I sell.

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:32.810
So I'm going to save this.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.390
and it adds it to my list.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.030
So if I choose it,
it will automatically apply those

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:45.680
countries to my book to make it
nice convenience for you when

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.200
you're adding new countries.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:50.420
I don't want to go through adding pricing
for all these countries right now,

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:50.420
so I'm going to remove
them for the sake of time.

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.390
So that's basically all you
need to do for metadata side.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.780
Let's look at assets,
the second tab at the top.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:02.740
I've already added an EPUB file here,
so I don't need to add another one.

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.990
But note that we also on the right
have the publication preview,

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.460
which Kristi touched on earlier.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.300
We automatically create
previews for books for EPUBs.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:17.860
If it's a text-based EPUB or a flowing,
we take 5% of the total word

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.480
count and make a preview for you.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:24.700
If it's a fixed layout,
we take 5% of the total page count

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.250
and provide a preview for you as well.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.810
That may not represent your
book in the way you'd like to

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.240
represent it for your customer.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:37.920
For example, in shorter books,
the copyright page in front

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:42.000
matter has a lot of words on it,
those two pieces.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.380
So your preview may actually
end up being just the copyright

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.380
page and the first page of text.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.200
It's not very helpful for your customers.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.890
So you really want to use this
as an opportunity to market your

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:57.120
book for your customers and create
something that's going to show off

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.520
your book in the best possible way.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.370
So let's move on to the
second part of assets,

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:03.190
cover art.

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:05.490
Kristi's already touched on this.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:09.960
It's 1,400 pixels and the
smallest side is what we require.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.300
Just make sure it's
eye-catching and grabbing.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.720
And finally, screenshots.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.900
You can provide up to five.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.200
You can also use the iPad resolution.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.320
You're welcome to shave off the 20-pixel
status bar at the top should you desire,

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.640
which I have done for
all of these images.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.930
It looks a little bit
jazzier in the store,

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.680
so I recommend it.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:35.230
We also take the new iPad resolution,
so it's 40 pixels for

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.370
the status bar there.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:41.010
Now let's move on to
delivery and validation.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.900
And when you click on that tab,
it actually validates all of

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.800
the metadata and everything
that you've added to your book.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.900
You notice that I have one error.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.950
I forgot to provide a language.

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.540
If I double-click on that,
it takes me to the box where

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.450
that error is and allows me
to enter in what I'm missing.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.230
For language, I can just type it in.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.390
It's a book in English.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.780
I head over to delivery again,
and it says it validates correctly.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.900
I've done my job.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.250
So I can click on the deliver button,
and away it goes.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.360
We don't want to wait for that,
so I'm going to move on to show you

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.250
what it looks like in iTunes Connect.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:22.820
So here again, you're probably very
familiar with iTunes Connect.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:26.090
It's the same as apps,
but a little bit different.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.660
You still come here for your
sales and trends reporting.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:33.020
You come here for your financial
sales data and all of that.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:36.180
But we've changed a few things for books.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:40.980
So to show you that,
let me go into the manage your

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.810
book section on the right.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.790
And I've expired.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:46.530
So let me log back in here.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.600
Go back to the "Manage
Your Book" section.

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.690
You notice that my book is already here.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.760
This recent activity, again,
just like apps,

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:05.250
is the most recently delivered or
anything that we've touched recently.

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:08.300
So I'm going to click on Life on Earth.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.190
You notice here that it shows the status,
that it's not on two stores.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.840
And if I want more details on that,
I click on that,

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.920
and it shows that those two
countries that I had selected,

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.870
Australia and United States,
it's not for sale in.

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:28.160
If I were to click on See Details,
it pops up the reasoning at the bottom.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.160
I have to go sign my contract,
apparently.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.300
Now, we recommend that you keep
coming here and checking up

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.800
on the status of your book.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.190
It provides the most up-to-date
information of what's

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.800
happening through the process.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.150
And also, if there's tickets or
any issues that we find,

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:42.730
we flag them here for you.

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:45.840
So finally,
as you notice on the right-hand side,

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.230
I can view more details or
even edit rights and pricing.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:53.460
So if I want to add any more countries,
I can come into iTunes Connect.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.840
You can also do that in iTunes
Producer and re-deliver.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.090
Either way is absolutely fine.

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:03.820
So we want to encourage you to sell in
as many markets as possible where you

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.440
actually have rights for your titles.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.940
We have 32 markets around the world.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.720
Use every single one of them.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:15.850
Even if you sell one
more copy of your book,

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.960
you make a little bit extra
money and get a little bit more

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:17.960
notoriety for your next title.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.890
And be sure that you create
a really good description,

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:24.600
a grabbing and captivating sample,
a great cover,

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.720
and interesting screenshots to maximize
your sales as much as possible.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.300
Thank you.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.600
Thank you, Ryan.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.730
So, so far we've talked about
what's possible with books,

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:37.340
and we've even delivered
a book to the store.

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.430
So to tie it all together,
we wanted to close by talking

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.730
to you a little bit about how
you can grow your business once

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.910
you've begun delivering books.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.010
So the first thing to
say is market your books.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.620
Don't take the philosophy,
if you build it, they will come.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.620
You need to be out there
telling people about your book.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:59.290
And in iTunes Connect,
we give you a marketing and affiliate

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.540
kit to help you begin that process.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.840
So first off, become an affiliate.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.840
You know, I'm your fan.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.100
I come to your site.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.760
You drive me to the iBookstore
so that I can make a purchase.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.390
And essentially,
because I came in through your site,

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.210
you earn a commission on that sale.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:16.940
So.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.040
Become an affiliate.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.410
And if you're interested
in the affiliates program,

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:23.740
there's another session about that here
at the conference to tell you more.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.360
Link to the iBookstore.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.180
You know, I'm your fan,
I'm really excited

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.700
about buying your book,
but don't make me work for it.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.570
Don't make me come and
search the store to find it.

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.810
Take me to your book.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.560
Link directly to your book in the store.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.290
You can even take advantage of our
widget builder so that you can design

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.270
a really beautiful link for your book.

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:49.610
And again,
the instructions on how to do this,

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.630
the link to widget builder is included
in that marketing and affiliates kit.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.800
Publicize your book
with redemption codes.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.060
Now, you guys are familiar with
this on the iBookstore side,

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.530
but the iBookstore also offers
redemption codes for publishers.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:09.130
So you're able to give away up to
50 copies of your book to reviewers,

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:13.370
to people who are influential,
who are going to be able

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.370
to help market your book.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.370
Definitely take advantage
of this feature.

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:15.180
Generate pre-orders.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.540
Now this is different than the app store.

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:20.760
You're able to place your books
on sale up to one year in advance

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.210
of their publication date.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:24.770
You're able to begin
building buzz for your book,

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:26.530
getting the excitement going.

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.930
And actually,
this is a great way to help your

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.570
books chart because all of that sale,
all of that sales volume that

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:36.160
builds up before the on-sale date,
posts on the on-sale date.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.560
So you should absolutely
take advantage of pre-orders.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.430
And of course, go global.

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.000
I've talked about it.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.560
Ryan's talked about it.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:49.360
You know, don't make assumptions
about your readers.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.760
Don't assume that
because I live in Norway,

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.010
I don't want to read a book
that's written in Spanish.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.600
If you have the rights
to sell into a market,

00:53:57.740 --> 00:54:00.680
you absolutely should be
selling in that market.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.490
So go global.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:04.550
So what have we talked
about this morning?

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:07.610
I know we're coming to
the end of the full hour.

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.980
So just as a quick recap,
sign up for the free free free

00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.210
free free first then create.

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:16.980
Remember that you want to take advantage
of those book creation resources that

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.780
are available to you in iTunes Connect.

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:24.240
iBooks supports flowing books,
fixed layout books, multi-touch books.

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:28.110
You want to make sure that you've done
your research and figured out which one

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.840
is the best fit for you editorially.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:35.440
Then, so you've chosen the book type
that best fits your story.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.490
You're using Apple tools
to build your books.

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.340
You want to keep thinking
about that reader.

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.520
Just keep them in the front of your mind.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:46.620
Take a walk in their shoes
at every step along the way.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:54.170
Go global, I think that's enough said,
and market your books.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:59.820
So I'd like to leave you today
with a comment from Stephen King.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:05.010
Now, Stephen King has sold more than 350
million copies of his books worldwide.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:09.220
So he's arguably one of the most
successful authors of our time.

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:14.940
And King writes,
books are a uniquely portable magic.

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.120
Now, I've loved books since
I was a very little girl,

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.100
so I definitely agree with him.

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.180
But you guys are also well
acquainted with magic.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:29.550
You create it and you bring it to
the App Store each and every day.

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.520
So what our team would like to say
to you is we invite you to bring

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:36.050
your creativity and your insights
to the iBookstore as well so that

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.450
you can become a bookseller with us.

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:44.520
So to get you started on your journey,
we've included links to many of the

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.430
resources that we've discussed today,
and you'll be able to access

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:48.940
these after the conference.

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:52.370
And again, remember what I said,
this is just the first of

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:53.990
five sessions about books.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.730
The next one comes up
in about 15 minutes,

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:58.850
Building Books with iBooks Author.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.580
So if you want to learn
more about book instruction,

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:04.200
make sure to take advantage
of these sessions.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.700
And also,
keep an eye out for this affiliate

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.690
session to learn more about how
you can earn a commission on sales.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.390
You guys have been fantastic.

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.200
Thank you so much for your time,
and I hope that you'll have

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.350
a great rest of the week.
