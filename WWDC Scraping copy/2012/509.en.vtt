WEBVTT

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.750
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.660
Welcome to another great day of WWDC.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.600
And thanks for spending your
morning with the books team.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.800
My name's Casey.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840
I'm the engineering manager
for the iBooksstore.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.230
And one of my jobs is to develop
technology that will enable

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.090
you to create books that people
are going to just love to read.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.340
So to help you with that,
today my colleagues and I are going

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.240
to teach you how to create interactive
books using EPUB 3 and JavaScript.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.510
Before we jump into the technology
behind EPUB and JavaScript though,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.060
I'm going to run through real quickly
where we've been since last year.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.000
So first,
I'll recap last year's iBook session,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.410
and then I'm going to explain to you and
really share with you some of the cool

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.890
new things we've added since last year.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.290
So, at last year's iBook session,
we showed you how to use EPUB 2 to

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.340
create two different formats of books,
flowing and fixed layout.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
And as a reminder,
a flowing book is a book where

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.540
the reader can resize the text.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.660
And in fact, the text in that document
is one long document,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.860
kind of like a web page,
that iBooks then neatly

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280
divides into individual pages.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.960
In contrast to that,
a fixed layout book is used when

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.370
you want a very precise design.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.370
It has full-bleed images and
text that overlaps those images.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.950
For both of these formats,
you can embed audio and video

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.800
using the HTML5 elements.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.540
And all of this was covered
in last year's session.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.300
In addition to that,
really my favorite moment from

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.460
last year was when I got to
introduce to you Read Aloud.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.830
Read Aloud is a technology that
allows you to sync a narrator's

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.800
voice with the text of your book
so that individual words light

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.590
up as that audio is read aloud.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.600
Now,
if you missed last year's iBooks session,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.140
don't worry.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.200
It is available for download
on the Apple Developer Center.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.350
And if you're new to EPUB,
you can pick this technology

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.780
up really quickly.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.300
And if you need more of a foundation,
definitely download last year's session.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.630
So since I last talked to you,
since last year,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.320
iBooks has been really busy.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.310
We are the first reading
system to support EPUB 3.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.090
And EPUB 3 support in itself,
let me tell you, it made for a busy year.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.230
But Apple didn't stop there.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.450
In January of this year,
Apple released iBooks Author.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.950
iBooks Author is a free app available
from the Mac App Store that makes

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.320
it easy for anybody to make a book.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.510
It combines the simplicity of
copy and paste and drag and drop,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.620
along with some really creative
layout tools that makes it quick

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.640
and easy to make some really
beautiful books for the iPad.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.470
So this year,
iBooks brings you EPUB 3 and iBooks

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.720
Author to give you some really
great development tools for getting

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.910
your books into the iBooks store.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.840
And I mean you in particular.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.040
So Apple developers,
you are a unique group.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.080
You have a more technological
background than just the average Joe.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.220
And that puts you in an especially
advantageous position for creating

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.630
some really beautiful books.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.500
So yesterday, my colleague Charles demoed
iBooks Author.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.600
Today,
some more colleagues and I are going

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.440
to show you how to put your technical
skills to use to create some interactive,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.250
engaging books using EPUB 3.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.700
And so you have options.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.300
When do you want to make an EPUB?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.140
Well, iBooks is actually a really
incredible platform for EPUB,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.880
and that's because we support
flowing and fixed layout,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.040
media like images, audio, and video.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.190
You can include your own fonts,
and you can make an interactive book,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.020
which we'll show you today.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.760
You can also create a read aloud book
to sync that audio with the text.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.380
And your single EPUB is
supported on the iPad,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.810
the iPhone, and the iPod Touch.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.790
So that's millions of devices
that are out there that are

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.190
ready to read your book.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.600
Also, EPUB uses standard technologies
like HTML and CSS and JavaScript.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.360
So if you already have these skills,
you are more than halfway

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.980
there to making a book.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.210
And finally, EPUB is open standard,
just like HTML and CSS,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.390
which means an EPUB can be
read across multiple platforms.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.900
In other words,
because EPUB uses web technologies,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.290
you can create a book
that's customizable,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.270
adaptable, and open.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.830
It gives you the ability to
create a single book for nearly

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.810
any type of book that can be
read on many different devices.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.040
Now, this is a huge list of features.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.070
And like I said,
we covered most of them last year.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.880
So today,
we're going to focus on the new items

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.580
we've added since we last talked to you.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.550
I'm going to give you
a foundation in EPUB 3,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.680
and then Jonathan's going to introduce
you to iBook JavaScript Library that

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.820
will let you easily incorporate some
really great interaction into your book.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.870
And then finally,
Alejandro is going to show you

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.740
a development tool that will
allow you to perfect your book

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.060
and streamline your workflow.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.090
By the end of this session,
you are going to be ready to make some

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.820
of the best books in the iBookstore.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.500
I actually saw that happen last year,
so that means you guys,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.990
you've set a high bar for yourself,
and I'm thoroughly expecting

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.130
to see it again this year.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.800
So, are you ready to make an EPUB?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.390
Yeah?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.840
Okay.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.900
Great.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.070
Welcome to EPUB 3 Bootcamp.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.320
I'm going to get you up to
date on the EPUB 3 anatomy,

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.690
and then I'll show you how
to use some EPUB technology

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.880
to create pop-ups in iBooks.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.460
As I mentioned,
EPUB is really just web technology.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.040
HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.820
And then we're bundling it
together and zipping it up and

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.810
giving it an extension of .epub.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.340
I actually think it's easiest
to think of a book as a website.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.870
But then you need to ask, okay, well,
what's the difference

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.990
between a website and a book?

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.920
And there's a lot of different
answers out there for it,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.640
but I'm going to give you
a technical explanation.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.940
And to do that,
I'm going to show you an EPUB.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.860
So here's our EPUB,
and I'm going to unzip it.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.520
And inside, there are two folders,
the OEBPS and the MetaINF.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.700
We're only going to worry
about the OEBPS folder today,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.970
because that is the folder that contains
all of the content of your book.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.070
So inside of it is all that web
technology I told you about.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.570
Your XHTML,
that's the main content of your book.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.000
Your text.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.640
It also includes your styling,
so your CSS and your fonts.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.300
And your media, so your images, audio,
video.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.260
This is all the standard web content,
but in addition to that,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.870
there's also two EPUB-specific files,
and this is what's making it a book.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.810
There is the OPF file
and the NAV document.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.410
Now,
the OPF file is a carryover from EPUB 2.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.580
The NAV document is an entirely
new document in EPUB 3,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.280
so we'll spend most of our time on that.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.860
First, though, let's look at the OPF.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.140
The OPF contains all of the
information about your book,

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.720
including your package version,
that's which version

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.400
of EPUB you're using.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.320
It also includes the
metadata for your book,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.720
a manifest which lists all
of the files in your book,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.160
and a spine which defines the
linear reading order of your book.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.100
So first of all,
because we're making EPUB 3 today,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.020
we need to update our package version.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.790
So this is the package element,
the version set to 2.0,

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.050
we have to make it a 3.0.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.370
Are you ready?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.840
3.0, okay, really hard, right?

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.590
All right, but that does set us up for
needing to make some other

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.610
adjustments and other changes,
starting with the metadata.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.110
So in EPUB 2, you are required to provide
three metadata items,

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.540
the title, the language, and the ID.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.780
But in EPUB 3, you're also required to
provide the date modified.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.150
So to run through the metadata
element for this book,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.440
The Hobbit, we have the titles,
The Hobbit.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.800
We have the ID for the book,
which is usually the ISBN number,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:08.410
the language the book is written in,
in this case, English, and our new item,

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.300
DC terms modified.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.620
This is the date your
book was last modified,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.790
and it's really important
that you include it so that

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.700
You have an idea of version control,
so that whether it's you with the book

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.300
with multiple versions or if you've
given someone else multiple versions,

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.740
we have a sense of which one
is the most up to date and then

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.490
therefore probably the most correct.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.770
And The Hobbit's a really
good example of this.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.470
The Hobbit was written in 1937,
and since then, it has undergone many

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.280
revisions and additions.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.340
So it's really important as you're
moving into the digital world that

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.280
you include that date modified so
that I can tell and the iBooksor can

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.970
tell what the most recent version is.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.500
So metadata,
much the same as it was in EPUB 2,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.050
but be sure you include
your DC terms modified.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.720
Next is the manifest.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.440
Again, the manifest,
mostly unchanged since EPUB 2.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.080
And this looks like a
lot of text up there,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.610
but really all it is is a listing of
all the files that make up your book.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.730
That's your XHTML, your CSS, your fonts,
all of that content we

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.660
were discussing earlier.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.630
In EPUB 3, though,
we now have something called

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.260
the properties attribute.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.070
The properties attribute
allows you to further identify

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.640
key files in your manifest.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.040
And I have two really good
examples of that here.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.250
One is for the navigation document.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.800
The navigation document is
a vital file in your book,

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.840
and so you need to call
that out as being special.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.440
So to do that,
you add the properties attribute

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.020
and give it a value of nav.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.050
Another example is for the cover image.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.680
In EPUB 2, the cover image was
defined in the metadata,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.130
but in EPUB 3,
all you need to do is add the properties

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.460
attribute with the value of cover image
on the actual cover in the manifest.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:14.360
So manifest largely unchanged in EPUB 3,
just be sure you use the properties

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.550
attribute where required.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.360
And finally, the spine.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.440
The spine is unchanged in EPUB 3,
but it is a very,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.940
very important part of the OPF file,
so I'm going to cover it here.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.340
It lists the linear
reading order of your book.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.390
That's all of the content
documents of your book,

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.450
and it's defining the order and
literally binding it together,

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.010
much like the spine of a physical book.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.700
And the markup for the
spine is essentially a list.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.330
So now we have the spine
element and we have chapter 1,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.160
chapter 2, chapter 3.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.250
It's very simple but very important.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.750
And that's the OPF file in EPUB 3.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.810
So we've updated the version number,
we added modified date to the metadata,

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.360
we added the properties
attribute to the manifest,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.180
and we provided a spine.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.200
Now I know there's at least a
few EPUB veterans out there,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.990
and you may have noticed that
I didn't mention the guide element.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.220
The guide element is actually
deprecated in EPUB 2,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:21.410
but it has a replacement in
EPUB 3's navigation document.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.860
The navigation document
replaces EPUB 2's NCX file.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.260
And if any of you have ever
written an NCX file by hand,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.780
you can rejoice now.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.200
You don't have to do it again.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.280
Yes, I knew there would be a couple.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.860
Okay.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:43.290
And the navigation document provides
all of the information about your book,

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.100
or about how to navigate your book,
including the table of contents,

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.730
landmarks, and a page list.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.000
And those are the three
we'll cover today.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.960
All of these, the table, contents,
landmarks, and page lists,

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.180
are created using an HTML5 nav element.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:05.280
The nav element allows you to
actually define an order for a list.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.840
So here we have the nav element.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.880
Inside of it is our ordered list,
and then we have individual list items.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:20.490
Note that each list item has both
text and a link for that text.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.900
Now because you're using this
nav structure for all three,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.900
your table of contents, your landmarks,
and your page list,

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.700
you also need to provide a way
to differentiate between those.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.380
And you do that using
the epub type attribute.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.880
The EPUB type attribute is
a new attribute in EPUB 3,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.690
and it provides additional
semantic meaning to any

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.620
element it's on in your book.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.410
There's a whole variety of
pre-existing values for this,

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.680
but for today, when we're discussing
the navigation document,

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.280
we'll focus on table of contents,
landmarks, and page list.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.160
And we add it directly
to the nav element.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.020
So here's our nav element with
the EPUB type of TOC for table

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.510
of contents added in there.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.310
So let's go ahead and make
a real table of contents.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.780
This is a table of contents in iBooks.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.840
So you have chapter one.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:28.140
On page 3, nested under it is figure 1,
and back out again is chapter 2.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.190
Now your job is to provide the
text for this table of contents and

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.540
to provide the structure for it.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.890
iBooks' job is to provide
the page numbers for you.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.330
So to create this structure,
you're going to use that nav element.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.920
And you're going to give
it an EPUB type of TOC,

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.480
for table of contents.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.910
And inside of that,
you have the ordered list

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.030
with your list items.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.440
So the first list item is chapter 1,
and it has a link associated

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.560
with it for chapter1.xhtml,
so that when the reader touches

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.760
chapter 1 in the table of contents,
they'll be taken to the

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.260
chapter 1 content document.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.910
Now, I didn't close out the
list item for this,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.730
because instead,
I'm nesting under it a new

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.850
ordered list for figure 1.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.570
And that figure 1 has a link that
points to chapter 1.xhtml with a

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.790
fragment identifier of figure 1.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.080
And that's because our figure 1
exists within the chapter 1 document.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:36.580
So this link will then go and reference
a figure 1 ID within that document.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.280
So that is the basic structure.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.030
So you have your table of contents,
it's HTML list with

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.920
the HTML5 nav element.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.920
And you use this same nav
structure to create landmarks.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:59.300
A landmarks replaces EPUB 2's guide,
and its job is to identify

00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.300
key files within your book.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.680
So it is essentially providing a
map to the structure of your book.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:08.470
And the iBooksStore will reference
the landmarks when we're cutting

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.660
the sample for your book.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.470
So as a reminder,
that sample is the free sample that

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.050
our customers download when they're
deciding whether or not to buy your book.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.000
And that means you want that
sample to be really good,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.580
right?

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.600
So to do that,
you need to provide a thorough landmarks.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:32.370
Landmarks can also be used for
defining the start page of your book.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.500
So this is the first page the reader
sees the first time they open your book.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:43.400
If you want, that can be the cover page,
that can be chapter one, it's up to you.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.610
And again,
landmarks uses the nav element.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.850
So we have added the EPUB type
landmarks to our nav,

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:56.490
but now we're also using EPUB type
attributes in each of our list items.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.200
This way, no matter what you've named
your XHTML document as,

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:08.010
you have a set value or a set tag for
what that content document's job is.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.340
So for our first example,
we have coverpg.xhtml.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.090
It has an EPUB type of cover,
so that's telling the

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:16.820
iBookstor this is my cover.

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.200
That means I could name this fish.xhtml.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.330
It doesn't matter.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.560
It will be the cover as far
as the iBookstor is concerned.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.970
So that's landmarks,
very important for you to add,

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.720
and I suggest you just make
that as thorough as possible.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.240
Next is the page list.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.660
Page list allows you to define
custom page numbers for your book.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.000
When do you want to define
custom page numbers?

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.420
Well, there's a few reasons.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.680
One, in flowing books,
the number of perceived pages for your

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.720
book depends on a few different factors.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.720
For one, the device size.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.650
Another, the font size.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.250
In this example,
we have the same book on both

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.450
the iPad and on the iPhone.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:11.540
But on the iPad, you have 398 pages,
and on the iPhone, you have 1,900 pages.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:17.690
So this can pose a particular problem
if you're trying to send someone to a

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.950
very specific location in your book,
because everyone's going to have

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.330
a different concept of the paging.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.950
For instance, let's say you're in a
classroom and the teacher says,

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:34.610
"Class, turn to page 82 of White Fang."

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.110
Now all of the students who
are reading digital readers

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:42.020
are going to have a different
concept of what that page 82 is.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:46.100
But they're going to be fine
if you provide a page list.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.990
Because your page list is
going to set a standard paging,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.510
sets demarcations,
and it will also provide custom

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.410
page numbers if you like.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.370
So the best way to show this is to look
at the table of contents in iBooks.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.200
So this is the table of
contents we just made.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.450
Chapter 1 is on page 3,
figure 1 is on page 6,

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.290
and chapter 2 is on page 9.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:17.370
When you apply the page list to this,
you can make these page numbers

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.780
whatever you need them to be.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.860
Now this example is a little zany,
but it gives you an

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.410
idea of what you can do.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:30.320
Chapter 1 is page 1, figure 1 is intro,
chapter 2 is Roman numeral 4.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.010
So it's up to you.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.280
Now, in fixed layout books,
the pagination is different.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.630
People experience the
exact same number of pages,

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.370
no matter what their device,
no matter what their orientation,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:49.560
but there still may be a time when you
want to define custom page numbers.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.130
And an example of this is,
let's say you have an

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.870
existing print book,
and you want the digital book,

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.630
its page numbering to match
up with the print book.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.500
To do that,
you would provide a page list.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.270
So now, you know, normally in iBooks,
the cover page by default

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.490
would be page one,
but your print book,

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.700
it's not going to have
the cover page number one.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:17.030
So by adding a page list to this,
I now can have my last page

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.150
be Roman numeral seven.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.000
And this means that the reader can
scrub that thumbnail nav along the

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.160
bottom and see the pages that they
want and navigate to it that way.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.370
Creating a page list for both
flowing and fixed layout books,

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.400
again, we're using that nav element.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.650
We're setting an EPUB type of page list,
and now all of the text that's

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:45.270
in our list items defines the
text for our page numbers.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.510
So in this case,
we have intro for the first item,

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:53.460
we have the next page unnumbered,
and then we start a numbering of 1, 2,

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.520
and 3.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.610
Now, your linking structure is going
to change a little bit between a

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.030
flowing book and a fixed layout book.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.590
And that's because in
a fixed layout book,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.280
you have one content document per page.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.080
So when you're linking to that,
you're just going to be

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.140
linking to page 1x HTML,
page 2x HTML, and so on.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:21.800
But in a flowing book,
you have one XHTML document per chapter,

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.800
and you're going to have many
pages within that chapter.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:30.380
So you need to provide markers within it,
and really IDs within that to

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.800
mark the start of each page.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.010
And it looks like this.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.480
So here's my HTML document.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:42.580
I have a paragraph in there,
and I've added the ID of P1 for page 1.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.860
And that references, then,
the chapter 1 XHTML with

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.110
a fragment ID of P1.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.100
So that is PageList.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.300
It's easy to create,
and it can be very useful.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.460
And that wraps up the
navigation document EPUB 3.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.910
I showed you how to create
a table of contents,

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.180
landmarks, and page lists.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:09.620
All of them use the HTML5 nav element
and the EPUB 3 EPUB type attribute.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.580
But we're not done
with the EPUB type yet.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.290
It has a few more tricks up its sleeve.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.360
If you remember way back when
I was first explaining EPUB type,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.600
EPUB type can be added to
any element in your book,

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.460
not just in the navigation document.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.580
And it will add additional meaning
to any of the elements you add it on.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:39.000
And one really cool way of using
EPUB type is to create pop-ups in iBooks.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.510
Popups and iBooks work on the iPad,
the iPhone, and the iPod Touch,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.340
and they're really easy to make.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.440
It looks like this.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.940
So I have in there some
superscripts for footnotes.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.530
When the reader touches that superscript,
there's a link on it,

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.680
and it triggers the popup.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.370
So on the iPhone,
we're overlaying the popup full screen,

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.570
and on the iPad,
we're insetting the popup.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.140
And to create these,
you don't need to know

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.600
any scripting at all.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.300
You just need to use two
EPUB type attributes.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.260
Here's the markup.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:25.070
So now I have my superscript 1,
and that number 1 has an anchor element.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.280
In that anchor elements,
there's two very important attributes.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.120
We have our href for our
link that's pointing to the

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:36.040
location of our pop-up text,
and we have the epub type

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.770
attribute noteref because we're
referencing a note that's elsewhere.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.600
And that note is in the aside element.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.570
So this aside element contains the
text that will appear in the pop-up,

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.050
and that aside element also
has two important attributes.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.370
It has the ID so that our
link can reference it,

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:01.730
and it has the EPUB type of footnote
because this is the note for our book.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:04.330
That's all you need.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.840
That concludes the EPUB 3 Boot Camp.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.300
I showed you the building blocks of EPUB.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:13.880
It's really just web technology.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.410
We also covered the structure in EPUB,
including the OPF and the nav.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.280
And I showed you how you can
start to incorporate a bit more

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.840
interactivity into your books by
using pop-ups using EPUB type.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.740
But don't stop there.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.820
Next,
Jonathan is going to show you how you

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:37.290
can use the iBook JavaScript library
to easily incorporate some really

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.050
impressive interactions into your books.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.420
Jonathan?

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.660
Thanks, Casey.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.420
How's everybody today?

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.300
Great.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.030
Great.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:53.690
So what is interactivity?

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.000
Well, let's travel back in time.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.590
When I was younger, I loved storybooks.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.600
I mean, I really liked them.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:06.600
Now,

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:07.470
They were great.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.160
The stories were great,
but there was always something missing.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.490
And then one day I was
introduced to something,

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.250
and it blew my mind.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.370
With just a little bit of interactivity,
I was re-engaged.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.360
So that's cool.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.370
But what does that have to do with EPUB?

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:34.200
I think it's easier for me to show you
something than it is for me to tell you.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.440
So let's take a quick break
and let's watch a little video.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.510
Now,
it's important to note that this video,

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.790
it's a trailer, but everything you see
can be done in an EPUB.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.900
Hey Ringo,
I've just had the strangest dream.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:10.600
♪ ♪ Where'd you start this thing?

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.040
Perhaps this is it.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.240
Groovy.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.240
So what did we just see
aside from everything?

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.410
So there was user interaction
that fired animations,

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.070
played audio, played video,
allowed people to drag things

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.460
and move things and interact.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.840
This is interactivity.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:48.530
It's fusing user
interaction with feedback.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:49.360
How do we do this?

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.880
How did all of this happen?

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.300
Behind the scenes, it was JavaScript.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:01.050
Since iBooks 1.5, we've supported this,
and now it's officially

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.540
supported in EPUB 3.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.100
Now that we have JavaScript,
what do we do with this?

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.690
Well,
there's components of interactivity.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.580
We take user interaction,
and then we take audio, video,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.620
CSS animations,
and we put it together so the users

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.310
have a more engaging experience.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.650
I talk about CSS.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.430
Let's talk and show a
little bit about that.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:39.660
So on screen, I have Clarisse,
our dog cow, and I have a CSS animation.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.540
CSS animations fire by themselves
without any user interaction.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.740
They look like this.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.340
But let's say we want something
to happen with user interaction.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.330
So when the user taps on Clarisse,
she rotates.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.940
We do this with JavaScript.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.300
And animations are the
core of interactivity.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:13.210
We control everything with JavaScript,
and we can link animations

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:18.840
together to create more complex
and engaging interactions.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:28.060
Using JavaScript,
we add class names or modify them,

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.060
and then we respond to these with CSS.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:34.640
So I showed you the user tapping on
Claris and the rotation happening.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.610
So let me walk you through what
actually happens in the background,

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.220
because I'm sure you're curious.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.590
So just follow along.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.260
So you're going to create an element.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.580
You're going to have to
add a class name to it.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.860
And then you add an event
listener with JavaScript.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.920
With JavaScript,
you're going to have to listen for touch.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.120
Touch is going to have a touch start,
a touch move, and a touch end.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.470
Not all touch is the same.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.310
Once you find that correct touch event,
you've got to make sure

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.360
it's the right one.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.620
So then you need to check
for a tap threshold.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.770
All that's fun.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:02.440
It's OK.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:05.900
So now we're going to check
the class on the element.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.190
Is it OK if it's OK?

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.410
We'll toggle it.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.090
If it's not, we'll toggle it again.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:15.170
So that was fun.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:20.360
But I don't think you came here
today so I could tell your life

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.740
is going to be more difficult.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.420
So you could do all of this.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.730
Or you could do this.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:35.170
iBook.js is
JavaScript interactivity simplified.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:39.160
And what is it other than awesome?

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.380
So it's Apple's framework.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.220
It's our library.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.460
It's available now.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.380
It's on iTunes Connect.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.860
It's for all of you.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.770
You can download it.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.660
It simplifies a lot of common tasks
that publishers have requested,

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.250
takes all this crazy stuff,
and bundles it into a

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.150
nice little package.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.020
It's unobfuscated,
so you can look what we're

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.590
doing under the hood.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.040
You can make sure you're
following our best practices.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.680
And it doesn't matter
if you're a beginner.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.040
It doesn't matter if you're a veteran.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.980
It's optional.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.130
Use it as a base.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.120
Use it standalone.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.760
Use it as a foundation.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.790
So now that I've already
sold you on this,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.590
let me show you what it actually does.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:22.740
So the first thing you might want is an
animation to fire when the DOM loads.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.210
So I have Claris off screen right now.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.170
Let's say the DOM is loaded.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.700
iBook.js will append build
in to the body class.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.490
That's great,
but maybe you want to delay something.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.430
You don't want your animation
to fire immediately.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.170
We can use a deferred
event to accomplish this.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.730
With a deferred event,
we simply add iBooks

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.540
deferred event to an element.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.780
And by default, one second later,
we'll append an active class,

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.510
and an animation will fire.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:58.560
You can adjust this delay with
data iBooks deferred event

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.120
delay as an HTML attribute.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.260
So those are event timing things.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.290
Let's talk about touch.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.890
Your book lives inside of touch.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.840
So it makes sense to use it, right?

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.940
Simple toggling of an element.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.000
This is what I showed
you with all that code.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:25.290
Instead of doing that,
just append iBooks Togglable,

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:25.290
and we'll add an active class
when the user taps on it.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.700
So we can toggle something.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.220
Let's drag something.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:34.350
Using iBooks Dragable,
we can leverage touch so all elements

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.600
can be dragged around on the device.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.510
It was really easy,
but it was a lot of work.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.340
So we've toggled things,
and what did we do?

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.640
We toggled things and
we've dragged things.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.360
Now we're going to duplicate
and create something.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:55.280
So if we look at the iPad,
we have some beautiful hills.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:59.720
We can append an iBooks stampable
class to the parent container.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:04.610
And on touch, we'll add an empty div
with the class stamp.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.820
Why would you want to do this?

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:11.930
Well, as we touch the hills,
let's add some dog cows.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.500
Just like that.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:18.860
Now,
you don't want everything to be tappable,

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.330
so we need to define
some type of hit area.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.880
We do this using SVG.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.640
HTML doesn't have a hill element,
so we use SVG.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.450
It's a format for 2D vector graphics,
and it's especially useful for

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:34.850
irregular shapes like the hill.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.220
Now, in yellow is our hit area.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.060
It was just defined in SVG.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.940
So any touch outside of that hit area,
nothing's going to happen.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:52.040
But if we touch inside of this hit area,
magic.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.720
This is touch.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.640
Let's talk about audio.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:05.330
Using iBooks Media Audio and setting a
source with Data iBooks Audio Source,

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.780
we can play audio with elements.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.470
You might be wondering, well,
there's an audio tag in HTML.

00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:14.430
Why would I use this?

00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:17.510
Well, you can still use the audio tag,
but there's a few things

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.080
you're going to have to do.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.300
You're going to have
to create an element.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.300
You're going to have to add
JavaScript to listen for that.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.480
You're going to have to do some action.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.240
When the user taps on it,
and then you're going to

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.490
have to play audio and then
manage that playback later.

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:34.200
Or you could just do this.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.370
Now, Claris is on screen.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.200
and Claris Plays Audio.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.500
So that's pretty cool.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:53.380
Now, not everybody wants audio to resume
from where it was last paused.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.530
And by default, when you play audio,
it will pause.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:01.380
So you can configure this
playback with Data Audio,

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.960
iBooks, Reset On Play.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.890
And by doing this,
the play head will reset every

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.100
time the user taps on the element.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.300
I told you this is easy,
and I said you can add

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.140
interactivity really easily.

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.150
Let's see how easy it is.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.080
There's three things we're going to do.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.770
The first thing, we're going to include
it like any script tag,

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.930
any library in the head of your document.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:28.930
Two,

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.600
Find the behavior you want
and add it to the class.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.800
And then three, optionally,
configure that behavior.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.770
Now, it really is that easy.

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:47.670
So to summarize really quickly,
all of this is available

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.670
on iTunes Connect.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.860
I showed you how to pair
audio to DOM load events,

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.280
to deferred events.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:57.680
I showed you the leverage touch,
tappables, stampables, draggables,

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.180
and how to control audio simply.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.140
So now what?

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.810
Maybe this is just the beginning.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.110
With advanced JavaScript,
you can do almost anything.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.760
First thing I would suggest,
look in iBooks.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.270
Look in iBook.js, look at what we do,
customize some things,

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.760
build some extra things out.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.800
Next,
as you're building more interactivity,

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.810
you're probably going to run into
an issue with the default UI.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.680
Because your book lives
inside of a touch environment,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.700
we leverage touch for UI.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.350
So if I were to tap on Sonnet,
the menu bar is going to

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.720
pop down from the top.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.930
Could be a dialog box if it's text.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.260
Now, this is great for
UI because it's consistent.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.540
But when you're building
interactive books,

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.880
you may not want that.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.900
It may detract from what
you're trying to accomplish.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.300
JavaScript provides a default binding,
prevent default,

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.460
which will prevent this behavior.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.800
So if we were to reset
this and tap again,

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.300
it's going to pop up.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:08.420
Nothing's going to happen
except what you tell it to do.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.080
So that's great.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.000
What else can I do?

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.780
Because everything in
iBooks renders with WebKit,

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:19.190
you can leverage WebKit too.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.280
So almost anything you
do with mobile WebKit,

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.460
you can do on the phone or in this iBook.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.870
Now, you can access hardware sensors.

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.540
You don't need an iOS app to do that.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.790
Accelerometers, gyroscopes,
magnetometers,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.540
why would you want to do that?

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.720
Maybe you've written a
book on home improvement,

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.690
and you're showing people how
to hang posters or pictures.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:48.580
You can tell them how
to do that with content,

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:48.580
and then you can include some widgets

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.030
So you can actually hang your
paintings and keep them level

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.700
all without leaving your book.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:03.840
Use location services for
real time GPS location,

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.820
and then compare it to some
predefined data so you can show

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:06.820
people how far things are from them.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:15.730
Move beyond just taps and
drags and include gestures.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:15.730
And finally,

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.770
Test, test, test.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:25.880
Because as you build more
complex interactions,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:25.880
things are going to break.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.850
And your book is only going to be
as good as the time you put into it.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.800
So test it.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.700
If your animations are slow,
accelerate them.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:38.370
Optimize your JavaScript,
and make sure the book

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.280
goes from good to great.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.790
So next,
we'll have Alejandro talk you through

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:51.150
some of the things I've showed you,
and he'll tell you how

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:53.270
to test your books.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.270
Thanks.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.270
Thanks, Jon.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:59.000
Now picture this.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:05.040
You have an idea for a book, a deep,
engaging book for your users.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:13.530
You have an idea for
a book about a flower,

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:13.530
red flower.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.900
spinning Red Flower.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.460
Now you know exactly how to do this.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.360
You're going to make
it spin using iBook.js.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.620
Jon taught you that.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.080
And you're going to
distribute it using EPUB 3,

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.880
just like Casey taught you.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.800
What they haven't talked to you about,
and what I will talk to you about,

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.180
is how to test it.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:37.610
How to go from writing your code on
your computer using HTML5 and then

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:42.980
testing it on your device where your
users are actually going to use it.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.480
With this in mind, let's test your book.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.990
There are six easy steps
you have to follow.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.230
Step 1, edit and save your document.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.980
Step 2, export it as an EPUB.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.090
Step 3, sync it to your device.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.100
4, open it in iBooks.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.990
5, turn to the relevant chapter.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:02.540
And 6, test your book.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.960
It's that simple.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.260
It's really easy.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.770
You know how to do it.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.210
It's a piece of cake.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:15.170
Now, as you get to understand your
book better and you use it,

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.290
you realize that it's not very
obvious that it's interactive.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:27.650
So you decide to put a background
behind it so that it's obvious to

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.590
the users that it's like a button.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.090
And of course, it still spins.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:32.090
It's the spinning red flower, after all.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.460
Now, something has changed.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.520
Now the book is in iBooks,
so you have to deal with caching.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.900
What this is, is that iBooks is really,
really smart about the work

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.820
it does and it doesn't do.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:51.970
So if it thinks that your
book is already in the device,

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:51.970
it's not going to sync it again.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:51.970
That's to make sync faster.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.710
So, to get around it,
you're going to modify the

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.730
modification date in the OPF,
just like Casey pointed out.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.300
With this in mind,
let's go through the steps again.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.260
You know how to do it.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.400
It's really easy, okay?

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.850
Seven steps this time.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.840
One, edit and save your document.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.150
Two, bump the modification date.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.930
Three, export it as an EPUB,
sync it to your device, open an iBooks,

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.750
turn to the relevant chapter,
and test your book.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.180
It's really that easy.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.400
You know how to do it.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.670
It's a piece of cake.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.100
Okay?

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.450
Now, you have an epiphany as
you're doing all this work.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.500
It's no longer the spinning red flower.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.050
It's the spinning red flowers.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.830
And I have great news for you.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:41.540
The steps to test it are
exactly the same as before.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.270
Let's go ahead and test your book.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.940
Okay?

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.460
Step one, edit and save your document.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:57.060
Does it feel like I'm repeating myself?

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:02.740
Well, that's because I am.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:08.080
And if you're going through this process,
then you're repeating yourself as well.

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.260
You don't care about these things.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.500
They have nothing to do with
the story you're trying to tell.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:18.500
All you really care about is making
an edit and testing your content.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.490
Well, I'm very pleased to tell you

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.350
That's why I'm here today,
to talk to you about a tool that

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.800
will take this overwhelming process,
turn it into this.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.140
BookProver.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.600
BookProver is an OS X app
that you can download from

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.470
iTunes Connect for free today.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:55.280
It will help you be more productive by
laying on top of a couple of cornerstones

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.000
that I will walk you through.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.530
The first one is instantaneous feedback.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:09.740
When you're building your content,
you're going to want to change positions,

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.290
colors, velocities,
all these variables until

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:11.290
your book feels balanced.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:17.180
And for that, you need fast,
strong support from your tools.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:21.700
And BookProofer provides that
with instantaneous feedback.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:22.950
Automatic Sync.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:24.490
This is all about focus.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.300
You don't want to leave your IDE.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:35.950
If you're focusing on your code,
you should be able to change it

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:36.200
and save it and see the results
on your device immediately without

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:36.200
having to leave your tool of choice.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.340
BookProofer is also tool independent.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.870
This means that you can
stay as productive as you

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.740
have been all these years.

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.110
You can use your image editor of choice.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.760
You can use your HTML editor of choice.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.890
What BookProofer does is that it creates
a link between the app and the files,

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.680
and as you save them,
it will update automatically.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:01.800
Also, it supports multiple
devices simultaneously.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:06.410
So as you make changes and you can
see them on your high resolution

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:10.490
iPad and on your iPhone or your
iPad touch all at the same time,

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:14.590
this will ensure that you provide a
premium experience for all of your

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.320
users and all of their devices.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:22.100
Last, BookProofer is extremely,
extremely,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.080
extremely well integrated with iBooks.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:30.450
It will show things like a ribbon on
your iBooks shelf to let you know which

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.880
books you're working on currently.

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:37.480
You don't have to do things like
turning to the relevant chapter.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:39.850
It knows what chapter you're on.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.140
It will remember these things.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.340
Well,
I'm sure you all want to see it working,

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:45.950
so let me go ahead and show you.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:54.200
[Transcript missing]

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.980
I have an EPUB here,
and I have a flower that

00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.330
will become relevant later.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.890
If we go into the EPUB folder,
you'll see familiar files

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:06.530
like the Meta-INF and the
OEBPF that Casey told you about.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:14.860
If we go in here,
we find my XHTML documents,

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.340
we find iBook.js,
and a couple of other things.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:22.650
Now that we have that,
let me go ahead and open BookProofer,

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:23.980
walk you through the interface.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.220
Here we have the work area.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.700
This is where you drag your EPUB.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:34.060
And it will create a link
between the EPUB and Bookproofer.

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.400
Down here is the device list.

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:40.390
As you add more devices,
they will appear on the list.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.920
And you can check which
ones you want to be syncing,

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.400
which one you want syncing enabled for.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.400
Let me go ahead and drag this folder.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.160
I don't even have to
compress it into a zip file.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.380
And now these guys are
just linked together.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:59.690
And if I check the iPad,
see how it syncs over.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.740
I have to have iBooks open, of course.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.490
So as I check the iPad,
it will sync it over to the device.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.710
Let me show you what that looks like.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:14.110
So you can see there,
you see the proof in ribbon to show

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.670
you that I'm working on this book.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:20.540
When I open it, I see my pretty flowers.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:24.260
I have my cover right here.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:29.080
And as I come here,
I realize I'm missing one of the flowers.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.970
Well, this is where that
other flower comes from,

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.800
where it becomes important.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.630
I'm just going to drag and
drop it into my images folder,

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.030
and I'm going to leave it
there so that you see how it

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.310
updates the book immediately.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:46.570
I'm just going to drop it,
not touch anything,

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.510
not say sync or anything like that,
and it will just update.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.040
It really is that easy.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.180
That's all there is to BookProofer.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.820
With that in mind,
let's go ahead and do some

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.400
interaction like Jon taught you about.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.420
Let me walk you through that.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:11.410
So I'm going to get my white
flower and my red flower,

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:16.180
which are the ones on screen,
and I'm going to just drop them

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:16.180
on my text editor of choice,
which in this case is VI.

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:20.160
You all know I'm really
good at following steps,

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.160
so I'm going to follow the steps that
Jon taught us about a few minutes ago.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:28.960
First, I'm going to add the
script tag on my head.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:37.700
So it's just script,
and the source is iBook.js.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.080
Next, I'm going to add the
iBooksTalkable class.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:52.160
So, that will just add an active class to
my image element when we tap the flower.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.480
We can access that active tag on CSS.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.460
So, I'm going to add some
CSS here to do that.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:01.240
So, I'm doing it inline so it's
easier for all of you to see,

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.350
but this behaves just
like a linked style sheet.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.680
So, it's a CSS style.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.420
It will look for my flower right here.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.100
You see it's a flower class.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:16.560
And when it's active,
it's going to execute

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.100
the code that's below.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:24.140
So when it's active,
it's going to apply a transform that

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.220
will rotate my flower by 360 degrees.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:32.610
Now, I don't want to bore
you talking too much,

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:32.610
so let me just save it.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.340
Switch to my device,
and without doing anything else,

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.960
my flower now spins.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.240
We have a spinning red flower.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.540
There's something else I want
to call your attention on.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:53.380
Notice that when I tap it,
the toolbar doesn't come down.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.460
But when I tap this flower, it does.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:00.450
That's the prevent defaults that
John was talking about a few minutes ago.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:04.580
And you don't want things to
distract your users when they

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.520
are tapping things around.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.910
So that's what it did.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.820
Now, let me just go ahead and
show you something else.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:14.800
Let's make the white flower interactive.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.930
And you will notice how
incredibly easy it is.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:20.760
Only two steps.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:25.950
I'll go ahead and add my script tag,
same as before.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.400
It just points to iBook.js.

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:28.540
It's on the head of the document.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:35.500
And then I'm going to
make it iBooks draggable.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.320
Okay?

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.720
That's it.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.710
I save it.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:44.000
Switch to my device.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:44.940
And this is incredible.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.720
Look at this.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.070
My flower just moves around.

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:55.320
I can rotate, I can move,
I can do both at the same time.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:05.300
Now, you have just seen how easy it is to
make great interactive books using EPUB,

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:09.160
iBook.js,
and then BookProofer to test it.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:12.720
Casey will come up on stage to
tell you where you can learn more.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.150
Thank you.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.200
Thanks Alejandro.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:22.240
You know what Alejandro showed you today?

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:27.680
It only scratches the surface of
what's possible in iBooks today.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:33.180
JavaScript has opened the doors
for so many creative opportunities,

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:39.510
and it will allow you to create a book
that is both inspiring and engaging.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:46.180
EPUB combines with HTML and
CSS to give you the possibility

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.960
of creating any type of book.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:52.480
You could create a basic flowing novel or

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:56.530
A high-design picture book with
interactivity and embedded audio.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.550
The choice is yours.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.600
Now, my colleagues and I today
talked a lot about the

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.280
technology used to create books.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:11.090
But one of the most important takeaways
is any of you can create a book.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:14.990
Any one of you can publish in iBooks.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.470
So iBooks this year gives you,
iBooks author,

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:25.430
and EPUB 3 in the hopes that
we can help you take your story

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:28.630
from imagination to reality.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:32.920
And to help you out, if you need any more
information along your way,

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.640
you can contact your Safari evangelist,
Vicki Murley.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.100
Also, I suggest you check out
the Apple Developer Forms.

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.570
We have a new iBooks community there,
and it's a great place to both

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:48.510
post your questions and help other
people out with their questions.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:53.580
Also, if you haven't already
signed up for iTunes Connect,

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:54.260
do so.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.820
Once you sign up to sell
your books on iTunes Connect,

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:01.530
you will have access to the
iBooks Store Asset Guide.

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:05.130
That guide will help you create
books and will explain to you not

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:09.220
only how to construct your books,
but how to deliver to the store.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:12.940
Also,
once you've signed up to sell your books,

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.840
you have access to our two example EPUBs.

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:19.970
We give you both a flowing
EPUB and a fixed layout EPUB.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:23.810
And the fixed layout EPUB contains
the iBook JavaScript library

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:25.720
that John showed you today.

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.360
Also,
if you have any more questions on EPUB 3,

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.840
visit idpf.org.

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.880
The IDPF is the standards
committee for EPUB 3.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.620
We had a number of
sessions for you this week.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.460
Publishing at the iBooks
Store already happened,

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.880
so if you missed it,
definitely check it out when we

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.680
posted the videos after WWDC.

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.220
Also, Building Books with iBooks
Author was this Tuesday.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.210
I think that they're going to do
a rerun for that later this week.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.220
And then this afternoon,
definitely check out the HTML, CSS,

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:58.800
and DOM for authors.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.550
Ted has some really good tips
and tricks in there for you.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:06.740
And finally, improving accessibility
in books is also tomorrow.

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:11.380
iBooks is the most
accessible reading system,

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.900
so it's really important you
make your books accessible.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.100
So please attend that.

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.400
Thank you for coming to WWDC.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.500
Enjoy the rest of your time.
