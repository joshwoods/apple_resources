00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.640
Hi.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.040
Welcome to session 503,
Building Books with iBooks Author.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.530
My name is Charles Migos.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.030
I've been the lead designer on the
iBooks project since the very beginning,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.570
and it's my pleasure to be here today
to teach you a little bit about iBooks

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.070
Author and hopefully leave you guys
with some new skills and tricks and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.860
techniques to get the most out of
your own book-building experience.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.210
So first I want to answer the question,
why did we build iBooks Author?

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.100
Of course, we did it for the children.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.740
We had a vision that the iPad would
be a great platform for delivering

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.890
a new kind of educational material,
one that would kind of transcend the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.200
limitations of their known counterparts.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.690
You know, you think that textbooks,
they're great at what they do.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.320
They have densely packed
information captured in text,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.840
and they're richly
illustrated a lot of the time.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.940
They've evolved over hundreds,
if not thousands of years at this point.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.220
They're great at what they do.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.920
And digital publishers have been
excellent at supplying ancillary or

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.200
secondary materials for those textbooks,
and they can be found on the web or as

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.470
standalone applications in various forms.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.870
But the problem with the systems that
exist today is that when you're taking

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.490
your attention away from the book,
it's a very fragile moment in terms of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.060
the students understanding the concept
that he or she is trying to learn.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.540
So every time you make that mode shift
away from a textbook to your computer,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.550
let's say, to your laptop,
or to some location on the web,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.340
your connection to what you
were trying to learn is that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.950
much further away from you.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.860
So what the iPad does so well
is it ties all these different

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.860
types of applications together.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.070
So what the iPad does so well
is it ties all these different

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.860
types of applications together.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.420
With iBooks multi-touch experience
and the -- an iBooks author

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.600
that enables you to create them,
we supply the best of what textbooks have

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.860
today plus the best of iPad interactivity
and touch experiences coupled with the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.040
other things the iPad does really well.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.460
Provides access to the web,
provides access to other applications

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.940
from third-party developers,
and it's really a combination

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.410
that can't be beat.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.290
And the tool that we created for all
this lovely stuff is iBooks Author.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.660
And when we were creating this tool,
we were trying to satisfy a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.930
couple of very tough audiences.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.900
We had to make sure that the third grade
school teacher that wanted to supply

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.350
custom class materials to his or her
class could walk up and use this product.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.160
At the same time,
it had to have sufficient depth to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.540
allow professional publishers to bring
their content to life on the iPad.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.340
We think we struck kind
of the right balance.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.980
But as we were designing the product,
we knew we were designing it

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.350
for more than just textbooks.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.300
We were designing it for all kinds of
books that are somewhat visual in nature.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.910
So here I have three examples.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.800
First is Michelle Obama's American Grown,
which is kind of a slash lifestyle

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.090
cookbook and gardening book all in one.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.980
Chock full of great
interactive experiences.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.720
The next is kind of a how-to book,
Learn Guitar.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.440
It's a great book,
has a lot of video course material to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.540
help you learn how to play the guitar.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.850
And the last is The Getty
You're in Focus,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.300
which is a photographic anthology book.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.360
So these are all great examples of
those books that aren't well served.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.340
by traditional EPUB today.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.860
But you're a highly technical crowd.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.240
What might iBooks Author have for you?

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.340
What can it offer you?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.750
Well,
many of you out there -- I don't want

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.600
to paint with too broad a brush --
many of you out there are developers.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:35.770
You're developing apps like this one,
which is Apple's iPhoto app for iOS.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.770
You didn't develop that one.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.770
Maybe some of you did.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.860
And recently what was published
was this multi-touch book,

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.270
Hello iPhoto, which is an excellent
companion to this app.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.360
This app is very deep.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.040
It's a powerful photo editing tool.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.950
This book helps you kind of learn
all of the in-depth secrets and

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.940
the techniques that you need to
kind of get the most out of it.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.860
It was published by a
third-party developer,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.860
not by Apple, of course.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.700
In addition to that,
you might be a game developer.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.200
Up here I have an example of the
Diablo III Gaming Guide published

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.700
by DK Publishing.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.300
Who knows your game better than you?

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.900
If you work directly with a writer,
with a designer,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.870
you could develop your own gaming
walkthrough book or your overall guide.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.370
Or if you're one of those
brilliant Renaissance types,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.050
I know you're out there too,
you could do it all yourself.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120
And lastly, we have an example of
a technical journal,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.470
Test Driving iOS Development with
Kiwi from Dan Steinberg.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.290
If you have domain knowledge and
expertise in a given area that you

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.630
want to make available to the world,
iBooks Author is a great way

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.260
for you to communicate it.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.450
And lastly,
you might be thinking about an iBook,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.900
an iBooks multi-touch book,
as an alternative to apps themselves.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.060
So here we have Cleaning Mona Lisa.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.140
The author here is Lee Stansted.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.240
This was developed by Tappity.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.770
They developed all the
interactive content for this book.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.270
And Jeremy Olson from
Tappity had this to say.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.440
He said, Olson suggests, well actually,
sorry, this is him being quoted.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.980
He guesses that using iBooks
Author offered them a factor of five,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.910
six,
or even seven times improvement in man

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.960
hours versus traditional app development.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.790
That's really telling of what
you can do with iBooks Author,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.620
and the kind of experiences you can
get with iBooks multi-touch books.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.020
And this quote comes
courtesy of tuaw.com.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.770
So what are we going to learn today?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.190
Well, first I'm going to give you a demo
of the iBooks multi-touch experience.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.900
This will be familiar to many of you,
but I'm going to touch on aspects

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.240
of the experience that we'll
showcase again in iBooks Author.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.970
So we're going to get an overview
of the basics of the interface,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.420
the iBooks Author interface,
and its features,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.060
and then I'm going to give you some
kind of more in-depth knowledge so you

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.400
can really just give you some tools
and techniques that will help you

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.190
differentiate your content from the
rest of the books on the iBookstore.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.040
All right,
so let's take a look at iBooks.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.230
All right, so as I launch iBooks,
this is the bookshelf that

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.640
we've come to know and love.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.120
On it, I have a selection of books.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.160
Most of them are multi-touch.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.680
A couple of them are traditional ePubs.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.640
I'm going to go ahead
and launch one of them.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.210
And at outset, you can see that this is a
vastly different experience

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.570
from traditional ePubs.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.530
We're trying to set the tone at book
launch that this is about rich media.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.600
It's a multimedia experience.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:38.150
And if you want to take the
time to create high production

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.150
video intro to your book,
you can do that,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.150
and this is what you'll see.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.140
As that video plays through,
we are brought to the table of contents

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.640
view for the landscape orientation.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.870
A couple things about it.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.070
If I swipe in the upper region,
I move through the chapters of the book.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.870
And if I swipe down here
in the thumbnail track,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.000
I'm able to scan the pages of
any given chapter visually.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.120
Tap to bring one to the foreground.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.760
I can pinch back to the
table of contents view.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.700
I also have this scrubber
which will allow me to zap to

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.360
a far location in the book.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.900
This is a fairly short book,
so I don't really need that.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.030
And when I land on a given chapter,
we have here a list of the

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.730
sections within that chapter that
function as a set of hyperlinks.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.230
I can tap on one and be brought
to that location in the book.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.400
So this is the second page
we've seen in this book.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.500
You look at this,
and it should feel like a real book,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.900
right?

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.980
There's real graphic
design happening here.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.330
There's control over the
typographic elements.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:41.850
There is imagery,
and it overall feels like not something

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.910
that -- it feels like something that you
would find in a traditional textbook.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:58.500
[Transcript missing]

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.150
So what you just saw, believe it or not,
was a widget.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.600
Even a simple diagram is --
we refer to it as a widget.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.180
A widget is any interactive
component that you have within

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.440
an iBooks multi-touch experience.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.840
The next widget,
up a level in terms of sophistication,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840
is the media widget.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.700
So here I have a movie,
which I can play in place, or again,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.590
bring it to full screen.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.920
I can tap to reveal
the transport controls.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.490
I can move around within the movie.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.360
and then pinch it back when I'm done.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.460
Next on this page I have another movie,
but it's kind of wrapped

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.460
in a special way.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.800
This movie is exhibiting the
full-screen only feature.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.010
So, I have an icon of Sir Paul Nurse,
a noted Nobel laureate

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.680
and cellular biologist.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.260
I can tap on him -
All living things reproduce.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.010
- and I'll become his movie.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.160
- And cells reproduce as well.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.880
He will espouse some brilliance -
They do that through a process -

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.880
but we will put him back because
we have much to cover today.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.750
Although he's got some
smart stuff to say.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.000
Next up we have the gallery.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.990
And in the gallery you can see
one of the tenets of the design,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.590
which was that things should
be interactive on the page,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.360
and they should be
interactive in full screen.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.600
Each of those experiences should
offer something different,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.500
but you shouldn't have to kind of switch
modes too heavily between the two.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.800
So here I can browse that gallery.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.890
If there's something
that piques my interest,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.490
I can bring it to full screen and
continue to swipe through the images.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:29.490
And again, pinch when I'm done.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.250
Next up we have the Keynote widget.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.040
I work within the iWork team,
and we thought as the developers of

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.600
Keynote that it would make an excellent
tool for creating animated diagrams.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.190
So here I have an example of
stem cell differentiation,

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:50.260
which is just a deck of slides
that are being animated using

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.950
a simple magic move transition.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.270
So you can see here that just
through the use of Keynote,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.780
you can create kind of rich
interactive experiences without

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.660
any code being required.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.340
On to the next section.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.820
And here is a 3D widget.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:13.790
Why?

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.230
Because it's very cool.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.340
So I can interact with
this thing on the page,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.240
or as you guessed it,
bring it to full screen and

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.300
look at it in all its glory.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.220
I like to stare death
straight in the eye.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.400
And I can pitch back when I'm done,
double tap to reset the view.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.720
Next up is the interactive image,
which looks like a traditional

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.530
annotated diagram that you might
find in any given textbook,

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.400
but this is a lot more.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.840
Here I can tap on one of these
interactive callouts to reveal

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.700
additional information about a
feature in the underlying image.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.310
And you'll notice that we kind
of zoomed the frame up to kind

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.470
of put emphasis on that feature.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.340
Do you think I can go to full screen?

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.100
You know I can.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.800
And when I'm in there,
I can continue to zoom around,

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.170
tap on these things, tap to put it away,
and I'm done.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.670
Next in the roster is the HTML widget,
and this is your go-to widget

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.410
when you want to create truly
custom interactive experiences.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.230
One thing to note with the
HTML widget is that it only exists

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.700
in kind of a full-screen only guise.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.400
It can't be interactive on the page.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.790
So here we have a thumbnail
representing the full-screen experience.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.940
We tap on it.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.200
After a short loading cycle,
you'll see the thing

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.660
is fully interactive.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.150
So I can strum over the different
organ systems of the human body,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.410
or tap through them, of course.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.600
And then finally we
have the review widget.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.010
As we were designing textbooks,
we thought-- or designing a tool

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.570
for the creation of textbooks--
we thought it would make sense to

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.740
provide a widget that would allow
authors to create end-of-lesson or

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.360
end-of-chapter reviews very easily.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.560
So here we have an example of that.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.760
Exoskeletons provide
select all that apply,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.890
support, armor, muscle attachment points.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:02.480
Don't be impressed.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.240
I've done this before.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.800
I'm going to say two here.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.560
This is an interesting question.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.970
It's the drag-to-target question type.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.170
So here I can grab one of
these little text placards

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.300
and pull them to a location.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.370
You should make note of this.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.990
There will be a test later on.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.720
Tendons Connect.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.360
Anyone?

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.490
Muscle to Bone.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.760
Good answer.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.590
Finally, at the end of the review,
I have a little summary slate

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:37.090
that lets me know how I did
on this particular test.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:44.400
The results of that session are
persisted until you reset the quiz,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:44.400
which I can do by hitting
the start over button.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.510
So that's the widget tour,
the tour of all the interactive

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.890
elements that you have within the
iBooks multi-touch experience.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.870
So I pointed out that we
have kind of a rich layout.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.460
Typography is important to us.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.810
Graphic design is very important to us.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.300
And we thought that's
great for landscape,

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.100
but what can we do in
portrait that makes sense?

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.330
We didn't want the authors of the book,
the designers of the book,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.500
to have to lay out their book twice.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.610
So what we did is we decided
to derive a view for them.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.170
So as I changed the
orientation of my device,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.830
we go to the portrait flow mode.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.580
And here you probably guessed,
we've taken all the textual

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.670
content from the book,
we've put it into this

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.280
river of text at right,
and then we've taken

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.500
all the visual elements,
turned them into thumbnails,

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.000
and put them in a gutter at left.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.840
Everything here is still
available on demand.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:33.880
So if I want to review that HTML widget,
I can bring it up and pinch it back.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.090
3D, of course.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.700
You get the idea.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.680
Also in this view,
I have some control as the

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.620
user over the font size,
which is important for the lifelong

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.500
learners out there like myself.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.000
or of course the visually impaired.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.100
And you can see that we've maintained
all the typographic styling.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.580
So the character of the book,
the brand of the book if you will,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.100
is still maintained throughout.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:07.720
And you can do things like customize
the headers of the book so it still

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:07.720
feels like a design-managed view.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.430
So that's the flow mode.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.390
We knew that students using these
new textbook experiences would want

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.490
a way to mark them up very easily
to create highlights and notes for

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.760
future reference for studying purposes.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.440
We have the standard method of
I can create a selection range,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.760
then by the edit menu hit highlight,
and voila, I have a highlight.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.150
We get the little contextual
highlighting toolbar that you

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.800
will be familiar from iBooks,
or should be familiar with from iBooks.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.050
I can change the color, add my note.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:46.000
[Transcript missing]

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.540
And we thought that's all well and good,
but it's not a really fluid

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.200
method for creating highlights.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.520
We thought we could do one better.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.600
So we decided to kind
of preload your finger.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:03.310
And any time you want to
create a highlighted range,

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.310
you can just put your finger on
some text and draw out a highlight.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.020
Same rules apply.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.200
Tap to reveal the context menu,
change your color, add a note.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.040
I'll very creatively
call this a new note.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.140
and tap to put it away.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.010
That note is available now.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.680
I can reveal it by tapping
its icon in the margin.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.550
So great, we've made it very efficient
and fluid to kind of create

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.500
these notes and highlights.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.880
We wanted to give you
a proper environment,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.250
too,
for consuming your notes and highlights.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.540
And that environment is the Notes View.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.280
So if I tap to reveal
the toolbar for iBooks,

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.900
third button over is
the Notes View button.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.130
I'll tap on it,
and in will come my notes for the book.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:42.960
I have only three.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.810
So these are the notes,
the highlights and notes that

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.720
we just created in that chapter.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.350
Wherever there is a note
present with a highlight,

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.080
it's beneath the highlight.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.180
And we're like, "Okay, this is great.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.300
This supports, you know,
studying tasks fairly well,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.120
but we thought we could do it one better,
too." So in the top left-hand corner,

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.680
we have the Study Cards button.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.130
If I tap it,
I'm brought into the Study Cards view.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.060
And what we do here is we take your
notes and your highlights and we

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.540
map them to Study Cards for you.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.900
So here I have my highlight on
the front and my note on the back

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.600
to put this on the crib sheet.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.990
I can simply swipe
through the Study Cards.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.400
And interspersed with
my notes are these guys.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.460
Now, I didn't highlight this.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.020
This is a glossary term found in
the chapter that I'm currently in.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.170
Anytime an author, you as an author,
define a glossary term

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.440
within iBooks Author,
this is how the end user will benefit.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:46.280
We can do things like create custom
study cards using those glossary terms.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.860
So what I can do here,
if I want to cram for my midterm,

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.740
which is coming up tomorrow,
I can turn off my highlights and notes,

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.570
hit the shuffle button,
and now I can sit down for a

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.420
dedicated study and review session.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.400
All right.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.170
And that's the iBooks
multi-touch experience.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.850
Like I said, it was plenty of review
probably for you at this point,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.000
but let's see how we actually create
that stuff over in iBooks Author.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.220
All right,
so let's take a look at the document

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.960
that we just reviewed in iBooks.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.000
This is what it looks like.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.500
This application is going to
be familiar to you if you've

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.000
spent any time with Keynote,
Pages, or Numbers,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.990
the iWork family of tools.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
If you don't use these tools,
you definitely should.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.990
You should primarily because
they're great at what they do,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.380
but they also allow you -- any skills
that you develop within them can be

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.900
used directly within iBooks Author.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.850
And moreover,
any elements that you create

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.910
within those apps can be brought
into iBooks Author and made use

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.110
of in your multi-touch books.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.600
So the framework here is
kind of standard iWork stuff.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.220
We have a toolbar up top which
houses all my create tools,

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.490
my major view switch tools.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.500
So if I wanted to add
pages to this document,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.900
I would pop this button.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.890
Here are my selection of layouts
for this particular book.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:29.600
[Transcript missing]

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.040
widgets,
which we'll see a lot of in a second,

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.920
and my preview and publish buttons.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.330
Finally over here we have
a set of panel toggles.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.060
I'm going to turn on the inspector
since we're going to need it very soon.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.070
Here we have the sidebar.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.940
It looks a lot like the pages sidebar.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.260
I have thumbnails representing
all the pages of my book.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.800
I can move through the
sidebar using the keyboard,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.010
just the arrow keys on the keyboard,
or I can swipe directly

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.260
in the Canvas view,
and you can see that we've

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.990
maintained the horizontal scrolling
paradigm from iBooks directly,

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.420
so it's very much a WYSIWYG experience.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.880
In keeping with that, we have maintained
interactivity wherever we can.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.010
So if you want to preview a movie,
you can do so simply by

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.700
clicking on the movie in place.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.740
You can also cycle through
the images in your gallery.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.600
Keynote, unfortunately,
cannot be previewed here,

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.330
but can be previewed directly
within Keynote or on the iPad.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.760
Next section here.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.400
3D widget, same as the keynote,
can't be previewed there,

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.210
but the interactive image definitely can.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.460
So you get the idea.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.640
It's a WYSIWYG environment.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:50.660
You get a great sense of what your final
book is going to be like just within it,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:50.660
but previewing is the way to
go to get the full depth and

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:50.660
breadth of the experience.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.260
So now I will hit the orientation switch.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.430
And here in this view,
you can see a couple

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.140
things have happened.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.580
We've switched to the flow mode.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.340
This looks a lot like the flow
mode that we saw on the iPad.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.240
Here in the sidebar we've switched from
a thumbnail view to a text outline view.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.620
And it's down to the level of topic
or subject within the sections.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.480
So we have chapters, sections,
and then topics within those

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.220
sections kind of outlined here.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.940
So this gives you a great kind of
comprehensive view of all of your

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.190
book's content in a textual form.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.710
All right,
so now let's really create some stuff.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.640
I'm going to ask iBooks
Author for a new document.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.640
When I do that,
up comes the template chooser,

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.990
which again is a standard
element with the iWork suite.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:43.050
In it are a selection of professionally
designed and lovingly crafted templates.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.280
I'm going to choose this guy.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.920
And as that template comes forward,
you see we try and put you in a good

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.030
place for beginning your authoring.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.560
And if I want to,
if I have everything captured

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.450
in my head because I am one of
those brilliant Renaissance types,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.090
I can start typing.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.130
And in that fashion,
I can continue to build

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.720
upon my book organically,
kind of work in a very

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:30.900
[Transcript missing]

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.780
and bring in the text for
those sections of that chapter.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.440
So here I've got a pages document.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.650
Once I bring it into iBooks Author,
iBooks Author asks me,

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.420
"What template would you like for this
thing?" That will tell iBooks Author what

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.070
kind of pages to create for this stuff,
but it also tells iBooks Author what

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.520
level this content should live at.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.980
So I know that these are sections.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.670
I'm going to choose this section layout.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.920
And I want you to pay attention
to this checkbox down here.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.940
So the incoming document actually
has some paragraph styles.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.450
If you have taken the time and energy
to craft a style sheet for your document

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.880
that you want to have preserved,
you should check this box.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.940
For the purposes of this demo,
I won't do that,

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.560
since I want the text to conform
to the style of the template.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.970
But just know that you can do that,
and your paragraph styles and

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.940
formatting will be preserved.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.110
The other thing that we were
smart enough to do is maintain the

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.540
section structure of that document.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.740
So I had that document
broken into three sections,

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.000
and now I have three sections
here within iBooks Author.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.160
And I've created a run of pages
based on the text of that book.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:48.910
You'll notice that there are
some natural page breaks in here.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.250
That's because the document
that came in also made use of

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:50.250
what are known as page breaks,
or section breaks as the case may be.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.410
So here's one.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:52.600
I can reveal it by selecting it.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.290
If I delete that, you'll see the text
collapses around that.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.960
If I wanted to introduce one,
I would leave my cursor

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.500
wherever I wanted it,
and I could go Insert, Page Break.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:12.140
And you can see that content now
lives in its own page happily.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.130
That's cool.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.400
So what's the next thing
that we would want to do?

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.810
I'm going to name my book.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:21.190
I'm going to call it
My Book because I'm vain like that.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:29.500
[Transcript missing]

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.290
No, no it's not.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.080
It's muscle.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.900
Pay careful attention
to that blue outline.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.130
That is a telling thing.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.540
This lets you know that you're
dealing with something we call

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.300
the Smart Field in iBooks Author.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.450
Specifically,
it's the Section Title Smart Field,

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.060
and that Smart Field is used to
name things within your book.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.290
When you apply that
Section Title Smart Field to something,

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.820
a chapter or a section,
you can name that chapter or section,

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.700
and that name will appear in things like
the Table of Contents automatically,

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.360
which is definitely what you want.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.690
So as I commit that
change by clicking off,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.220
you can see that here in the sidebar,
the title has been updated,

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.240
and if I go to the Table of Contents,
the title has been updated there as well.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.570
And here are the three sections
that were created when we brought

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.310
in or imported that document.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.600
All right, what next?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.900
Let's start making this thing our own.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.170
I'm going to drag in...

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.820
This chapter splash image.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:31.700
I'm going to add one here
for skeleton and support.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.690
Add one finally over here for muscles.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:45.290
Actually, I want this guy to be cells,
and I want this guy to be skeletons.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.390
Alright, I know you want me to,
so I'm going to make that one muscles.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:57.040
Great, so we've customized
this book a little bit.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.100
It's starting to feel like my book
and less like a vanilla template.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.120
If I go to the table of contents now,
you can see that we took that

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.040
splash image that was used
in the chapter head page,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.460
and we've made it the background
for the table of contents view.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.940
I can override this and make
this something different,

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.500
but that's what we do by default,
and I'll show you how to

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.830
set that up in a little bit.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.340
Alright, next let's name our sections.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.800
Again, this is a smart field,
so we'll call this one

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:29.120
"Cells are the Unit of Life."

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.000
And this one's Kilton Support.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.370
All right, you'll notice that when
I double-click this,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.150
a little HUD popped up.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.260
When I triple-clicked it,
that little HUD popped up.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.640
And that HUD tells me what
level that this smart field

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.940
is currently pointing at.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.080
Right now,
it's titling the current section.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:01.530
If I wanted the chapter to
be named Skeleton Support,

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:01.530
I'd select that.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:06.900
And you can see that now it's updated
with the current title of that chapter,

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.000
which I could change.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.130
You get the idea.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.710
Remember the smart fields.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.300
You will love them and
hate them over time.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.900
And I want that change,
and we'll leave that right there.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.370
All right, let's get to the good stuff.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.810
Let's start -- well, actually,
before we get to the good stuff,

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:36.140
I'm going to point out something
else that you need to do typically,

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:41.250
which is give a style to your headings,
right, which is important for creating

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.660
some visual hierarchy on your page.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.980
So here, via the format bar,
I have a little pop-up menu

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.110
that shows me all of the defined
styles for this template.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.110
I'm going to choose Heading 1.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:49.340
Cool.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.390
There's one over here too,
and one over here as well.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.520
I'll give that the heading 1 style.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.030
Great.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.630
So I've started to differentiate
things on the page,

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.490
but I'm actually doing
a lot more than that.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.970
I'm starting to define
the document structure.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.280
If I go to the portrait view over here,
you'll see in the sidebar that

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.010
those things we just defined
with those paragraph styles

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.750
are now present in the sidebar.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.790
That's because we use special
semantic paragraph styles to

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.130
build out our table of contents.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:26.250
If at any time you want to survey
or change those paragraph styles,

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.100
you can do that here in the document tab,
sub tab TOC,

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.000
where we list all of the things that
the table of contents knows to pay

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.300
attention to when it builds itself.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.330
And we are going to leave that alone.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.250
All right,
now we get to build some cool stuff.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.730
So here I've got a two-column layout.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.690
I have a sense of what
I want to create next.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.050
It's my demo, after all.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.460
So I'm going to choose three-column
layout via this conveniently

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.930
located pop-up menu down here.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.860
So it's a little graphical menu.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.400
It allows me to choose from
the defined page layouts.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.450
So if I want to create
variants in my document,

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.570
I can do that.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.730
I don't like where this is breaking,
so I'm going to insert

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.400
another page break.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.400
Cool.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.630
Now let's bring in a
couple of visual elements.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.050
The first one I'm going to bring
in is purely ornamental in nature.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.100
has this lousy line on it.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.990
I'm going to remove that.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.960
And you can see that great
wrapping behavior that we showcase

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.520
all the time in iWork demos.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:29.590
That's cool.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:34.100
And then I've got another slightly more
fancy illustration that I've done in

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.310
something like Photoshop or Illustrator,
and I just drag that in.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.800
I'm going to turn off its ugly line, too.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:43.630
Great.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.100
That's sort of kind of nice.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.400
I need to do something to it.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.210
I think what it needs are some labels.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:56.000
To add labels to this beastie,
I can just insert a text box,

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.070
do the cell,

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.140
A little bit smaller.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.400
Drag out a copy.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.120
Tissue.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.000
Any guesses?

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.390
Nicely done.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.160
I know you know the next one too,
but I'm going to leave that

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.090
alone for just a second,
and I'll show you why.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.910
All right,
so I'm going to group that thing.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:20.640
No biggie.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.700
You've seen groups before.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.350
Come on.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:28.460
I can resize that, of course.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:28.460
These guys are all too huge.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.900
Great,
so I have a diagram that's important.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.300
I expect the student to absorb
something from this diagram.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.920
But right now, iBooks Author doesn't know
that this is a special thing,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.900
and therefore it's not
going to be interactive.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:50.280
And the way to verify that is by
clicking back to the portrait view,

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.920
and you can see in our
gutter thumbnail track,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:51.920
there are no thumbnails for that
content that we've just created.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.800
Charles, you ask,
"Why is that so?" I'll tell you.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.000
It's so because the way in which
you tell iBooks Author that this

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.060
is a special image element is
you give it a title or a caption.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.080
Textbooks are full of illustrations.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:13.840
Most of them have at least a caption to
tell you what content is in the frame,

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.360
and that's why we
applied that logic here.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:21.470
So here, I've turned on the title and the
caption for this illustration.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.510
I have a selection of layouts,
default-defined layouts

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.330
that I can choose from.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.030
I'm gonna choose bottom for this guy.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.450
I'm also gonna turn on a label.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.340
Let's call that a figure.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.680
Okay,
that looks like something meaningful,

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.560
and iBooks Author agrees.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.300
Here it is.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.300
It's in kind of a funny place, though.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:43.080
I sort of want it up here,
or at least here, and it's not.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.450
How do I control where it lives
in the portrait flow mode?

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:49.800
I can do one of two things.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.090
I can simply, you know, translate it up,
just offset its position,

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.190
drag it to where I need it,
but that's cheating.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.970
What I really should do
is anchor this to text.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.310
If I go here to the object placement,
it's actually the wrap tab.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.460
You can't tell that because
there's no label here.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.580
And here in the object
placement settings,

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.110
I have it currently set to floating.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.470
If I switch this to anchored,
I'll see this little blue dot

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.140
appear somewhere in the text.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:25.290
So now this is the text that this
image will forever be associated with

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:25.290
until I drag it to a new location.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.770
What we did with this in
the design of the system,

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.730
one of the tenets of the design was
make sure the content adapts smartly

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.400
to changes whenever those changes
may occur in your creative process.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.420
So I'll show you an example of
how anchoring helps you do that.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.310
I'm just going to copy
this block of text,

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.200
or I can just actually pound
out some carriage returns.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.870
So I'm pounding out my carriage returns,
and the text is going down

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.660
and down and down and down.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.090
Watch what happens when life
as chemistry leaves the frame,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.080
or leaves the page.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.960
That image went with it.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.310
And if we go over here,
we can see that this

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.940
is the text's new home.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.900
The image has maintained its
layout relative position.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:12.010
So it's still appearing
in the same place,

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:12.010
but living on the page with the
text that it is anchored to.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.700
So in that way, you're able to make
changes late in the game,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.210
make changes upstream in your text flow,
and those changes will

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.500
ripple through smartly.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.240
One other thing to remember about
that behavior is it always ends

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.720
at your current section level.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.080
So you'll never ripple
beyond your current section.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.240
You'll only make -- you'll only
have effect within the section

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.950
that you made that change in.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.460
All right, cool.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.840
That's anchoring.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.210
Let's get rid of that guy.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.860
Put our paragraph style
back for this one.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.460
No, that's not what I wanted.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.080
That's what I wanted.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.790
All right, what do we got next?

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.960
Well, for some of the media types,
we actually know that they're

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.110
special kind of straightaway,
so we don't bother you with having

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.500
to give them a title or a caption.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.530
I need some wrapping behavior here,
so I'm going to delete that guy, too.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.700
with no effect.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.340
Thanks, Charles.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.820
You're welcome, Charles.

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:23.140
So I drag in this movie,
and it comes pre-wrapped in a frame.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:26.700
So I don't need to do
anything special to a movie.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.020
This layout sucks for that movie,
so we'll switch it to two column.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.080
That is much happier.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.370
All right, so this movie has come in.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.720
It's got its title and label lockup.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.040
It's got its caption.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:42.290
I can go ahead and name this thing,
Cellular Vision.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.260
And it's got this label here.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.220
That's cool.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.260
Well, someone in my branding or
marketing department wants a

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.800
bit more of an energetic name,
let's say.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.260
So they want me to change this
label to something custom.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.460
They want it to read
"Biocinema." In order to do that,

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.660
I go over here to the widget tab again,
and beneath title,

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.970
when I pop that label menu,
I see all of the predefined

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.680
labels I can choose from.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.950
If I select "Edit Label
Styles," I can make my own.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.840
So I'll hit plus.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.430
I'll call this Bio Cinema.

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.670
That sounds marketing cool.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.760
"I'm going to create it.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.760
I can choose a label format.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.750
I actually want the section

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.340
So we'll leave that alone.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.240
I'll hit done.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.260
We weren't smart enough to apply it,
but I can apply it there.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.380
Now I have BioCinema 1.1.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.860
Okay, that's kind of cool.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.900
It gets better.

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:39.730
All right, something, something,
something, something.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.130
as seen in -- The next thing I'm
going to show you is something

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:45.530
called a figure reference link.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.370
If you want to refer back to an
image that's somewhere in your

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.450
book from a location within text,
you can do that by creating

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.330
a figure reference link.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.360
And you create those over
here in the hyperlink tab.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.590
So I have a cursor position.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.900
I'm going to select enable as hyperlink.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.920
If I had a text range selected
and I hit that checkbox,

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.060
that text would become the link itself.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.450
But if nothing is selected,
we provide one for you.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.930
I'm going to point at that movie.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:17.000
It correctly refers to
it as bio cinema 1.1.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.820
That's pretty cool,
but the fun does not stop there.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.130
Let me bring in a second movie.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:29.800
Sir Paul Nurse, exuding brilliance.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.090
Great.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.360
So it's come in with that new
label style that we created,

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.980
and it's come in properly incremented.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.100
But as I mentioned before,
we wanted the system to be

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.360
as adaptive as possible.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.120
We want you to make changes
whenever you want to.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.780
That includes being smart about the
relative position and ordering of things.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.700
So if I take Sir Paul Nurse and I put
him over here in front of the biocinema,

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.370
the cellular division video,
you'll see that the

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.060
numbers have exchanged.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.800
And also the figure reference
link down here has been updated to

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.420
correctly match the movie it refers to.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.920
So that's what we... Thank you.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.200
So that's what we mean
by an adaptive system.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.580
All right, you'll remember that this guy,
Sir Paul Nurse, let's not forget,

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.540
was represented by an image
of himself within iBooks.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.940
So let's show you how to do that.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.960
You should note a couple of things
about this widget's configuration.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.440
I can set the poster frame here.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.660
I can dial one in.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.960
I can set a looping option
for this movie if I desire.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.460
I'm going to leave it alone.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.860
And up here at the top,
I have a full-screen-only checkbox.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:40.100
When I check that,
iBooks Author turns the content into

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:45.460
a thumbnail for me based on the frame
that I defined as my poster frame.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.840
But I don't want that image.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.290
It's a rather unfortunate
image of Sir Paul Nurse,

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:51.000
anyway.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.680
I'm just going to drag in
a replacement thumbnail.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.190
Cool.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:04.290
Now that title and caption
aren't in a happy place,

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.400
I'm going to change my
layout to free form,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.190
and then get there somewhere
where it makes more sense.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.500
It's tedious, I know, bear with me.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.500
And then drag that out so it feels
like something a little bit better.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.500
Great, there's Sir Paul Nurse.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.140
Great.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.640
Now finally, I think we don't have enough
text for one new page,

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:54.700
so I'm just going to go ahead
and create a blank page.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.850
I'm going to bring in the Keynote widget,
and I'm in finally for this section.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.120
So after a brief kind
of transcoding process,

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:18.240
Keynote actually fires up in the
background to make a lightweight,

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:18.240
portable version of
that Keynote directory,

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:18.240
of that Keynote presentation.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.670
It will behave just like
the keynote presentation you

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.840
created when you created it.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.360
I'm going to make it
really large on the page,

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.900
too, because one thing that not a lot
of people know is if you make

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:33.010
something very big on the page,
big enough that it approaches

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.630
kind of full-screen size,
it will restrict you from

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.140
actually going to full screen.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.600
So things will kind of only
remain interactive on the page,

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.600
and they won't go to full screen.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.600
They're still present and can
be called upon when you're

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.900
in the portrait flow mode,
but they won't be there.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.700
Oh, I'm also going to do the
same thing for a gallery.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.660
I'm short on text,
and I have no idea why.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.270
So to create a gallery,
you could do the boring

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.290
thing of going widgets,
gallery, insert it.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:06.130
Or you can do the cool thing of
just dragging in a set of images,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.900
and you create a gallery automatically.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.180
If you need to remask something, you can.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.820
I'm going to scale this
up so it too is large.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.340
I'm going to choose a
better layout for this guy,

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.850
the default layout for this view.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.490
Same rules apply here.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.220
This gallery probably won't go
full screen because it's big

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.670
enough to break that threshold,
and will just remain on the page.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.250
Cool.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.420
On to the next section.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:44.600
So for 3D, just like the other elements,
you drag in the 3D element.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:51.640
This 3D model is in the Collada format,
which is in a file format that is open

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:58.180
source and widely known and widely
written to by all the 3D authoring

00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:58.180
packages that you know and love.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:12.800
[Transcript missing]

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.660
Next up, let's do the interactive image.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.150
Now with it, I definitely have to go
to the widgets popover.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.860
I'll choose interactive image.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.870
Give myself sufficient
area to kind of work with.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.210
Alright, so as that image settles in,
you'll see that we provided

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.100
two call-outs for you to work
with kind of straight away,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.700
since we're nice like that.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:51.460
This guy is, no, the collateral ligament.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.900
So we kind of zoomed in.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.830
You can see that that callout
had a zoom setting by default.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.500
If I want to change that, I can.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.290
I've got a little heads-up display here.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.530
I'm going to zoom it up,
get a tighter shot of

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.720
the collateral ligament,
and then hit this set view button.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.080
The set view button is your friend.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.260
You don't want to forget
to hit that button,

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:19.970
or you'll be very frustrated
by the experience.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.400
Next, we'll work on this call-out,
which again has a Zoom setting.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.200
We'll make this one patella.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:33.020
It's not a tiny bit.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.240
You'll notice there's something
going on here with the background.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.930
My image ends here,
and the background for this view

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.180
is kind of a subtle gray gradient.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.370
If I want to get rid of that,
I can do that.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:53.100
Here in the Graphics tab, we can edit,

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.500
The graphic settings for this view.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.890
So right now it's set to gradient fill.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.840
I can make that a color fill.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.390
I can make that transparent if I want.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.650
said it to White,
so now when we go to Patella,

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.240
what did I forget to do?

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.950
Set the view.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.470
God, you'd think the designer would know.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.960
Very annoying.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:15.250
Great.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:16.800
So the view is now set.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.440
We've got a nice,
harmonious background happening.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:26.520
Finally,
we'll add one more callout using that

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:26.520
handy-dandy plus button on the HUD.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:35.800
And this guy we'll label Niscus.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:41.960
Set the view, and we're done.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.180
So you can see the interactive
image is powerful for creating

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.640
the annotated diagrams,
but it has a couple of configuration

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.030
options that give it extra life.

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:56.440
And if you vary these within your book,
it's for great interactive effect.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.040
So let me show you a couple
of those options right now.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.230
Up top you can see we have the
show transport controls checkbox.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.160
So if I wanted a kind of
a guided path structure,

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:10.080
I wanted to lead the user through a
bunch of set landmarks within my image,

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.780
I could do that by enabling
the transport controls.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.220
So if I have this large sweeping
panorama that I want to use as the basis,

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.310
I could do that.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.210
Next up we have the sidebar option.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:32.190
So if this interactive image
were more horizontal in nature,

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.190
let's just make it quickly
more horizontal in nature.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.530
I could have show
descriptions in sidebar,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.020
and then now when I activate
one of the callouts,

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:42.740
you can see that there's an area
left reserved for the actual

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.080
description of this feature.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.440
Let's put that back there.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.770
Cool.

00:43:55.810 --> 00:44:01.360
All right, so next up,
let us do the HTML widget.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:11.480
The thing to know about the HTML widget
is it's HTML5 as you know and love it,

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:11.480
but it needs to be wrapped
as a dash code widget,

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:11.480
which is easy enough to do.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.980
As I mentioned,
they're not interactive on the page,

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.210
but you can actually
preview the HTML here.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:22.960
So we have an unfortunately named
edit HTML button here in this HUD.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.450
Unfortunately named since you can't
actually edit the HTML in here.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.260
You can, however, preview it.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.250
And you can click on it here.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:36.080
and see exactly what
we saw within iBooks,

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:36.760
and that's great.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:40.060
So this view is the dedicated
full-screen only view which allows

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.890
you to see the content that will be
live in full screen within iBooks.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.240
And lastly here,
I'm going to create a review widget.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.910
To do that, I insert one.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.910
We have

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:05.190
A multiple choice question provided
by default for your editing pleasure.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.380
No, no, no, let's make it, no,
let's make it not.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.660
All right, so if there are more than one
correct answer that applies here,

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.380
I can hold down the command
button and select all that apply.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.520
If I need to change the number of
available answers for the end user,

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.820
I can do that via this menu
here in the widget tab.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.050
I'm going to go ahead
and set that to three.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:45.280
I want to do that change
because I actually want four.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.840
And since this question
has a metaphysical bent,

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.310
I'm going to go ahead
and select that guy too.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.900
When I want to add a new question,
I do that via this popover menu here.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.190
I'm going to select the visual
multiple choice question.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.900
And just use the images
that we had in our gallery.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:12.890
That guy, and that guy, this guy,
and this guy, and ask the question.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:31.970
I'm going to say this guy because
it's a virus that's way scary.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:31.970
If I want to reframe this,
I can simply resize this.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:33.400
There you go.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.620
Get it exactly where I want
it and leave it alone.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.080
And that's my question.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.670
Let's add one more question type quickly,
and then I'm going to show you some

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:42.800
tips around working with layouts.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.320
So the last question I'm going to
do is the drag label to target.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:51.150
Audience participation is expected here
because I told you there would be a quiz.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.880
And here's the quiz.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:57.000
So to do that,
we're going to need this knee.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.920
What is this feature of the human knee?

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:07.660
Anyone?

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.890
Collateral ligament.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:12.900
That's correct.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:17.840
And this?

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.760
Patella.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.320
Awesome.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.520
This is a smart crowd.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.770
What do I need to do with this guy?

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:27.880
I'm going to zoom him up a tight bit.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.900
I'll give myself some room to work.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.300
Edit Mask allows me to edit
the constraints of that mask.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:44.540
So if I hit Edit Mask,
you'll see that that image becomes open

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.940
to panning and scaling within that view.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.540
When I hit Edit Mask for any
masked image within the system,

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.540
it's a slightly different effect.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:56.320
I can toggle between editing
the perimeter of the mask or

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.970
editing the image itself directly.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.770
Probably more of an
answer than you wanted,

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:08.400
but you know,
I don't want to be complete.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.360
And then I'll add a third one here,
and this last one.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.310
Nice job.

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:18.900
And we're done.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.920
We've successfully recreated the
content that we saw within iBooks.

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.820
That's great.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.590
Why did it go so smoothly?

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:27.610
Couple of answers.

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:33.000
First, I'm the designer on the product,
and I'm very familiar

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:33.000
with the demo content.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.160
But more importantly, we had a game plan,
right?

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.400
Like, we came in knowing what
template we wanted to use.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.780
We had the text for our chapter
pre-built in a document.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.720
We flowed that document
into our template.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.150
It created pages for us.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:47.820
And then we had all of our assets for the
interactive content kind of ready to go.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:51.280
So we were able to populate things very,
very quickly.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.920
Key to all of that working
well for you is the template.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.210
If you want, you can use the templates
that we've provided,

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:00.440
and you can't go wrong,
but you're not going to differentiate

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.860
yourself very much from the other
books that have used that template

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.380
that you'll find in the iBookstore.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.970
So how do you customize these things
and kind of make them your own?

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.460
Well, first, what is a template?

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.560
A template is the following.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.240
It's a selection of layouts,
and it's a style sheet for your document,

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:21.030
a paragraph style sheet and
a character style sheet.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.270
And it is a set of object style
attributes all collected in one place.

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:29.810
If you want to see your style sheet,
your paragraph style sheet,

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.450
you can hit this little button
in the format bar or go view,

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.630
show styles drawer, and out it will pop.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.620
I'm going to turn off these guys.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:41.100
Now, these are all the paragraph
styles that you saw me use

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.370
earlier in the other pop-up menu.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.870
If I want to see my layouts,
I can go to that View menu

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:51.650
again and hit Show Layouts,
or I can just grab this little

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:55.670
bar and split it down and reveal
the layouts for this book.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:02.120
So here I have, I can see that I have two
layouts defined for my chapters,

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:07.000
five layouts defined for section,
and a number of individual page layouts.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.450
The first difference between
the page layouts and the

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.000
chapter and section layouts,
well, it's probably obvious enough,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.880
the chapter and section ones have
two pages associated with them.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.580
The first is the head page,
so whenever you introduce

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.700
a new chapter or a section,
that is the thing that you'll see

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.960
that identifies the incoming chapter.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.440
The second is the default body page,
which is the page that gets

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.000
used to create pages when you
flow in text into your document.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.550
You can override that at any time,
but this is the standard page

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:37.890
that will be used when you
create a chapter or a section.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.540
So if I want this to be splashier,
this looks great in all, Apple,

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.980
thank you very much,
but I want it to have more presence.

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:47.080
What can I do?

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.220
Well, I can go to that layout.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:57.670
I know it's this layout because
it has the checkbox beside it,

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.670
and say, "Okay, bigger is better."

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.600
So a couple things happened here.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.940
Well,
this is not in a happy place just yet.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:09.470
I knocked away that text that was beneath
it because my image wrap is enabled.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.730
I can defeat it by pushing that image
all the way into the background.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:19.880
So the Z-ordering affects
the way things are -- the way

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:19.880
text is wrapped in the system.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:19.880
Just FYI.

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:26.090
I can then select these text boxes,
go to the text inspector,

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:27.310
and choose a new color.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.600
I'm going to make these all
white so I can see them.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.160
I'm going to do the same
thing for this line.

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:41.840
All right, we've got something that
looks a little bit different.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.010
It's got more presence.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.760
It's making good use of that imagery.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:48.040
To see its effect,
I can hit the Supply Changes button,

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.710
which appears any time
I change the layout.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.520
And you can see that those changes
have been inherited by the page

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.190
that was using this layout.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:52:00.230
So it's just that easy to make
sweeping changes in your document.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:03.200
If I'd made overrides on this page,
I'd edit things locally,

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:09.150
change the size of the image,
change the size of the text boxes,

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:12.320
it would have left those things alone
and only pushed changes through to

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.120
those elements I hadn't touched.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:18.870
If at any point I decide that I want
the thing to inherit all the changes,

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:20.760
I'll just undo what I did.

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:24.700
And via this contextual menu,
I can select Reapply Layout to Chapter.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:30.290
And this will reset everything to
conform to what's defined in the layout.

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:32.630
So that's our chapter
layout which we edited.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.870
Let's take a look at our section layout.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.990
Alright, this is our section head page.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.730
This is the layout that's being used.

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:42.680
Another thing you need to know
about layouts is that for every

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:46.660
layout that exists in landscape,
there is a companion layout

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.490
in the portrait universe.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:52.130
We switch over to the portrait world,
we can see that layout right here.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:56.290
This one doesn't really feel like the
one we just left in the landscape world.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:00.480
For example, it's not making use of that
imagery that we saw on the page.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:05.590
If you want the portrait layout to share
elements with the landscape layout,

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:07.980
you can do that very easily.

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:12.000
So if I switch back to landscape,
and then in my inspector,

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.990
go to the layout tab,
I can see the attributes for any of

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:18.230
the layout elements that I select.

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:22.640
So here I have the section
image layout object.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.330
It's flagged as editable
on pages using this layout.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.360
What does that mean?

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:27.490
It's obvious enough.

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:30.240
If I uncheck this box
and hit apply changes,

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.360
I can no longer affect
this thing on that page.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.400
I can't select it, I can't edit it,
I can't do anything to it,

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:39.630
which is great when you're creating
elements like this page number that you

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.970
really don't want to select mistakenly.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:45.400
You don't want things to move
around or shift as you're

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.560
pouring content into your book.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.050
In this case,
we do want that thing to update,

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:51.790
so we're going to undo what I did.

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:56.940
So editable on pages using this layout,
and then the second checkbox,

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.180
shared with portrait layout,
will do the obvious thing.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:03.750
It will now make this element,
once I apply changes,

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.120
available to the portrait layout.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:07.080
There it is.

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:09.970
I can push it to the background,
reveal the text,

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:17.910
and do the same process that we just
went through for the chapter head.

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:22.570
Apply Changes.

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.640
Now when we look at our sections,
you can see that they've

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:27.410
inherited that new heading style.

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:30.260
A couple of other things to
note in your portrait layouts.

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:34.190
You have this little blue splitter bar,
which basically determines the

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.300
proportion of head region to body
flow region in your template.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.260
And the head region here, of course,
corresponds to the head

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.090
page in Landscape Land,
and the body region, of course,

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:47.230
corresponds to the body page layout.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:50.790
Some of the things that people
don't really know you can

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:52.860
do with the portrait layout.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:57.220
If you have designed a template that
you're going to use for a portion of

00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:02.310
your book that doesn't have any imagery,
you can turn off the thumbnail track.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.880
And you can do that right here.

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:05.400
So there's a show thumbnail track.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:08.650
If I disable that,
you can see now my column of text

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:10.980
goes full width across the view.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.320
I'm going to leave that enabled.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.700
The other thing that you can do
that's important to know is that you

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:21.440
can change the numbering style for
any section or chapter in your book.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:25.770
So here underneath the numbering tab,
if I wanted to,

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.220
I could set this to none,
and when I set this to none,

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.140
none of my sections are going
to be numbered in my book.

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.800
And if I switch over to the
portrait table of contents view,

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:39.290
I didn't even show you guys this
way important stuff up here.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:42.000
Somebody remind me to do that.

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:48.370
Table of contents,
if I expand things in place now,

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:48.370
you can see that these
sections don't have numbers.

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:54.340
But if I set that back
to relative to chapter,

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.880
you can see that they
will in fact have numbers.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.370
There you go.

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:01.590
All right,
now we should see the right thing.

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:02.500
There we go.

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:06.500
Know that section number, dot,
Roman numeral, section number.

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.420
That all makes sense.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:10.420
Kind of.

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:12.700
Great.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.090
So when all is said and done,
we've got our book just

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.030
the way you want it.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:19.450
You're going to need to preview it,
so let's go and preview our masterpiece

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:21.940
right now for completeness' sake.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.200
To do the previewing,
you simply have to connect an iPad

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.380
physically using the sync cable.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:27.760
Cool.

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:30.120
Actually, before I do that,
nobody reminded me,

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.040
but I'm going to show you this anyway.

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.230
There are some special nodes up here in
the sidebar that you should know about.

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:36.840
First is your book cover.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:42.250
It's labeled by your book title,
but here's where you will customize and

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:46.580
create the cover that will be shown in
the iBookstore when you're selling it,

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.380
and will be shown on the bookshelf
after someone has bought it.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:54.130
Here's the intramedia slot where
you can drag in a piece of video

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:59.740
or a static image to represent your
book brand as the interior cover.

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.600
This is the table of
contents view for landscape.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.260
You saw the one for portrait.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.960
Here's where you can style things
and create a kind of custom

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.930
table of contents experience.

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.540
A quick example of that,
I won't go into any too

00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:18.370
great a detail here,
but if I wanted to center these things.

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.090
This guy is not visible.

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.600
I could do that.

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:31.670
Also, I can customize the
backsplash and do... Actually,

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.670
I should have left that white.

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.670
Shouldn't I have?

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.670
Yes, I should have.

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:36.610
Easy enough to do, right?

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:39.630
And then finally,
you have your glossary view.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:55.400
[Transcript missing]

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.390
So I can enable that
here in the View button.

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.410
You can see that in this text field,
it's pre-populated with the

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:02.790
word that I've selected.

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:04.890
I can hit Add Term.

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:06.810
And now when I go to the glossary view,
you can see that that

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:07.900
term has been added here.

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.740
You can do a lot of great stuff here.

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:14.300
You can add imagery to support
your definitions for glossary term.

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.810
You can drag-and-drop to
create cross-relationships

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.740
between terms to this area.

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:23.520
And you can also create a
number of different index points

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:23.800
for any given glossary term.

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:28.100
And I apologize,
I didn't show that to you earlier.

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.490
So in order to preview it,
I connect the iPad,

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:34.000
I make sure iBooks is in the foreground,
I hit the preview button.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.420
It will take just a moment
to prepare the preview.

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:49.720
So once the preview is prepared
on iBooks Author's side,

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:54.840
it pushes over the content to iBooks.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.310
You can see it's updating there.

00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.560
Here's our book cover.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:04.580
We've opened to the same page that we've
left focused here in iBooks Author.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:17.100
[Transcript missing]

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:25.240
So hopefully you've come away
with the impression that you

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.400
can create your own books,
and that's exactly the impression

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.370
we want to leave you with.

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.820
And I didn't advance
through these slides.

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.300
I'm going to bypass this stuff.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.440
So if you know the iWorks suite of tools,
you know iBooks Author,

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.180
you can get ready,
you can use it straight away.

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.200
Templates are your friend.

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.200
You can customize them.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.680
If they don't give you
everything you need,

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.780
you can create your own templates really,
really easily.

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.960
Here are a bunch of points that
I won't bother going through right now.

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.510
But for the friends at home,
when you freeze frame the

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:57.090
video from this session,
here are all the special tips

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.720
and tricks that I touched on.

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:08.650
For more information,
these are some valuable sources.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:08.650
Please take your snapshot.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:08.650
Allow this to absorb in your brain.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.680

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.630
