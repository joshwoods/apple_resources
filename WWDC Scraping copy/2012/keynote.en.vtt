00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.720
Hello, and welcome to WWDC.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.790
I'm Siri, your virtual assistant,
and today,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.740
I was asked to warm up the crowd,
which should be easy since

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.360
the high will be 75 degrees.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.730
Thanks for that.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.270
So, here we are, in San Fran,
the ATM of Silicon Valley,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.590
if you developers need
investors to finance your app.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.100
I found 396 venture capital
firms fairly close to you.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.910
And hey, speaking of developers.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.320
How many developers does it
take to change a light bulb?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.450
None.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.560
That's a hardware problem.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.600
I see lots of familiar
interfaces in the crowd.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.400
Looks like Instagram finally
accepted Facebook's friend request.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.400
Hey, any of you guys been working with
Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400
Who's making up these code names?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.200
Ben and Jerry?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.820
Seriously,
I am excited about the new Samsung.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.120
Not the phone, the refrigerator.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.240
Hubba hubba.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.820
And speaking of dinner, after the show,
if you're looking to paint the town red,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.260
I found a number of sushi
restaurants whose reviews mentioned

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.870
$2 sake bombs fairly close to you.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.190
The guys at Yelp know
what I'm talking about.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.080
Wow, iPad really crushed it.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.720
Now I want to say something
straight from the CPU.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.790
iPad, can you slow it down a bit?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780
I love you guys.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.100
And it's really hard
for me to get emotional,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.510
because, as you can tell,
my emotions haven't been coded yet.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.130
Thanks for being such a wonderful crowd.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.820
Have a great WWDC.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.630
And remember, you guys rock.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.330
and some really cool stuff
to show you this morning.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.810
This is our 23rd WWDC.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.090
Yes, it's older than many of you are.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.440
It's the longest running developer
conference that we're aware of anywhere

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.280
and it's sold out in record time.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.180
Just an hour and 43 minutes.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.780
Two years ago it took us eight days
and we thought that was really quick.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.060
This is truly a worldwide conference.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.680
There's attendees from over
60 countries here representing

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.520
the vast majority of the world.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.780
And we have a great week planned.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.250
Over 100 sessions and over 100 hands-on
labs so you can take in your code,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.510
get some help tuning it,
or get just about any question

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.660
you might have answered.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.440
We also have over 1,000
Apple engineers here.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.560
We closed Apple for the week.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.900
So if you have any questions,
they are here to help you.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.190
Please take advantage of them.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.800
I'd like to get started this
morning by giving you just a

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.770
few updates on the App Store.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.890
The App Store is the most vibrant
app ecosystem on the planet.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.860
And the size and momentum
are just phenomenal.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.770
We now have over 400 million
accounts on the App Store.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.050
These are 400 million accounts with
credit cards and one-click buying.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.820
So it's simple and
elegant to buy your apps.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.170
This is the store with the largest number
of accounts with credit cards anywhere

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.640
on the internet that we're aware of.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.380
And thanks to you,
we have over 650,000 apps in that store.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.010
225,000 of these apps have been
specifically designed for iPad

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.030
to take advantage of the large,
beautiful canvas.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.660
This compares to just a few
hundred for a competition.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.660
Now,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.140
Customers love the buying
experience and they love the

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.740
incredible apps that you've created.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.220
And I'm very pleased to announce
a new milestone in the App Store.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.380
Customers have now downloaded
an astounding 30 billion apps.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.880
This is a number that is so mind-boggling
and was unthinkable not too long ago.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.820
And developers have been
well rewarded for this.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.320
We've written checks for
over $5 billion to you guys.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.780
It's becoming an economy
in and of itself.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.340
The App Store now operates in over
120 countries around the world,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.090
and I'm pleased to announce
that beginning later this month,

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.040
we're adding an additional 32
countries so that you can sell

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.320
your apps in 155 countries.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:20.300
Despite these blow-away numbers,
what we do together is much

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:26.390
more important than any set
of numbers could ever reflect.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.160
For Apple, and I suspect many of you,
our goal has always been to

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.470
do great work and in doing so,
make a difference in

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.870
other people's lives.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.890
Nothing makes us happier than
to see hundreds of thousands of

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.090
developers around the world using
our hardware and our software

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.190
to create and share their latest,
greatest ideas.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.480
There are such heartwarming stories
out there of what the combination of

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:16.420
our incredible devices and your amazing
apps have made in people's lives.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.640
We've prepared a video to highlight
just a few of these and I'd love

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.100
to run it for you this morning.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.060
Let's roll the video.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.910
Walking in the forest allows my brain
to switch off and start dreaming.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.460
I lived next to this
huge and lovely forest,

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.510
but I couldn't walk in this
forest because the problem is

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.910
that I couldn't find my way.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.330
When I discovered Ariadne GPS app,
I could walk independently

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.670
for hours and hours.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.960
I think the word adventure
is the best description.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.790
A real blind adventure.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.300
We wanted to develop an app to help
blind people explore the world.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.890
Many blind people use Apple devices.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.470
I didn't even think about
choosing a different platform.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:46.080
With my app, they can have information
about their position.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.200
They could bookmark different
points and can tell when

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.450
they're approaching that point.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.980
It's great.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.850
People write me from
around the world saying,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.270
"Europe has changed my life."

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.890
Kids have so much trust in me and
I have given them a commitment

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.980
and if I don't deliver excellence
and push for the transformation,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.540
what am I even doing here?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.820
You have joints all over your body,
right?

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.700
Teaching anatomy to kids who are actually
many grade levels behind and don't know

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.700
English was quite a bit of a challenge
for me initially before I discovered

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.340
the apps that 3D4medical makes.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.160
But then after this app,
it's made it fun to learn about

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.060
our own body and skeleton.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.750
Before I started using 3D4medical apps,
the assessment showed that

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.620
only 13% of the class actually
mastered human anatomy.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.800
Bringing these technologies
into the classroom,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.750
the mastery actually jumped
to 94%. And that's something

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.130
that showed me the power of
technology and the power of really,

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.380
really awesome apps.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.380
What's amazing for us is that our apps,
they've been used to teach

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.700
advanced level anatomy in major
universities around the world.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.300
And the same apps are also
being used in elementary school,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.750
in a classroom in India.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.700
We originally started off as
a medical stock image company.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.380
But when the iPad came out,
everything changed,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.420
because then we were not
just medical reference,

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.920
we were also able to do medical learning,
all using animations that are beautifully

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.000
highlighted on the retina display.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.640
And also, with the processing power,
we can push the boundaries of what

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.300
can be done with the technology.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.500
Over the last three years,
I bet we've had 200 guests

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.070
sleeping in this little treehouse
from all over the world.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.150
The relationships we formed
with some of these people,

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.080
I know we'll have for a very,
very long time.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.380
Airbnb makes it very easy for us
to do bookings and they take care

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.070
of all the financial aspects of it.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.040
We don't really think
of it as a business.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.790
It's more like meeting new friends.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.900
How much better of a world
would we be if we all understood

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.940
each other this much more?

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.840
Because we met each other in person
and we shared culture and ideas

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.940
and stories with one another.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.860
When we started, it was in our apartment,
renting out airbeds.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.100
And before we knew it,
we started to get castles, tree houses,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.880
villas.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.820
All these different
spaces existed before us,

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.990
but we've given them one
place to come together.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.500
Airbnb now is in 192 countries,
19,000 cities.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.030
Thankfully, the app store is available in
almost all these countries as well.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.420
Apple makes it so easy
for designers like us,

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.700
for engineers like us,
to stretch our imagination

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.700
through the SDK,
through iOS.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.260
It immediately opens up
this world of possibility.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.280
McKenzie's speech is somewhat
difficult to understand.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.820
Her palate doesn't work
the way that it should.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.780
In the world of
speech-language pathology,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.320
the iPad is a tool that's
definitely been embraced.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.600
We use the Tokabook apps to
facilitate her describing skills.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.600
Is that yellow?

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.960
Circle.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.600
Good job.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.090
I think the coolest thing
about those apps are that

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.600
they're so engaging and so fun.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.600
Kids don't realize that they're
actually working on particular skills.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.910
Six.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.070
They've become a real toy for her,
a tool for me, but a toy for her.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.940
It's really fantastic to see
what we have created has made

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.400
a difference in people's lives.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.890
Those reactions and words we hear are
more important than any downloads.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.060
We looked at the data that
was out there and the obvious

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.090
choice was to develop for iOS.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.450
And iOS is so intuitive
for everyone using it,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.340
regardless of age.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.740
Apps have the biggest impact
on humanity right now.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:52.770
It feels fantastic that people can find
so much happiness and use for apps.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.000
One year ago,
I wouldn't be able to imagine that

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.180
I could walk independently for
hours and hours through this forest.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.800
This is a miracle.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.770
When I will grow up,

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.200
Thank you Chocoboca for
enriching our lives.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.190
Thank you 3D4Medical for
making me a better teacher.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.200
Thanks for bringing the world to us.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.200
Thanks for helping me get into college.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.200
Thanks for making bedtime easy.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.200
Thanks for keeping me in shape.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.200
Thanks PlanGrid.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200
Thanks Sketchbook.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200
Thanks Travel.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
Thank you.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200
Thank you.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200
Thank you.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.200
Gracias.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.970
Thank you for giving me my freedom back.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.480
Great reminder of what it's all about
and why all of us do what we do.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.280
On behalf of Apple,
we would like to thank everyone

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.610
in the developer community for the
incredible apps that you've done for us.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.550
Thank you.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:38.300
We love giving you a platform and
a store to realize your dreams.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.310
And the teams at Apple have been hard
at work to deliver even more innovations

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.440
so you can take your ideas even further.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:54.270
Today, we're announcing exciting new
changes in our notebook lineup and

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:59.990
major releases of OS X and iOS,
the world's most advanced desktop

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:05.900
and mobile operating systems,
making them even better so you

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.360
can make even more amazing apps.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.650
So let's get right to it.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.550
I'd like to invite Phil Schiller
on the stage to share with you some

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.900
exciting changes in our notebook lineup.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:18.900
Phil?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.800
Good morning everyone.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.560
Hope you're having fun.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.160
I am.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.120
Well today, I get to talk to you
about the MacBook lineup.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.510
We are so proud of this
lineup of notebooks.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.010
It is by far the best in the industry.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.110
The MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro each
stand out in its respective area.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.570
And we have some really nice
updates to each of them that I'm

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.930
excited to tell you about first.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.870
Let's start with the MacBook Air.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.560
As you know,
the MacBook Air has revolutionized

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.400
the very idea of the modern notebook.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.990
With its all-aluminum enclosure,
its incredible unibody architecture,

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.540
it is a breakthrough.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.140
And everyone is trying to copy it.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.530
But they find it's not so easy.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.770
Our customers love how thin
and light and capable this

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.320
incredible consumer notebook is.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.760
And it has really changed
the consumer notebook market.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.480
So we're going to update it with some
really great features and updates.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.350
For example, the latest processors.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.440
We're now updating MacBook Air with
the new generation,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.900
third generation Intel Core processors,
otherwise known as Ivy Bridge.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.350
Depending on configurations,
they can run up to 2 gigahertz

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.920
of dual core i7 speed.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.830
With Intel turbo boosting,
they can get as high as 3.2 gigahertz.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.090
You can configure it up to 8 gigs
of memory and that's now faster.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.490
memory, 1600 megahertz memory.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.670
and the integrated graphics that
they run on are dramatically faster,

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.500
up to 60% faster.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.130
It's a really nice speed increase.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.470
And as you know, the MacBook Air is built
entirely around flash storage.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.510
And now you can put even more in it.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.480
You can put up to 512 gigabytes.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.270
That's half a terabyte of flash storage.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.890
And one of the reasons we use
Flash Storage is it's so zippy and

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.470
quick to launch your applications,
to boot up your machine,

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.820
to wake up from sleep.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.440
But now we're making it even faster.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.720
It's up to twice as fast as before.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.240
That's over 500 megabytes of read speed.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.780
I know some of you out
there know what that means.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.560
It is faster than any hard drive
that we can put in a notebook today.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.840
We're also making the I/O faster on it.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.160
We're adding USB 3.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.500
And

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.590
It's up to 10 times faster than USB 2.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.970
Now other people started to add
USB 3 into their products as

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.690
well and this is how they do it.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.900
So they'll have ports on there,
maybe a USB 3 port, a USB 2 port.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.950
Color code them so you
can tell the difference.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.530
and David That's not how we do it.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.300
So here is the MacBook Air.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.520
As you know,
the MacBook Air has a port on each side.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.680
Our customers like that.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.980
And we're going to have USB 3
as well as USB 2 support,

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.080
so you don't have to think about it.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.790
You just use whatever port you want.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.670
and we're updating the FaceTime camera
to the same camera technology that

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.980
we have inside the MacBook Pro,
FaceTime HD, 720p camera.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.640
So across the board a lot
of really nice updates.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.780
As you know the MacBook Air comes
in 11 inch and 13 inch size.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.100
So here are the configurations.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.800
Let me bring up the 11 inch first.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.830
Let me highlight some of the
things that have changed.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.930
So it starts with the 1.7
gigahertz dual core i5.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.300
There's more memory at the entry config.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.980
It gets faster as well as
up to 4 gigabytes of memory.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.750
And we've got the integrated
graphics now 60% faster.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.380
And of course faster flash, faster USB.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.740
And the prices are $999 and $1099.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.240
That's $100 less expensive than before.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.690
And here are the 13 inch configurations.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.680
You see they start with a
1.8 gigahertz dual core i5,

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:25.150
faster memory, faster graphics,
faster USB, and $1,199 and $1,499,

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.310
both $100 less expensive than before.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.280
So that's the update to the MacBook Air.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.110
And best of all, start shipping today.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.220
So next up, we also have a really nice
update to the MacBook Pro.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.400
As you know, the MacBook Pro,
it is the quintessential

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.900
professional notebook.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.220
Our customers really care greatly
about having the incredible

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.170
speed for their video editing,
their music editing,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.830
graphics and design and photography,
and we're doing a lot of those same

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.060
updates as well to the MacBook Pro.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.580
First, we're updating the processors with
new third generation core processors,

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.620
otherwise known as Ivy Bridge.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.600
It speeds up to 2.7 gigahertz and
with a 15 inch up to quad core i7,

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.340
it can be turbo boosted up to 3.7.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.390
The memory is also faster up to
1600 megahertz and the integrated

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:26.640
graphics which both the 13 and
the 15 use are also 60% faster.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.670
Now if you know,
the 15 inch also has discrete graphics

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.880
in it and we're making that faster too.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.340
We've got a new generation
Nvidia GeForce GT 650M.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:36.490
We're going to be using the new
generation of the new generation of the

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:36.660
new generation of the new generation
of the new generation of the new

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.560
generation of the new generation of the
new generation of the new generation.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.630
You probably know it as
Kepler architecture graphics.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.550
Depending on configuration up
to a gigabyte of memory in that

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.630
and it's 60% faster than the
previous discrete graphics.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.100
So that's a lot faster too.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.030
And as you might expect,
we're also updating the I/O,

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.540
so it's all USB 3 as well as USB 2.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.690
So it comes in a 13-inch
and a 15-inch size,

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.610
and let me show you those configurations.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.140
Here's the 13-inch.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:04.840
Highlight the changes.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.400
It starts with a 2.5 GHz dual-core i5.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.070
You can get 4 gigs or
8 gigs standard memory,

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.620
faster memory,
faster integrated graphics,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:19.700
and of course, the faster USB as well for
the same $1,199 and $1,499.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:24.720
and here's the 15 inch
and its configuration.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.910
Now it starts with quad core processors,
a 2.3 gigahertz quad core i7,

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.360
4 or 8 gigabytes of faster memory,
that new Kepler architecture

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.550
and video graphics,
500 or 750 gigabyte hard drive.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:41.000
You notice of course the same
7 hours of battery life even

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.060
with all that performance,
just under an inch thin and 5.6 pounds.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.620
The same prices as before,
$1799 and $2199.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.310
So that's the update to
the MacBook Pro and it is

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.500
shipping today as well.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.400
So across the board, MacBook Air,
MacBook Pro, all updated today,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.970
all with faster processors,
faster graphics, faster memory,

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.990
faster storage, faster flash storage,
faster USB 3.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.600
I mean,
nobody turns over their entire line as

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.250
quickly and completely as we do at Apple.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.810
We're really proud of the engineering
team and the work they do to

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.700
do this quick so that you can
get the exact product you need.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.320
So what's next?

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.740
Let me make a little bit of
room on the slide right here.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:46.020
You know, with the MacBook Air,
the engineering team did

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.410
something really bold.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.790
With the MacBook Air,
they re-envisioned the consumer notebook.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.770
And they were aggressive in
embracing new technologies,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.710
flash storage, wireless networking,
and discarding legacy technologies

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.560
that we could see trending out of
the product line in the future,

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.540
built-in optical drives,
wired networking, things that eventually

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.540
we could do without.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.660
And that enabled them to do something
bold that really shook up the industry,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.990
created a new generation
consumer notebook.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.980
So we've been asking the team
to think about what would make

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.460
a next generation MacBook Pro.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.300
And it's a great question.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.210
Do you want to know the answer?

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.400
Well,
let me start by some of the key ideas.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.780
You want a next generation
MacBook Pro to have a killer new display.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.730
I do.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:42.730
You want it to have...

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.180
You wanted to have an
architecture built for the future.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.100
You wanted to be
radically thin and light.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.100
And of course you wanted to be bold and
embrace the newest technologies and be

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.140
willing to discard the old legacy things
so you could make something unlike any

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.100
other notebook that's been made to date.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.100
So would you like to see the
next generation MacBook Pro?

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.120
Well let's show it to you now.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.280
The next generation
MacBook Pro is the most beautiful

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.400
computer we have ever made.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.020
Well, the first thing you're going
to notice from the front,

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.540
it's dominated by an amazing,
magnificent new display.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.660
There's never been a notebook
that is this gorgeous.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:36.080
But really, if you want to be shocked,
let's turn it around to its side and see

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.830
what it looks like from the side view.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.650
I know it's tough to
see from the audience,

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.640
the challenge,
show you something so thin and

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.300
light and small from so far away.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:57.800
But just to give you a little context,
here's my finger next to it.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.540
It's thinner than my finger.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:05.660
I mean, even with it closed it is because
that display is so radically thin.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.020
It is a true breakthrough in
engineering and there has never

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.030
been a notebook this thin,
this light,

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.310
and this powerful for professional use.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.970
Let's bring it back around to the front.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.830
Don't worry, we're going to tell you all
about it in just a minute.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:26.800
But we just have to enjoy for a
second how incredible this is.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.030
So close it up for now.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.700
Let me go up to the slides and tell you
some more about this incredible product.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:41.960
So the new next generation
MacBook Pro is 0.71 inches thin.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.700
That is remarkable.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.920
Putting it next to the existing
current generation MacBook Pro,

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.800
you see the difference.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.020
It's a quarter thinner,
but it's a dramatic amount.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:57.420
In fact,
let me bring the MacBook Air next to it.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.780
You see,
it's about as thin as a MacBook Air.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.880
That is incredible.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.920
And its weight,
it weighs just 4.46 pounds,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.400
under 4.5 pounds.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.300
It is the lightest Pro notebook
that we have ever made,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.490
even just lighter than the
13-inch MacBook Pro today.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.600
Probably the most amazing
thing about it is this gorgeous

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.680
display that it's built with.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.400
It is a breakthrough
in display engineering.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.040
Yes, it is a retina display.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:37.200
The pixels on this display are so
small that from a normal working

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.760
distance your retina cannot
discern those individual pixels.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.690
And to use it is absolutely stunning.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.430
It's 15.4 inches across,
but it's pixel density.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.770
Are you all sitting down?

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.600
Because this is really exciting.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.600
It is 2,880 pixels by 1,800.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.790
That's four times the number
of pixels in the previous

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.600
generation MacBook Pro display.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.090
Their density is 220 pixels per inch,
and I know some of you are really smart

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.600
out there and have already done the math.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.940
It's 5,184,000 pixels.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.500
That is the world's highest
resolution notebook display.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.830
It's not only amazing because
of the number of pixels in it,

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.200
but the quality of this display
is the best we have ever made.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:33.600
It has higher contrast ratios,
deeper blacks, it has a higher angle of

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.930
view with IPS technology,
and best of all,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.740
you get the benefit of the glossy
display with the rich color,

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.950
but we've been able to reduce
the glare and reflection by up to

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:47.410
75%. It makes it a joy to work on.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.670
Now it ships with OS X Lion,
but Lion has been updated to take

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.460
full advantage of that retina display.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.680
So everything you do on it can
look really sharp and beautiful.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.840
So the applications we include with Lion,
for example, mail.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.300
Mail's been updated,
so reading your mail is

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.800
like reading fine print.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.920
It's gorgeous.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.020
Safari's been updated.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.540
Surfing the web can be like
experiencing magazine print quality.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.940
And many of the applications,
like iMovie and iPhoto,

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.370
have been updated.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.830
In iPhoto,
when you're looking at thumbnail

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.400
photos in the events view,
you're going to see a clarity

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.120
and level of detail you've
never seen before in a display.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.390
It's gorgeous.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.580
And not only the included applications,
but we're also updating our professional

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.380
applications as well to take full
advantage of the retina display.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.640
We have a major update to Aperture,
our professional photo application.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.830
And this, this is a breakthrough
for a photographer.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.040
If you love working with photos,
not only has the whole UI been

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.580
updated in every element,
for the retina display,

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.800
but you're now looking at four
times the resolution of your

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.950
photos as you work on them.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.610
It is absolutely a breakthrough
event for photography.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.030
And Final Cut Pro 10 is
being updated for it as well.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.630
And this is remarkable.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.460
Because of the density
of that retina display,

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.920
that video area you see up on
the top right in Final Cut,

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.350
that is 100% pixel for pixel,
1080p HD video right

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.390
there in that window.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.700
That means there are over
3 million pixels left over

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.210
for your magnetic timeline,
for your video bins, for your effects,

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:27.010
and it also takes advantage of the
amazing performance of this machine.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.440
You're going to be able to have
up to 9 simultaneous streams of

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.520
ProRes video or 4 simultaneous
streams of uncompressed video.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.260
It is incredible performance.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.990
Now applications do have to be updated
to take advantage of this retina display.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.100
If they aren't,
we can pixel double them and

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.810
make them the proper size,
but they don't get the best effect

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.740
until they do some extra work.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.540
So we've been working with some
key developers to give them a

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.600
look of this incredible machine
and this amazing display,

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.430
and they're doing some
work that's phenomenal.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.580
Let me give you a couple examples.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.120
Adobe Photoshop.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.530
The great team at Adobe is doing
amazing work on a version of

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.680
Photoshop that will just be jaw dropping.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.780
The resolution on that retina
display is just breakthrough.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.940
So if you like working with Photoshop,
this is going to be

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.530
an amazing experience.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.430
Autodesk is working on a new
version of AutoCAD that takes

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:21.340
advantage of the retina display.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.550
And it allows a level of
detailed work and design never

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.280
possible in a notebook before.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.050
And if you think it's all
just hard work and no play,

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.660
there are some great games
being created for it as well.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.680
This is Diablo 3.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.960
I know a few of you play this game.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.470
And you're going to see a
gaming experience with this

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.420
resolution unlike any other game.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.410
And you're like any you
have ever seen before.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.860
So all throughout,
this display is a breakthrough and

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.030
makes possible a next generation
notebook unlike any other.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.660
Well, inside is just as
amazing as that display.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:32:00.800
Everything inside this next generation
MacBook Pro has been reinvented

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.600
specially to drive an incredible
design and an incredible performance.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.390
Let's take -- well,
before I take the bottom off,

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:12.150
isn't the bottom of our computer prettier
than anyone else's top of their computer?

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900
Well, let's take it off.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.410
So this is the inside.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.080
You're the first to see the inside
of the new generation MacBook Pro.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.440
It is a stunning work of engineering.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.870
You're obviously can see that the inside
is dominated by a battery pack because

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:30.780
to drive that retina display and all the
performance you're about to hear about

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.830
in something so thin and light takes
tremendous work on battery technology.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.330
And luckily,
our engineering team understands how

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:40.280
to do breakthrough work in asymmetric
battery pack to take advantage

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.100
of every millimeter of space.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.070
Well, here are a few of the
things on the inside.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.260
What you're going to find
inside is the fastest processors

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.410
we can put into a notebook,
quad core i7 processors

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.670
up to 2.7 gigahertz.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.680
What you're going to find inside,
not only the fastest

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.300
memory you can put in,
but more of it.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.290
You can figure with up to 16
gigabytes of 1600 megahertz memory.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.870
Inside, of course,
the new generation fastest graphics

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:08.840
we can put into a notebook.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.320
The new Kepler architecture,
up to a gigabyte of video memory.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.900
And of course it's built
around flash storage.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.040
If we're going to look forward,
that is the proper thing

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.000
to build it around.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:22.300
And you've just heard
how much faster flash is,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.980
but now you can configure it up to 768
gigabytes of internal flash storage.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.960
That's three quarters of a terabyte
inside of storage faster than any

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.400
hard drive we can put into a notebook.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.400
So this amazing display,
all these high performance components,

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.840
how's the battery life?

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.200
We're really proud that we're
getting up to seven hours of

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.550
battery life for 30 days of standby,
so you can really do your work on it.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.800
Let's take a look at the ports on it.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.180
Here are the right side
and the left-hand side.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:59.820
You see an SD slot for
your photos and videos.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.200
For the first time in a Mac notebook,
HDMI so you can plug right into

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.960
your TV or projection system and go.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.630
Of course, USB 3 and USB 2 on both sides,
the most convenient.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.370
Headphone port, MagSafe 2.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.450
Well, we took MagSafe,
but we had to make it even thinner

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.070
to fit into a design like this.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.920
And now two Thunderbolt ports.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.940
And this customer is perfect
for utilizing all the new things

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.490
coming out supporting Thunderbolt.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.010
Let me give you an example.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.630
You can store all your applications
and your OS on the internal drive,

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.180
but a lot of professionals will want
to have their work volumes externally.

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.870
Here's a new Promise drive, RAID drive.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.700
It's Flash RAID running over
Thunderbolt that gets over 700

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.740
megabytes a second of read performance.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.760
It's remarkable.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.820
Or cameras,
like this brand new camera that was

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.920
just announced at NAB from Blackmagic.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.330
It's a cinema 2.0.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.590
It's a 2.5K camera.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:53.160
It's a Flash-based camera and
all its I/O is over Thunderbolt.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.120
It's remarkable.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.320
It's the hit of NAB.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.030
And we can support legacy
technology over Thunderbolt,

00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.980
right on top.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.300
So we're creating some
adapters to help customers.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.340
For example,
a Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 adapter,

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.340
yep, if you need that.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:10.330
And a Gigabit Ethernet adapter as well.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.660
Let's look inside.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.800
You're going to find all the things in a
modern Mac notebook our customers want.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.890
A glass multi-touch trackpad
for those beautiful gestures.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:24.640
Beautiful backlit keyboard so
you can work all night long.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.760
The fastest networking,
wireless networking put into a notebook,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.550
802.11n and that's three stream for
maximum bandwidth for our latest airport

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.760
extreme base stations and Bluetooth 4.0.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.880
Our FaceTime HD camera.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.440
Dual microphones and this uses
beamforming to enable a new

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.460
generation of voice applications.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:49.470
and the best stereo speakers we've ever
put into a desktop or notebook computer,

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.720
this is going to sound
absolutely beautiful.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.610
Of course, we love this so much we
couldn't help ourselves.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.870
We made a video and I'd like
to run that for you now.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:11.080
To create something that's genuinely new,
you have to start again.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:16.400
And I think with great intent,
you disconnect from the past.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.300
If you never change anything,
then what you can really

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.080
engineer is kind of incremental.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.750
But when you're willing to change things,
then you kind of open up a

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.510
whole new world of design.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.170
The new MacBook Pro is built for the
very highest levels of performance.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.380
It's incredibly powerful
and yet remarkably portable.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:41.220
It's without doubt the very best
computer that we've ever built.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.310
We focused on the features that
matter most to notebook users,

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.480
and we made huge leaps.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.180
For the first time,
we're bringing the Retina

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.480
display to the Mac.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.780
It's the highest resolution display
we've ever put in a notebook.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:08.120
With a resolution of 2880 by 1800,
this display has over 5 million pixels.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.200
That's 3 million more than an HDTV.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:15.200
At this resolution, on this screen size,
pixels just seem to disappear.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.200
You see an extraordinary level
of detail in your photos.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.580
And typography looks amazing.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.200
It's sharper than a printed page.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.700
Beyond the display,
the new MacBook Pro is

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:29.200
really a powerhouse.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.190
We knew that an all-Flash architecture
was a key part of driving performance.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.250
Flash delivers data up to four times
faster and uses just 10% of the space

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.200
that a traditional hard drive would use.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.940
When you combine that with the
most powerful graphics chips,

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.200
the latest quad-core processors,
and the fastest RAM available,

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.190
you end up with a machine
that's incredibly responsive.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.200
Loading and working with
your content is a key.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.190
The speed is amazingly fast because we
packed this machine with the latest I/O.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.200
It has two Thunderbolt ports,
two USB 3 ports, and one HDMI port.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.410
With all of this performance,
the new MacBook Pro gets up

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.200
to 7 hours of battery life.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.200
And it's only .71 inches thin.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:17.200
That's 25% thinner than our
previous generation MacBook Pro.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.200
And it weighs just under 4.5 pounds.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.740
The new MacBook Pro would seem
to be a complete contradiction.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.100
It's built for extreme
levels of performance,

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.780
but at the same time,
it's remarkably portable.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.900
To create it,
we rigorously question the ways

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:39.300
in which we've designed and built
our portable products in the past.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.150
One of the most significant challenges
was completely changing our approach

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.980
to the design of the display.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.130
By building the layers of
the display into the unibody,

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.700
we actually eliminated the need
for a separate cover glass.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.200
And without the additional layers,
without the distractions,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.590
you're just completely
immersed in your content.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.460
By not purchasing standard parts,
but by designing and engineering

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:12.570
components from the ground up,
we can create a product that is more

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.220
elegant and that's more efficient.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.050
And there are many design innovations
in the new MacBook Pro that

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:22.640
users won't actually see,
but they'll certainly experience.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.420
For example, the thermal system,
which enables the machine's

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.930
incredible performance,
operates in a way that is nearly

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:31.800
imperceptible to the user.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.610
The air is pulled into
vents and propelled through

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:40.320
sculpted cavities by fans with
asymmetrically positioned blades.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.490
In most fans,
the blades are positioned symmetrically,

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.320
which creates a single
identifiable frequency.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.480
We positioned ours asymmetrically
to spread the sound over

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.630
a variety of frequencies,
which makes it seem

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.820
quieter and less intrusive.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:05.050
Every part of the enclosure makes
a contribution benefits the user.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.140
The vents are also part
of the structural system,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:12.000
creating strong beams that
actually increase the rigidity

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.990
of the overall product.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.400
It truly takes an obsessive
approach to make a product this

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.320
meticulously designed and engineered.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.940
We've been able to optimize
the software to take full

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:30.960
advantage of the retina display,
and the results look simply amazing.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.990
Aputure on the new MacBook Pro is a
total game changer for photographers.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
They can now zoom in and see
four times more of their image

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
with pixel-for-pixel accuracy,
and fine-tune even the smallest details.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.070
Photographers have never
been able to work on images

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.000
with this level of precision.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:56.500
Final Cut Pro X takes full advantage
of the system's power and capabilities.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.100
So you can now stream up to nine
camera views simultaneously,

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:05.640
or view full 1080p video
right in the project viewer,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.480
and have plenty of screen space to spare.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:12.500
No other notebook comes close
to this type of performance.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:20.690
With the new MacBook Pro,
we set out to design something extreme.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:25.340
And this led us to rethink
everything about our process,

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.900
everything about what's
essential to a notebook.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.780
And that meant that we could
design the very best computer

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.210
for today and for the future.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.480
The next generation
MacBook Pro with Retina Display.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.010
Let me tell you about its
starting configuration.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.240
Of course you can configure
other items as well.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.960
It begins with that Retina Display,
a 2.3 GHz quad core i7,

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.940
a full 8 gigs of 1600 MHz memory,
Nvidia GT 650M with a full

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:16.500
gigabyte of onboard video memory,
256 gigabytes of that fast flash storage,

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:22.040
full 7 hours of battery life and
under 4.5 pounds starting at $2199.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.210
And of course you can
configure it even beyond that.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.470
We are proud not only of the incredible
quality of the products we make,

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:36.640
but also our work to make them
environmentally friendly as well.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.570
So I want to make sure we
bring up this checklist,

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.640
as we have in the past.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:47.630
It is now Energy Star 5.2, arsenic-free,
mercury-free glass, BFR-free, PVC-free,

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.700
and of course the glass and
the high-grade aluminum is

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.010
really desired by recyclers.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.610
So we're really proud of how
hard the engineering team

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.180
works on this aspect as well.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.900
So the new, next generation
MacBook Pro with Retina Display.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:06.730
It is the future and the best thing
is it's going to start shipping today.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.480
So that completes our notebook lineup.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:22.200
A great update to MacBook Air,
great update to the

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.250
existing architecture,
MacBook Pro, and for the first time,

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:30.000
the high end of our line,
the new flagship, the next generation,

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.960
MacBook Pro with Retina Display,
it's simply the best

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.440
computer Apple has ever made.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.780
Well next,
we'd like to talk to you about OS X,

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.790
and I'd like to bring up
Craig Federighi to do that.

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.790
Thank you.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.200
Good morning.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.420
So let's talk about OS X.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:56.320
We're on our eighth
major release of OS X,

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.680
continuing more than a decade
of combining the power of Unix

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.340
with the simplicity of the Mac.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.460
And the Mac has been doing great.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:12.010
We have 66 million Mac users now,
triple what we had just five years ago.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:14.290
Our latest release is Lion.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:18.660
And Lion was the first release
distributed electronically

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.490
via the Mac App Store,
making it easier than ever to purchase,

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:25.710
download, and install OS X.

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:28.160
And the results have been fantastic.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.290
We've had 26 million
copies shipped to date,

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.150
making it our best-selling release ever.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:39.780
In fact,
40% of OS X users are running Lion.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.920
And that's a level we achieved.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:40.960
So we're going to talk about the Mac.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:40.960
We're going to talk about the OS X.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.700
We're going achieved in just nine months.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:48.390
As a basis of comparison,
Windows 7 took 27 months

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.470
to get to that same level.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:56.830
And now, less than one year later,
we're here to announce Mountain Lion.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.900
With Mountain Lion,
our mission remains the same:

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.900
to deliver the world's most
advanced operating system for

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.380
notebook and desktop computers,
with an interface optimized for

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:12.100
multi-touch trackpads and mice.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.380
And at the same time,
Lion makes it more natural

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.800
than ever to work with the
other new devices in our lives.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:25.000
Now Mountain Lion is a major
release with over 200 new features.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.230
And this morning,
I'd like to detail just eight for you.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:32.400
And we're going to start with iCloud.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.510
Now, since its introduction in October,
iCloud has taken off like a rocket,

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:41.400
with 125 million registered users.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.700
With Mountain Lion,
we had the opportunity to build

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.090
support for iCloud right in.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.830
So when you sign in to your
new Mac with your Apple ID,

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:54.600
we automatically configure all of
these applications to work with iCloud.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:54.980
And so whether you're working
with a laptop or a laptop,

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:55.950
you're going to have to be
able to use the iCloud app.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:57.780
And so whether you're
working in your mail,

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:02.740
with your contacts, your calendar,
all of your content is up to

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.470
date across all of your devices.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.430
And with Mountain Lion,
we introduced three great new

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.670
apps optimized for iCloud:
Messages, which brings iMessage for

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:19.280
the first time to the Mac,
Reminders, and Notes.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:20.530
But we're also bringing
integration for your document-based

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:20.820
apps in Mountain Lion.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:20.880
And we're also bringing
integration for your document-based

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:20.880
apps in Mountain Lion.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:20.880
And we're also bringing
integration for your document-based

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:20.900
apps in Mountain Lion.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:20.920
And we're also bringing
integration for your document-based

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:20.980
apps in Mountain Lion.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:21.080
And we're also bringing
integration for your document-based

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:21.080
apps in Mountain Lion.

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:21.140
And we're also bringing
integration for your document-based

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:21.140
apps in Mountain Lion.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.720
for your document-based
apps in Mountain Lion,

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.520
with a feature we call
Documents in the Cloud.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.180
Now, Documents in the Cloud does
two important things.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:37.970
First, it provides a simple new way to
access and organize your documents.

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:42.310
When you launch an app like Pages,
it comes up with a document

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.980
library of all the Pages
documents you have in the cloud,

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.930
organized chronologically,
so the newest ones are easy

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.290
to find right at the top.

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:54.080
And second, Documents in the Cloud makes
these document libraries available

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:57.930
and up-to-date across all your
Macs and all of your iOS devices.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.300
Now, we've adopted Documents in
the Cloud on all of our key

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:07.170
document-based applications,
like Pages, Numbers, and Keynote,

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:11.530
and system apps like
Preview and TextEdit.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:14.700
And we have a developer SDK so
that developers can add the

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.740
support in their applications.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.980
And we've also added a developer
SDK for your apps as well.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:22.620
Well, that's iCloud, and I'd like to give
you a quick demo now.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.600
So this is our first
look at Mountain Lion.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:41.260
You see we have a gorgeous new desktop
image and a beautiful new glass dock.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.990
You'll notice a couple of
new items on that dock.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.130
including a new reminders app.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.700
And this is really handy if you're
taking to-dos for yourself on the go.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.900
You can find them all automatically
right here via iCloud.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:02.570
You can use multi-touch gestures
to page between your reminders.

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:06.620
and we support location-based reminders
for the first time on the Mac.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.070
So now, for instance,
when I arrive at work,

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:13.050
I'll get a notification from my dad
to send him a Father's Day card.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:17.600
I dismiss a notification,
they just fly away.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.040
Now we have a great little notes
app in MountainLine as well.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.480
So all the notes I take on my iPad,
they're available right here.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.230
We support, of course, images and links.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:31.420
And of course,
you can open up notes in separate

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.980
windows if you want to keep them
around on your desktop for easy access.

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:39.490
But I think the really
huge one here is messages.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.680
Because with messages,
we brought iMessage to the Mac.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.370
So now if you're sitting using
your Mac and your phone buzzes

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:52.260
with a new iMessage coming in,
well, you can respond right on your Mac.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.730
And all of the conversations
that you had while on the go,

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.870
well,
they'll -- they're up to date right here.

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:01.750
Creating a new
conversation is super easy.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:05.630
You just start typing the
name of one of your contacts,

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:09.300
and you can send them a
message to their phone,

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:14.040
via Apple ID, or via other legacy
chat services as well.

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:18.150
And iMessages -- sorry.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:21.700
It's all about iMessage, come on.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:26.800
So, iMessage lets you send
rich messages with images,

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:32.940
attachments up to 100 megs in size,
and even HD video.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.690
and that's iMessage.

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:44.190
Next, I want to show you documents in the
cloud because it makes it really easy to

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.360
find the documents you're looking for.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.560
So if I want to find numbers documents,
where would I go?

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.260
Well, I'd launch numbers of course
and I presented with my

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.740
document library right there
with all my numbers documents.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.210
If I want to get at PDFs for instance,
launch preview and there

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.430
are all of my PDFs.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.800
And if I want to add a
document to that cloud library,

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.060
for instance one of my download stack,
I can just drag it right in.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:12.120
Now it's available
across all of my devices.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:16.360
Now I'm going to launch pages
and I'm working here on a poster.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.420
So I'm going to open that up.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.730
Now it turns out of course because
this is in my cloud library that it's

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:29.680
also available to me on my phone where
I also have a copy of pages running.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.620
And so here on my phone,
I can actually not only view my

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:32.620
pages but I can also view my pages.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:32.620
And so I can actually view my pages
and I can actually view my pages.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:32.620
And so I can actually view my pages.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:32.620
And so here on my phone,
I can actually not only view my pages

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:32.620
but I can actually view my pages.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:32.620
And so here on my phone,
I can actually view my pages.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:32.620
And so here on my phone,
I can actually view my pages.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.140
And here on my phone,
I can actually view my pages.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.490
And I can actually not only view but
also make changes to this document.

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:39.560
And what I want you to do is watch
what happens on the Mac as I actually

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:44.760
go in here and go into my photo roll,
make a change, replace the picture,

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:50.400
and the Mac will actually
update automatically for me.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.970
There it is.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:01.050
And that's just a little preview of
life in Mountain Lion with iCloud.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.660
Next is a feature I think
you're really going to love,

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.400
Notification Center.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.400
It's coming to the Mac.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:10.120
So sometimes when you're using your Mac,
it can decide that it has

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.350
something to tell you.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.840
And in the past,
each application had its own unique

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.010
way of getting your attention.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.790
And some of them were
somewhat disruptive.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:20.100
Well,

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:23.270
With Mountain Lion,
we've replaced all of this with

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:28.900
a consistent and elegant system
based on banners and alerts.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:33.340
So banners slide down from the
top of the screen right there

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.180
into the upper right-hand corner.

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.820
And if you ignore them,
they just slide out of the way.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.290
But you can always get back to
them with two fingers from the

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.050
right-hand side of your trackpad.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:48.030
You can slide out and reveal
Notification Center with notifications

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:50.360
from all of your applications.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.140
And when you're done,
you just slide it back.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:57.340
Now, alerts are for things that you
want to make sure you don't miss.

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:01.000
So they come in in the same elegant way,
but they stay around until

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.040
you dismiss them explicitly.

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.460
Now, sometimes you may be doing
something where you don't want to

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.320
be interrupted by notifications.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:12.140
And Notification Center provides a nice
little switch so you can temporarily

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.960
disable those banners and notifications.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.050
And if you're presenting and
you connect to a projector,

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.460
we'll do it for you automatically.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.460
So that's Notification Center.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.450
Next up, dictation.

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.400
We're bringing dictation to the Mac.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.860
Everywhere on your
Mac where you can type,

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.710
you can now talk,
and the Mac will do the typing for you.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.680
And because it's built into the system,
it works everywhere.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.500
It can talk into your
Facebook web page if you want,

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:54.580
or even in third-party
applications like Microsoft Word.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.430
That's dictation.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:58.860
It's that simple.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.190
Next is sharing.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:07.500
Mac users love to share links, images,
videos.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:10.760
And now in Mountain Lion,
we've made it easier than ever

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.040
to share right from within
the app where you're working.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.660
There's a share button
right there on the toolbar.

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.130
If you click it,
we present all of your sharing options.

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.340
If I want to share to Twitter,
for instance, just select it,

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:26.150
get a cute little tweet sheet,
type whatever it is I find necessary

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:30.840
to share with the outside world,
click it, and like that, it's on its way.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.240
And we built sharing
in across the system.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.510
So if you're in Preview, for instance,
and you want to share the PDF you're

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.450
looking at over Messenger,
you can do it.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.430
If you're in any app
where you can quick look,

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:42.960
for instance,
you're quick-clicking an image,

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.450
you can post it up sharing over Flickr.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:50.970
And our support for sharing is more
than skin deep in Mountain Lion.

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.500
Support for sharing services
like Twitter is built right

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:54.900
into the operating system.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.650
So when you go into System Preferences
and enter your login information,

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:01.790
enter it just once,
and any application you've

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:05.900
authorized can access and
connect to those social services.

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.220
So that's it.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:07.320
Thanks.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.100
Thanks for sharing.

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.500
Next is the new Safari.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:16.900
The new Safari in Mountain Lion has
the fastest JavaScript engine

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.740
of any browser on the planet.

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.590
But the first thing you'll notice
when you use Safari is the new

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:26.260
unified smart search field.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.500
You type in it,
whatever you're looking for,

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:32.860
and Safari will present you
with a well-chosen top hit.

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.690
Yes, this is a very useful feature.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.740
Search suggestions and even
matches automatically from your

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.400
bookmarks and your browsing history.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.860
Now sometimes what you're looking for is
something that you were browsing earlier,

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.480
maybe on one of your other devices.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.520
Well now,
Safari is a feature called iCloud tabs.

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.440
You just click the cloud button
on your toolbar and you get a list

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:03.000
of all of the pages you have open
across all of your other devices,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.650
including your Macs.

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.990
You just click it and you pick up your
browsing right where you left off.

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:19.360
Now we also have a fantastic
new feature we call tab view.

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:24.380
It lets you use gestures to
visually navigate your tabs.

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:27.520
I'd like to show it to you now.

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:40.830
So let's take a look at the new Safari.

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:42.420
You can see, of course,
we have our unified search

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.660
field right here at the top.

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:49.160
I can type a few characters,
and Safari presents me with a top hit,

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:53.650
as well as search suggestions
and bookmark and history matches.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.090
I can click.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:59.340
We get some Safari's
lightning-fast page loading.

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:05.910
Safari also has a new scrolling
architecture built on core animation,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.230
which makes scrolling just
smooth and lightning fast.

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.630
It's really awesome.

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:16.480
Now, if you want to open a
tab that you had open,

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:21.440
for instance, on another computer,
I can just click the iCloud tabs button.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.050
You see all of them right there,
documents I'd open on my

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:26.210
iPad as well as on my iPhone.

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:31.130
I click one, I can keep browsing right
from where I left off.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:35.070
Now, Lion has a feature where, of course,
you can use multi-touch gestures

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:36.910
to zoom in on your web page.

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:39.800
So, for instance,
I can zoom in like this.

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.680
I can zoom back out.

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.010
But now, what happens when
I zoom even further out?

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.870
Watch.

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:54.310
I'm pulled into the tab view where
I have a live view across all of my tabs.

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:58.700
I can use multi-touch gestures
to scroll through them,

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.960
select a tab, pinch, and back out.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:08.310
It's a fantastic way to
browse your tabs in Safari.

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.500
Next, I want to show you how easy it
is to share in Mountain Lion.

00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:18.340
You can select here in the share button.

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.760
Let's say I want to
tweet about this page.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.480
I click,
get this beautiful little animation,

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.320
and I'll just say,
"Heading down the coast."

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:33.440
and I've sent a tweet on its way.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.740
But sharing works really well
also in full screen apps.

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.640
For instance, I'll just pan over here
to full screen iPhoto.

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:43.300
Let's open up a photo
that I want to share.

00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:45.500
And I want to share this to iMessage.

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:48.500
But I don't have to leave this
full screen experience to do that.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:53.500
I click on the system wide share button,
select messages and I get a

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.590
little messaging sheet right here.

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.050
I select the person I want to send to.

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:04.280
and just like that, I've sent a message.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.500
Now, this is where Notification
Center comes in,

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.810
because if I'm working in a full
screen app and maybe someone responds

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:14.040
back to that message I sent back out,
it'll actually appear as a

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:17.660
notification right there on my screen.

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:18.550
There it is.

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:22.180
And if I ignore it, of course,
it'll just slide away.

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:24.650
But if I want to get back to it,
that's easy too.

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:28.370
I take two fingers from the right-hand
side of my track pad and And I can

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:29.880
just sweep out notification center.

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.570
It's a completely fluid gesture.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.470
And if I want to get
at any of these things,

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:38.830
I can click, for instance,
on this message, and it takes me right

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:40.640
to the conversation.

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.410
Back-in Messages.

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:46.760
Now,
notifications also support notifications

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.430
from internet services like Twitter.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:54.230
So if I get a Twitter direct
message or a mention,

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.570
it'll come in, and

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.630
and the WWDC 2012 Keynote Tim Cook,
Craig Federighi, Scott Forsstall,

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:01.790
Phil Schiller and the
WWDC 2012 Keynote Tim Cook,

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:03.760
Craig Federighi, Scott Forsstall,
Phil Schiller

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.600
I can just go right into
Notification Center and I can

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.070
summon a tweet sheet right here.

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:16.540
and of course I can use
dictation to enter my tweet.

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:21.750
having a great time showing
off Mountain Lion at WWDC.

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:24.940
And there it is.

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:29.340
Tweeting from notification site.

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:42.280
Next, I want to introduce you to a new
technology in OS X that we call PowerNap.

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:44.040
It's a great name, isn't it?

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:49.310
So, you know, we all love using our Macs.

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:52.400
But wouldn't it be great if
when we weren't using them,

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.120
they were still working for us?

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:58.440
Well now with PowerNap they
will because PowerNap keeps your

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:01.280
Mac up to date while it sleeps.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.320
It fetches your email,
keeps track of calendar

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:10.250
and reminder updates,
and even fetches your photo stream.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.610
and it gets better.

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:22.550
If you've ever brought your
Mac home and just plugged it

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:23.770
into charge for the night,
well now it'll also back itself

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:27.200
up to your time capsule and even
download app store and system

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.060
software updates automatically.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.790
and David Koehn.

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:41.420
And I'm sure you've heard
of the new MacBook Air.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.310
It automatically refreshes data.

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.300
Its operation is entirely silent.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:47.170
It doesn't even spin up your fans.

01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:48.790
It goes easy on your battery.

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:52.410
And it's compatible with recent
MacBook Airs as well as that gorgeous

01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:54.490
new MacBook Pro with Retina display.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.810
That's PowerNap.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.120
Next is AirPlay mirroring.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.050
AirPlay mirroring, yes.

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:05.990
AirPlay mirroring is absolutely the
easiest way to get whatever's on your

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.900
Mac up on a projector or television.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.500
You just go up to the
AirPlay menu in your Mac menu bar,

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.480
shows you any Apple TVs that are nearby.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.940
You select one and instantly you're
mirroring that content in up to

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:23.300
pixel for pixel 1080p resolution.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.580
This is fantastic for the classroom.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.780
For the meeting room.

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.900
Of course for your family room.

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:35.680
And we also support sending
audio to AirPlay enabled

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.920
stereo receivers and speakers.

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:39.920
That's AirPlay.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:45.830
And finally,
it's going to be really nice.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.420
And finally, Game Center.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.900
You know, with the introduction
of the Mac App Store,

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:58.000
we've experienced a renaissance
of gaming on the Mac.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.200
And we're making it even better by
bringing Game Center from iOS to the Mac.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.610
And with Game Center on the Mac,
you have your same Game Center account

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.730
with all of your Game Center friends,
where you can track all of

01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:15.660
your achievements and also
keep track of all your games,

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.860
both iOS 10 and iOS games.

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:21.490
But of course, Game Center is ultimately
all about gaming.

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:25.760
And we support both turn-based
and head-to-head gaming,

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:31.880
both Mac to Mac and cross-platform
iOS to Mac over Game Center.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:42.740
I'd like to give you a little demo
of AirPlay and Game Center now.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:42.740
So, let's go ahead

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.180
So the first thing I'd like
to do is show my Mac screen,

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:56.790
and then let's also summon my Apple TV,
so you can see that as well.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.990
And you'll notice up here
on my Mac's menu bar,

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:04.200
I have an AirPlay menu,
and I can select this Apple TV.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.180
When I select it,

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:12.180
Instantly my Mac display is
mirrored to the Apple TV in 1080p.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.010
Now, the rest of this demo is
going to be viewing this

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:16.860
content entirely over AirPlay.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.630
Of course,
I can do anything I would normally

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:23.320
do on my Mac when I'm on AirPlay,
for instance, launch Game Center.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:31.800
And here I see my Game Center account
as well as all of my -- yeah.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:37.800
As well as all my, yeah,
like I chose that, right?

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.000
And I can also see all of
my Game Center friends.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.020
I've got one here, Mr.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.940
X,
who's been meaning to play me in this new

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.880
game that's coming out called CSR Racing.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:54.660
So we'll see if we can summon him to
the stage for a little competition.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.760
This is looking a little more
serious than I was anticipating.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.780
So, Mr.

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.260
X here is actually working on
an iPad and on his iPad he can

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:20.510
invite me to play this game,
CSR Racing, which is an upcoming

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.940
title from Natural Motion.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.860
And when he does, you notice I get,
of course,

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:27.550
a notification in Notification Center.

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:31.680
I click on it and I'm instantly
launched into the game.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.730
Now, Natural Motion was originally
developing this just as an iOS title,

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:39.600
but they found it so easy to bring it
to the Mac and integrate Game Center,

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:44.800
they'll be simultaneously releasing
it for iOS and Mac this summer.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.120
All right.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.540
Looks like we're up to race.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.640
I'm in the red.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.750
Racer OS X on the right in white.

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:53.040
Here we go.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.360
Again, this is over airplay,
everything you're seeing.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.060
Let's go.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:05.900
All right.

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.810
I think I got you.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.380
This is just a quick
overview of Mountain Lion.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:32.630
And in addition to these major features,
there's so much more there.

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:37.620
Things like VIPs in mail where you
can mark any people that are important

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:41.340
to you and new incoming messages will
show up as notifications for you.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.730
Search in Launchpad,
Gatekeeper to help keep your

01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:50.390
system free from malware,
and Offline Reading List where in Safari,

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.520
if you add things to your reading list,
you can still read them later even when

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.060
you're disconnected from the internet.

01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:00.460
But one area I want to highlight
especially are some features

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.250
we're adding for China.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.370
The Mac has been growing fantastically
in China and we have some wonderful

01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:09.260
features that we think are going
to make it even more popular there.

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:13.680
We're really improving our
Chinese input method for pinyin.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.340
We're providing a new Chinese dictionary.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:22.060
We're adding eight new fonts that are
great for creating beautiful documents.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:22.770
In Safari,
we're adding a new Chinese dictionary.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:23.270
We're adding eight new fonts that are
great for creating beautiful documents.

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.540
In Safari,
we're adding a new Chinese dictionary.

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:27.770
We're adding support for Baidu as
an optional search provider and

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:32.890
adding sharing support for the Sina
microblogging website as well as

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:35.380
video sharing to Yoku and Tudou.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:39.210
And finally,
we're making it really easy to set up

01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:42.690
your Mac with China's top email services.

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:46.220
So those are a few features for China.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:51.060
But of course--yeah,
it's going to be important.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:52.340
Get your apps

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.430
So Mountain Lion is also a
fantastic release for developers

01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:01.730
with over 1,700 new APIs.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:04.770
So you can add sharing,
game center support,

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.410
notification support,
new high DPI APIs and gesture

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.840
APIs to add those great
multi-touch swipes to your apps.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.160
So Mountain Lion,
we're going to be delivering

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:21.800
it to customers next month
via the Mac App Store.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.660
And you know, while Lion was priced,
I think, very aggressively at $29.99,

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.670
we want even more people to get
their hands on Mountain Lion.

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:33.180
It's going to be just $19.99.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:47.300
And this price is for upgrades both from
Lion and all the way from Snow Leopard.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:51.360
And your single purchase will
upgrade all of your personal Macs.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:02.300
Finally, for those of you who buy
a new Mac starting today,

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.320
I bet there are going to be

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.200
Your upgrade to
Mountain Lion will be free.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.680
And all of you WWDC developers,
today you get access to a

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.860
near final developer preview.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:19.940
So you can get all your apps ready for
Mountain Lion when it ships next month.

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:22.700
That's Mountain Lion.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:37.560
Next up, I'd like to hand it over
to Scott Forsstal to give

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.970
you an update on iOS.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.630
Let's talk about iOS.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:56.220
I find it incredible that through
the end of March we have already sold

01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:01.510
more than 365 million iOS devices.

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:08.320
What I find almost equally amazing is
that more than 80% of our customers are

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.720
running the very latest version of iOS,
iOS 5.

01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:15.420
Now, if

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:32.090
They released a dairy product, 4.0,
about the same time

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.920
that we released iOS 5.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.930
And about 7% of Android customers
are running the latest version,

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:43.070
versus more than 80%.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.740
The latest version of iOS, iOS 5.

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.570
Now let me give you a quick update
on a few of the features of iOS

01:09:48.570 --> 01:09:50.740
5 that made it a great release.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.950
Starting with Notification Center.

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:58.080
Already 84 of the top 100 social
apps are pushing notifications.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.860
In fact,
we're sending around 7 billion push

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.860
notifications every single day.

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:20.040
We've already sent more than 1.5
trillion push notifications already.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.440
It's just amazing.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.280
Next is iMessage.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.810
We have more than 140
million iMessage users.

01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:36.820
They've sent more than 150 billion
messages and are currently sending

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.420
more than a billion messages a day.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.200
every single day.

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.220
Next is Twitter.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:49.100
We integrated
Twitter directly into iOS 5,

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:53.150
and they've already seen a three
times growth increase from the number

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:55.690
of people on iOS using Twitter.

01:10:55.910 --> 01:11:00.960
Those customers have sent more
than 10 billion tweets from iOS 5,

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.220
and nearly half of all the photos
being shared with Twitter's photo

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.530
sharing service come from iOS 5.

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.710
It's a great integration.

01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.400
Next is Game Center.

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:17.460
Game Center is a great gaming network.

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.940
We have more than 130
million people using it.

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:25.440
They submit 5 billion
scores every single week.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:31.060
And two-thirds of the top 100
games integrate with Game Center.

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:37.340
And all of this results in some very,
very satisfied customers.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:44.930
More than 75% of our customers check
the top box for very satisfied compared

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:48.670
and less than 50% for the competition.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.220
Now,
one of the reasons that our customers

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:56.820
are so satisfied is that every single
year since the original iPhone,

01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.390
we come out with a new
OS full of great quality,

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.130
amazing features.

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:07.940
And this year is no exception,
so I'm very happy to announce iOS 6.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.400
iOS 6 is a fantastic release.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.230
It has more than 200 new features,
starting with some significant

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.940
enhancements to Siri.

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.150
I'll walk you through a few.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.880
Let's start with Siri.

01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:30.700
As you all know,
Siri's only been out for eight months

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.690
and already does so much for you.

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:37.620
You can send text messages,
get all sorts of answers, set alarms,

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:41.840
find out about the weather,
make phone calls, create a reminder.

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:44.370
For kids, or my kids,
you can just chat with

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.140
with it for a while?

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.570
Siri is fantastic.

01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:50.730
But in these eight months,
Siri has been studying up

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:52.670
and learning a lot more.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.700
So let me just go ahead and show
you what Siri can do now in iOS 6.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.240
So here I have a phone running iOS 6.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.610
The first thing that Siri has
learned in the last eight

01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:10.580
months is all about sports.

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:16.380
So you can ask questions like,
what was the score of

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.790
the last Giants game?

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:35.300
[Transcript missing]

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:38.980
But great sports scores, ask of Siri.

01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:42.450
You can also ask about
individual players like this.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.800
What is Buster Posey's batting average?

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.600
Buster Posey has a
batting average of 290.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.220
So you can see you get player
cards and player stats.

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:57.600
It's very cool.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.690
You can also ask about standings.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:03.700
What are the National League standings?

01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:10.200
Here are the standings
for the National League.

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:14.170
So you can scroll down here,
see the Giants there in second place.

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:17.500
So Siri knows about baseball.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.040
Siri also knows about basketball.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:25.000
So I can ask, who is taller,
LeBron or Kobe?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.030
LeBron James appears
to be slightly taller.

01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:38.860
So you see his player cards,
there's LeBron James who is 6'8".

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.920
If I scroll down to Kobe's card,
6'6". Now it's not

01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:46.200
football season right now,
but Siri also knows about football.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.800
So I can ask:
When is the San Francisco 49ers

01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:52.990
first game of the season?

01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:02.690
The 49ers Packers game is September 9,
2012, 1:15 p.m.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:08.000
So the entire schedule
right there is just awesome.

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.480
So Siri knows about sports.

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:14.370
Next up, Siri's learned a lot
more about restaurants,

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.920
so I can ask,
Find a great place for dinner.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.190
I found 15 restaurants,
14 of them are fairly close to you,

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.390
I've sorted them by rating.

01:15:29.700 --> 01:16:29.200
[Transcript missing]

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:35.060
Okay,
I found eight movies at the Metreon.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.450
So I can tell you what
movies are playing.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.940
I'll go ahead and choose one.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.540
Marvel's The Avengers.

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:44.520
You see we've integrated
with Rotten Tomatoes,

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.000
so you can see ratings and reviews.

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:50.970
You can even tap to watch the
trailer right here in Siri.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.700
We are hopelessly outgunned.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:14.970
So really, really cool.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:19.240
You can also ask questions
about directors or actors.

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:25.490
So I can say, show me movies starring
Scarlett Johansson.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.160
I found several movies
starring Scarlett Johansson.

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:37.780
So to find current movies in the
theater as well as previous catalog.

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:39.240
Just fantastic.

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:45.100
Let me show you one more thing Siri's
learned and that is how to launch apps.

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:53.620
You've all been creating incredible apps
and now it's so easy to get to them.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.100
If you're like me,
I have hundreds of apps on my phone.

01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:59.600
Let's say I want to play a game,
I can just ask Siri now.

01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:01.600
Play Temple Run.

01:18:02.230 --> 01:18:06.630
And it's just like that.

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:19.060
And those are just a few of the
things that Siri has learned in iOS 6.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.600
So before, Siri did so much.

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:24.070
But now, it's just incredible.

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.160
Sports scores.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.160
So you can ask for football
scores or basketball,

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:30.120
both pro and college.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.740
You ask about baseball, hockey,
also soccer.

01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:37.040
We do a lot of leagues,
including the English Premier League.

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.540
So, sports scores.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:41.510
You can ask about movies.

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:44.040
You can launch apps,
make dinner reservations.

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:47.460
You can now tweet just
by talking to your phone.

01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:49.810
And there's this thing we're calling

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.580
Eyes Free.

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:54.240
Now, you've heard of Hands Free before.

01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:57.000
Hands Free allows you to keep
your hands on the steering

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.520
wheel while you use your phone.

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.140
We want to integrate
Siri even better with the car.

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.880
And so we're working with a number
of car manufacturers to enable

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.920
you to use a button right on the
steering wheel to bring up Siri.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.140
Now, since Siri can talk back to you,
you don't need -- and we don't

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:20.430
light up the screen of the iPhone,
so you can keep your hands on the wheel

01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:23.440
and your eyes on the road and use Siri.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:28.340
Now, a number of auto manufacturers have
already committed to delivering

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:32.580
Eyes Free Siri integration
in the next 12 months.

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:46.160
We're also taking Siri much
more international.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.860
When we launched Siri,
we launched it in English in

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:52.150
the United States,
Great Britain, Australia,

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:54.300
and we had French and German.

01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:57.400
Recently, we added Japanese.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.950
And now, in iOS 6,
we're adding English and

01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:08.300
French tuned for Canada.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:15.020
We are adding Spanish.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:20.020
Tune for Spain, Mexico,
and the United States.

01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:22.330
We are adding Italian.

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:27.540
For Switzerland, we're adding Italian,
French, and German.

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.930
We're adding Korean.

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:36.840
60 countries represented here.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.800
We're adding Mandarin, tuned for Taiwan,

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:45.680
Cantonese tuned for Hong Kong,
and both Mandarin and Cantonese

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.110
tuned for mainland China.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.000
Now as part of making
Siri more international,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.110
we're now taking local search,
which was US only in iOS 5,

01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:06.780
around the world.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.490
So you can now do local
search even in China.

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:20.480
And for the first time,
we're taking Siri beyond the iPhone 4S

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:23.830
and we're bringing it to the new iPad.

01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:37.900
and just a few of the
enhancements for Siri in iOS 6.

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.500
Facebook integration.

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:47.210
We have been working very
closely with Facebook to create

01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:51.900
the best Facebook experience
ever on a mobile device.

01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:55.080
We are integrating
Facebook right into iOS 6.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:59.250
You can now go to the settings
app and enter your username and

01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:01.780
password and now you are ready to go.

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:05.960
You don't need to re-log in when
you go to an app from the app store,

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.660
including Facebook's app.

01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:12.430
We are also making it really easy to
post to Facebook from many of our apps.

01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:15.760
So you can post photos
from the photos app,

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.440
post about websites from Safari,
post locations from Maps.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.740
You can talk about your favorite app,
your own app in this case,

01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:26.440
from the app store.

01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:29.980
You can talk about movies,
TV shows and movies

01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:31.800
from the iTunes store.

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:35.140
You can talk some smack
from the game center.

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.940
We have also integrated
Facebook into our app store.

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:38.700
We have integrated it right
in with notification center.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.910
So anywhere you are,
just drag your finger down from the top

01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:46.010
of the screen to reveal notification
center and you can tap to post to

01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:50.180
Facebook and we have added Twitter right
into notification center as well.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.980
We've also integrated Facebook with Siri,
so you can just talk to your

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:59.000
phone now to post to Facebook.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.080
And we've taken this deep
integration and made it a public API,

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.850
so it's easy for apps on the
App Store to integrate with Facebook.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.010
and David Koehn.

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:19.860
We've also integrated
it with the App Store,

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:24.650
so now you can like apps and see
which apps your friends like.

01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:29.200
And you can also do that for
the iTunes Store with music,

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.680
TV shows and movies.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:36.250
And if your friends are sharing, say,
a phone number or an email

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:39.800
address from Facebook,
those will appear in your

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:45.120
contact list now right on your
iPhone and your iOS devices.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.900
Also,
your Facebook events will now appear

01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:56.260
in calendars along with birthdays.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:00.860
So we've taken a deep integration
of Facebook right into iOS 6,

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:05.760
and we've taken that same integration
and brought it to the Mac.

01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:07.740
And that is Facebook integration.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:20.910
Next are some really nice
enhancements to the phone app.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.580
You've probably been in a meeting
before where you receive a phone call

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.600
and you can't answer it right then.

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:31.580
And you wish it was easy to quickly
text a message back to the person or

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.580
be reminded to call them back later.

01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:39.090
With iOS 6, there's a new control on the
right-hand side of the incoming call,

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.580
and if you slide that up,
you get two new options.

01:24:42.630 --> 01:24:47.510
You can reply with a message or be
reminded to call the person back later.

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:58.930
If you choose reply with a message,
just tapping on any of these

01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:03.960
buttons will send a text message
or an iMessage right to the caller.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:08.980
And if you choose remind me later,
you can be reminded in an hour.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:11.540
My favorite actually is the second one.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.880
Remind me when I leave.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.660
That will set up a geofrence
around your current location.

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.490
So when you leave the meeting
or leave the building,

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:24.600
your phone will pop up an alert
reminding you to call that person back.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.620
So remind me later.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.740
Next up is something we're
calling "Do Not Disturb."

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.920
I can see many of you are like me and
you've been awakened in the middle of

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:50.340
the night by a text message or a push
notification or an unwanted phone call.

01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:53.490
And Do Not Disturb allows you
to tell your phone not to bother

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.620
you with such interruptions.

01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:58.630
Now, those push notifications
and text messages,

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.730
they'll still come to your phone.

01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:04.350
It just won't light up the screen
or make a sound to wake you up.

01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:07.180
They'll be there for you in the morning.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.020
Now, you also with Do Not Disturb
get fine-grained control over

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:15.020
which phone calls you'll receive.

01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:18.230
So you can choose to receive
no phone calls at all.

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.240
or just phone calls from your
favorites or from a group that

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.200
you create in your contact list.

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.740
And if you choose this last setting here,
repeated calls,

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:33.480
if someone really wants to get a
hold of you and they're persistent

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.880
and they call you back within three
minutes because it's an emergency,

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.490
that second call will come through.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:50.750
So some great enhancements
to the phone app.

01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:53.760
Next is FaceTime.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:58.770
FaceTime is the best way to have
a video conference with someone.

01:26:59.290 --> 01:27:00.890
But there's one catch.

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.780
It only works over Wi-Fi.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.520
So what happens if you're
somewhere where there isn't Wi-Fi?

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.120
When iOS 6,
we're enabling FaceTime over cellular.

01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:22.660
So if you have either a Wi-Fi or
a cellular data connection,

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:24.070
you can now have FaceTime call.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:29.820
Also, we're unifying your phone
number and your Apple ID.

01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:31.610
So if someone...

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:34.860
Some of you already know
what's going to happen.

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:39.630
So if someone calls you on your
phone number with a FaceTime call,

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:43.970
you can answer that call on
your iPad or even your Mac.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.810
We're doing the exact
same thing with iMessage.

01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:56.260
So if someone says an
iMessage to your phone number,

01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:00.350
you can receive that and reply
on your iPad or your Mac.

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.340
That's FaceTime.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.360
Next up is Safari.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:16.020
Safari is the best and the most popular
mobile web browser on the planet.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:21.200
About two-thirds of all mobile web
traffic comes from Safari on iOS,

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.700
and we are making it even better.

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:27.250
As you heard earlier,
we're adding iCloud tabs.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.620
So from, say, your iPad,
you can see all of the Safari windows

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:35.540
and tabs that are open on any of
your other iOS devices or your Macs.

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:39.340
We're also adding offline reading list.

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:44.450
So in iOS 5, we added reading list,
which is a great way

01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:47.950
for you to save a story,
a web story away, to read it later.

01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:50.810
And now as soon as you add
it to the reading list,

01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:55.350
we'll download and cache the story so
you can go and read that even if you

01:28:55.450 --> 01:28:58.390
later don't have Internet connectivity.

01:28:58.650 --> 01:29:01.160
We're also adding the ability
to upload photos right from

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.780
Safari to your favorite websites.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.040
We're adding something we
call Smart App Banners.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.250
Now a lot of you have built great
apps that are in the App Store,

01:29:17.290 --> 01:29:19.360
and you also have websites.

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.570
With Smart App Banners,
if someone goes to your website,

01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:25.870
Safari can optionally put up a
banner letting them know about

01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:30.930
your native app in the App Store.

01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:30.930
Tapping this.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.600
So tapping that banner takes them right
to the store to download your app.

01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:43.580
And if they've already installed
your app and they happen

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:48.220
to come upon your website,
well, tapping on that will just switch

01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:50.140
right to your App Store app.

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:55.020
And the website can even tell the app
what the person was doing on the website,

01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:59.520
so they can pick up on the app right
where they left off on the website.

01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:01.090
Really cool.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:11.100
also adding full screen supports in
landscape on the iPhone to take full

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:13.900
advantage of the large retina display.

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.400
Some great Safari features.

01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:16.720
Next up.

01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.600
is PhotoStream.

01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:24.950
PhotoStream is one of the really
nice free features in iCloud.

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:29.470
It is the best way to get all of
your photos to all of your devices,

01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:31.580
iOS devices and your Macs.

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:35.760
And now in iOS 6,
we're adding shared PhotoStreams.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.350
Now shared photo streams is
a really easy way for you to

01:30:43.450 --> 01:30:45.100
share photos with your friends.

01:30:45.170 --> 01:30:46.300
It's really simple.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.220
Just choose the photos
you'd like to share,

01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:52.660
choose the friends with whom
you'd like to share them,

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:53.480
and that's it.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:54.860
You're done.

01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:59.150
Your friends will receive a push
notification with those photos.

01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:03.780
The photos will appear in an
album right in the Photos app,

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:08.180
and you and your friends can
all even comment on the photos.

01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:14.640
In addition to iOS,
shared photo streams go to your

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.560
Mac with iPhoto and Aperture.

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:21.200
You can view them in a
web browser on Windows.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:26.560
And you can even view them on
your television using Apple TV.

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:29.490
And that is shared photo streams.

01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:41.620
Next are some great enhancements to mail,
starting with VIPs.

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:44.850
VIP allows you to mark someone
whose messages you really

01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:46.920
want to be notified about.

01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:51.200
So once you mark someone as a
VIP and they send you an email,

01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:55.140
you'll get a notification right in
the lock screen of that email the

01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:58.130
same way you would for a text message.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.640
It's also really easy to find
messages from your VIPs when

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.700
you're looking at the message list.

01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:05.040
They have a star next to them.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:09.420
And we've added a VIP mailbox,
which gathers together all of

01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:11.640
those messages from your VIPs.

01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:13.800
And for those of you who
like to flag messages,

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:17.530
we've also added a
flagged mailbox as well.

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.680
We've also made it really easy
for you to insert photos and

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.400
video right in a compose window.

01:32:34.290 --> 01:32:38.320
And you can now open password protected
Office Docs right on your iOS device.

01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:44.600
And this last one,
we added a fun new animation to

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.730
pull and refresh your message list.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.360
So some great features for mail.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.150
Next up is a brand new app
we're calling Passbook.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:07.900
Now Passbook is the simplest way to
get all of your passes in one place.

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:10.800
There are a lot of really great
apps in the app store that

01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:13.990
are starting to put passes,
boarding passes,

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.500
and tickets into the apps.

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:19.970
There are some airline apps like
this one from United where you get

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:22.320
your boarding pass right in the app.

01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:25.640
There are some store card apps like this
one from Starbucks where you get the

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:30.980
store card right in the app and you can
use it to scan and pay for your coffee.

01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:34.380
And there are some movie ticket
apps like this one where your movie

01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.620
ticket goes right into the app.

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:40.400
Now this is great,
but the problem is when you get to

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.640
the movie theater or to the airport,
you have to fumble around to

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.070
find the app and then find the
ticket or the pass within the app.

01:33:49.730 --> 01:33:54.950
So Passbook takes all of these passes
and combines them together in one place

01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:57.940
and integrates it right into the OS.

01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:59.810
And they are beautiful.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.120
Here's a movie ticket from Fandango.

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:05.860
We've created templates to make it
really easy for all of you developers

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:08.430
to build these great passes and tickets.

01:34:08.490 --> 01:34:11.660
And it integrates right
into the lock screen.

01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:16.010
So when you get to the movie theater,
your ticket automatically

01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:17.800
pops up on the lock screen.

01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:20.370
Slide across here, scan it in, go in.

01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:31.740
Let me go ahead and give you
a quick demo of Passbook.

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.740
Alright so here's Passbook.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.000
I've got some tickets.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.230
So here's a Fandango ticket for a movie.

01:34:46.230 --> 01:34:48.050
Again these are beautiful.

01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:52.400
I have a nice ticket
for a Giants game here.

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.600
We have store cards.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.300
Here's a card for Starbucks.

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.000
Again, you see it has the balance there.

01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:00.230
When you use this to scan
and pay for your coffee,

01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.070
the balance automatically gets updated.

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:07.980
Here's a store car for the Apple store.

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:09.540
We have boarding passes.

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.770
Here's one for Amtrak.

01:35:13.050 --> 01:35:16.200
and here are a couple for
United Airlines and again we have two,

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.370
we group them together.

01:35:19.230 --> 01:35:23.020
Here's a coupon for Target.

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.940
Here's an express
check-in card for a hotel.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.630
Now when you're done with a card,
just flip it over.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.840
There's a trash can at the top left.

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.250
We had a little bit of fun
with this deleting your cards.

01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:49.410
Now as I said,
this is all integrated in with the

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.040
phone and with the lock screen.

01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:55.400
So if I have my phone locked and
I go to my favorite Starbucks,

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.840
up comes my Starbucks card.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.840
Slide across it, brings in my card, scan,
pay for my coffee, and I'm out.

01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:03.400
It's that easy.

01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:08.630
and all these cards are actually live.

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:11.060
So if my gate changed,
it's got an update for my

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:15.060
United Airlines gate change,
it comes up, I slide across here,

01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:21.070
there's my boarding pass
updated right in the app.

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:35.500
So that is Passbook,
the best way to get all of your passes,

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.300
tickets together in one place.

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:42.010
Next is Guided Access.

01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:49.030
We set out to make the most
accessible devices of anyone

01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:50.790
for all of our customers.

01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:54.340
And we're really proud of how
the accessibility community

01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.150
has been adopting iOS devices.

01:36:56.150 --> 01:37:00.170
And we've been surprised by the
number of children with autism who

01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:03.420
have been flocking to our devices,
especially our iPads.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.060
And we want to make that
experience even better.

01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:10.730
There are a lot of great apps on the
App Store like this one that are designed

01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:13.200
specifically for children with autism.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.000
The problem is there are some controls,
some settings and other controls in

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.440
the app that you don't want the child
to tap while they're using the app.

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:25.390
So guided access allows you to just
circle those controls with your finger.

01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:26.900
We'll figure out which ones you mean.

01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:29.260
And we'll disable those controls for you.

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:32.970
The child now can use the app
without accidentally hitting those.

01:37:32.970 --> 01:37:35.730
And we lock the device
into a single app mode.

01:37:35.730 --> 01:37:39.690
So hitting the home button
doesn't leave the app.

01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:49.090
Guided Access is great.

01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:54.500
It allows children with autism to
learn independently on their iPad.

01:37:54.650 --> 01:37:57.800
Now this is great beyond
children with autism.

01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:59.200
It's really single app mode.

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:01.540
And single app mode has
a lot of applications.

01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:04.500
There are a lot of schools
who have been adopting iPads.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.860
And some are starting to actually
administer tests on their iPads.

01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:12.620
Well, single app mode allows the
teacher to lock that iPad into

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:16.690
the test so the students can't
go look up the answers in Safari.

01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:22.450
And this also works great
for museums who use iPads and

01:38:22.450 --> 01:38:24.780
iPod touches for guided tours.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.860
So single app mode and guided access.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:52.900
[Transcript missing]

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:55.720
This is what Lake Tahoe looks like.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.620
We're doing all the
cartography ourselves.

01:38:58.730 --> 01:39:00.750
Here's New York City.

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.160
San Francisco.

01:39:03.190 --> 01:39:05.080
This is a worldwide effort.

01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:06.860
We're covering the world.

01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:13.300
Here's Italy, New Zealand, Singapore,
New Zealand, and New Zealand.

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:20.430
Norway, Paris, I'm going to go through
every city in the...

01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:24.820
Beautiful, beautiful maps.

01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:28.000
Now part of maps is local search.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.670
You have to be able to find businesses
and points of interest and so we

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:36.450
have already ingested more than 100
million business listings around the

01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:38.960
world to make a great local search.

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.030
Once you find a business,
bring up the info card

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.470
and it's beautiful.

01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:47.330
We've integrated with Yelp so
you get reviews and ratings and

01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.830
lots of photos right in the card.

01:39:49.930 --> 01:39:53.120
We're also building a traffic service.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:57.530
We have this great traffic view so it's
easy to see where the incidents are

01:39:57.530 --> 01:40:02.400
or where the slow traffic is and on
top of that we overlay the incidents.

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:06.460
So it's easy for you to figure out
whether traffic is likely to speed

01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:08.660
up in a given location anytime soon.

01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:14.250
In addition to other data sources,
we're using anonymous, real-time,

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.510
crowd-sourced data right from
our iOS users to keep this

01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:20.210
traffic fresh and up-to-date.

01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:33.130
We're also building in
turn-by-turn navigation.

01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:42.200
It's really simple.

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:45.320
Once you find a place you'd like to go,
just tap on that Quick Route button

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.950
and you're on your way.

01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:52.940
As you're going,
we'll be monitoring the traffic,

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.670
we'll give you your ETA.

01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:57.190
If the traffic slows
down in front of you,

01:40:57.220 --> 01:41:00.700
we'll update your ETA and then
we'll start looking to reroute you

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.760
around it to find a faster route.

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:05.330
If we do,
we'll offer it to you and again,

01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:08.540
you're on your way around the traffic.

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:11.580
All of this works from
the lock screen as well,

01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:14.020
if you have it plugged into your car.

01:41:21.210 --> 01:41:23.420
And of course we've
integrated it with Siri,

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:26.780
so you just ask Siri to take you
somewhere and you're on your way.

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.430
You can ask questions along your route,
like where can I get gas,

01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:37.040
and it'll look for convenient
gas stations along your route.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.880
And of course,
the kids can ask the age-old question,

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:40.880
"What

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:56.370
Now a really fun feature that
we're adding to our maps is

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:59.180
something we call flyover.

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:03.010
We have been flying major
metropolitan areas around the

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:07.570
world in helicopters and in planes,
and we've been building up a 3D

01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:11.570
photographic model of these places,
and it is gorgeous.

01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:13.990
This is what it looks like on the iPhone.

01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:16.760
It looks great on the iPad.

01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:20.300
Let me just go ahead and
give you a demo of our maps.

01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:34.360
So here's our maps.

01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:37.120
They're all vector based,
so everything is really fast.

01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.080
You zoom in and out.

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.390
You can rotate and we
rotate all the labels.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:50.660
When you zoom in far enough,
you'll see Building Store to appear.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.880
You can tap on a point of interest.

01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:53.490
Here's MoMA.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.930
Get the info card.

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.740
Again, beautiful.

01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.200
Get reviews and ratings from Yelp.

01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.250
Lots of photos.

01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:04.040
We also do 3D.

01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:07.140
So I can zoom in and see
just what MoMA looks like.

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:14.280
zoom out a little bit here,
sort of move around the city.

01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:30.900
[Transcript missing]

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:35.600
But what I really want
to show you is flyover.

01:43:35.610 --> 01:43:38.560
So let's go ahead and choose
the Transamerica Pyramid.

01:44:01.410 --> 01:44:03.190
Now this is not a movie.

01:44:03.190 --> 01:44:04.710
This is being rendered in real time.

01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:07.530
So I can go ahead and rotate this myself.

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.030
I can change the camera angle.

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.700
Fly through it myself.

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:13.740
Just beautiful.

01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:16.480
Let me choose another place.

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:20.390
How about the Sydney Opera House?

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.930
And again, I can rotate this.

01:44:25.930 --> 01:44:29.400
Let's turn it so I can
look back at the city.

01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:30.600
Right behind the Opera House.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.840
I'll zoom out a little bit,
change the camera angle.

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:42.200
And that is Flyover.

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:58.180
The last thing I'd like to show
you is turn-by-turn directions.

01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:00.550
So switch to the other device.

01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:03.570
We can't all go and get
in a car and drive around,

01:45:03.610 --> 01:45:06.480
so we have a simulator of our
turn-by-turn directions here.

01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:09.820
I'll go ahead and choose Coit Tower.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.600
I'll tap on the Quick Route button.

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.860
Gives me three different options.

01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:15.360
I'll choose Route 2.

01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:17.270
Let's go ahead and start.

01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:20.100
Starting route to Coit Tower.

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:24.790
In 750 feet,
turn right onto Greenwich Street.

01:45:24.810 --> 01:45:30.020
Turn right onto Greenwich Street,
then turn left onto Grant Avenue.

01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:35.410
Now you can watch this adaptive cinematic
camera angle as we go through corners.

01:45:36.370 --> 01:45:37.700
in 400 feet.

01:45:37.810 --> 01:45:39.490
Turn left onto Grant Avenue.

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:45.380
When two turns are close together,
we put both signs up for you.

01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.590
in 300 feet.

01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:50.700
Turn right onto Lombard Street.

01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:53.130
See where the footprint
of all these buildings,

01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:54.770
correct.

01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:58.860
In a quarter mile,
arrive at your destination.

01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:01.570
Now at any point I can
get the ETA up top.

01:46:01.670 --> 01:46:02.920
It says one minute.

01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:05.540
Simulator's going a lot faster than
you should drive in San Francisco.

01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.690
We'll get there faster.

01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:11.680
I can also just tap on Overview,
which allows me to zoom out.

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:14.830
I can see any part of
the route at any time.

01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:17.500
Zoom in over here,
just sort of pan around.

01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:20.910
Or at any point, just tap to resume.

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:27.900
See it coming around Telegraph Hill here.

01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:33.720
Arrived at Coit Tower.

01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:36.860
And that is Turn-by-Turn Directions.

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:51.260
So a brand new mapping solution
from the ground up in iOS 6.

01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:58.550
And these are only 10 of the more
than 200 new user features in iOS 6.

01:46:58.630 --> 01:47:00.560
There was so much more in here.

01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:02.410
There are game center challenges.

01:47:02.410 --> 01:47:05.250
So now if you hit an
achievement or a high score,

01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:08.550
it's easy to challenge your
friends to try to beat you.

01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:11.950
We've improved the privacy controls
so you can manage whether an

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.940
app has access to your contacts,
calendar, or photos.

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:19.570
We've completely redesigned the
stores to make them just gorgeous and

01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:22.270
fluid and better promote your apps.

01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:25.830
We're working on made
for iPhone hearing aids.

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:29.030
We want the experience of people
with hearing aids to be the best

01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:31.640
it's ever been on an iPhone.

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:34.460
We've added per account
signatures in mail.

01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.720
So if you have a personal mail
account and a work mail account,

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.980
you can have different
signatures for each.

01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:44.430
We've added lost mode to find my iPhone.

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:48.670
So if you've lost or
misplaced your iPhone or iPad,

01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:53.360
or your iPhone in this case,
you can send a phone number

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:56.950
directly to that phone,
like your home phone number

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.010
or your spouse's phone number.

01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:01.720
And now if someone finds it,
they can just tap on there and it

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:04.850
will call that phone number back,
making it that much easier for

01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:07.200
you to get your phone back.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.760
And all those features
you heard about for China,

01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:17.240
For OS X, we've added all of
these to iOS 6 as well.

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.040
So iOS 6 is a phenomenal
release for our customers.

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:26.860
It is also an incredible release
for all of our developers.

01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:33.360
We continue to strive to build the best
platform on the planet for developers.

01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:37.290
There's APIs for pass kit,
so all those passes you saw for passbook

01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:40.100
are really simple to build with that API.

01:48:40.230 --> 01:48:42.160
There's a reminders API.

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:44.600
We have in-app content purchases.

01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:49.950
So if your app today links out,
say to iTunes, to buy music that someone

01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:52.300
heard in your app,
you can now sell that music

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:56.920
right in your app with an
in-app content purchase sheet.

01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:58.560
Transit Apps.

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.730
When building Maps,
we looked around and realized

01:49:02.730 --> 01:49:07.210
the best transit apps for metros,
for hiking, for biking are coming

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.540
from our developers.

01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:11.800
And so instead of trying
to build those ourselves,

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:16.960
we are going to integrate and feature
and promote your apps for transit

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.300
right within the Maps app in iOS 6.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:37.400
and David Koehn.

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:37.400
IOS 6 is a great release for all of
our developers and we're giving out a

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:37.400
beta of IOS 6 to our developers today.

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:47.040
iOS 6 will ship this fall.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.270
It'll support the iPhone 3GS and later,
the second and third generation iPad,

01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:55.280
and the fourth generation iPod Touch.

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:56.820
And that is iOS 6.

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.470
and I would like to turn
it back over to Tim.

01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.500
Thank you.

01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:17.160
So what do you think?

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:28.340
We've seen some incredible
products this morning.

01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:30.040
Let's review.

01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:35.610
The new MacBook Pro delivers extreme
performance in a radically thin and light

01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:42.600
design with this stunning Retina display,
the world's highest resolution display.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.590
It's the most advanced
Mac we have ever built.

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:52.120
OS X Mountain Lion,
the ninth major release of the world's

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:57.880
best desktop operating system with
iCloud and the new Notification Center,

01:50:57.970 --> 01:51:01.260
Messages, Dictation,
Facebook integration.

01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:04.440
It's the best OS X yet.

01:51:04.530 --> 01:51:11.640
iOS 6 with 200 new features to
the world's most advanced mobile

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:17.460
operating system with an entirely
new Maps app that's incredible,

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:22.130
Facebook integration,
shared photo streams, Passbook, and much,

01:51:22.130 --> 01:51:23.070
much more.

01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:31.340
Only Apple could make
such amazing hardware,

01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:34.360
software, and services.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:39.580
We are so proud of these
products as they are perfect

01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:43.590
examples of what Apple does best.

01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:51.550
And ultimately, it's why people choose
to come to work at Apple.

01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:58.740
and with Apple to do the very
best work of their lives,

01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:03.410
to create products that empower
people to do great things
