WEBVTT

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.190
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Manager of the Worldwide

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.960
Developer Relations Mac OS Technology
Group,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.320
Tim Holmes.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.730
Tim Holmes: Good morning.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.700
Welcome to session 111.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.190
I'm not going to be speaker today,
fortunately.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.530
There was a chance of that due to
an impending childbirth coming.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.090
This session's gonna be a
little different than many of

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.190
the sessions you've been to.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.370
You've been to a lot of details
about technical hurdles you need

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.700
to get over to move to Mac OS X.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.700
You've learned about the
technology underlying Mac OS X.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.550
But this one is important
in a different way.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.700
This isn't just about coding.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.050
It's not just about moving your Macintosh
application-- or your application

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.700
to the Macintosh or to Mac OS X.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.700
It's about truly making
it a Mac OS X experience.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.700
There's a lot gonna be covered today.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.560
It's a long session,
so I won't take a lot of time.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.700
I simply want to introduce a man
who I consider a true evangelist,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.700
the user experience technology manager
for Mac OS X and Apple Computer,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.670
John Galenzi.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.720
-

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.220
All right, well, good morning.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.940
As Tim said,
we're going to take a different tact

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.060
with this session and look at some
sort of conceptual ideas relating to

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.290
user interface design and how to create
a really great product on Mac OS X.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.480
We're not going to be looking at APIs.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.090
We're not going to be
talking about coding.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.600
We're not going to be looking
at data structures or I/O Kit or

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.980
any low-level stuff that,
you know, a lot of you are looking

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.920
at in other sessions.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.730
We're going to be looking at the
high-level ideas behind what does it

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.700
take to create a great citizen product,
a true citizen on Mac OS X under

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
the Mac OS X--the user
experience for Mac OS X,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.330
which is Aqua.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.890
We're going to do that by first
looking at building a foundation

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.000
for why that's important.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.900
By looking at some of the benefits
that users are going to gain from

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.870
this and that you as a developer
are going to gain from creating

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.580
a product that has great design.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.210
Next thing we're going to do
is look at what are some of the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.600
scenarios that you're going to
face as you consider adopting Aqua.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600
How do you allocate your resources?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.400
Where do you spend your time?

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.580
Because there's lots of stuff to do
when you bring a product to Mac OS X.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.780
And so we're going to look at
and help you sort of set the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.630
priorities for those decisions.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.590
And the third thing I want to do
is go in depth on what some of the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.590
building blocks are for a great
product on Mac OS X under Aqua.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.430
So this is the Mac OS X desktop.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.580
We're all familiar with this.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.540
We've all, you know,
you're all running Mac OS X.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.070
You've seen this.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.900
You've interacted with it yourselves.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.230
But you know,
when Apple released Mac OS X back in,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.630
what was it, January 2000 at Macworld,
we revealed to the world an

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.900
interface that was unparalleled
on any computing platform.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.470
And the reviews that we've seen to
date have really attested to this fact,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.900
right?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.370
I mean,
the reviews we're getting are fantastic.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.080
They're talking about Aqua in
using words like "awesome" and,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.900
you know, "fabulous," etc.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.090
And, you know, they wrote it.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.890
I didn't write it.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.660
So, but the reviews are attesting to the
fact that this is a phenomenal interface.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.150
We use transparency and shadowing and
anti-aliasing to create an environment

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.900
that's incredibly attractive.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.900
And that really is the new world in which
your apps on Mac OS X are going to live.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.880
And that's why I'm going to keep
talking about this idea of citizenship.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.560
If you treat Mac OS X as if it was a
country that you were going to belong to,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.040
that your product is going to belong to,
it's going to relate to the citizenship.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.530
Are you a stranger in a strange land
or are you really a full class citizen

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.890
and a true citizen of this country?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.620
So the benefits of creating a
product with great design are many,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.180
right?

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.040
The first benefits for users are they're
going to learn your product faster.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.010
A product that's well designed,
that has a great intuitive interface

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.150
layout that leads them through
the process of arriving at the

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.590
solution that your product offers
is a product that's going to allow

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.320
users to learn the product faster.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.390
If they can learn the product faster,
they accomplish tasks more quickly,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.860
because things aren't
getting in their way.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.480
They're not confused about
where they're going to find some

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.360
given feature in your product.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.030
Windows that are laid out nicely,
that are organized properly,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.810
that have proper spacing-- and
we're going to get into all these

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.470
details shortly-- are applications
and products that are going to

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.080
enable users to get on with the task
that they're trying to get on with.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.590
And the software is not
going to get in their way.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.640
As a result of those things you're
going to increase productivity.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.030
So users are going to gain a
great return on investment.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.030
They purchased your product.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.220
They wanted to get a
solution from your product.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.240
They're getting the solution.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.800
They're getting their things done.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.500
And so they're going to have
great return on investment,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.150
which is going to save them time,
which is going to save them money

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.000
as a business or a small business.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.170
All of this stuff matters.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.120
And sometimes,
when we're developing software,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.470
we forget about those end users out
there who are using the product.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.820
They don't care about all the features,
per se, as features.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.910
They care about how those things
enable them to get the solution that

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.770
they're trying to arrive at to the
problem that they're facing with their

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.750
business or with their life or whatever.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.330
All of us have introduced
Macintosh to somebody,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.790
right?

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.340
We've all sat down with a
family member and we started to,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.840
you know,
we've been preaching them or whatever,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.100
we've been talking to them for months or
years about how great the Macintosh was.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.060
And so we sat them down,
finally we had an opportunity

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.800
to sit them down over Christmas,
holiday, vacation or whatever,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.530
and we sit them down in
front of the machine and we,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.510
you know,
it's that first experience that matters,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.890
right?

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.680
And I bet you half the audience here
will have chosen the wrong product

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.680
to introduce the Macintosh with.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.270
I've done this several times with people
and I remember certain times I chose a

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.200
product that I will never choose again.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.970
And I sat them down and I thought
this was the product that would

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.100
get them to choose the Macintosh.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.170
And they started to interact with
this thing and they got all confused

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.960
about what they needed to do next.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.250
Those were products that were not
well designed in terms of leading

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.590
the user into the task at hand and
into the solution that they're after.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.730
So increased self-confidence,
it comes about when products are

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.190
designed in such a way that users
accomplish the things they're trying

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.080
to do and they feel good about it.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.910
And ultimately,
if the users have done all these things,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.370
if they're getting things done,
if they're getting return

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.520
on their investment,
a positive return on investment,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.700
if they're feeling good about themselves
in terms of using the computer,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.700
they're going to have real
satisfaction in the purchase

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.700
they made from your company.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.200
The developer benefits
come right out of this,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.660
of course.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.640
If you've got satisfied customers,
you've got increased upgrade revenue.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.170
The chances are that a happy
customer or satisfied customer of

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.730
a previous product of yours will
buy a new product is very great,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.540
if they have a great
experience with that.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.180
Not only that, but with Aqua,
specifically on Mac OS X,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.320
if you do nothing but clean up
the interface on your product,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.740
follow the interface
guidelines completely,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.540
and add all of the
functionality that Aqua offers,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.080
and add no additional features,
people will buy the product upgrade.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.430
So you don't even need to add new
functionality specifically for Mac OS X,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.750
because people are looking
for the Mac OS X user

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.810
experience within your product.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.840
And if you just deliver that alone,
you'll get a product upgrade,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.800
potentially.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.010
So anyway, based on the user experience
benefits that we've seen before,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.900
you're going to have
reduced support costs.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.090
If customers are getting
things done with your product,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.150
Why would they call you?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.250
The software's not getting in their way.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.590
Why would you have complex documentation
if the product just sort of leads

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.850
the user through the task at hand?

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.200
Right?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.380
So reduce documentation.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.370
More positive product reviews.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.200
Probably the single most,
the single manner in which customers

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.300
and reviewers are going to evaluate
your software on Mac OS X and the

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.340
quality of your product on Mac OS X is
based on the quality of your interface.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:21.440
If your interface is half done or
shoddy or just doesn't feel like Aqua,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.180
you're going to see it
reflected in the reviews.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.280
All of us have read,
certainly those who've been

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.570
on the Mac platform for,
you know, a number of years,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.670
know about those typical reviews,
product reviews that sort of say,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.400
"You know what?

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.660
This is kind of a cool product
from a functionality point of view,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.910
but it sure feels like
a Mac port." Two stars.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.580
Right?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.730
Don't have that happen to your
product on Mac OS X when the

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.800
reviews start coming out about it.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.900
And gaining a competitive advantage.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.260
I'm taking a few minutes on these
slides because it's really important to

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.070
build this foundation for why the rest
of the stuff in this session matters.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.870
A competitive advantage can
be earned by your product.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.400
If you deliver a product that
has a fantastic user experience,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.790
because if you consider all things being
equal in a given software category,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.730
right, your competitor has the same
functionality that you do,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.520
you essentially read and
write each other's files,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.030
you do all, you know,
all things being equal,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.620
the product out of those two that
has the better user experience that

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.090
builds on Aqua the best is going
to have the competitive advantage.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.700
Not only for that,
but because you're going to

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.080
have reduced tech support costs,
simplified documentation,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.710
all the other things as a result.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.940
So how do you decide what to adopt?

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.740
You know,
what attributes of Aqua do you want to

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.240
adopt in your product as you come to 10?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.630
Well, the way to do this, I think,
is to sort of lay out a good, better,

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.140
best scenario.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.040
Kind of like we do on the
Apple Store with our software,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.900
with our hardware, right?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.060
Good, better, best configurations.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.740
Let's look at it that way
in terms of adopting Aqua.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.800
The good scenario is really the minimum.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.350
What does it take to create a great
product or a good product in Mac OS X?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.500
Well, it takes native code for one thing,
right?

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.290
And then it takes these six things.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.870
It's not enough to bring
your product to Mac OS X,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.000
to bring your code over to Mac OS X,
to carbonize or to Cocoa,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.260
bring your product right in Cocoa or
bring it over in Java or whatever

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.650
you do to get your code onto X.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.880
It's not enough to bring,
to port your code to X because that

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.560
just gets you to the operating system.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.500
But it doesn't get your product
on the operating system,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.900
if you know what I mean.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.200
So native code is one step,
but it's not the minimum.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.000
That's not what we would
consider the minimum.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.280
The minimum is native code
plus these six things,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.930
quality icons,
respecting the doc-- we'll get into

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.890
all these in detail in a minute here--
but adhering to the system appearance,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.070
adhering to the layout guidelines,
adhering to the new

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.760
windowing model on Mac OS X,
if that's going to affect you,

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.880
and providing user assistance
through Apple Help.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.220
That's the minimum.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.720
That's what it takes to
ship a great product,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.480
or a good product on 10, sorry.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.920
A good product on 10.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.180
A better product on 10 is going
to have all of those things,

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.200
native code and all of those things,
plus adhering to the file locations that

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.080
are default for every user on Mac OS X,
saving files in the right places

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.930
as predefined by the system.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.200
Adopting Sheets and doing
things like help tags,

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.680
going to the next step,
next level in terms of

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.400
providing user assistance.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.050
And of course the best delivery
of a great product or the best

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.470
way to deliver a great product on
10 is to do all of these things.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.260
Which is add dock animation
where it makes sense.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.700
Implement drawers,
take advantage of drawer functionality.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.560
And then do speech enabling your
application where it makes sense as well.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.920
So, really what I'm saying is that
to provide a fantastic user

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.550
experience on Mac OS X under Aqua,
you need to adopt the

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.790
human interface guidelines.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.800
This is a document that's been
evolving over the last year.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.050
We've continued to, we've had,
I don't know,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.800
I think it's three updates now.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.950
As of today,
there's a new update that's available

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.800
for download off our developer website.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.800
I'll give you the URL at the end.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.770
But this document is a dynamic document.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.800
It's going to continue to be updated
as we continue to add functionality

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.090
to Mac OS X and as we continue to
view what developers are doing and

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.800
help give you guys guidance in terms
of what you're doing on the platform.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.090
So step one, let's go in depth on some
of these building blocks for

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.240
creating a great Aqua application.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.260
Step one is native code.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:24.020
You all know how to do this,
and if you don't,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.020
that's why you're here or whatever.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.020
And I'm not going to go
into this in great detail.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.010
Step 2: Quality Icons Why quality icons?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.540
Probably the single most visible
attribute of your application on

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.660
Mac OS X is the icon that shows up in the
dock when the application is launched.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.400
Icons in Mac OS X can be extremely large.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.400
128 by 128 when you're looking
at the browser view in Finder

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.020
and you select an application,
don't double click it but

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.850
just select it or a document,
you see the enlarged

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.660
application icon in Finder,
right?

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.720
And application icons and document icons
on Mac OS X are extremely rich in design,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.240
in visual appearance.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.190
And they have lots of characteristics.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.420
And if you look at this
particular slide on the top row,

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:06.490
you've got user applications
which are highly,

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.940
you know, they have lots of color,
they're inviting, they're attractive,

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.040
they communicate lots about
what the application does.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.240
That's the first genre of applications,
first type of application icons.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.080
The second row is utility applications.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.720
They're monochromatic in color.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.990
They're viewed in characteristics,
visual characteristics, right?

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.520
In fact, there's a lot to say about icons
and I'm not even the expert there.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.490
And I don't want to go into any
great detail because I could

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.960
talk this whole session about it.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.390
So we've actually put a session
specifically aside to talk

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.060
about icons here in Hall 2,
10:30 on Friday.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.570
And the biggest takeaway from this
session is going to be that you will

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.120
learn how to critique icons in Mac OS X.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.800
So that when you're working
with a graphic design

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.900
agency or graphic designer,
or in-house graphic designer,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.580
and they produce a first
turn of an icon and say,

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.820
"Hey, what do you think of this
new icon?" You can say,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.360
"Well, you know, I don't know.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.640
Either it's great, or it's not,
or it needs some more work."

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.030
So I think coming to this session is
going to give you that information,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.190
give you some insight into
how to critique icons and

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.030
make some good choices.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.210
Icons are very different on Mac OS X,
and they're a very visual

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.840
component of your application,
so they're really a big deal.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:20.230
Conversations about the icon
inevitably lead to the doc,

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.230
because the doc is the keeper of icons,
right?

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.190
And there are three things that you
need to do with respect to the dock,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.520
or that you need to pay attention
to with respect to the dock,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.800
in terms of delivering a great user
experience on 10 with your application.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.800
The first two things are
things that you must do.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.850
Every application on the platform
should do the first two things,

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.820
and we're going to talk
about these in detail.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.850
The third thing is something
that some applications should do.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.850
In some instances, it really makes sense
to animate a dock icon,

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.270
but not in every case.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.400
So the first thing that every application
that ships on Mac OS X should do

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.440
is to respect the doc's location.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.690
Why does this matter?

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:00.690
Well,

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.150
Everybody's been caught currently,
because lots of

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.060
applications don't do this,
currently with windows that size behind

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:15.040
the dock and now suddenly you're caught
because you've got to move the dock

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.040
or size it down or whatever you do to
get at the resize box for the window.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.790
So every application on Mac OS X that
ships should respect the dock's location.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.160
There are APIs available
for Carbon and Cocoa,

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.310
and when you open a new window or open
a user window or zoom your window,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.200
make sure that you don't zoom
it or size it behind the dock.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.600
So this is the behavior
that you want to have.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.690
Not this.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.560
This.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.460
users will be a lot less frustrated,
and you're going to provide a

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.100
greater user experience for them.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.080
The next thing that every application
should do to provide a great user

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.580
experience on Mac OS X is to have
dot clicks always produce a window.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.890
Why is this so important?

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.140
Well, one of the things that we're trying
to get around with in Aqua is to

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.830
move beyond where we were with
Mac OS 9 and provide a better,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.720
more streamlined user experience.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.140
Not all the features are there yet.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.760
We know that.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.920
We're consistently revising
the operating system.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.220
We're going to add new functionality.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.760
But one of the things that's an
experience that we've probably all had

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.120
with someone on the Macintosh is where
people close the document window thinking

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.140
that they're quitting the application.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.240
And suddenly they're sitting
there now and there's no

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.520
windows open on the machine.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.370
They click on the background,
the desktop on Mac OS 9,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.360
and they're lost.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.500
Where'd my application go?

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.420
Where'd my document go?

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.260
I don't know what I did.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.050
And one of our design goals for
the doc and for this particular

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:35.360
principle is to make sure that that
doesn't happen anymore on Mac OS X.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.190
And if every developer out there
shipping a product on Mac OS X does this,

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.600
The problem's going to be gone.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.330
Because what happens is
if you follow the rules,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.320
if you're a document-based application,
if you have no document windows open,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.790
a click on the doc will result in a new,
untitled document.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.660
If all of your windows are minimized,
a click on the dock is going to activate

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.440
the last window that was minimized.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.240
And if you're a
non-document-based application,

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.770
like System Preferences, for example,
and you close the

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.700
System Preferences window,
when you click on the

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.840
System Preferences icon,
the app is still running, right?

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.500
What it does is it brings
up its main window.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.250
That's the behavior that every
application on Mac OS X should be doing.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.860
Animating Doc Icons This is the third
thing that relates to the doc and

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.900
this falls into the category of things
that some applications should do.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.630
Every application could animate,
it's possible to animate your

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.100
application icon and your document icon.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.580
And this should only be done in
the case where you want to provide

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.900
meaningful feedback to the user.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.300
You want to provide status and
some operation that's occurring.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.130
You want to provide some update as to,
you know, progress on some,

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.100
maybe a high-end rendering process that's
taking place with one of the documents.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.200
So when you consider
animating your doc icon,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.390
whether it's your document,
a document icon, or an application icon,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.430
think very carefully about whether
this is going to provide great

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.100
value to the user in terms of
indicating progress or status,

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.820
or whether this is just something cool.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.440
This is the kind of functionality
that we dread making available

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.700
sometimes because there's always
developers out there that go,

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.000
"This is just too cool."
And they call home and they say,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.300
"You know what?

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.920
I've got to work on something
really important." And then

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.450
they stay up all late,
late real night,

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.700
making something really neat.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.200
And yet it has no value.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.600
And the last thing that any of us
want is firing up a bunch of apps

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.190
and having the doc animating every
single icon in the doc animating.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.550
So do this where it makes,
it lends value.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.200
And don't use garish colors.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.160
Don't use blinking.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.250
Don't use, you know,
just some crazy animation

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.190
that's constantly going.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.700
Use it where it adds value.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.440
So for example, in Mac OS X,
if you look at what we're doing

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.630
with the mail application,
the mail application

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.580
icon looks like this.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.200
And when you receive new mail,
that's a status that we want

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.200
to communicate to the user.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.090
That's a situation we want
to communicate to the user.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.200
So what we do is we tag the
application icon with a red badge.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.600
The red badge happens to have inside
of it the number of new unread

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.200
messages that you have in your inbox.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.690
But that's not what's
most important here.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.700
What's most important here is
that there's a red visual cue

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.700
that your eye picks up on,
even if you're not even

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.550
looking at the doc.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.700
You're on screen.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.040
You're interacting with your computer.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.270
And yet you see that red icon up here,
certainly if the doc is up.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400
right?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.380
That's the kind of guideline that
we're looking to lay out for you,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.240
before you.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.540
Be very careful how you do animation.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.220
Do it in a way that's minimal,
minimalist,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.000
that doesn't get in the way and stand out
in a way that's going to distract users,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
but that also communicates volumes.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.080
So what happens is your eye
sees a red dot and it goes,

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.770
"Oh, I got new mail." And then you
zero on in the details as to how

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.730
much mail and whether you really
care about reading it or not.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.680
So be careful how you choose
to animate your icons.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.330
And we're going to have sessions later on
this week that go into detail about how

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.330
to do this from the API point of view,
but I don't want to get

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.000
into those details here.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.450
So before we get into the next session,
I want to talk about

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.820
what's your citizenship.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.930
I brought this up because I recently
moved to Silicon Valley from Canada.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.180
I'm a Canadian.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.690
And it's a great place to live here,
it really is.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.300
But you know,
and I'm not an American citizen,

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.400
I'm a Canadian citizen, proudly so,
but I have a work visa here.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.500
But the thing about citizenship is,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:26.890
When I go around here,
particularly when we moved in

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.230
and I started to drive around the
valley and find my way around,

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.520
I couldn't find things.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.600
There were certain things I was
looking for and I couldn't find them.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.600
And it really came down to a cultural
difference or kind of like a citizenship.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.590
I mean they do things differently in
the States than they do in Canada.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.240
They do things differently in
Europe than they do in Canada or

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.600
in the States or whatever.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.500
And so some prime examples of
looking for something and not

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.590
finding it when I expected it
to be there were three things.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.600
First of all, service stations,
gas stations.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.060
I'm driving down the highway.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.000
I'm expecting a gas station to be
at an interchange where there's

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.560
another highway or whatever.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.600
That's where they are in Canada.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.550
And so we've gone on
trips here and we've,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.600
you know, been near running out of gas.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.600
And there's no service station.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.580
It's not the visual cues
that I expected are there,

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.590
but there's no service station.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.470
The other thing is a 7-Eleven.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.600
I can't find 7-Elevens.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.590
They're not working.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.780
we're expectant to be.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.470
Usually in Canada, or in eastern Canada,
certainly the ones that I knew about,

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.520
7-Elevens were by the local strip mall,
right?

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.940
The small shopping plaza that's
in the neighbourhoods or whatever.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.440
There's always a 7-Eleven right there.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.960
Well, that's not where they are here.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.030
So I'm looking for
things in certain places,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.330
and I'm not finding them.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.690
And the other thing is lakes.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.280
Where I come from, in eastern Canada,
there's lakes everywhere.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.400
And so when I go into the woods,
go for a hike or whatever,

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.010
and I'm walking around over the hills,
I expect to see a lake.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.140
And I do.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.180
And yet when I go for hikes here in
the Santa Cruz Mountains or whatever,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.960
there are numerous instances where we've
been at a children's camp or something,

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.240
and we're walking around,
and we expect a lake to be somewhere,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:51.960
and there's no lakes.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.090
And it really disorients you.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.280
And the reason I'm talking about this is,
we showed the Mac OS X desktop

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.860
at the beginning,
right?

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.150
That's the world in which your
application is going to live.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.680
The question is,
will your application show

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.060
things in the right places
where users expect them to be?

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.990
What's your citizenship going to
be with your Mac OS X product?

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.770
And the way to show what your
citizenship is through the

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.090
next several building blocks.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.900
The first is system appearance.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.540
Aqua has very specific representation
of on-screen interface elements,

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:20.900
right?

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.320
Pop-ups look a certain way,
push buttons look a certain way,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.080
bevel buttons, radio buttons,
all of the interface widgets that

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.860
we're used to have a particular
appearance that's unique on Mac OS X.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.360
They don't look grayscale.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.190
They don't look just white
or whatever we're used to

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.490
previously on the Macintosh.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.000
They don't have other
platform appearances.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.300
They're very unique to Mac OS X.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.430
Your application needs to follow this
appearance if it's going to look like

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.970
a full-class citizen on Mac OS X.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.420
The reason that's important is because
users are going to come to expect a

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.770
particular appearance for controls,
and they're going to use that

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.890
as visual cues for visual cues
as they search out things on the

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.640
screen and know what to click on,
et cetera.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.660
So one of the new things that was
introduced with Mac OS X is toolbars.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.690
Toolbars in Mac OS X have a
striped background appearance.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.400
They have icons that are up
on the toolbar that have a

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.370
shelf-like perspective on them.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.750
We're going to talk in detail about
what toolbar icons look like in the

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.960
designing icon session on Friday.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.190
But Mac OS X toolbars have
a very special appearance.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.700
They're very cleanly laid out.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.700
Nice use of white space.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.700
The icons sit on a striped background,
as I said.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.140
There's text below the icon,
anti-alias text of the system font,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:30.570
right?

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.780
Carbon, sorry,
Cocoa developers get this for free

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.700
by using the NS Toolbar class.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.580
They just get this stuff for free,
plus the configuration sheet that

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.020
comes down to configure the toolbar.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.800
Carbon developers need to
do a little bit more work in

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.370
assembling some of the pieces,
but essentially can easily do this.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.600
The other thing about these toolbars
is they don't really show status.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.890
They're used for selecting, you know,
making a choice and moving on.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:59.070
And so when you make a choice,
when you select an icon, it darkens 50%.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.260
So when you look to roll your
own toolbar through Carbon,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.230
for example, make sure that the icon is
darkened 50%. So if you have

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.330
toolbars in your application,
this is the appearance

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.620
for them on Mac OS X.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.100
Square Bevel Button The Bevel
Button is nothing new.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.400
The Square Bevel Button was created
specifically on Mac OS X to provide

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.520
for the situation where you want
to have multiple buttons that

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.480
are related that show status.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.500
The Square Bevel Button does
a really good job of showing

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.060
which one is selected.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.980
So you have text attributes, you know,
bold, italicized, underlined,

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.390
or alignment or whatever.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.410
The Bevel Button does
a great job of that.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.690
The Square Bevel Button also is great
for in the bottom left corner or

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.950
anywhere along the scroll bar edge
of a window because it fits in there.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.800
It can be any size.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.730
It can have a pop-up
menu associated with it.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.810
It can have an icon in it.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.800
It can have a whole bunch of things.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.900
It's a great use of it there.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.220
Great for toolbars, et cetera.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.240
So this is another way of doing a toolbar
in Mac OS X or doing collections of

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.270
related items that need to show status.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.360
Another thing on Mac OS X is
the appearance of text.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.520
It's anti-aliased.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.700
It's anti-aliased everywhere.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.340
And the font that's provided through
the system is lucid or grand.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.220
When you specify a particular
font face in your application,

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.460
when you're drawing text yourself,
you should select text through meta

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.170
font specifications through the
appearance manager for your Carbon.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.980
Avoid hard coding font references.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.600
Avoid hard coding font sizes.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.200
Specifically saying,
"Use Geneva 9 for my interface,"

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.360
is something you should avoid.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.630
Those fonts may not even
be available in the future.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.570
Lucida Grande is a system font.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.000
You need to specify the font that you're
going to use to draw the text on your

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.860
interface by using meta specifications.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.100
Let the system draw it wherever possible.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.610
In one of the sessions here, 119,
session 119,

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.920
Carbon Controls and Appearance,
we're going to get into detail as

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.460
to what are the common API changes
that you need to make to get your

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.390
text to draw properly in Mac OS X.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:06.900
So one of the great ways of learning is
by looking at pictures of what not to do.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.800
or what to do.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:12.230
And in this case,
because this is just so,

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.180
as we look at applications
that are coming to Mac OS X,

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.740
we're seeing lots of great
examples of what to do.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.770
We're also seeing lots
of common oversights.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.690
So rather than fabricate some fake
screenshot that we put together in

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:28.220
Photoshop to communicate some idea,
I chose to use some real

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.760
developer examples from out there,
maybe some of these are your products,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.460
and show what some of the common
oversights are with respect

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.370
to creating a great appearance
for your Mac OS X product.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.240
What are the typical things that
developers are doing today on

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:44.240
shipping products in Mac OS X?

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.420
So that you can learn from them.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.880
And this is not an effort
at picking on a developer.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.490
This is all about
learning from each other.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.490
First one is wrong window background.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.240
Windows in Mac OS X come up,
certainly under Carbon,

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.600
by default come up with
a white background.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.790
So you need to use theme
backgrounds to get the striping,

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.090
the pinstriping background
that's common on Mac OS X.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.320
So windows on Mac OS X, dialogs,
palettes, utility windows, you know,

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.140
whatever, all the window types have
a pinstripe background.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:18.800
Your application needs to have
pinstriping on the background

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:18.800
of your dialogs in your palette
windows and utility windows.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.560
Not only does a white background look,
well basically what this does

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.170
is it makes it look incomplete.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.390
Aqua controls in fact were designed
to look best on a striped background.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.960
And using the wrong background,
although this is a really little thing,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.200
leads to bigger things like this.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.640
Custom backgrounds,
controls that don't even look.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.240
This is a Mac OS X product.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.500
It doesn't even look like Mac OS X.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.080
It's using not even
Mac OS 9 pop-up menus.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:52.950
There's no little down arrow
indicating that those are pop-up menus.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.560
These look like System 7 pop-up menus.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.390
Or not even.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.680
Um, the tabs that are being used,
those three buttons in the top are tabs.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.090
Non-standard tabs.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.810
So what this does is it
makes this product feel,

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.500
even though it has
fantastic functionality,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.210
it makes it feel like it's
not a full class citizen.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.290
Antialiased text or not,
one of the most common things that we're

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.100
seeing with product shipping-- these
are all shipping products in Mac OS X.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.590
In fact, this product comes from-- this
dialogue comes from a product

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.720
that's in fact the company's done
a fantastic job moving to 10.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.360
And yet, in this particular dialogue,
for whatever reason,

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.270
we have a mixture of antialiased
text and non-antialiased text.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.690
We have a mixture of system font
and hard-coded font references.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.080
So if you look at the right side of
this screen of this particular dialogue,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.350
we've got controls that
have the Helvetica font.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.100
They're not using the system to
draw the font in the controls,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.450
so they must be drawing the controls
themselves with Appearance Manager maybe,

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.170
but the font is not correct.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.840
We've got the labels down
the side are Helvetica.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.790
So we've got Helvetica font on some
controls and on some labels mixed

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.800
with Lucida Grande font that the
system drew on some of the controls.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.400
If you look, even there's some other
lack of attention to detail.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.100
Even the baseline of the
text on the labels and the

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.990
controls doesn't even line up.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.570
So one of the messages I want to
communicate really clearly here

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.940
is that your customers... Hold on,
one of the messages I want to

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:23.880
communicate here is that you've spent
a lot of time writing your product.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.280
You've spent a lot of time investing
yourself into the code behind your

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.100
product and all of its functionality.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:35.890
If you put on a half-hearted
effort for the user interface,

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.470
people are looking for a fabulous
interface on Mac OS X because it's

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.100
set a new standard for interface.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.920
If your product doesn't deliver that,
that's how they're going to judge

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.850
the quality of your product.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.380
And that's highly unfair probably
for the code that you've written,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.100
because your product probably
does some great stuff.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.720
But the same way that we buy
cars and we buy other things,

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.530
we look for attention to detail.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.160
If there's no good icon in your product,
if it's just got a Mac OS 9

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.190
grayscale icon that's scaled
up to 128 by 128 in the dock,

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.470
The first impression
I'm going to have is,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:07.480
whoa.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.100
You know these, wow, they,
looks like they rushed to market.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.690
And then you get this kind of stuff,
which, which further, you know,

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.740
aggravates that, that idea.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.380
Or pushes that idea.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.530
Here's another common mistake.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.590
Too small text.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.600
Every developer,
pretty much in this room probably,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.190
every one of you,
is going to argue that I need to

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.590
use small text in my interface.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.950
It's got to be really small because
my users want lots of functionality

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.280
on the screen and there's not enough
screen real estate and I've got to

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.600
cram all this stuff on the screen.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.740
Well, you know what,
that might be the case for some utility

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.500
windows and for pallet windows and
productivity applications that might,

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.600
there's probably some good arguments in
certain instances where that matters.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.600
And where that's valuable
and where that's important.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.780
But the vast majority of cases,

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.500
That we see and that
I interact with developers,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.800
vast majority of cases it's
completely not important to,

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.370
in fact you shouldn't do small text.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:02.800
I'm stumbling over my words here.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:07.390
The problem with this particular dialogue
for example is this text is so small,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.800
it's hard to read on a 1024768 display.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.520
What happens if I start
running this application on

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.650
my new iBook that has 160 P.I.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:16.540
running Mac OS X?

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.610
I can't read it.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.360
So be very careful where
you choose small text.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:28.110
Dialog boxes like this one
are transient in nature.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.550
You display a dialog because the
user told you to display the dialog.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.680
They chose something in the interface.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.860
A dialog appears.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.910
It could be much bigger.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:38.620
This dialog could grow 25% or 30%
and use the full-size system font,

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.840
large system font, everywhere on it,
and it would be equally usable.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.300
And because dialogues are transient,
they can be much bigger.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.560
You can use standard-sized controls.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.880
You can use standard-sized text,
large system font.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.090
Because I'm focused in that as a user,
I'm not interacting with other

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.140
stuff on my screen typically.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.850
Careful how often you use small text.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.590
Another common problem:
mixing small and large text.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:02.600
Here we've got a dialogue,
or a portion of a dialogue,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.330
that's got standard font
in the pop-up menus,

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:11.050
but it's got small system
font for the labels.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.180
If you're using small controls,
then use small labels.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:22.100
If you're using large controls,
standard controls, use large system font.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.460
Because what this does
is it looks incomplete.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.390
It looks unfinished.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.440
There's another thing.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.300
It might be a list.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.000
I'm not sure what this is.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.420
In fact, lists on Mac OS X have
a white background.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:36.990
This one's got a striped background.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
This list is using non-standard
font for the contents of the list.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
So it's a Helvetic or something.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
I'm not even sure what it is.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.850
The OK and Cancel are in the right place,
but we're going to get to that shortly.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:52.000
And along the top here we have,
what are they, white bevel buttons?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.920
Oh, they're column headers.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.000
Well, on Mac OS X, there's a particular
appearance for list headers.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.450
For Carbon, if you use Data Browser APIs,
the Data Browser will give you the right

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.000
appearance in Mac OS 9 and on Mac OS X.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.540
It just does the right thing
for column headers and it takes

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:08.890
care of a lot of other stuff,
like cool animation of columns

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.550
as you move them around.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.720
It does the right thing for you,
saving you, helping you,

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.590
or allowing you to focus on
the value add for your product

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.300
and letting us do the UI code.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.750
And in Cocoa,
lists can be done with NSOutlineView and

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.190
NSBrowserView and some of the
other classes that are available.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:30.600
So lists have a white background,
the dialogue has a striped background.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.560
This is common.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.310
And that is where we have a
duality in character for controls.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.230
And the most common of these is
button labels or label buttons

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.400
or... I'm not sure which it is.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.170
So as I look at this dialog,
it's laid out great.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.610
It's followed the interface, you know,
the layout guidelines,

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.980
the spacing and stuff like that.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.660
It's got full Aqua, you know,
the right pinstriping,

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.290
got the right controls,
everything like that.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:57.290
The problem is...

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.180
Is gradation a button?

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.600
Or is it a label for the
pop-up menu beside it?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.340
Well, it's both, actually.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.980
For people who are used to the computer,
they could probably figure this out,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
and it's not that big a deal.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.580
We probably wouldn't even think,
you know, very much about this.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.900
But for new users, new customers,
it's confusing.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.670
A button is not a label.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.640
A button is a button.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.240
A pop-up menu needs a label.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.240
Interface elements were
designed for specific reasons.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.270
Use them for what they were designed for,
and don't make them do

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:31.270
two different things.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.950
Going back to a dialogue that we
looked at a little bit before in

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.440
terms of the font size mixing up,
something else I want to bring

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.790
attention to is something else
I see fairly often in products

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.810
that are shipping on 10 today,
and that is this button

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:47.700
that has an ellipsis in it.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:48.880
What does it do?

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.380
I don't know.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.760
What they really want this to do
is essentially be the last item in

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.400
those pop-up menus where there's a
separator that says more or other.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.380
Right?

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.450
Maybe it's a font list or,
well in this case I forget

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.400
what's in these menus,
but maybe it's a list of font sizes

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.570
and then there's a separator spacing,
right, and then it says other,

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:10.760
dot dot dot.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.230
So unless something has to be
elevated to the primary level,

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.330
you know,
to the highest level in the interface,

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.520
a dot dot dot button is not something
that users are going to understand.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.540
And the problem here is that it cuts down
on productivity because the user has to

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.030
click on this thing to see what it does.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.200
Oh, okay.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.500
And then they make a mental note about
what this does and hopefully they

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:29.500
remember what it does in the future.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.900
Too many group boxes.

00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:38.450
One of the design goals in Aqua was to
eliminate black lines and hard edges and

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.600
move to a softer environment that has
lots of breathing space and white space,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.160
and that sort of thing.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.140
And this is a fantastic
product on Mac OS X.

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.240
They've done a fabulous job with this
from a technological point of view.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.240
But here's a great example of
a dialogue box that has way

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.280
too many group boxes in it.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.950
And in fact, the goal for the developer,
probably,

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.000
was to make the group boxes help the
user navigate the dialogue and find

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.780
the things that they're looking for.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.590
But in fact,
they've not accomplished that.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.920
They've gone,
it's in fact done the wrong thing.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.740
It's gone the other way.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.230
In fact, all the lines now make it
very confusing to read.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.940
And we're going to get into some examples
later of how to avoid using group

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.940
boxes but use separator lines and white
spacing to accomplish the same goal.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.890
And yet it makes the
dialogue far more readable.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:31.030
If you do have to use group boxes,
which are available in Aqua,

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.170
there's a primary group box and
there's a secondary group box,

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.540
which have both different appearances.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.000
So in the case where you might
have a group box within another

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.520
one where it's warranted,
there's another appearance

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.470
for a secondary group box.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.570
So look in the interface
guidelines for details on that.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.680
Mixing Platinum and Aqua.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.030
A lot of you are coming
from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.620
You're carbonizing your products.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.420
And here's a product that's
shipping on 10 today.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.810
They've got it inside
of a Mac OS X window.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.540
But the contents of the window
are completely platinum.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.940
The disclosure triangle on
the folder is the platinum,

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.870
the Mac OS 9 appearance.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.990
The folders themselves,
Mac OS 9 appearance.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:09.430
The list background is gray and white,
Mac OS 9 background.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.910
So what this leads me to
believe as a user is that,

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.860
well, is this a native Mac OS X app?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.580
Or I'm not sure,
because it feels like kind of 9.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.180
Make sure that every interface
element that you draw is native for

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.390
the platform on which you're on.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.570
What's your citizenship?

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.100
Another example of
mixing Platinum and Aqua,

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.900
here's somebody who decided
that the progress bar was,

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:38.390
you know, I don't know,
they were going to draw it themselves,

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.770
so they figured out what the pixels were,
and they're drawing this

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.770
thing by themselves.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.770
But the problem is that on 10,
it draws the same way it

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.770
always did on Mac OS 9.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:46.730
So there's a progress bar
control available in Mac OS X and

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.630
it will draw the pulsing,
you know, sort of the animating,

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.990
not pulsing, the animating progress bar.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:53.800
Common issue.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:54.660
Wrong tabs.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.560
Tabs, you know,
and some of this is because Apple in

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.700
the past didn't have a tab control.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.730
So developers had to come up with
another way of allowing users to

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.880
switch the pane in a dialog box.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.110
But here are three examples of ways
in which people have customized tabs,

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.080
in which they continue
to customize tabs on X.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.260
And for example, on the right side,
we've got two rounded bevel buttons

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.240
that they're taken out of context here,
but in context,

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.790
you would have no idea that they
switched the pane of the window.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.640
They just look like two buttons that
happen to be really close together.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.000
So if you've got a tabbed interface,
use the standard Mac OS X tabs,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.580
which look like this.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.840
They're available north, south, east,
west side of a pane.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.320
Top, bottom, left, right.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.790
and they're available in large or small,
a standard or small size.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.810
Toolbar overdose.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.400
This is actually a real
product shipping on 10.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.240
And when you fire it up
for the very first time,

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.310
you get-- well,
I think it's nine toolbars

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.660
showing up on screen.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:59.030
And not only that-- well, first of all,
what that shows me is that the

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.160
programmer or the programmers or
whatever felt that every single

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:05.230
piece of code that they wrote was
extremely important and needed to be

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.820
connected up to an interface element.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.080
Because they wanted the user
to use that cool feature.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.420
That's not what usability is about.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.130
Usability is about progressive
disclosure to your users to allow them

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.720
to move through the process of solving
a problem that they're trying to solve,

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.320
and you providing a great
solution for your software.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.800
Don't just expose every feature in
your application to the interface.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:29.780
Don't populate the menus with
every possible hook into your code.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.130
It just makes for a completely
confusing environment.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.190
This is synonymous with taking
every control in an automobile and

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.290
putting it on the steering wheel.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.100
It becomes highly unusable.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.000
You can't find anything.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.060
How would you possibly drive?

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.180
How would you do stuff?

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.160
Not only that,
but we have appearance issues here.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.290
It doesn't look like a Mac OS X toolbar,
right?

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.060
We talked about the toolbar
design for Mac OS X.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:55.500
It's clean, straight background,
nice icons up on a background,

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.740
although this is the bevel button,
which is another option.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.300
That's true.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.000
But we have the font inside
of some of the controls here

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.500
is Helvetica or something.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.540
It's not Lucida.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.340
We have a pop-up menu at
the top for percentage,

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.260
which looks like it's
trying to be a combo box,

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.020
but it's a pop-up,
but it's an edit field.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.660
So we've got this multi-characteristic
schizophrenic control,

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:17.650
which really becomes
highly confusing for users.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:19.500
And why is it confusing?

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.930
Because it doesn't look like
anything they're used to.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.600
It kind of looks like
something they're used to,

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.710
so maybe they'll figure it out.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:29.490
But it doesn't lend users to
self-confidence and to encourage them

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.110
to move on and learn the product.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.240
Step 5 about being a good
citizen is layout guidelines.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.760
We publish very detailed
information about the spacing

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.040
between interface elements.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.540
And we've thought long and hard
about why this is important.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.240
It comes down to readability.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.290
It comes down to navigation
of content of your dialogues.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.270
It comes down to localization issues.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.740
It comes down to the overall
appearance of Mac OS X.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.020
Lots of white space and
breathing room and a light,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.860
friendly,
kind of lively feeling to Mac OS X.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.000
So it's important to follow these.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.520
And we're not suggesting
that you memorize this stuff,

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.190
because we've got a great
tool that's available that

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.530
you've seen already probably,
called Interface Builder that lets

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:17.440
you basically draw your interface,
drag and drop elements on screen,

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.970
and as you drag these things on screen,
you get guidelines that sort

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.980
of snap in place that say,
"Hey, this is the right place for that,"

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.900
with respect to that other control
or with respect to the edge of the

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.740
window or the tab panel or whatever.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.490
Interface Builder is a
fantastic prototyping tool.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:36.190
Not only does it let you draw this stuff,
but it lets you hook it up to code.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.980
And you saw in the keynote address
where Scott Forstall demonstrated this.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.490
Fantastic example of
how this is a really,

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.660
this is a prototyper with a kick.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.440
It's the UI design tool of choice
and we're going to continue

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.840
to extend this tool so that it
becomes the premier design tool

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.380
for interface design at Apple.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:41:06.970
Carbon APIs are available to,
this is not only just

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:06.970
for Cocoa developers.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:06.970
Carbon developers can use the
output from Interface Builder

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:06.970
and extract the resources in
the windows that are in there.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:06.970
Those APIs exist and we're
going to talk about those in

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:06.970
some of the other sessions.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.850
So let's look at some common scenarios
that we're seeing as products

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.770
come to Mac OS X of developers
who are not adopting the interface

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.190
guidelines in terms of layout,
you know, guidelines.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.880
And we're going to look at why
this matters and how you can

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.620
transition a dialogue that doesn't
follow this stuff into a dialogue

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:28.510
that does and how dramatically
it affects the overall usability.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.700
Here's a preference panel from an
application that's available on 10 today.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.780
Fantastic application.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:41.280
And yet it's very hard
to navigate this panel.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:46.930
It's very hard to tell what's
here and you have to actually

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:46.930
read every single element

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.960
and think about it in its context
relative to the other elements to think

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.150
about whether it's the one that you want.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.000
The alternative is of course
to apply the interface guide,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.700
the layout guidelines and
you get something like this,

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.470
which has grouping of
elements that are related,

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.990
it uses a separator bar,
it uses white space,

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:08.890
and suddenly now you can quickly
scan the categories and zero in on

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.410
the category that you're interested
of the setting that you're after,

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.410
right?

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.410
So go to this or go to this.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.650
And the dramatic effect
that you see here,

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.120
if that is applied to every single
dialog box in your application,

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.880
every single palette window or utility
window or whatever you want to call them,

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:29.260
but if you take these guidelines
and apply them to your application,

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:34.720
you could ship that application
simply by applying the guidelines and

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.150
people would buy it because it looks
so much better and it's so much more

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.150
navigatable and so much more usable.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.980
So the effect on your
application moving to Mac OS X,

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.300
applying these guidelines is dramatic.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.430
We've seen developers who have
taken the time to do this and

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.420
they're blown away by the results.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.070
Their quality assurance teams
look at these things and go,

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.180
"Wow, this is great." And yet the
developers haven't done anything.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.720
They've only modified the
layout guidelines or the

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.260
layout of their dialogues.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.260
Here's another example.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.420
This is a shipping product on Mac OS X.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.200
We've got a bunch of problems here.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.400
We've got check boxes way
too close to each other,

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.970
although they're on a white list,
so we'll give them credit for that.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.660
We've got some big buttons on the right,
which we're not sure what they do,

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.660
but we'll talk about that in a second.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.760
And then we've got some text at the top,
which is the list label, I guess,

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.680
but the text is clipped.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.320
It's cut off.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.590
This is shipping on 10.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.700
So what does that say to you as a user?

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.080
If you buy a product,
you spend 200 bucks or whatever

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.930
you spend on the product,
and you fire this thing up and

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.830
there's text that's cut off.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.100
The effect it has on you is that
you have an immediate impression

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.920
and you make a decision,
you form an opinion about the

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.900
quality of that product based on
what you're seeing in the interface,

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.600
and you maybe haven't even
done anything with the product.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.950
Maybe it does provide a great solution.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.600
Maybe it does have highly
functional characteristics.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.100
And yet you make a decision about
its quality based on the interface.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.500
So for all of you out
there who are writing code,

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.180
if you're not one of the
UI designers at your company,

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.020
get on the UI designers to make
sure that they do a good job

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.600
because otherwise your code will
be misrepresented to your users.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.980
So when you apply the layout guidelines,
not only do you adjust the spacing

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.060
and get rid of the clipping text,
but you end up thinking about

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.220
the overall functionality.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.200
Does this need to be a modal dialog?

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:17.080
In fact, if we make it a modalist dialog,
we can simplify the dialog

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.670
and make it a lot cleaner.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.560
So we end up with this.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.100
Check all, uncheck all.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.950
Turns on and off all of the
check boxes in the list.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.860
We've had the spacing list,
put the right font at the top.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:31.550
Dramatic change from this to this.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.750
If you apply the layout guidelines
using Interface Builder or

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.590
whatever tool you want to use,
you get dramatic effects in your product.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.140
Dramatic usability increases,
productivity increases.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.800
So the cumulative effect of a
lot of these oversights is an

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.860
interface that's very confusing.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.220
Here's an example of a
product shipping on Mac OS X.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.000
It's a great product, it really is.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.770
But it's hindered by a
really clumsy interface.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:04.300
We've got label buttons or
button labels at the top.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:09.690
We've got features that are
just sort of existing in space.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.780
I don't know why we have a checkbox
up there below the buttons.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.860
We've got overuse of group boxes, which,
you know, aren't even laid out nicely,

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.890
so I don't know what's grouped
together really and why.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.860
There's no labels.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:27.520
We've got interface elements like a
slider control that talks about scale

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.280
that goes from a scale of nine to 4,000.

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:35.700
266.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.000
I don't know what that means.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.460
So the developer does,
and there must be a reason,

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.560
but you know what?

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.800
The user probably doesn't care.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:50.630
So be careful of elevating things
to the primary interface that are

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.630
meaningless to the user in the
context of what they're doing.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.240
Not only that, we've got something else.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.640
Halfway down the screen you see some
bevel buttons that have icons in them.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:58.600
They're disabled for this
particular screenshot,

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:05.190
but they're actually the title of a group
box that's connected by a reset control.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.230
What does that mean?

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.200
I don't know.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.700
So here's an example where someone
had a creative idea and yet when they,

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.420
if they had done usability
testing or whatever,

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.290
they would have realized
this is just non-standard.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.710
So group boxes have
particular appearances.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.970
The contents of group boxes or whatever,
you know, groupings you have

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:26.950
This is just a stranger
in a strange land.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.970
And add to that a whole bunch
of other stuff and you get an

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.460
interface that's highly unusable.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:34.350
You don't know where to go first,
although they've tried to show you

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.650
where to go first by making the
push button at the bottom very big,

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.200
okay?

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.850
And we see that a lot.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:44.370
And this is not to pick
on this developer at all.

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:44.370
I see that a lot.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.180
So when you apply the
layout guidelines to this,

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:51.890
you end up with something that's
highly more navigatable visually.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:56.490
There are visual cues, there's groupings,
dramatic change.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:03.300
Tab along the top, labels and pop-ups,
you don't have duality

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.740
of meanings and controls.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.400
You've got groupings, original image,
scanned image, image quality, you know,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.130
the center alignment of sort of
center orientation of stuff in Aqua,

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.210
great white spacing,
the proper help button,

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.200
no more closed box, all that stuff.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:25.220
Big difference in usability
between that and that.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.500
So it does matter to apply this stuff.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.530
And I interact with a
lot of developers who go,

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:30.920
oh yeah.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.600
You know, what does it matter?

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.910
Well it really does.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.000
Because we see lots of examples
as we interact with you,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.760
looking at your products on 10,
and it affects the usability.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.310
It affects the self-confidence of users.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.560
It affects their productivity.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.240
It affects all those things that
we talked about at the beginning

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.780
that ultimately user benefits
roll into developer benefits.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.080
You want to make money on Mac OS X,
make a product that is so easy to use,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.480
and so navigatable,
and so visually gorgeous like this,

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.080
you will make money on Mac OS X.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.170
It's not about just bringing your
code to Mac OS X and making it native.

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:07.900
Because that just gets
you to the platform,

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:08.520
remember?

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.400
It doesn't get you on the platform.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.210
So don't be a stranger in a strange land.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.720
I've talked about this message a lot.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.620
I'm not going to carry
on about that more.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.120
Let's talk about the new layout
in terms of the layout guidelines.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.460
This is a little bit different,
but there's a new layout

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.480
in Mac OS X for menus.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.730
And this came about, again,
to try to solve a problem,

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:31.780
an age-old problem that we've had on
the Mac whereby we've become so used

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.630
to-- certainly those in the audience who
are from the Macintosh background-- have

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:40.460
become so used to quitting an application
by going to the File menu Quit.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.690
They haven't even thought about the fact
that that makes absolutely no sense.

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:47.180
We don't quit files.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.160
You quit applications.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.150
You close files.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.140
You save files.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:52.080
You print files.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:52.700
You open them.

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:54.740
But you don't quit them.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:58.070
Although that's a term that people say,
I'm going to quit this document.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.490
But that's a misuse of the term.

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.360
We quit applications.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.780
And so we've taken the opportunity
in Aqua to introduce a new hierarchy

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.130
in the menu bar that starts on
the left with the Apple menu,

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:09.640
which is system global.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:12.620
This menu shouldn't be populated by you.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.980
This is not for developer features,
developer commands.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.560
This is for the system.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.820
And the new Apple menu is
accessible everywhere in the system,

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.400
regardless of what application you're in.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.650
You can get the same
functionality in the Apple menu,

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:28.970
unlike what you could do in Mac OS 9,
which was highly frustrating.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:32.020
Now that once you see the new design,
you go back to Mac OS 9, it's like, ah,

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:32.400
blast.

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.520
I've got to click on Finder and then go
to the Apple menu to find about this Mac.

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.000
In Mac OS X,
you just go to the Apple menu, boom,

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.660
about this Macintosh.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.880
Or this computer, whatever it says.

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.500
The next one, moving right.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.260
First one is the Apple menu,
system global.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.540
Now we have application global.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:50.900
So the things that you put in
the application global menu are

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.470
the things that relate to your
application on a global scale,

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.940
like preferences.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.520
An application has preferences.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.200
Sometimes documents have preferences.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.380
And what we're encouraging you through
the interface guidelines is to put

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.220
a preference item in the application
menu that is hierarchical in nature,

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.340
that says preferences, application,
preferences document.

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:12.040
But in most cases,
applications have preferences and they

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.550
should go in the application menu.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.800
And therefore,
with the application menu in place,

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.660
we now have a great place
to put the quit item,

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:18.040
right?

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.900
We quit processes on X.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.240
We quit applications.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.400
That's where the quit menu should go.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.690
So as you move from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X,
one of the first things you need to do

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.150
is make sure that your menu structure
adheres to the Mac OS X menu structure.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.310
Move your preferences item
from wherever it was before.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.730
In many cases, it's the edit menu,
but in many cases,

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.400
it's elsewhere and it's not
even called preferences.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.590
Call it preferences and put
it in the application menu.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.840
Moving right, we have the File menu,
which is document global, in a sense,

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.280
document centric.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.740
So you put into the File menu
the things that relate to

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.400
your application documents.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.150
Saving, opening, printing, page setup.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.380
You actually close,
we put the Close one in here.

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.450
We didn't put it in the Window menu,
we put it in the File menu

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:03.860
because you actually close files.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:07.020
And a lot of people think of it that way,
and so that's where the Close command is.

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.460
The Window menu is really
for manipulating windows and

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.260
tiling them and arranging them,
but this is where we put Close.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:16.390
So pay attention to that too.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.390
Some people overlook that.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.100
Next, moving right again.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.370
So we've got, so starting at the left,
just to remind you, right?

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.840
System global, app global,
document specific.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.990
Now we're looking at
document content specific.

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:30.300
So the next menus are all
about document content.

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:36.120
And then you've got the window
and help menu at the end.

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.810
For the system, which the system takes
care of in many cases,

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:42.640
and the help menu is where you're
going to hook up your user assistance.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.170
Remember we talked about how a good
application delivers help through,

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.450
delivers user assistance?

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:51.490
This is where you would hook up your user
assistance for Apple help on Mac OS X.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.310
Predefine file locations.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.090
On Mac OS X, every user has an account,
right?

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:02.260
And in that account, in that setup,
they've got a default directory,

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.840
a predefined directory for movies,
for documents, for music, for pictures.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:12.000
So don't put your application
support files in the music folder.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.580
Put them in the library folder
in a folder that's titled

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:15.480
according to your application.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.580
If you save music,
make the default location

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.620
the user's music directory.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.070
And after that,
if the user chooses to make another place

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:26.060
for you to save as a default location,
fine.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.640
But that's the user's choice.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.120
But a well-behaved application of
Mac OS X that delivers a great user

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.140
experience is going to respect the
default predefined file locations

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.880
that are available on per user basis.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.130
And the new interface guidelines,
by the way, they're published today

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:46.860
and available on the web,
talk about when you should

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:52.150
use those locations,
what they are,

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.150
and when they're to be used,
and that sort of thing.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.150
Another building block of a great
user experience on 10 is Apple Help.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.090
Apple Help is a lightweight HTML browser.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:02.140
Basically,
we've been talking about this for

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:06.040
two years and it's not a memory hog.

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:06.920
It's there.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.100
It's written in a way specifically
to deliver quick content,

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.490
feature-rich content.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.200
You can put QuickTime movies
and sound in there.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.780
We've got a great announcement to
make in the Apple Help session on,

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:19.440
I forget which day it is, session 125.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.900
Anyway, I think it's Thursday or
it might be today.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:21.200
I'm not sure.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:21.900
Look on your calendar.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.850
But session 125,
we've got a great announcement

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:28.800
about moving some content from other
platforms into Apple Help format.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.720
But Apple Help is the way you
should deliver user assistance.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:34.100
We're going to be extending
Apple Help functionality in the future,

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.560
of course, as we're going to extend
everything in the operating system.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:41.350
But this is where and how you should
deliver user assistance on Mac OS X.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.440
It's going to provide
an anti-aliased display.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.180
It's going to provide
really rich content.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:45.990
Do it this way.

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:47.440
Don't roll your own.

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.570
Let us deliver the services that are
user experience related wherever we

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:51.940
can so that you can focus on the things
that are going to be used in the future.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:54.820
Don't just focus on the solutions that
you need to be providing to your users.

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.180
Don't spend time writing a help viewer.

00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:58.780
We already did that.

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:02.500
And if it doesn't have the functionality
that you're interested in or that

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.770
you need for a particular case,
work with me and develop relations

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.690
to get that functionality added.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.700
Talk about that in a little
bit of detail later on.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.000
The new window layering model.

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:14.490
Here's another example of where
in Aqua we're trying to go beyond

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.600
the experience that we've had
before and solve some of the

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:18.200
problems we've had in the past.

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:20.640
In Mac OS 9,
when you have multiple applications open

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.040
with multiple document windows open,
it becomes really confusing and

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:29.140
frustrating sometimes to move data from a
Finder window into an application window.

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.230
Because every time you
click on one of the,

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.000
you know,
whether you click on Finder or the app,

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:38.860
all of the windows come forward from
that application and maintain their,

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.240
Z order.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.890
As a Canadian, I would say Z order.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:45.660
But they maintain the
ordering that's there,

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.300
that the user put in place.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.320
And that becomes really
frustrating for moving data back

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.640
and forth through drag and drop,
for example.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.190
So one of our design goals with Aqua was
to enhance that functionality and solve

00:54:56.190 --> 00:55:00.200
some of the usability issues there,
create a more modeless environment

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.910
that'll support Sheets,
which we're going to

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:04.970
talk about in a second,
but have this interleaved document model,

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.540
which allows you to have multiple
applications open with multiple documents

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.480
and interleave an Excel window with
a MetroWorks window with a WordPro,

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.300
whatever.

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:18.920
Interleave your document windows,
and it makes for a whole lot easier

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.570
movement of data between windows,
among other things.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.460
10 is sheets.

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:27.500
Sheets are fantastic.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.140
They're probably one of the
things that's mentioned the most

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:31.820
often in a review of Mac OS X.

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.640
This new interface behavior,
new interface element,

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.880
which is called sheets.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.820
Well really, sheets are just dialogues.

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.420
They're document-specific
modal dialogues.

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.680
So wherever today you have a document,
when you have a document open,

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:48.040
you would bring up a dialogue
whose contents and whose settings

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:50.780
affect the current document,
the active document,

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.580
that's a perfect candidate for a sheet.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:57.040
And the benefit of sheets is that
it moves the user into a more

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.300
modeless world where they become
modal only for that document.

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.760
Today, in most cases,
if you put up a modal

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:08.560
dialogue for a document,
I'm now forced into this

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.020
modality within the application.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:11.200
I'm modal for that application.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.820
I can't do anything else in
that application on Mac OS 9.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.840
Sheets allow me to put up the sheet,
this dialogue,

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.890
that is connected with the title
bar of a document so that there's

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:21.120
this immediate association.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.360
I can move that window around and
the sheet just follows along with it.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.310
And yet I can still interact with all
the other documents and work on the other

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.450
documents in the application that I'm on.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.040
So this is a move,
a deliberate move on our part to

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.430
move even more closely to some of the
design principles that are laid out,

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.280
software design principles that
are in the beginning of the human

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.700
interface guidelines document.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:43.580
I know a lot of people that just
sort of open that book and they go,

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.280
software design principles.

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:49.500
Oh,
that's what a button needs to look like.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.280
And they go on and they
make the widgets look right,

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.560
and yet they haven't paid any attention
to the software design principles.

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.520
Here's a great example of how we are
paying attention to the software design

00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:00.100
principles in Mac OS X with Aqua,
and moving one of those

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:01.560
principles is mode-lessness.

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.570
Don't force users into a mode where
they're stuck and they can't do anything

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.120
else but what they're focused on.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.000
Sheets does that.

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:11.090
So use Sheets only where
it's document specific.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:12.260
Help tags.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.600
Help tags is another,
is the next level of user

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.850
assistance on Mac OS X.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.380
HTML help is really just
delivery of content,

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:19.620
right?

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:22.200
It's sort of like, I need to read about,
you know, making a movie,

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.560
or whatever it is that you do.

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.370
And so the user goes off and reads
the HTML document and looks at

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:29.250
some interactive stuff and hears
some sound clips or whatever it is.

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:30.920
But help tags are all
about sort of saying,

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.540
letting the user move
around the screen and say,

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.100
let's see, what's this?

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:37.630
Ah.

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:39.410
What's this?

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:40.300
Oh, okay.

00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:41.620
So it's, what's this?

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:42.460
User assistance.

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:47.150
And the interface guidelines
talk in great detail about how to

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.730
write the content for a help tag.

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:52.800
It's pretty straightforward,
and help tags go a long way

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.840
in providing a really rich,
really informative user

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.380
experience for your customers.

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:02.310
Speech Enabling:
We've come a long way with our

00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:04.140
speech technologies at Apple.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.000
There's a session here
called Session 127.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.340
It's speech recognition and synthesis.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.110
We all talk.

00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:11.000
We all listen.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.390
These are things that we
don't even think about doing.

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.860
Wouldn't it be great if your application
could enhance the user experience by

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.270
speaking to the user where it made sense?

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.080
Say you're in K-12.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.060
Say you deliver educational products.

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:29.050
Or say you're a graphic design tool
and you want to just... Right now,

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:31.310
you say you're drawing something.

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:33.220
In today's applications,
if you're drawing something,

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.600
the mouse button is down
and that's my input device.

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.300
Wouldn't it be cool if
I could say while I'm drawing,

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:40.710
"Thicker pen.

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:42.590
Color red."

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:44.220
That's another input device.

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:47.300
And the speech technologies
at Apple allow you to do that.

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:50.800
And so think about ways in Mac OS X,
all of the APIs and all the functionality

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.100
that was there before is available in 10,
and we're going to extend this

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.180
stuff further as we're going
to do a lot of other stuff.

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.660
So speech enabling your application
can greatly enhance the user

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:03.520
experience and make you even a
better full class citizen or a better

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.400
citizen in the country of Mac OS X,
in this world of Mac OS X.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.600
Not only speech recognition,
which sometimes is difficult

00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:13.170
to do and get right,
given the environment that your

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.480
product is used in or whatever,
but speech synthesis

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.260
is actually fantastic.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.120
You can actually embed in the text string
that you give to the speech synthesizer,

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.880
you know,
little codes that say emphasize,

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.940
change the intonation, pause,
so that the speech synthesis

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.720
you get is actually very,
very realistic.

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:35.340
So imagine you're a K through
12 customer and you want to

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.300
use speech in your product.

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.210
You can actually greatly enhance
the user experience by having this

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.660
product talk back to the kids.

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.610
Or if you're a game developer,
instead of storing tons

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:47.880
and tons or megabytes and
megabytes of digitized speaking,

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:51.310
you know, digitized voices,
use speech synthesis.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.570
You just have to store the ASCII text
of the string that the synthesizer

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:58.040
would speak with some of the,
you know, encodings inside and you'd

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.940
save tons of space on your CD,
which would in turn translate into

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.480
lower cost of goods and et cetera,
et cetera.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.720
So speech enabling your application
can make sense in a lot of cases.

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:10.800
The last final building block,
which wasn't on the chart in the

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.480
beginning but I want to mention,
is consistency everywhere.

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:15.670
As we look at products
coming to Mac OS X,

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.810
and this is true on Mac OS 9,
but particularly on Mac OS X as

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.300
products are coming over,
we still see developers who say, "Ahh."

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.070
Well, I want to give it a different
way of picking colors.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.920
I've got a better way of picking colors.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.650
So they choose to offer a
different way of picking colors.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.240
I don't need to use
the system font picker.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.980
You know, I don't like it,
or I can't figure out the APIs,

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.200
or I don't know where the APIs are,
or I didn't even know it existed,

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.650
so I wrote my own font picker.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:44.140
Well, the problem with that is that users
who come to Mac OS X are going to be

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:45.480
expecting a consistent experience.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.460
It's like me looking for a
gas station or a 7-Eleven.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.900
I want a Coke or a Mountain Dew at
11 o'clock at night,

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.420
and so I say to my wife,
I'm going to go to the 7-Eleven.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.220
So I go bombing around.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.840
Well, an hour later,
I still don't have a Coke or

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.280
a Mountain Dew or whatever
it was I wanted to get,

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.560
and I'm still looking for this thing
because the visual cues weren't there.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.400
The things I was looking
for weren't there.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:07.030
If I'm looking to change a
font in all of the applications

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.740
I've ever used on Mac OS X,
do font picking in a certain way,

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.500
and now I get into your application and
your font picking is in a different way,

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.040
it's not that I can't figure it out,
it's that it impedes my productivity.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.340
It slows me down because
now I'm going to go,

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.910
"Oh,
where do I pick fonts in this product?"

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:22.880
Where do I choose a color?

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:23.790
How do I choose a color?

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.500
How does this color picker work?

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.040
We have color pickers on Mac OS X.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.600
Yes, they're different
between Carbon and Cocoa.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.160
We know that.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:29.740
It's a known bug.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.300
We're going to fix that.

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:37.950
That's no excuse to not use the color
picker that's available in the system.

01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:41.900
Because when we do make them the same,
they'll be the same.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:41.900
Your application will just offer
color picking the same way that

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:41.900
every other application does.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.900
Yes, the FOD Picker might not be
available to some of you,

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.780
depending on the
framework that you're in.

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:46.870
But it will be eventually.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.970
That's certainly our goal.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.000
We're investigating that.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.290
So build your code in
anticipation of it coming.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.600
Support Unicode in
international customers.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.160
Mac OS X, I mean,
we made a big message in the keynote,

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.930
in obvious keynote about the
localizability of Mac OS X,

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:05.340
the multilingual aspects of Mac OS X.

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:14.130
If you're going to provide a great user
experience for all of your customers,

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:14.130
which are worldwide, hopefully,
you need to think about all

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:14.130
the international issues.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.690
Use Unicode encoding for your
fonts and stuff like that,

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.040
for your text.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.180
Application bundles.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.590
That point is up there because it's about
the double click experience on Mac OS X.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:30.170
Remember years gone by back in '84
when Mac Paint was just a single file?

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.540
This application that we all love to use,
it was a single file on the desktop.

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.760
It was in a folder and you just
double-clicked it and that was all.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.840
And if you wanted to move
it to another system,

01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:41.190
your new Macintosh,
you just copied it on a floppy

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.170
disk and moved it across.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.620
It was just one icon to move.

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:46.840
Mac OS X not only does it provide
bundles that give you a single

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.500
icon that users move around,
and that icon is really just a

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.910
folder containing lots of stuff.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.150
But the bundle also gives you a lot of
other functionality that we're going to

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:59.300
talk about in one of the sessions here,
114, app packaging and document binding.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.280
And in other sessions you're going
to hear a lot about the bundle,

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.660
the application bundle.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.060
So consistency everywhere.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.890
The point of this slide is,
wherever possible,

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.320
build on system services and
system behaviors because users

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:12.740
are expecting those things.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.480
They're looking for
things in certain places.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.780
They're looking for
the common visual cues.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.220
And if they're not there because you
just decided to do something different,

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.480
it's going to dramatically affect
the usability of your product.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:22.860
It's going to affect your performance.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.240
the product reviews that you get.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.260
It's going to affect all the things
that we talked about at the beginning.

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:31.770
So in closing,
and I wish I had a slide here

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:35.880
that was the the original slide
of the building blocks for Aqua.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.820
Focus on the basics before the advanced.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.060
We've talked about a lot of
stuff that relates to Aqua and

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.720
providing a great user experience
in your Eccles 10 product,

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.530
but what we want to clearly
communicate with that chart is don't

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:52.980
go off and do cheats before you
have the layout guidelines in place.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.040
That chart is really important.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.030
Do the layout guidelines and a
quality icon and adopt the system

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:03.960
appearance before you go off
and do some of the other stuff.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.540
Respect the doc before you
go off and do doc animations.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.000
And don't do doc animations
unless it makes sense to do that.

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:13.540
Don't do help tags before
you've delivered basic user

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.300
assistance through Apple help.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.320
You understand?

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.720
So there are priorities there.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.950
Focus on adopting the system
appearance and getting the

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:22.760
layout guidelines in place.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.740
Because of all the apps
that I've seen out there,

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.330
the vast majority of them don't
yet yet do those basic things.

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:33.230
As I look around many of the
interface design discussion

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:36.670
lists that are out there,
some hosted by Apple, some that are not,

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:42.300
we see all kinds of weeping and wailing
and gnashing of teeth about different

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:47.330
features in Aqua that aren't there
or how can Apple change this or that.

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.790
But I want to just turn it,
we're aware of a lot of those issues

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:51.740
and we're going to address them.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.600
But I want to turn the
challenge back to you.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.700
As Steve said, create products that
are going to delight.

01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.300
Your users.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.440
What is your citizenship?

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.900
Are you going to exist in this
world of Mac OS X and make

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.600
your product look like a true,
you know, citizen of that world?

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.800
Or is it going to be a
stranger to a foreign land?

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:14.060
A great way to do that is to follow the
checklist for creating Aqua applications,

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.800
which is in the back section.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.710
It's one of the appendix,
one of the back sections of

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:19.800
the interface guidelines.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.800
It's called the checklist for
adopting Aqua applications.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.870
And it's a great checklist.

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:26.620
Follow that checklist and if you can
do all those things or many of those,

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:28.790
you're going to have a
fantastic product on 10.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.800
Work with Apple to enhance Aqua.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.800
If you're thinking of creating a control
that you think is absolutely important

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.800
and key to the success of your product,
don't just keep it to yourself.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.000
Work with me and Developer Relations,
I'll give you my email address shortly,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.130
to convince me and I can work as
an advocate on your behalf to get

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.600
Apple to add that functionality
in the system potentially.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.420
And then everybody can benefit
from that functionality and the

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.800
whole platform will benefit.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.050
Thank you.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.200
So what's your legacy?

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.840
Mac OS X has the capability,
has an interface that's unparalleled

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:06.200
of anything we've seen before and
the reviews would attest to that.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.450
You have an opportunity to release
a product that on X sets a new

01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:12.590
standard in interface design,
sets a new standard in terms

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:14.190
of appearance on Mac OS X.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.180
What's your legacy?

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.190
What do you want your legacy
to be as a software developer?

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.310
Do you want to be known for having,
you know, yeah it does a lot of stuff,

01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:24.690
but man,
I don't know how to use the product,

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:25.500
you know?

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:29.580
Or do you want to be known as a
company that delivers fantastic

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:35.060
solutions that delight customers and
that feels like it's part of the OS?

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:36.620
Oh, who made this?

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.090
Wow.

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.380
You know, I thought this was part
of the OS or whatever.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.070
What's your legacy going to be?

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:46.560
It's not only about APIs and features
and elevating all those features up into

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:48.990
a toolbar that's completely overloaded.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.400
Last thing, I want to do a plug for the
Apple Design Awards tonight.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.150
The Apple Design Awards is
four categories.

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.260
One of them is
Best Mac OS X User Experience.

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:01.830
We're going to highlight a runner-up
and a winner in that category,

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:04.900
as well as other categories,
where we're going to say these

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.040
products set the standard to
which every other product in

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.760
Mac OS X should be coded towards,
in terms of user experience.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.600
So come to the
Apple Design Awards tonight.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.740
It's going to be a fun event.

01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:16.690
Last thing,
just some information for you.

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.760
Inside Mac OS X,
Aqua Human Interface Guidelines,

01:07:18.830 --> 01:07:19.860
they're available now.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.000
A new version is
available on the website.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:24.900
There's a new web page up there
that went up a few weeks ago.

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:28.200
It's from developer.apple.com/ue.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.370
It just basically links to all kinds
of discussions about windows and

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:33.280
dialogs and icons and all this stuff.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.450
It's great to sort of drop into that
one page and you've got contacts out

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:39.960
into the Carbon and Cocoa worlds for all
the different interface elements that

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.960
I've talked about today and a lot more.

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:44.710
And then there's an interface
discussion list that's hosted by Apple,

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:45.560
which is up there.

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:48.770
And you don't need to write
down these URLs because in fact,

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.500
in the last slide that I'll end up on,
there's a single URL you can visit.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.600
It's got this session number with
all of that information below it.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.460
Just point you to a few more
sessions that are coming up.

01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:00.380
Session 119 and 120 that are
tomorrow in hall two right here.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.870
They're going to talk there in
those sessions specifically about

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.990
how to get the right appearance

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:09.220
If you look at some of the
common oversights we looked at,

01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:11.970
how do you get beyond, you know,
striping that doesn't line up,

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:13.300
which isn't even an example I showed.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.760
How do you get beyond a white background?

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:17.890
How do you get beyond, you know,
the wrong halo around your controls,

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:20.270
or controls that animate, you know,
all those sort of things.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.090
That's a session to come to if
you're a Carbon developer and you

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:23.020
want to get around those issues.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:27.440
Designing and using Aqua Icons, again,
great session to attend to learn

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.060
how to critique and decide whether
the icon that somebody's made

01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:31.230
for you is the right one or not.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.480
Apple Help, again, straightforward.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.530
Speech Synthesis Recognition,
please visit that one.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.030
Session that's going to be very
interesting and I would encourage

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.100
you to attend is Session 114,
where we are going to set clear,

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:47.210
as many of you have asked us to,
make a clear statement about

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.250
what is going on in terms of
file naming and document binding

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:51.320
and application packaging.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.180
What are the rules?

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.140
What should I do?

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.340
All these sorts of things.

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:55.780
Come to that session, please.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.230
And Interface Builder.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.110
Learn about Interface Builder.

01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:59.770
If you haven't played with it,
go to Session 702,

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.520
even though it was yesterday,
but you can watch it on

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.520
the DVD or something.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.010
And the last thing is feedback on Aqua.

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:06.880
We love to get feedback on Aqua.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.900
There's a feedback forum.

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.050
It should be a really fun event.

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.860
It's this afternoon.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.700
Please come to that.

01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:15.160
I've actually run out of time here,
although I've got about five minutes.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.480
I think I could take a couple questions.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.060
So if I want to ask the
Interface Design Team,

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.400
a couple of you want
to come up front here.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.000
We'll take a few questions,
but there's a feedback forum for

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.340
Aqua and then for the high-level toolbox.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.770
And here's my contact information.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:32.450
Please work with me as you look to
get a few things added to the system

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.270
when you consider adopting Aqua.
