00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.470
In 1998,
Apple Computer became the first computer

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.000
company to make open source development
part of its ongoing software strategy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.970
We've had great successes then,
and today we'd like to give you an update

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.200
and status on some of the projects,
which includes Darwin itself,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.000
QuickTime Streaming Server,
OpenPlay/NetSprocket.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.780
At this point,
I'd like to bring on stage the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.790
director of CoreOS Engineering,
Brett Halle.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.440
Good morning.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.370
Certainly open source at Apple,
I think one should realize,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.000
is becoming fairly pervasive
through our project plans.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.110
And certainly this isn't the only session
at all that's dealing with open source.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.000
But in this session,
we're going to spend some time

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.230
today and actually go over kind
of more of the infrastructure and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.000
mechanisms and stuff behind what
we're doing around open source.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.630
And you can learn a lot about
open source throughout the week

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.000
and other sessions as well.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There's a huge number of
technical sessions for Darwin,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.100
something on the order
of 20 different sessions,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.000
as well as some of the
other technologies.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So it's not just here we're going
to be talking about open source.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.210
This is something that's pretty
consistent throughout much of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.000
the technology discussions.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.750
So we're going to spend a few minutes
and talk about a number of the various

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.000
projects around open source at Apple.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.790
In addition,
we're going to give you a little

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.050
idea of where we're going,
particularly in some of

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.000
the infrastructure and
stuff that we're doing.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.120
We're going to talk about how we're
going to support to kind of enable open

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.960
source development in the community.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.050
And most importantly,
how you can get involved and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.000
participate in the process.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.400
So first, it's worth mentioning that
our public source license,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.210
version 1.2,
was released just a little while ago.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.760
And that's actually been
extremely well received.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.270
Since the original release
of our public source license,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.800
we've been working with the
community to kind of refine it

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.800
and make it work well for both
our developers and Apple Computer.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.770
And I think we've done extremely well.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.350
And clearly the community believes that
because we've been approved by the OSI as

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.800
being a certified open source license.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.590
Certainly something
we're very happy about.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.330
I'd like to now actually make
a bit of an announcement that

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.120
we've added a new project to the
open source projects at Apple.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.300
This is CDSA,
the Common Data Security Architecture.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.940
Thank you.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.100
Sounds like that one person
is very excited about this.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.320
This is an open group standard.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.130
It's basically the basis,
the underlying foundation for a lot of

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.420
the security features within Mac OS X.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.890
Support for the key chain and
other key services of the system.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.760
It provides a number of modular
plug-ins for cryptography and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.890
certificate management and key
management and things like that.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.900
This is now available as of today,
I believe.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.740
We got all the stuff all up
last night and this morning.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.740
It should be available now on our website
for you to download and play with.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:05:43.800
[Transcript missing]

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.010
There's a ton of projects
being ported to Mac OS X,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.460
and I think to a large degree that's
because of the open source nature of

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.600
Darwin and other parts of the system.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.470
It really fosters the philosophy of
being able to get these kinds of services

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.700
and capabilities under the system.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.950
As of today, for example,
as I understand it,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.990
on sale in Developer Depot is a
CD of something like 1,200 ports,

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.830
BSD ports from the ports collection.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.080
1,000?

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.840
2,000!

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.840
Oh my goodness, sorry.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.820
You know,
tools and commands and applications,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.890
if you will,
to run into the Darwin environment.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:51.470
and David LeRoy.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.730
Also, I think that's one of the other
aspects that we think is pretty

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.730
important is being able to actually
keep up with the community at large.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.730
There's an order of magnitude more people
involved in the development process and

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.730
there's a way to really leverage that
community far beyond the walls of Apple.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.730
I think it's a pretty important
capability and facility.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.730
Certainly,
all of this really comes down to

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.730
trying to make sure that we make the
best possible products we can for

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.730
our customers and our developers.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:08:33.000
[Transcript missing]

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.460
and much like there's
quality benefits for us,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.340
I think that's true as well to
the open source environment.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.930
The reason it works is because
there's a lot of people working

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.590
on the technologies and everybody
benefits by the improvements in the

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.730
quality and testing capabilities.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.620
For Apple, this community is growing
pretty significantly.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.430
Since we released Darwin,
we've had over 700,000 downloads,

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.060
which is pretty darn significant.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.480
Even the next door is clapping,
I think this is great.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.130
They think it's pretty cool.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:13.460
We've had over 95,000 users
registered on our site.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.030
And that's a pretty significant
developer community.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:24.390
Our mailing list activity year over year
has grown by two and a half times a year,

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.900
it's exponential.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:25.900
And we're at this point about 1,800,
you know,

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.840
items in the mailing list
discussions every month,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.620
and we see this growing at
a pretty ferocious rate.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.220
Clearly as we've reached major
milestones of reaching to the developer

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.600
preview releases and the public beta
and now of course the final release,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.890
this ends up being pretty
significant milestones of

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.320
developer involvement and adoption.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.000
And as people continue to port their
products and technologies to Mac OS X,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.710
this is a great forum for
them to participate in.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.900
If you're not on the mailing list,
we encourage you to.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.010
There's a lot of great discussion there.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.700
There's a lot of activity going on,
specific activity going

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.870
on in the community well.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.400
Certainly we're actively involved
in supporting the FreeBSD and

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.770
changes and things that we have.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.140
There's a very vibrant
relationship there,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.320
sharing information about security issues
and collaborations that we're doing on

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.960
packaging and other kinds of things.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.930
Also, we work very tightly
with the IT department.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.460
We're very involved in the
development of the freeBSD.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:24.460
We're very involved in the
development of the freeBSD.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.650
We're very involved in the Apache group.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.090
We've certainly had them on campus and
sponsored their activities and try and

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:36.420
provide hardware and other things to them
as well as fixes to support the platform.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.220
The X386 project, MySQL, PAM, et cetera,
there's a number of projects where

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.050
there's been a lot of two-way activity.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.170
In addition,
there's been quite a lot of interest in

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.240
the open source developer community to
actually port Darwin to the X86 platform.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.000
And we've, you know,
been supporting that work.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.240
That's not something that, you know,
we're doing for any

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.140
product direct interest.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.740
This is something the community
is pretty excited about doing.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.040
And as that work continues to evolve,
we take the fixes and changes

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.620
incorporated in the source base so that
people can take advantage of one shared

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.720
source for all of that technology.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.470
The streaming server has been ported
to just about every significant

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.890
platform that's out there.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.730
And as a result,
you can make sure that it's

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.880
possible that you can stream
QuickTime content on just any,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.900
anything that you want.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.080
Also, certainly I'm sure you've seen
recent announcements on things,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.840
new participants in
NetSprocket and OpenPlay.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.800
And there's been a lot of
positive progress there.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.220
And we'll talk more about
that in a few minutes.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.400
In addition, we've been really, you know,
working with the community.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.500
As I said, there's been a lot of fixes
and things that have come in,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.470
things like security fixes or
other fixes that have come in.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.560
We've actually, you know,
watched those things.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.420
If there are opportunity,
we fold them into software updates.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.120
So as you have seen, we've had, you know,
three software updates

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.620
since Mac OS X was released.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.840
And in those,
when there's been opportunities

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.970
to include security fixes or
things from the community,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.880
we do.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.910
And like I said already,
the support line has been kind of now

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.070
kind of dealing with this new concept
of getting fixes along with their,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:12.980
with bug reports.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.400
So there's been quite a lot
of exciting activity there.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.790
We have this as part of the
infrastructure for working

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.000
with the open source community.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.680
As I mentioned, it's not just Apple.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.510
We actually have people in the
community who actually have write

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.920
access to our CVS repositories and
actually in a position to contribute

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.520
directly to the code for Darwin and
some of these other projects.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.220
And these folks we
call Darwin Developers.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.800
These are partners in the open
source arena for a number of

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.120
specific open source projects.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.720
They should be considered peers to
the rest of the engineers and people

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.140
at Apple in terms of their ability
to help contribute code changes

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.080
and kind of participate in the
process of evolving the source code.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.470
They can help with questions and then
certainly they're in a position because

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:08.380
they have CVS commit access to be able
to commit changes and modifications

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.360
and things into the CVS repositories.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.670
Obviously from a standpoint of
just managing the source code,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.860
it's not a very easy thing to do.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.480
But again,
we do try and make sure that they

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.930
are specific point people for
each of the key technologies.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.360
But again, it's worth noting that those
people aren't necessarily

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.240
people who work for or at Apple.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.970
These developers are folks
that the community and the

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.400
core team of Darwin have
selected for technical ability,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.390
kind of well-known participation
in the open source community,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.830
folks that are actually approved
by the Apple executive management.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.330
So that they actually -- we are giving
them access to our repositories,

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.340
like I said.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.600
There's quite a number of
people who are involved in this.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.110
and here's a list of some of the
key people if you're involved with.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.400
And one important announcement
that I want to make today is that

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:09.900
we've just recently in the past day
signed Jordan Hubbard of FreeBSD to

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:15.360
be part of the Darwin core team.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:20.070
Jordan, if you can raise your hand.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.000
If you know,
Jordan is actually one of the

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.180
founders of FreeBSD and is certainly,
I think, the real spiritual leader

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.900
of the FreeBSD community,
if you will.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.380
We really take involvement and
collaboration with that community

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.900
to be a very serious goal of
Darwin and our open source project.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.900
So we're really glad to have
him on as a Darwin developer.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.530
In addition, there's a large number
of other people here.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.900
I won't go through this.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.900
You can look at the list.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.980
But you'll actually get a chance
to meet some of these folks here a

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.670
little bit later in the presentation.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:57.100
So from my particular section of this,
I think one other thing to note, again,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.030
is that there's some really important
benefits we see to open source.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.460
This is not an experiment for us.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.540
This is the way we do business for
Mac OS X and for a large number of our,

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.860
you know, technologies.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.770
And this is something that we're
really working to try and make

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.360
work well for Apple Computer.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.810
We really, you know,
think this is something that we're,

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.340
you know, is a real benefit to you.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.190
We think it's a benefit to Apple,
to the open source community,

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.300
and to our customers.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.700
And we really would like to, you know,
have you guys be part

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.740
of that more and more.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.200
So if you get an opportunity,
please get on the mailing list,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.750
get involved,
and we'll talk a little bit more

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.660
about how you can do that and some of
the specifics in just a few minutes.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.620
You'll see, as mentioned today,
with the growth of addition of

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.670
CDSA now in our open source arsenal,
that, you know,

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.190
this is something that we're, you know,
continuing to evolve and grow

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.540
projects that we think are appropriate
candidates for open sourcing at Apple.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.100
And, you know,
if you're interested in it,

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.820
if you think you're one of those
people who really can make a

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.740
contribution and want to be directly
involved as a Darwin developer or

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.850
just as part of the Darwin community,
we'd love to have you.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.610
So up next in the presentation,
we have a number of things

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.390
we're going to talk about.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.810
Dave Dozicki is going to come up next
and talk about some of the support

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.100
resources and kind of the mechanisms
for supporting the community.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.480
He's also going to talk about
Darwin itself and how you

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.120
can get involved in building
and working with that.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.900
Chris LaCroix will talk a bit
about the streaming community.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.760
He's going to talk about
the streaming server.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.560
Lane Roth for NetSprockets and OpenPlay.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.260
And Ron Hayden will talk about our open
documentation efforts with HeaderDoc.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.660
And we'll also do some Q&A in the end.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.600
And on that, I'll pass this on to Dave.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.570
Alright, so we're going to start off
talking about what infrastructure

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.810
you guys have to work with us.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.520
First of all, let's start off with
our Darwin repository.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.820
Our repository,
where most of our projects live,

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.460
is beyond our firewall.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.320
So,
you guys can get at it fairly quickly.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.140
And our external Darwin developers
have direct access to it,

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:04.640
too.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.010
We also have an internal repository
where some of our non-live projects

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.450
live for a few specific reasons.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.710
Either we've got source code from
third parties that we can't release,

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.950
there's some information we've received
under NDA that we can't release,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.980
things like that.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.220
But we try to minimize that where
we can and keep our projects

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.290
in the external repository
where you guys can get at them,

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:32.710
read the history, read the comments,
know why we did things the way we did.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.810
We have a web form where you
guys can come in and provide

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.340
us with patches or feedback.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.060
Those will come to us and
also they're available to our

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.400
Darwin developers so we can get
them back into our CVS repositories.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.260
And of course our Darwin developers
work with us and you,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.880
the community,
to incorporate changes and fixes

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.350
into our code to make it better.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.360
We have a bug tracking
system inside of Apple,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.030
of course.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.780
We also thought it was good for you
guys to be able to see what changes

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:09.460
we're making or need to be made so
you can help us out if we need it.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.210
You can browse and submit
them via our website.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.350
It is incorporated with our
internal bug tracking system,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.940
so it's not a separate
bug tracking system.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.160
It's just an import and
an export of our bugs,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.570
so you don't need to worry about
any disconnect in nature of the

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.000
bugs that are reported there.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.680
They're what's in our
bug tracking system.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.190
And we update it three times a day
so you guys can see quick updates.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.270
These are a bunch of
the resources we have.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.300
There's, of course, our main website.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:45.910
There's also our page on CVS and how to
use it at Apple with our repositories.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.940
We have a few main resources.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.940
We have our mailing list
hosted on list.apple.com.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.930
That includes Darwin development,
our main development mailing list.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.060
That includes Darwin OS users,
our kind of discussion list for

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.940
people that are actually using Darwin.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.640
And there's also some mailing
lists for the streaming server

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.940
and the security project,
also known as the CDSA project.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.940
And I think that's it for mailing lists.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.800
There's, of course,
our bug tracking system if you want to

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.940
see what's going on with our projects.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.970
a list of our
Darwin developers is available.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.530
We also have Hexley,
which is a logo that was come

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.370
up with by the community.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.740
Of course, created by John Hooper for the
use by the Darwin community.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.400
There's also T-shirts available
that you can talk to us later.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.080
You saw Brett, of course,
wearing one and there are a few

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.700
others of us around here wearing them.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.050
and now I'll talk about Darwin itself.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.160
Darwin is the core of Mac OS X.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.700
It's the foundation.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.840
It's the same.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:53.370
You can swap in a kernel you build
yourself from our repository with

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.080
the kernel provided in our system.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.860
We consider that very
important that you can do that.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.590
And, you know,
if you ever run into any problems,

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.710
let us know.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.730
But it works today and we
plan on keeping it working.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.530
So now you've probably
seen this picture a lot.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.850
We'll show it to you again.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.000
Darwin is the foundation of Mac OS X.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.630
It provides the file systems,
the networking, Mach, I/O Kit, drivers,

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:26.810
and it also provides user land
which would probably sit right

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.950
next to QuickTime and all sorts
of other-- or Cocoa actually.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.790
Yeah, the foundation of MEGAUS 10.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.870
It's BSD based with a
Mach kernel and I/O Kit.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.060
We think it's very important that it
is BSD based because it provides a

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:41.120
foundation for lots of your applications
to be ported over in a quick way.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.170
It's extensible to provide
support for a lot of file systems.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.320
We already have a bunch
in the base system today,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.060
including HFS, UFS, NFS, UDF, MS-DOS.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.620
But there's certainly more out there,
and we'd like to see them.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.720
It provides dynamic and flexible
configuration management.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.530
As you've seen in earlier presentations,
we provide things like mobility,

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.380
hot plug of disks, and et cetera.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.380
And it supports multiple platforms,
and we'd certainly like to see more.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.680
Today we support PowerPC and x86.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.310
You can download binaries for both
platforms from our website and be

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.080
able to run them today on your system.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.550
And now we're going to have
a demo by Wilfredo Sanchez.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:26.840
- Hey Brett.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.850
My name's Fred Sanchez,
I'm a Darwin developer.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.840
What that means is basically that,
like anyone else who works at Apple,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.190
for Brett in the CoreOS group,
can you log in for me?

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.630
I'm one of the engineers
that works on Mac OS X.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.970
I'm one of the authors of some
of the software that you'll see

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.500
in your system when you boot up.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.480
In particular,
I wrote a program called System Starter

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.290
which turns your computer on
from the sort of... Init has run,

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.290
you've just turned the computer on up
to the state where it's safe to bring

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.400
up the login prompt for the multi-user.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.480
Tomorrow there will be a talk
on performance and Joe Sokol

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.040
and Robert Budage will be like,
"Why isn't the system started?

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.970
It doesn't go fast enough."
That's a personal affront

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.490
to me so I had to fix that.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.470
And so I got a demo here of
a thing I've been hacking on.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.530
Yes, sir.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.020
Flip the switch?

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.590
Demo 1?

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.200
Alright.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:31.790
I am going to bring up the very
famous terminal application,

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:35.280
which scares a lot of people
but is a lot of fun for me.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.340
If you're a Darwin developer,
you spend an awful lot of time

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.300
on the Unix command line prompt,
so this shouldn't scare you too much.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.540
Basically, System Starter is like
all good Apple software,

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.330
it has a demo mode.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.590
So I'll show you how it normally works.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.400
It runs a series of startup
items in serialized order.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.400
So it knows this item has to start
before this other item can go,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.400
and it runs one at a time in order.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.520
And what I did different here
is if you turn on your computer,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.390
you might notice that it
takes a while to run each one,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400
one at a time.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.950
And this might have looked different
to you in that you see a whole

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.380
bunch of things happening at once,
and then you see a few more,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.400
and then you see a few more.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.490
So what I changed is
that the startup items,

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.460
rather than running serially in order,
it'll run as many as it can possibly

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.400
run all at once in parallel.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.380
And then as soon as it
can run another one,

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.400
it runs a few more.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.540
And so the debugging app what
you see here is it's showing you

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.150
like it's launching a whole bunch
of commands and then waiting on

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.340
the right one to exit for you.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.940
And I do this because I have
a vested interest in seeing

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.400
Mac OS become a better system,
mostly because I don't want to use it.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.400
I want to use Windows for
the rest of my life.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.040
And I don't work at Apple,
but I have access to the software

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.400
and I can do this as well,
and so can you.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.370
Now before you think I'm a liar,
I actually used to work at Apple,

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:58.400
which is why I wrote this,
but now I don't, so it's all good.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.400
So that's my demo.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.400
Do I do the -- can you do that?

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400
Back to date.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400
Thanks.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.440
Can we switch back to the slides?

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.930
So the roadmap for
what's left in the week,

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.340
we have a 193 leveraging
BSD services in Mac OS X.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.720
It's going to be in the
Civic Center Friday at 2:00 p.m.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.890
We have 140, the Darwin kernel,
which is also going to be at the

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.960
Civic Center on Friday at 3:30,
which I highly recommend for those

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.790
of you that are interested in
what's going on inside the kernel.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.940
And then there's our feedback forum on
-- also in the Civic Center at 5:00 p.m.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.020
So up next, we have Chris LaCroix
from the QuickTime group.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.670
Thanks Dave.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.810
I'm just going to really
briefly go through,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.900
or kind of provide some status
on where we're at with the

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.500
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:06.490
First thing I want to do is kind of take
care of some confusion that people have.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.500
There's a Darwin Streaming Server and
there's a QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.240
And people always ask, "Well,
what's the difference between those

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.500
two?" And there's actually nothing
different at all other than the name.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.030
QuickTime Streaming
Server is just a branding,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.500
our brand name that we use for the
Mac OS X version of the server.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.500
Other than that,
they're built from the same source code.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:29.500
The Darwin platforms are FreeBSD, Linux,
Windows NT, Solaris.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.870
It's all identical source code.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.500
They have identical functionality.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.500
They have the same
user interface as F3.0.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.490
There's no difference.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.700
and David LeRoy.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.880
So here's what, here are the platforms
we currently build on.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.400
The ones on the top are platforms that
Apple actually builds and tests on.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.740
So, those,
and we actually provide binaries that you

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.240
can download of all of those platforms.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.700
The ones underneath are platforms
that other people have ported to.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.520
Mac OS was done by some guys in Brazil.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.370
There's a SGI IREX port.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.690
Compaq actually ported it to
their true 64 systems which are

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.540
like massive 64-bit big hardware.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.100
And it's been ported to a bunch of
other Linux I or Linux S or whatever the

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.500
In 3.0, the newest features are we've
added a web-based administration.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:21.760
That's one of the things that allowed 3.0
to be exactly the same on every platform.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.040
In versions 2 and earlier,
we actually had a little

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.120
Cocoa app for Mac OS X.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.960
We've gotten rid of that and
everything is all web-based now.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.170
We've added some broadcast automation
functionality which allows a

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.060
broadcaster to automatically
start up broadcasts to a server

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.660
which then get reflected to clients.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.660
Skip protection is new.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.230
Skip protection is just another
brand name for a collection of

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.830
quality of service enhancements
that we've added to 3.0 and will

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.260
continue adding in future versions.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.620
We've improved the authentication.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.130
We now have Digest MD5 authentication.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.570
and we've done a few minor API changes.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.220
So if you want to hear more about these,
there's a session tomorrow that

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.390
will go into a lot more detail.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.500
and so here we're here's
where we are with downloads.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.700
So we have over 150,000
downloads of the server itself.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.780
The client has over 150 million
copies of the client in distribution,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.590
which is a pretty big number.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.560
And then the number I just looked up
recently which kind of surprised me

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.550
is that we have over 500 developers
that are currently subscribed

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.220
to the developer mailing list,
which means that they're

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.500
actively watching mail go by.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.040
So I guess we've got probably
the biggest... We have the

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.560
biggest development team for any
streaming server in the world.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.300
I guess you can look at it that way.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.270
and another thing I did is I just
kind of did a search on Google for

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.410
QuickTime Streaming Server,
Darwin Streaming Server,

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.360
just to kind of see what kind
of people were using this.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.240
And here's a list of some
of them I came up with.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.200
There are actually a bunch.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.950
I got like a massive number of pages
in Google when I did the search.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.680
So NASA's using it someplace.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.220
I'm not sure exactly
what department it is.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.830
Popwire actually does
some pretty cool stuff.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.320
They've got, they provide kind of
internet radio station.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.970
And they've taken the playlist
broadcaster portion of the server

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.910
and modified that so that you could,
it,

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:12.110
provide crates of an internet
radio station that has ad

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.110
insertion and things like that.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.110
Vancouver Film School has
standardized on the server.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.690
They actually use it for,
they've got a little internal

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.840
TV show that they do and they put
that up on the web in streaming

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.200
format for quick time only.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.200
SurfNet TV is,
I think that's the European site,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.200
I actually don't remember what they do,
this is a week ago that

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.200
I looked at this stuff.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.200
Ink Tomy has created a caching
proxy that works with the server.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.190
Compaq, as I mentioned,
ported it to their 264 system

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.200
and they include that as,
one of the things they provide

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.200
is a collection of open source
software for that platform.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.200
And the Darwin Streaming
Server is one of those items.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.200
And the Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory,
they've got a camera that's up

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.200
in the crater and is actually
watching the volcano all the time.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.200
And they've got a live stream
that you can go and watch.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.990
They use the Darwin Streaming
Server for that.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.840
Some of the resources are the
mailing list that I just mentioned.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.120
If you go to lists.apple.com,
just search for the word "stream"

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:05.950
and you'll see two lists.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.530
You'll see a developer
list and a user list.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.940
They're both actually
good to subscribe to.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.350
They don't have a massive
amount of traffic,

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.590
somewhere between 5
and 20 messages a day,

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.500
but they're all really
focused and good messages.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.670
So it's actually good.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.480
And all of our engineers are
actually up on those lists too,

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.950
so that's the best way to
get a hold of those guys.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:32.120
You can get all the information about the
product up on Apple's open source site.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.120
And then you can go to the QuickTime site
if you want to find out more about

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.880
QuickTime and more of the client
side features of QuickTime and

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.250
how they interact with the server.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:47.960
and a couple of, or three,
four more sessions.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:55.670
So there's a "Broadcating Live"
with QuickTime streaming or

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:55.670
broadcasting live at 5 o'clock.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.560
And then tomorrow we've got two
sessions that are server-side only,

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.740
starting at 9 o'clock.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.330
Just an overview of the server.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.400
I'll go into more
detail about the server,

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.140
how it works, the new features,
things like that.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.920
And then we'll have a bunch of the
engineers come up in the 407 session

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.120
and show you all the different
ways you can customize the server.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.640
It's truly the most customizable
streaming server in the world.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.020
And then we've got our feedback
forum on Thursday at 3.30.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.140
And we'll also be at
the Beer Bust at Apple.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.590
All the engineers there,
so you can kind of look either in the

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:27.030
server group or the QuickTime group.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.140
We'll be in one or the other.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.120
And that's it.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.580
Next is Lane Roth.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.480
Thank you.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:49.300
All right, so I'm covering the
OpenPlay effort within Darwin.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:53.630
The biggest news is that NetSprocket,
which was released as

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.940
open source a while back,
is now part of the OpenPlay effort

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.800
and it has been carbonized.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:08.170
All of the NetSprocket functionality,
all those APIs are now part of

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.010
OpenPlay and are being tested
right now and getting all

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.080
that functionality working.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.730
Currently,
the package that will be checked

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.230
in to CVS shortly consists
of two separate projects:

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.520
the OpenPlay project and
the NetSprocket project.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.850
This is a legacy of how this all
came to be and how it was developed.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.100
It makes things a little
bit tough to figure out.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.840
We are working to correct that.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.310
We will combine both of those
projects into a single project

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.040
that will be called OpenPlay.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.300
This will alleviate some of the
weirdness with having multiple

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.910
directories that are the same name
and some duplication of source files,

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:47.830
so forth like

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:53.300
The current NetSprocket source is
available and will remain as such,

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:59.680
but all future work will be on
the combined OpenPlay project.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.570
Okay,
so the networking API is designed to be

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:10.020
cross-platform and protocol agnostic.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.280
Currently,
it is running under Mac OS X in

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:17.900
a carbonized form under
Mac OS as well as under Windows.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:23.490
There is a TCP/IP network module that
is available for all of those platforms,

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.900
and then Apple Talk is
available for Mac OS.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.760
There are three API layers
to the new OpenPlay.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.030
There's the game interface,
and that's the highest level interface,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.870
which was known
previously as NetSprocket.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.890
That interface is what most of the
games and other applications will use.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.890
The protocol interface was the
former straight OpenPlay interface.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.060
It's a lower level interface
just for connecting and

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.900
passing packets back and forth.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:59.190
The networking interface is
just a wrapper to go around

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:04.900
the different networking APIs,
and most people won't be using that.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:09.130
It all comes together as you see.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:15.150
Your application can talk to any one
of the three APIs within OpenPlay.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:23.990
You can also talk directly to any of the
OS networking APIs as you feel needed.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.200
Inside of OpenPlay,
the game interface talks to the

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:31.420
protocol interface and that talks
to the net module interface that is

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.920
selected for whichever game you're
running and it will talk directly

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:40.350
to the networking API in the OS.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.700
Okay, so the game interface, as I said,
is the highest level interface.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.600
This is basically the NetSprocket API.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:53.440
It's the easiest way for
you to add functionality,

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.500
networking functionality to your game.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.750
The APIs handle hosting games,
joining games,

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:06.050
it handles all the game management,
it handles your player management

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.400
for just two or more players.

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:13.100
It also handles packet management,
so you can send data back

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.700
and forth very simply.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:20.830
You don't have to worry about a lot
of the details like all the wrapper

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:27.400
functions are in the cross platform
segment are swapped in their byte order.

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:32.040
You still are responsible for
doing that for your specific data,

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:36.340
but you don't have to worry
about all the underlying data.

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:39.100
That's all handled by those APIs.

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:44.400
It's cross platform again, OS X, Mac OS,
Windows.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.330
The protocol interface is
a lower level interface.

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:56.690
This is where all the platform
agnostic and networking wrappers are.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.850
Like I said,
there's IP for all the platforms

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.270
and there is Apple Talk for Mac OS.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:10.900
And then besides running
on the mentioned platforms,

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:17.150
this interface has a start
into a Linux version and that

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.770
is underway by the community.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.580
The networking interface is just
a very low level wrapper to go

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.600
around your different protocols.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:32.140
It has a plug-in design so that
in the future if it's needed,

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:37.220
somebody can drop in a new protocol
module and they can do that

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.030
independent of the release package.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:44.180
So you can do it just if you
have some private networking

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.750
API that you need to do,
you can have your own separate module

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.190
and not have to check it into CVS.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:56.820
This single API can also be used
by your program if you want to have

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:02.900
that very low level control and
still have the network diversity.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.900
And that's it.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:19.270
and I manage the
Darwin Documentation Project.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.330
So a couple years ago,
Apple obviously did a big leap into

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.650
open source with Darwin and then a few
months ago we did another major leap

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.100
into open source with our documentation.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:35.890
It was a recognition that
the documentation is often as

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:35.890
important as the source code and

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:44.210
What the purpose of this project is,
is to provide the tools and

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:48.640
resources to allow developers to
provide the documentation directly.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.160
Which is very exciting for me.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.530
I've worked for a long time in
technical publications and one of

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.460
the things I've discovered is that
frequently the writers are a bottleneck

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.100
to the information that you need.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.470
The engineer may have the information,
especially reference material.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.100
The engineer may have written down
that information for the writer.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.100
The technical support people
may have the information.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:13.100
Some of our customers using the
product may have the information.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:16.100
But because of the enormous number
of things the writers have to cover,

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.100
that may not get into the next release.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.100
And it's wrong.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.060
And it's a problem.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:25.220
So one of the things that we're learning
from open source is how to remove that

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.000
bottleneck and let the person who has
the information provide the information

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.100
as quickly as possible to the audience.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.560
This doesn't mean that we're not writing
documentation anymore or that we're

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.100
asking the community to provide it all.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.520
We have a Darwin Technologies writing
team which is concentrating on

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.100
some of the big picture stuff.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.470
So we're doing an
IOCAP fundamentals book,

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.380
we're doing KEX tutorials,
we're doing stuff on handling

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.100
USB and HID and such.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.870
But the actual reference material
is more and more frequently

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.100
coming directly from the engineer
and getting into people's hands.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:00.100
So here's the things that we cover
in the Darwin Documentation Project.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:04.000
First and probably most
important is HeaderDoc.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.060
And what is important about HeaderDoc is
that it's a very simple process.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.100
It's a very simple process.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.030
It's a very simple project.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.090
It's a very simple project.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.180
And the reason about this is that every
person in this room who's doing a C or

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.100
C++ project should be using HeaderDoc.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:40:48.700
[Transcript missing]

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:00.020
So as you can see,
we have quite a lot of different projects

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.500
and things that we're involved in.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.850
Apple is extremely
committed to open source.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.940
As I've mentioned before,
this isn't an experiment.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.130
This is a way we're doing business.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:12.400
And you'll see more and more
involvement from us as each day goes by,

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.390
as new projects come online as
it's appropriate and we get more

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.250
and more infrastructure in place.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:21.340
We really want to encourage you to join
the community of open source developers.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.030
There's, as I said,
over 3,500 just on our

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.940
mailing list alone.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.880
There's a lot of great information
there and there's a lot of people who

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.290
really know the software inside and out,
including a lot of the

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:32.730
internal Apple developers.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.760
This is a great way to
get to them directly.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.620
And the people are quite
willing to jump on and answer

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.410
questions if you've got any.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.520
So please participate.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.160
There's a lot of conferences
that we're also involved in,

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.210
so in the open source community and such.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.260
So we're going to be at MacHack.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.920
We have a number of different
sessions there where we'll talk about

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.340
the booting architecture and more
information about Darwin and a number

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.590
of other talks going on at MacHack.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:02.040
At USENIX, we have one,
a Boffin participation going

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.220
on that Ernie will be at.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.900
And as well, we'll be at the O'Reilly
Open Source Conference.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.540
I know I have a talk there,
an executive forum talk,

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.980
and we've got some others as well.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.300
So we're certainly looking at ways
that we can be more involved in

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.180
some of these external activities.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.180
And if you're going to be there,
we're going to be there too.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.580
So on that,
I'd like to have Jason come up,

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.140
and we're going to do some Q&A.
