00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.680
Welcome to session 125 about Apple Help.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.190
One of the blocks on my good, better,
best diagram was titled Apple Help.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.940
And I was talking about how providing
user assistance is really key.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.380
And what's interesting to
note is that in the good,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.110
better, best diagram,
providing user assistance with

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.240
Apple Help was in the good scenario.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.180
It's one of the basic blocks of
building blocks for providing

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.970
a good user experience.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.970
It's one of the basic
building blocks for Aqua.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.940
So a lot of times people think
about help as sort of being the last

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.760
thing they do for their application.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.840
And really,
it's one of the basic building

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.850
blocks for your Mac OS X product.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.140
So it's great to see great
attendance in the room here.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.970
I'd like to ask very quickly,
just do a little impromptu survey here.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.630
How many of you are currently
using Apple Help in your product,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.360
say on Mac OS 9 or something like that?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.280
Okay.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.710
How many of you are planning to
or hoping to use Apple Help for

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.800
your Mac OS X product?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.170
All right, fantastic.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.730
So that's really great.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.530
So what we want to do in this session
is we're going to have a little feedback

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.230
attitude in the San Jose welcome room.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.170
And we want to talk to you about how
easy it is to get Apple Help going

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.180
and then move into some details about
the APIs and all that sort of stuff.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.360
And then we've also got some
really cool announcements.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.690
So I'd like to welcome Gordon Meyer on
stage from our Instructional

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.940
Products Group at Apple.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.210
And he'll walk you through
some of the basics here.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.760
Thanks for coming.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.300
It's good to see you all.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.640
I've been looking forward
to this session all week.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.870
So let's get right to it.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.360
This is our agenda for today.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.490
We're going to start out talking a
little bit about help philosophy,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.090
the things you can do in your
help systems to make them good,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.610
to make them really hit the mark.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.670
Then we're going to move
into a discussion of the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.800
help viewer at Apple Help.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.860
We're going to look at
all of its features,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.620
demonstrate them for you,
and then we'll examine some of

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.760
those features in detail so you can
see what they bring to your help

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.340
system and how to implement them.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.150
Then we'll talk about authoring,
how to create an Apple Help book.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.150
You'll see that you can take existing
HTML content and move it into

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.300
Apple Help in about five minutes.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.260
It's very easy to implement.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.330
But I know that all of you are
not coming from a system where you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.120
already have HTML Help content.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.980
You might have content in another format.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.620
So we'll talk about converting
to Apple Help as well.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.080
And as John mentioned, we have a special
announcement about that.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.330
So if you currently work
in Quick Help or Win Help,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.600
be sure and stick around because
there's a great new tool coming aboard.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.920
After we talk about conversion,
we'll cover everything you need

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.360
to know from the programming side
to hook up to the help system.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.740
The APIs, how to handle your help menu,
how to put help buttons in dialogs,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.600
and so on.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.540
And you'll be pleased that there, too,
using Apple Help is very simple.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.990
Finally, we have time at the end for Q&A,
so if there's something that we

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.110
don't cover or you have questions,
please be sure and come up to the mic.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.190
Because before you leave the room,
we want to make sure you have

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.700
everything you need to start
implementing Apple Help and get

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.310
your application shipping on 10.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.300
I was really pleased by the
show of hands to see how many

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.550
of you are moving to the system.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.550
We've had great adoption so far,
and I'm anticipating a lot more now.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.300
One too many.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.580
So let's begin with a little discussion
about the philosophy of help.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.240
These are some ideas and principles
that you might find useful as

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.560
you create your help systems.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.200
They're things that we try and
keep in mind as we create ours.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.360
Well, starting at the 10,000 foot level,
what is it about help?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.410
What role does help
play in an application?

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.300
Well,
it's one part of the documentation suite.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.860
And what do I mean by
a documentation suite?

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.850
Well, I have a very broad view of that.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.760
You see,
the documentation suite is everything

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.620
you include with your product that
helps users understand how to use it.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.200
You might have a printed manual,
on-screen help certainly, a tutorial,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.040
a read me, your website.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.110
All of those things contribute to user
experience and to the user education.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.380
But so does the UI of the application.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.150
Help tags, error messages, dialogues,
and the UI itself communicates

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.430
to people how to use your app.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.170
So that's a pretty broad
collection of things.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.620
So let's focus on help.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.230
I mean, every one of those has something
that it brings to the party

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.580
for helping users understand.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.320
But since we're here to
talk about on-screen help,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.670
let's look at that specifically.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.700
So what is the role of help?

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.520
What does it provide that some
of those other things don't?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.710
Well, for one thing,
it's a companion to the computer.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.340
When you're using an
on-screen help system,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.570
you know that your user has a computer in
front of them and has your application.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.780
That isn't necessarily true for
those other things I mentioned.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.500
Why do people use help?

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.790
Well, often it's a last resort for users.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.170
Now, not everybody uses help this way,
but many do.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.360
And in fact, I do myself.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.380
I have a little story to illustrate this.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.810
I think you'll find that
as you think about it,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.760
this might be how you use help as well.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.290
So this was a couple weeks ago,
and I just made a CD with iTunes.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.920
I burned some of my
favorite songs on a CD,

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.860
and I wanted to make a CD label.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.790
So I launched Illustrator,
and I drew a couple of circles,

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.420
figured out how big they needed to be,
typed my song titles in and so on.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.730
And on the label,
I wanted a title for the CD,

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.050
but I wanted the title to
kind of curve around and match

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.360
the roundness of the label.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.970
And I didn't know how to do that.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.820
I'd never taken text and
set it on a curve before.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.930
So how did I approach the task?

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.230
Well, I looked through all the menus,
and I tried out the various tools,

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.900
and tried to figure out how to do it.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.700
I brought all my experience
to bear with Illustrator to

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.410
try and tackle this problem,
and I failed.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.500
So my next step was to find
somebody else who might know.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.560
I looked around me, among my colleagues,
and asked a few questions.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.600
Hey, does anybody know how to do this?

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.080
And it turns out they didn't know either.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.360
So at that point, I had two choices.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.080
I could give up and decide, well,
who cares if the text is curved?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.450
Or I could turn to the documentation,
turn to the help,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.260
and try and find my answer,
which is what I did.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.970
And I got in there,
and I found my answer.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.580
And it was a springboard for me.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.520
I was back working in Illustrator,
completing the label the way I wanted to.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.180
And it was great.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.410
It was a very good help experience.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.360
and that's how many users come to help.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.220
So what can you do to your help system
to optimize that kind of experience?

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.190
It's an important role.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.770
There are a couple
principles you can follow.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.940
How do you optimize your help system
for providing a great user experience?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.780
Well, you should consider thinking
about a minimalist approach.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.880
Now,
if you're an instructional design person,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.550
you know that minimalism is this
entire school of thought and it

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.560
has a lot of principles and some
baggage associated with it as well.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.920
But I'm not going to go into all of that.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.570
There's really three principles
that I have from that school of

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.520
thought that I want to talk about.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.350
And if you're not familiar with this,
don't think of minimalism as

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.200
meaning don't provide any help.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.100
That's not what it means at all.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.490
It sounds like it from the name, I know.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.590
So what you want to do is you
want to focus on real-world tasks.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.890
People come to the help
with a task in mind.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.530
In my case, it was curving text.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.400
I wasn't looking for help on
using the Fit to Path tool.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.600
You want to emphasize troubleshooting.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.720
Because people reach an impasse, right,
they've tried to figure it out,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.980
they've asked for help, they couldn't,
they come to the help

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.400
with the documentation.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.600
There's a problem.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.570
They want to get on with their work.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.400
So include troubleshooting
information in your help.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.320
Now separate troubleshooting sections
are all fine and well and good,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.400
but if you can include troubleshooting
information with your task instructions,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.610
it's even better.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.470
Because that's where people
are likely to find them and

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.230
likely to encounter the problem.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.700
Another principle you can use is
acknowledging prior experience.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.190
Now, I know all the authors out
there do audience analysis,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.730
and they think about, you know,
who am I writing for?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.080
Who's the person who's using this?

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.740
Well, apply that principle down
to the very task level.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.310
Think about the topic you're describing,
the type of person who wants to do this.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.360
For example,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.860
Someone who's coming to the
help and looking for information

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.830
about making a font italic,
probably a novice user.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.240
They need a certain level of instruction.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.170
Someone who's coming to the help and
looking for information on kerning

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.820
pairs is probably an advanced user.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.900
They bring a lot to the
table about font technology.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.820
Acknowledge that as you
provide instructions.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.720
We've all had the experience of turning
to a help system and finding the

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.010
information there either too basic or--

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:42.200
[Transcript missing]

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.500
Another high-level principle you can
use is to exploit the environment.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.300
The on-screen help system is
on-screen and on the computer.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.340
It's not a printed book.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.190
You can do things in on-screen help that
you couldn't dream of doing in print,

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.210
such as providing automations and
using animated graphics and so on.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.780
Likewise related to books,
it's kind of easy to find stuff in books.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.560
We know how to do that.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.860
You riffle through pages
and you flip through things.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.100
On-screen help, you can't do that.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.630
You need to think about the structure
and making things easy to find

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.420
so people can locate information.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.940
It turns out that search is
a really good way to do that.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.410
And we're going to talk about some of
the search technology we have built

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:22.410
into Apple Help to help you with that.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.430
And finally, when you write your tasks,
write for following along.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.790
Assume the user is following the
instructions you're giving them.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.510
A book has to be very
narrative in its nature,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.160
right?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.640
Because the reader might be
on a train or on the beach,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.060
might not have a computer with them.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.330
And so when you look at a book,
it needs to provide task instructions

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.610
and kind of a narrative of what's
happening on screen as you're doing these

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.520
things to keep everything in context.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.770
When you're on a computer,
the user has probably come with a problem

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.770
and is following your instructions along.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.530
If the UI speaks to the user
and enforces conditions such as

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.460
clicking OK or making sure a value
has been specified and so on,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.390
let the user interface do that.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.540
Take advantage of those other pieces
of the documentation suite that are

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.770
available because you're on the computer.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.620
Help tags, for example,
error messages and so on.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:18.400
It's not necessary to be as narrative
in on-screen help as it is in a book.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.760
So, yeah,
I know what some of you are thinking.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.500
That's all well and good,
but I've already written a help system,

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.740
right?

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.910
That's fine.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.680
There's still something you
can do to make sure your help

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.580
really hits the mark on Mac OS X.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.520
And to do that,
you just need to provide a consistent

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.860
help experience and adopt Apple Help.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.220
As John mentioned,
it is the help system for the platform.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.160
We've worked hard to make sure the
help system is optimized for delivering

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.830
on-screen information like this.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.220
We've built in some special features
that you're going to hear about today.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.840
So that's one thing you can do to
join the platform and make sure that

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.290
the user has a consistent experience.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.100
You know,
John mentioned in his talk yesterday at

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:07.070
the Adopting Aqua guideline-- Adopting
Aqua session that using custom controls

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.090
that don't go with the rest of the
UI can be confusing for people because

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.720
they come to your app and they're like,
oh, well, gee, what are these?

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.080
Well, a similar situation
happens with the help.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.860
If you roll your own help solution
and don't use the help viewer,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.310
when your customer comes
and looks up the help,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.350
they're coming with a task in mind.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.680
But they open the help system and
they see what you've created and

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.230
then immediately their task becomes
figuring that out instead of getting

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.190
the answer to their question.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.140
So I've talked about the features of
Apple Help and how we try to optimize

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.290
it for the on-screen environment.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.630
Let's take a look at it in action.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.430
This is Jess.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.780
Jessica is the tech lead for
Apple Help and she's going

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.180
to drive the demo for me.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.110
That way I don't have to point, click,
talk and pace back and

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.170
forth all at the same time.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.300
So let's start with the Help Viewer.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.680
This is kind of the core of Apple Help.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.140
It's an HTML display application.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.350
You see it here on screen.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:17.660
There's a little opening animation we've
included in Mac Help to welcome the user,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.710
invite them to type in a question.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.690
And that's actually a Flash movie
playing in the Help right there.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.580
Let's talk about the UI for a second.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.260
You see across the bottom we have some
navigation controls and a status area.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.900
Across the top we have a very
simple interface for searching.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.520
We have a large text field and a
nice pulsing Ask button because we

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.180
want to encourage people to search.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.440
So we've typed in a search string.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.590
Why don't we go ahead and
click Ask and see what we get.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.520
So that fast,
the Help Viewer has searched through

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.530
all of the content in Mac Help,
some 300 pages or so, and has presented a

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.940
relevancy-ranked list of results.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.120
Those are topics that are most
relevant to what Jess typed in.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.440
Let's take a look at one of them.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.560
So this is, again,
as a standard HTML page.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.160
You see the topic of the page.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.360
The yellow area there in the
middle actually indicates actions.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.820
We're doing that in Mac Help.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.280
Kind of echoes back to the
color of help tags that you

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.060
see throughout the interface.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.540
At the bottom,
you see a couple of hypertext links.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.690
You can tell because
they're blue underlined.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.920
But these are examples of something
else we've built into the help,

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.220
which is special handling
for certain types of links.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.840
And that one says
Open System Preferences for Me.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.910
Why don't we click that?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.430
You'll see what happens is that
System Preferences comes to the front.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.120
We've actually launched
that from the help system.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.160
Behind the scenes there's an Apple script
that's running from that href.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.040
So when the user clicks it,
we run the script and tell

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.930
System Preferences to come forward.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.710
This is a very simple
example of automation,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.670
which we'll talk more
about in a few minutes.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.360
The other link, Tell Me More,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.330
does a pre-program search in the Help.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.390
You'll notice up at the top there,
there's been a new search term entered.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.690
This is a way of gathering
related topics without having

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.460
the hard link to other pages.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.530
And again,
we've searched all of the Help and

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.620
presented the most relevant topics.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.600
Let's look at the Help Center.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.720
So the Help Center here
is unique as well.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.600
This represents all of the help
books that are available on

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.100
the system for the user to use.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.900
You can see Mac Help, iTunes Help,
and one that I can't read.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.650
Why don't we take a look
at that second one there.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.960
So it turns out that this is
Japanese input method help.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.310
And of course, as a Mac OS 1080 program,
the help viewer is completely

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.800
international and can display
whatever you need it to display.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.370
So also installed on this
machine is QuickTime.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.910
Let's take a look at that.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.920
So QuickTime help is rather unique.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.360
Now this page looks a lot like Mac help
and this page is stored on the hard disk.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.290
But the rest of QuickTime help
is on the Internet.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.790
It comes from servers at Apple.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.980
And the help viewer has a very special
feature built in and it's able to

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:56.270
find a page even if it exists on the
Internet instead of the local hard drive.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.520
So let's click a topic here and
again this is going to do a search

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.500
to come up with some related ones.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.780
We'll go into one of these.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.510
and that page you're looking at
just came from Apple's servers.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.040
See, we're able to do the search
locally without connecting

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.550
to the internet because our
search index is stored locally.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.090
But this page came from the help servers.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.650
Now, of course,
it happened really fast because

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.160
we have a good network connection.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.270
If we had a slower connection,
you'd see a little status message

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.040
and a progress bar appear at the
bottom of the help viewer window.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.380
So this allows us to continue to update
the help after the product is shipped

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.590
and make sure it's good content.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.800
Also here is another link at the bottom.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.310
This one is go to a website.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.420
When we click that,
we just pass it off to the

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.890
web browser and load the URL.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.700
The help viewer,
when it encounters a hyperlink

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.750
that it doesn't process internally
or does not refer to a help file,

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.450
it passes it through the system
to the appropriate handler.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.530
Let's talk some more about searching.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.200
Let's look for something
about sound here.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.090
Sound volume, that's a good choice.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.340
So again, we've searched the content.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.580
You can see all the stuff from
QuickTime that's available.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.200
We didn't connect to
the internet for that.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.670
But at the bottom of the page,
you see there's a link

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.220
that says Search All Help.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.150
When we do that,
the Help viewer searches all of the

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.800
available help books on the system:
Mac Help, iTunes, QuickTime, and so on.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.200
It's presenting the most relevant
topics from all of those books.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.470
When you adopt Apple Help,
your book will be listed in the

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:30.130
Help Center as well and will be
searched exactly the same way.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.140
That's it.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.050
Thanks.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.610
We'll see you in a few minutes, Jeff.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.870
So we've talked about how help can be
a benefit to users in providing a good,

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.560
consistent user instruction
experience on Mac OS X.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.910
But what are the benefits for
you as authors and developers?

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.100
Well, it's very easy to author.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.090
Apple's embracing open
standards everywhere,

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:01.960
as you're hearing
throughout this conference.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.250
And Help is another example.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.980
We use standard HTML.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.290
You can author Apple Help with any
HTML authoring tool you choose.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.080
Anything from a Go Live or
a Dreamweaver to BBEdit to

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.840
Stickies to whatever you choose.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.200
Something on another platform.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.640
Whatever you use to author HTML today,
you can continue to use with Apple Help.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.020
It's also very easy to implement.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.160
These features we just
saw in the Help Viewer,

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.460
the internet connection, the searching,
all of that is provided

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.760
by the Help Viewer.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.330
There isn't anything special that
you have to do as an author to

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.860
enable those or make those work.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.040
And most importantly,
it's one help solution for Mac OS X.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.060
Carbon, Cocoa, it doesn't matter.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.050
You can adopt it and deploy
it with your application.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.100
So let's look at the
specs for the system.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.840
It renders HTML 3.2.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.520
That's without JavaScript or forms.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.280
Natively plays QuickTime movies.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.740
You saw an example of a
Flash movie playing in there.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.020
But you can use any
QuickTime media you want to.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.230
QuickTime supports over 200
different media formats-- JPEG,

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.290
GIF.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.980
Flash, MP3, you name it,
basically QuickTime can play it and

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.800
you can use it in your help system.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.040
And again,
by saying we play QuickTime natively,

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.830
I mean we do not use
the QuickTime plugin.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.700
We use the Sherlock Engine for searching.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.080
That's how we get our fast
searching and our relevancy ranking.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.200
You can launch AppleScript from
a simple hyperlink.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.460
We'll get into the syntax of that later.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.560
And you can retrieve
content from the internet.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.540
The Help Center that you saw displays all
the books that's available for the user.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.500
This is based on permissions.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.380
If the user does not have permission
to launch your application,

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.440
your help does not show
up in the Help Center.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.090
That way users are insured of seeing
reference material only for applications

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.660
that they're actually able to use.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.420
And if you're familiar with
Apple Help from Mac OS 9 and Mac OS 8.5,

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.540
where it started,
you'll be pleased to know that

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.760
you no longer have to store your
help in one single location.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.200
It works seamlessly with help stored
on the network or on the hard disk and,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.450
of course, on the internet.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.210
So I'd like to talk a little bit
more about this internet-based

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.120
content because it's a very
important feature of the Help Viewer,

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.560
and it doesn't work like
it does in a web browser.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.290
You might think it does,
but it behaves differently,

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.740
and let's look at it.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.160
So the help viewer prefers local content.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.650
It always looks locally first.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.940
And by locally,
I mean in your help folder with

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.590
the rest of your materials.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.280
If it can't find it there,
if that file is missing,

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.030
then it will look in a cache folder.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.640
Every user has a help cache and
the help cache contains files

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.470
that were recently downloaded.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.490
If it doesn't find them
in the user's help cache,

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.840
then it goes to your site and
retrieves the page using HTTP.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.280
Now you tell us where you're going
to put this content on the Internet.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.020
You give us the URL to
pre-append to the location there

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.360
when you index your content.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.010
and once we do download a file,
it's cached locally for three days.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.780
That way users can come back and
look at it again without having

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.560
to reconnect to the Internet,
but it doesn't stick along so, you know,

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.030
stay around so long that it's stale
and in the meantime you may have

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.240
updated what's on the Internet.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.060
I have a little illustration
here to demonstrate this.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.760
So the simplest scenario,
a page is requested,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.910
it looks on the disk and it finds it,
and so the help viewer opens the page.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.200
If it does not find it
in your help folder,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.830
it looks in the cache,
and if it finds it there,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.410
it opens it from the cache.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.400
If it does not find it in the cache,
it uses HTTP to go to your remote site,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.880
and it takes the page, downloads it,
and puts it in the cache,

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.900
and loads it from there.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.100
Now I keep saying page.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.810
That's not quite right,
because this happens for every

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.900
element that's on the page.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.890
If you have graphics,
the same process is repeated.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.790
It will look locally,
it will look in the cache,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.900
it will look on the Internet and
retrieve it if necessary.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.260
That way you can have a mix of
local graphics with remote pages,

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.890
or local pages with remote graphics,
or all one or the other.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.900
It's very flexible in that regard.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.220
And as an author,
you don't have to decide or even know

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.900
where those pieces are going to reside.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.900
You make that choice at the very last
minute when you ship your product.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.900
And that's one of the
key advantages of this.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.900
And you guys know what
development cycles are,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.900
right?

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.750
Your application engineers
are creating their apps,

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.100
coding madly,
and your help team or your help

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.900
person is following shortly behind,
lagging, trying to catch up.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.960
At some point, the help has to freeze.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.410
You have to ship the product.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.430
It goes off, it's done,
but development can continue,

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.890
and often does continue after that point.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.810
Bugs will be fixed or introduced.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.770
Features will change and so on.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.900
And that makes the help wrong.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.880
And having a help that's incomplete
or incorrect isn't good for anyone.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.950
So, when you get to that point
where you need to freeze,

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.810
you can take a snapshot and say,
"What features of this

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.820
product are likely to change?"

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.690
take the topics that cover those
features and put them on the internet.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.770
That allows you to be able to
maintain them after the product

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.500
is released or at least catch
up right before it's released.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.360
And as an author,
you don't have to decide up until that

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.160
very moment because the help viewer,
as we've seen, looks in these places

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.780
and finds the content.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.370
It's like a hunting dog.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.200
It'll sniff it out and find
it in any of these locations.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.420
You don't need to make sure that all
of your hrefs are pointing to specific

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.490
folder names or specific sites.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.500
It handles figuring that out for you.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.450
So how do you author Apple Help?

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.030
Well, it's really easy.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.360
You start with HTML.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.590
Again, HTML

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.540
You take your start page,
the main page for your help book.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.450
That might be your table of contents,
your quick clicks page

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.460
as we saw in our demo.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.320
Whatever page you consider to
be main for your help book.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.910
And you modify it.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.260
You add one line.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.190
You add a meta tag.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.550
A meta tag is a standard HTML element.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:04.630
Put a meta tag of the type Apple title
and the name of your help book.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.850
In this example, myapp.help.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.700
Add that to your one page.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.450
This is a standard element so other
systems are going to ignore it.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.040
You can continue to deploy this
information on other systems.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.290
systems, no problem.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:17.600
And that's it.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.940
That's the only modification
you have to make.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.840
You take your entire help folder
and you drag and drop it on top

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.490
of the Apple Help indexing tool.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.220
The indexing tool scans all of
your content and creates a search

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.160
index and puts it in the correct
place in the folder for you.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.740
So you want to do this at the end, right?

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.010
Because you want your
help to be up to date.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.560
You want that search index to
represent the latest content

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.590
that you have in there.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.670
When you index your content,
this is also where you specify where

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:50.160
that remote site's going to be if
you're using Internet-based content.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.300
And this is also where you
turn on anchor indexing.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.120
Now, we haven't talked about anchors yet,
but we will in a moment.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.010
Just keep in mind that it's at index
time when you turn this feature on or

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.660
off to decide you're going to use it.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.200
So you've created your help,
where do you put it?

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.010
Well, on Mac OS X,
help resides inside your

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.740
applications bundle.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.500
All the localized help can live there,
just like all the other localized

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.170
resources with Mac OS X.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.290
And this provides a nice drag-and-drop
install of your application

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.030
and all of its help files.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.440
How do people get to your help?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.120
Well, three ways primarily.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.860
The first method of access,
and the one you should

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.840
definitely implement,
is a help menu.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.540
At a help menu,
we recommend a single item in there.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.810
In this case,
it's Mail Help in this slide.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.600
It should obviously be
your application's name,

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.590
Help, with a command question mark
as the keyboard shortcut.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.550
So why do we recommend one item?

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.800
Well, you know, in user tests,
it's interesting.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:48.800
We've

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.730
I've sat through many
user tests at Apple,

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.840
and we find that when people have a long,
complicated help menu,

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.630
especially when those items in the menu
kind of all lead to the same place,

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.190
right?

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.000
They all open the help
system and they go somewhere.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.480
I know as authors, it's painful to admit,
but to a lot of people,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.050
it's all kind of the same.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.610
If there's four items in the help menu,
we'll often see people pick the

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.850
wrong item five times in a row.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.010
Yeah, you stand back there
behind the glass and say,

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.940
no, how can you be doing this?

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.680
But it's true.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.180
A nice, simple menu works great.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.310
And when people have questions,
they just want to get to where

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.260
they're going to get their answers.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.340
You can also implement a Help button,
which is the second graphic there.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.940
This is a great way to
provide contextual help.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.900
And from the contextual menu as well,
you can add a help item there.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.280
If you're going to do provide
contextual help with a

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.220
Help button or a contextual menu,
you normally want to

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.490
use an anchor to do so,
and we'll talk about that.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.700
So essentially,
we've covered everything you need

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.860
to do from the authoring side
to get your help up and running.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:56.940
But what else can you do?

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.710
If you have some extra time or you
want to go that little extra step to

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.200
provide a really good help experience,
there are a few things you

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.760
can do and take advantage of
some of our advanced features.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.490
and I are here today to talk about how to
provide on-screen help for Mac OS users.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.570
In this session,
we will talk about how to provide

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.090
on-screen help for Mac OS users.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.070
We set up some user studies.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:48.280
Earlier in the study,
we had someone do a task and they had to

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.620
come to the help for information on it.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.790
We provided an automation that would
actually do that task for them.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.540
and 95%, maybe 99%, I think it
was one person out of the group,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.350
chose to do the automation.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.270
Rather than doing the task themselves,
they clicked, yeah, do it for me.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.600
I mean, come on,
that's what computers are supposed to do,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:05.980
right?

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.950
Do things for me.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.570
Well, later in the same study,
we had another task,

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.270
and in order to successfully
complete that task,

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.100
they had to undo what this
automation had done for them earlier.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.120
We wanted to see if people were
going to become reliant upon that

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.560
automation and go back to it or
be stumped when confronted with

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.390
having how do I undo this thing.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.270
And it turns out that nobody
had any problems with that.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.010
Using the automation did not
impede their ability to learn

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:32.940
how to work with the system.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.470
And in talking with them after the study,
they loved it.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.650
They wanted more of that type of thing.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.490
So this is a great opportunity
to make your help stand out.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.400
You can also improve search results.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.960
We talked earlier about how it
can be difficult to find things

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.540
in an on-screen help system.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.410
One of the best ways to
find things is by searching.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.680
Come to help with a
representation of your task,

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.630
type in your question,
and get a related list of topics.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.050
Now, to make that work,
it's up to you as an author to provide

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:07.110
keywords that are going to relate your
tasks to real-world representations.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.030
You can use the keyword
meta tag for that.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:13.400
You can also use keywords to
provide synonyms and misspellings.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.390
For example,
we spell QuickTime a couple of

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.120
ways in our help content usually to
make sure that people can find it.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:22.680
Because believe it or not,
people do want to spell it as two words,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.940
unusually.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.880
You can also use the robots meta tag.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.940
This is a standard tag if you run a
website and you're familiar with it.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.180
But this provides you with a way to
omit a page from a search result.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.960
So that page will not come up
when somebody searches for a term.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.340
So why would you want to do that?

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:45.680
Well, if you have a table of contents
page or a Quick Clicks page,

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.700
all of the words on that page
are going to get indexed.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.080
And when a user types in those words,
they'll see that as a result.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.690
And if they go to it,
it doesn't really help them, right?

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.500
It's just the table of contents.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.460
It's kind of being a tease.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.150
So you use robots to omit
that page from searching.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.350
And that way, when people search,
they get the pages with

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.560
the real content on them.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.900
Apple Abstract is another
meta tag that we support.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.310
Add this to your content
with the contents of this tag

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.190
being a summary of the page.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.400
When that page is found by a search,
that summary will appear

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.240
underneath the topic title.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.620
This lets users get an idea
of what's on that page,

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.560
a little short paragraph
describing what they're going

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.040
to learn if they click on that.

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:35.140
It makes search results a little bit
more usable because they can decide.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.870
And if your content is on the Internet,
it's even better because then they can

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:43.740
decide and make a more educated choice
when they go to download that page.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.080
Anchor Lookup.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.280
An anchor is a standard HTML element.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.940
It's not visible to the user.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.910
It's contained in the HTML code.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:02.670
It's usually a short little phrase
or a name such as printing 001.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.570
Anchors are how you provide access
to specific pages of the help.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.580
As an author,
you add this anchor to your page.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.240
You turn on anchor indexing
when you index your content.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:18.050
And then your application can display a
page in the help simply by telling the

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.660
help viewer to open this anchor name.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.170
The application doesn't
know what page it's on.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.280
It doesn't have to know what folder
it's in or any of its location.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:32.090
It just says, "Hey, help viewer,
show me the page with printing

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.090
001 on it," and it'll happen.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.990
Remote content,
we've talked about this a little bit.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.740
This is a great way to help
users and a great way to

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.040
keep your content up to date,
as I've said.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.170
If you're gonna implement it,
here's a couple things to keep in mind.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.500
You want to optimize your
pages for downloading.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.690
Now, a lot of help is text,
and so they're small and

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.120
they come down quickly.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.470
But if you're using graphics,
consider putting the graphics local

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.670
so they don't have to be downloaded.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.480
Again,
the Help Viewer will manage that for you.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.240
Or use QuickTime Reference Movies.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.450
And of course, in QuickTime,
movies is what they

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:06.480
call their file format.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.700
It can be a JPEG or a GIF.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.770
It doesn't have to be an animation.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.550
But a reference movie is very small,
just a couple of K.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.520
The Help Viewer will download that.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.580
And because it has the graphic
that's referred to in the HTML,

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.310
will display the entire page
right away very quickly.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.760
Then QuickTime will see
that it's a reference movie.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.750
And QuickTime will go out on the
network and download the graphic

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.620
that actually appears there.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.600
Just a little tip for you.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.600
We've talked about searching.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.100
If you're going to use remote content,
it's even more important to optimize

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.480
for searching because you don't want
people to hit the Internet too often.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:43.570
Try and limit the topics per page and
make your topic titles very accurate.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:49.190
What I mean by that,
if you have a very long page with several

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.590
topics on it and you do a search for it,
only the title for that page

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.590
shows up in the search results.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.400
If that title of the page doesn't
reflect the rest of the information,

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.320
they might not get that that's
the page they should look at.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.310
So breaking that up into smaller
chunks helps people find stuff,

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.870
and it goes to optimizing
for downloading as well.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.760
These are some help
commands you can download,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.890
excuse me, you can implement.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.690
I'm not going to talk about the HTML.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.010
I won't read it to you.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.540
That would be very painful for all of us.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.400
But these help commands are a special
type of URL you can use in your content.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.220
You notice they all
start with help colon,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.760
which is a special handler we've
defined for the help viewer.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.990
And by using these commands,
you can cause the help

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.970
viewer to do things.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.570
You can tell it to go to the help center.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:35.990
You can switch to another book.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.750
For example,
if you want to take somebody to Mac Help,

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:42.700
you can include a link in your content
that says open Mac Help for me.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.700
When they click that,
the help viewer will go find Mac Help.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.390
You can open to an anchor in a book.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.120
So if you want to refer to a
specific page either within

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.690
your own book or someone else's,
you can refer to it by anchor

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.900
without having to know its file
name or location on the disk.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:01.450
A couple more.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:02.980
You can perform a search.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.520
You saw this in the demo.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:07.300
Tell me more,
our quick clicks that were in the demo.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.700
Those all perform a search
within the help viewer.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.370
You can specify what book to
search as well as the search term.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.920
and of course you can
run an Apple script.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.190
Here's the syntax for that.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.910
It's a help:run script and you give
the path to the Apple script that's

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.900
included with your help content.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.080
You can also pass a parameter
to that Apple script.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.180
So you can generalize your
scripts and pass parameters to

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.170
have them do specific things.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:52.080
So we've covered what you can do if
you're starting with a new help system,

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:56.080
how to create a help system very
quickly and get it into Mac OS X,

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.180
how to take an existing HTML book,

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.350
and Convertit to Mac OS X.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.700
But what if you're not
starting with HTML?

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.780
I know that many of you are coming from
WinHelp or QuickHelp have existing help

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.970
systems you want to get into this system.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.130
Well, if you're coming from Apple Guide,
there is a utility from

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.380
our friends at GuideWorks.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.060
They're no longer with us,
but before the company folded,

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.180
they did make this utility
available for all of us to use.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.150
Take your Apple Guide source,
run it through this utility and

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:27.640
it will just give you a very basic
starting HTML framework for it.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.740
You can leverage some of
the work you've done there.

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.970
It doesn't cover everything,
but it'll get you started.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.600
If you're coming from
WinHelp or QuickHelp,

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:37.430
well,
we have some really good news for you.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.220
As to the announcement
we alluded to earlier,

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.750
and to talk about that,
I'm going to ask John to

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.380
come back up on stage.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.120
And thank you for your attention.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.490
So I'm going to be brief because I want
to introduce somebody very quickly.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.060
But one of the things I want to
say is that developer relations

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.440
is one of our mandates is to make
you successful on the platform.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.750
And one of the ways we want to do that
is to eliminate some of the barriers that

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.040
it takes to get your products onto the
Macintosh because a lot of people are

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.320
bringing products from other platforms.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.110
And the last thing we want to do
is for you to have hurdles that you

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.290
have to cross that are unique to
Macintosh that aren't available,

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.500
say, on another platform or don't
exist on another platform.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.380
And one of those barriers currently
was a lot of people are coming from

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.170
Windows to Mac OS X and they have content
on Windows in WinHelp format and they

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.530
needed to get that over to Apple Help.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:35.340
And so I want to introduce somebody
that we've begun to work with,

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.250
Jack Minsky from Software Mac Kiev.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:41.840
and to talk about a tool that
they've come up with working

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.260
with us at Developer Relations.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:43.760
So Jack.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.340
JACK MAHER: Thank you, John.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:50.940
So my name is Jack Minsky.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.940
I'm the president of Software McKiev.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:57.280
We are the world's largest conversion
house moving stuff from Windows to Mac.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.710
Some of the titles you may
have heard of that we moved,

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:03.040
the World Book Multimedia Encyclopedia
that we did for World Book IBM,

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.120
Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:12.970
We did SimCity 3000, KidPix Deluxe,
SPS S10, and a couple of hundred others.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.230
More recently,
we've been moving things to Mac OS X,

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:20.460
and we've also done some
WebObjects projects,

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.820
basically any Apple technologies
that need to be implemented.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:27.380
As we were moving projects to Mac OS X,
we discovered one of the things that

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:32.360
shouldn't have been a long lead time
item but turned out to be was moving

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.040
things from something we use extensively
called QuickHelp from Altura Software,

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.190
which allowed us in doing these
conversions to take basically

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:43.100
the Windows Help file and move
it over to run on the Mac.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.280
very nicely.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.660
The problem with Quick Help is it
doesn't have a Mac OS X version

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.200
and probably isn't going to.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.510
And that meant launching
Quick Help in the classic box,

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.210
and that was something
we didn't want to do.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:01.600
So we started painfully trying to take
this RTF-based Windows help and move

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.780
it over to an HTML base for Apple help.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.360
And finding that took us two to
three months per project and over

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.720
the number of projects we were doing,
that didn't make a lot of sense.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:16.080
So we set out to make a tool for
ourselves in-house to be able to do that

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.770
process on a rapid basis to automate it.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:22.030
And that tool is called Quicker Help.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.750
We've made it into our first product
that we're actually going to ship,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:30.900
one of our own tools.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.900
We've created lots of in-house tools.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.430
This is the first one through
cooperation with Apple we've

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.200
decided to make available in
general to the developer community.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.160
It shortens the time literally
from months to move your help

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.390
over to a couple of days.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.750
The utility itself,
I'm going to show you right now,

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.270
takes a couple of minutes to run,
but then you still need to

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.500
do some converting by hand.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.100
If you're starting from
Win Help or Robo Help,

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.590
you'd need to change all of the
right mouse clicks to control

00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.900
clicks and those kind of things.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.900
It still has to be done by hand.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.400
Of course,
you'd have to replace screenshots.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.650
The basics of getting it from RTF Help,
dividing it into those small chunks for

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:08.850
HTML Help is all done automatically.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:14.600
What it does is it takes RTF Help,
moves it to HTML Help, and again,

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.450
Win Help and Quick Help files.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.760
I'd like to show it to you.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:30.400
[Transcript missing]

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:32.450
Quicker Help.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.220
Sorry.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.530
I like to see the bouncing shoe go.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.410
So I always want to put the dock up.

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:42.760
OK, so the first thing we need to
do is specify a project file.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:47.290
And we can do that either by using
the Select button to find one,

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.800
or of course, because this is Mac,
we can use drag and drop.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.840
And I've identified here
what's called an HPJ file.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.600
Those of you who've made
Quick Help before know this is the

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.120
basic index file for the product.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:41:42.200
[Transcript missing]

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.280
and then that appears in my chooser here.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.750
And anytime I want to go back and
retain that exact set of settings,

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:53.040
whether it's the mapping of the fonts
or the titles or whatever you've set up,

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.880
you can have that exact one for help.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.620
So we say OK,
and we saved our preferences.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.680
And that's it.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.370
And we're ready to convert.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.400
Now let's give it a spin.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:08.740
I'm going to choose a place
for the destination folder.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:14.180
I'm going to put it on the desktop so
we can see it and create a new folder.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:18.380
And I'm going to call
that one Jack's Help.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.590
create that on the desktop,
and it starts converting.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.920
This process is gonna take
about another minute and a half,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.050
so give me a chance to tell you
about a few of the other features.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:33.010
We did show this at the expo.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.880
Those of you who came by and
helped by giving your comments,

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.850
thank you for that.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.350
One of the things that was requested
that we've decided to add to the

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.780
product is the ability to print out
all the pages of help that you make

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.040
instead of having to print them one
at a time from the Apple Help Viewer.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:51.100
So that's an option that
you'll be able to check a box

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.530
in the preferences as well.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.380
That's helpful if you're doing
your own editing or you wanna

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.690
give it to your QA group to try
and check through the help and

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.580
make sure that everything's okay.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:04.590
So here it goes doing the processing,
and you can see going from RTF files,

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:10.100
both text and graphics being created.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.530
And at the end of the process,
we'll be given a choice to,

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.200
with two options.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.500
We can open up the folder
that contains this help,

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.960
so that you can go in
and take a look at it,

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.880
maybe start to do some
editing right away.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.510
Or we can open up the final result,
just take a look at it in Apple Help.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.320
I'm not going to open up
the destination folder.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.570
We'll open Apple Help.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:43.670
And there it goes.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:47.360
We've got the help viewer jumping
up and down here on the bottom.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.770
And there's the result,
all converted from an

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.890
RTF file into Apple Help.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.490
And just to show you this is real,
I have here in Quick Help the

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:58.620
original file of this.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.170
You can see,
for those of you who remember

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.360
what Quick Help looks like,
well,

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.670
this is the opening Quick Help page.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.270
This is the opening Apple Help page.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.060
So you have a difference
in environment there.

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:09.700
We'll just drill down through a couple
of these here so you can see that

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.700
we've got essentially the same content.

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:23.950
So these are exactly the same,
or at least the same content.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.260
There you go.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.000
And that's what it does.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.790
Simple as that.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:41.640
This is an almost final version because
of a few things we wanted to add.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:48.960
And so we believe we'll have this all
tied up and available even next week.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.000
We're going to be announcing
distribution for this.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.240
Certainly it's going to be available for
download from our website and I'll give

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.780
you that contact information in a minute.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:04.180
And pricing is $5.95 for the SDK,
the same price for those of you who have

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.580
used Altura Quick Help as their SDK.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.880
The difference being you don't
have any kind of fees to pay for

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.180
distribution of the Quick Help viewer.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.520
Apple Help is free.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.190
And if you'd like more information,
please contact us.

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:20.080
Write to me, jack@mckeeve.com.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.550
Write that down.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.600
Or www.mckeeve.com on the web.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.370
We will be announcing some
additional distribution next week.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.740
And we are going to stay
at the end of the session.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:34.110
If you have any questions,
please feel free and come up and

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:38.240
chat with me and our engineers
and be to answer whatever we can.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.240
Thank you.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.110
So that's just an example of some
of the tools that we're hoping to

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.560
bring to the platform to help you
move your help content across and

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.620
even other stuff in other domains
and other technologies on Mac OS X.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:02.090
If you have some specific tools that
you're using that you think you'd

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.800
love to have Apple produce or work
with third-party developers to produce

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:08.210
the conversion process or whatever,
please contact me at

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.140
the end of the session.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.390
My contact info will be up on the slide.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.970
To continue with some of the lower-level
stuff relative to Apple Help,

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.920
I'd like to invite Jessica Kahn on stage.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.980
She's the tech lead for
Apple Help at Apple,

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.170
and she's going to walk you through
some of the APIs on this stuff.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:32.060
- Hi everybody,
thanks for coming to the session.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.670
Well,
so far you've heard from Gordon and from

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:38.860
Jack about what good on-screen help is,
what the help viewer does

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.500
to display it to the user,
and how to create a help book.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.060
What I'm going to talk to you
about is the help menu on Mac OS X,

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.790
listing your book in the help center,
which is that main table of

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.300
contents in the help viewer,
and accessing help from your

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.960
application using menus,
buttons, or contextual menus.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.290
And then we'll bring up John for Q&A.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.250
So Gordon mentioned before
that the basic help menu on

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.640
Mac OS X is what we recommend that
you use and it's a single item,

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.620
your application's name followed
by the word help with the question

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.980
mark key as the keyboard shortcut.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:14.440
How do you get the basic
help menu on Mac OS X?

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.360
It's actually really easy.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.240
Some of you may remember from
Mac OS 9 and before that you

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.800
need to create an Apple Guide and
that can be a little tricky.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.720
This, I think, is actually a lot easier.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.650
Basically what you do is,
as Gordon mentioned,

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:28.720
you bundle your application
with its help content.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.890
You define a couple of
keys in your Info.plist,

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.220
or for those of you who are familiar
with localizing your application,

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.080
those can be defined in the
Info.plist.strings file as well

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.800
in case you want to ship multiple
languages of your help book.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.380
And then you define a couple of standard
keys that you should be defining

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.480
anyway if you're bundling your app,
the bundle identifier

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.790
and the bundle name.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.790
I'll go into a little more detail
about our special keys now.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.700
So that CFBundle help book
folder key is basically,

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.140
as you can see from
the graphic hopefully,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.780
specifying the folder in which
your help content is stored.

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:03.410
That red circle is a little off,
I'm not sure why,

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.800
but it wasn't on my computer.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.800
Anyway, that's the help folder
down in your app package.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:13.800
And this graphic displays
your app once it's been built.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.350
That's where,
if you had a global help book folder,

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.550
it would be.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:22.320
and the CFBundle help book
name key is basically exactly

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.040
the same as your Apple title.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.600
And so that's the key that's
more likely to be localized,

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:26.760
right?

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.660
Because if you're shipping, say,
a French language version

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.680
of your help book,
that title would probably be in French.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.030
And so that's the Info.plist key that
you might define in your strings file

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.750
rather than your main Info.plist.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.420
Here's an example of the Info.plist.

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:48.820
Basically, this just shows the four keys
that you absolutely need to

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:55.220
define for your help content to
show up in the basic help menu.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.940
The CFBundle helpbook folder,
as you can see, is a string value,

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.520
my app help folder.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.860
The CFBundle helpbook name folder
is--helpbook name key rather is also

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.320
a string and that's your Apple title.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.810
Your bundle identifier is usually
something that uniquely identifies

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:12.330
your application to the system,
something like

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:15.060
com.yourcompanyname.yourappname.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:18.060
And your CFBundle name is sort of the
user visible name of your application.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:22.550
Okay, so let's step back for a moment.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.640
If you define those
four keys in your plist,

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.530
and you put your help folder
down in your app bundle,

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:30.640
and you launch your app,
you're gonna get the basic help menu.

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.940
And as much as we stress that
the basic help menu is the

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.810
easiest thing for users to use,
we also understand that we need

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.070
to be flexible for you guys,
and that some of you are gonna

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:41.640
want to have multiple help menu
items doing different things.

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.620
So an example of a custom
help menu is bbeditshelp,

00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:47.750
and guess what,
you can do it using Apple Help 2.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.520
Here's what you need to do.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.930
Basically, you need to define an array
value instead of a string value

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.860
for that help book folder key,
and that is a little clue

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:59.900
to the system to say,
hands off, don't touch my help menu.

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.580
That means we're not creating
a help menu for you at all.

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:07.140
You need to use whatever standard menu
managing APIs you use for Cocoa or

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.950
Carbon to create your help menu,
to add items,

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.790
and then to handle those items.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.150
And you can use some of the
Apple Help APIs that I'll be talking

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:18.180
about shortly to handle those items.

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.880
So just again to stress
how you would do this,

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:25.010
you just, the change for the plist is
just that you set an array value

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:26.780
for CFBundle helpbook folder.

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:29.820
And you can put your single
string inside that array.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.390
Or if you want to ship
multiple helpbooks,

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.140
we allow that too.

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:36.370
And so you would create an array and
list your multiple helpbooks in there.

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:41.470
Right, so we've discussed how to
have a basic help menu.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.380
We've discussed how to
have a custom help menu.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.420
That's half the picture for
accessing help from your application.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.000
You also need to make sure
that your help is registered

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.700
to appear in the Help Center.

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.960
Without doing this,
you're not going to be able to search.

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:58.420
You're not going to be able
to get to your remote content.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.390
You can't execute those Apple scripts
that Gordon talked about and a

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.390
number of other custom help features.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:02.560
How do you do this?

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:03.360
Well, it's pretty easy.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.740
You just call one API.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:07.530
We recommend that you call it each
time your app launches because if

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:10.140
the registration is already current,
it's basically a no-op.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.920
You're not gonna spend a
lot of time in that code.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.580
It takes an FS ref to the bundle
of probably your application,

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.470
but it could be any bundle in
the system that contains help

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.560
down inside of its resources.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.770
It registers all books contained
in that bundle as denoted by those

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:30.120
special help list keys that we
discussed for your info P list.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.080
And the good news is Cocoa Apps with
just one help book get this for free.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.140
And so, as I'll demonstrate later,
if you're a simple Cocoa application,

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.630
you don't really have to do any
work aside from storing your help

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:44.170
content and setting your P list keys
to have a basic help menu just work.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:49.480
The caveats for this are that you
should keep your Apple titles,

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.300
those are the titles as they
appear in the Help Center,

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.600
as unique as possible
to avoid user confusion.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.080
It's going to be a little bizarre for
a user if they end up launching the

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.110
Help Viewer and they see the main list
of table of contents and there are

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:01.200
things in there that are the same.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.200
They're not going to know where to go.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.300
Also, the user needs to have launched
your application once for your help

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.700
to appear in the Help Center list.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.320
At first,
I can tell that some of you might

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.200
want to gasp at this limitation,
but it's not as bad as it seems.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.450
Because the likelihood of the
user wanting to get to Help Viewer

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:19.090
application before they've ever
even launched it is pretty slim.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.250
Okay, at this point,
I'm gonna do a demo for you to

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:26.220
show you that it really is that
easy to have a basic help menu.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:33.790
Get rid of the stuff and
launch Project Builder.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:43.760
and PeeBee.

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:48.040
Okay, so first I'm gonna show you,
the nuances of making a basic

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.750
help menu for a Carbon application
and a Cocoa application are

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:53.180
just slightly different,
so I'm gonna show you each just to prove

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.100
to you that it's simple for both of them.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:58.440
So let's create a new
project in Project Builder.

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.220
And let's make a Carbon application.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.300
What are we going to call it?

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.860
We're going to call it Carbon Demo.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.410
And then let's set its location.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.720
We're gonna put that
down in my demo stuff,

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.570
and I've already made a little folder
in here that contains a help book.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:22.920
And so let's just choose
that location and say finish.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.620
and I are going to be talking
about the project builder.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:33.590
The project builder is pretty
nifty because it gives you

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:35.700
a lot of stuff for free too.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.520
Basically at this point,
if I just hit the build key,

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:43.070
the build button,
I've got a bare bones Carbon app

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:45.690
that's already going to run for me.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.390
So all I need to do to add my
help to this is to click on the

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.390
resources area of the project,
go to the project menu

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.390
and add my help files.

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:48.340
which are stored in this folder.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:50.540
As you can see,
this looks like a basic help book.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:53.210
So let's say we want to have
this whole folder added.

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.690
So let's highlight it and click Open.

00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:58.630
and then here you want
to be very careful,

00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:59.860
take note of this.

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.680
Because we want to add the whole folder
to the resources section of the project,

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.840
we want to create a folder
reference for the added folder.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.360
If we didn't do that,
we'd end up adding separate files

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:10.680
and that's not what we want.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.260
We want to think of the help
book as a single resource,

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.480
a single entity that gets copied around.

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.500
So there it is.

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.970
Now inside there,
I've got one HTML file that's, wow,

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:23.900
that's a big font.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.060
One HTML file that's my
main file for the book,

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:30.350
and in here I've defined the Apple title,
as Gordon suggested you need to do.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.220
So keep in mind, this is gonna be one
of my plist key values.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.800
The other one is the actual folder
itself that I've added to my app bundle.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.520
So let's go set those key list P's.

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:47.760
Rather, P list keys.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.320
Click on the Carbon Demo target,
and you want to edit

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:52.110
some target settings.

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:54.320
So you go in here to
Application Settings,

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:57.360
and first, you make sure that you
have a bundle identifier.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:03.190
So let's name this com.apple.CarbonDemo.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.890
This doesn't really matter what our
type and signature and stuff is.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.590
That can all be left at the
default for this purpose.

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:12.760
Past that,
we actually want to click into the

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.600
expert mode to add our new keys.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.600
So this is just a different view of
the same stuff that you saw before.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:20.820
And we're just going to add a new
sort of top-level key here and

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:25.600
call it CFBundleHelpBookFolder.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.550
Because we want the
basic help menu for free,

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.600
we're going to leave
that as a string value.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.600
Whoops.

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.600
And then it's going to move it for
us so that it's hard to click in.

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.870
And we're going to name
that the folder name,

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.520
which I'll go back and show
you in a moment because I can't

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:41.600
look at that view right now.

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.580
But the folder name, I believe,
was CarbonDemoHelp.

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.690
and past that we want to add
one more sibling and that's

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:53.820
the CFBundle Help Book name.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:57.940
That's your Apple title, remember.

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:01.300
And for this example,
I happen to make it the same name,

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.150
but it doesn't have to be.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:11.330
So we've added those things,
and at this point,

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:17.650
I think all we need to do is add a little
snippet of code to our main source file.

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.840
Now,
this is only necessary for Carbon Apps,

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.580
but don't be upset, it's not that bad.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.840
It's pretty simple, actually.

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:28.270
so that you don't have to watch
me struggle through writing

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.540
code while I'm talking up here,
I pre-prepared a little code snippet

00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:34.380
that we can plunk into there.

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:40.800
I'll try to show you this source in a
way that you can see it in a moment as

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.000
soon as I copy it into the main file.

00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:49.680
So we're just replacing that
initialize with a snippet that

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:54.780
also contains that initialize call.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:58.900
Okay, so let's expand this so that you
guys can see that it's not that

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:01.770
big a deal to register your book.

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:08.140
So basically, to register your help book,
which is to get it into the Help Center,

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:12.290
you get your main bundle,
your app bundle,

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:15.300
and then once you've got that,
you get the bundles

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.470
URL using CFBundle calls.

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:21.380
Using that, you can get the FSRef and
then you pass the FSRef to the

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:23.160
AH register help book call.

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.590
Again, this is what puts your help book
in the help center and this is

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.310
what Cocoa Apps get for free
that Carbon Apps need to do,

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:30.780
but as you can see, it's only what,
12 lines of code or so.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.210
It's not that bad.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.720
All right,
I think if the demagogues are with me,

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.870
we're ready to build and run.

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.640
Let's make sure that Help Viewer
isn't already running,

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.710
because that would screw us up.

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:58.460
It appears to not be running,
which is good.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.570
So let's execute our little Carbon app.

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:05.460
So here it comes.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.930
Now, it's got a help menu.

00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:08.990
And I promise you,
there's no code in there to have

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.600
started that help menu for you,
to have given that to you.

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:15.300
That's actually the high-level
toolbox providing a free help menu.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.980
And it names it for you.

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.560
And if we choose it,
you'll see that it handles

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.760
it for you as well.

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:26.920
and there we go, we're in my little help
book that I created.

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:29.890
So, you know,
you spend a little time making

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:32.100
a help book and then you spend,
what was that,

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:37.990
maybe five or ten minutes adding it
to your project and you have a working

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:37.990
help system in Apple Help on Mac OS X.

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.100
So now just to show you the
nuances that are slightly

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.300
different between Carbon and Cocoa,
I'll do one more quickie to show you that

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:47.790
the Cocoa app is actually even easier.

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.380
So let's do a new project again.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:53.730
And this time,
let's have it be a Cocoa application.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:59:01.320
Let's call it creatively, Cocoa Demo,
and set its location similarly to

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.580
the pre-prepared folder that I have.

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.360
Let's finish creating that.

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:14.790
Alright, so, similarly,
we're just gonna open up this resources

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.690
section and add our help book.

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.790
Cocoa Demo Help.

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:26.180
make sure that that folder reference
is chosen and then click Add.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:31.300
And then let's edit the target to
define those keys that we need.

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:36.930
So, again, we need to make sure we
have a bundle identifier.

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.290
and then we zip into expert mode and
create our little custom help keys.

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:53.180
Whoops, that always surprises me.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.320
So, CFBundle Help Book Folder
with Cocoa Demo Help,

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.140
and then just to keep it simple,
our Apple title or the

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.600
book name was the same.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.240
So we've defined our keys,
and now I think at this

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.600
point we're ready to build.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.590
Oh, actually,
let's just double check one thing.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.870
I think, just to be really a little
bit anal about this,

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:28.240
let's make sure that our help
menu is going to look right.

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:30.200
This is the nuance for Cocoa.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:33.360
A basic Cocoa nib in the version
of 10 that's shipping now

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.580
already has a help menu in it,
but you just want to go rename it.

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:46.500
So let's just call that
Cocoa Demo Help and save that.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.770
And now let's build our app.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.400
and run our app.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.570
Here we go.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:01:00.510
We've got the help menu, Cocoa Demo Help.

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:05.440
And without adding any code,
you're going to see that Help Viewer is

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.050
going to launch and display your help.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:09.920
So it's as simple as that.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.520
and I'm glad the demo
gods were smiling upon me,

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.220
but I'm also glad to be back
here talking to the slides again.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.350
Okay,
so just to review what we've covered.

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.660
We've talked about how
you can get a help menu.

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:30.290
We've talked about how you can get
your book listed in the help center.

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:32.820
Those are the two key things you
need to do to just have your basic

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.140
help system working in Mac OS X.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.560
Now, I'll briefly just cover
the Apple Help APIs,

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.040
which are how you can hook up
buttons and contextual menus.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.960
You can use these to access help
content from all over your application.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.810
They're stored in the help framework,
which is part of the

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.660
Carbon Umbrella framework,
but because they're a C API,

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.680
they're usable by Cocoa Apps as well.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.450
They're available in CarbonLib 1.1
and later for CarbonLib applications.

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:56.600
There are five of them.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.740
We already talked about the first one.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:02.650
Two more go into a category of opening
help viewer to a particular location,

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:06.600
and two others are to
perform lookups and searches.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.840
I have some sample code here.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.530
It might be a little hard to see,
but I hope not.

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:12.060
The gist of the code is that
this stuff is really easy.

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:14.370
As you can see,
all of those are one-liners.

01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:19.240
The first one is using ahgo2pages to
open the help viewer to the help center.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.380
The second is opening to
the developer help center,

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:25.980
which is a special category of developer
help content that we display in Mac OS X.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.590
The third is using ahgo2pages,
supplying the Apple title for your

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:33.030
book and then not supplying the
other optional parameters to take

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:36.700
your book--to take your application,
rather, open help viewer and go to the

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.500
main page of your app's help.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:42.340
You can also use this with
some optional parameters to get

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.340
within your help book somewhere.

01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:49.930
Finally, you can use that API to get to
any HTML or text file on disk,

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.150
even if it's not inside of a help book.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.860
You can also do lookups and searches.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.820
I'll briefly cover actually
the last two on these slides.

01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:00.380
AHSearch is used,
it's the programmatic way

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.920
of doing a help:search URL.

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:06.480
And basically it causes HelpViewer
to open and perform a search.

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.420
If you're familiar with
the Apple Guide APIs,

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:12.120
that's similar to the
AG Open with Search API.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.110
The top one is the one that
I really want to stress.

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:16.140
That's AHLookupAnchor.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:19.410
And in my opinion,
it is the most flexible

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.040
API that we've presented and
I hope you're going to use it.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.570
As Gordon mentioned,
it makes content authors free to

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.920
reorganize the help content as
they see fit without affecting the

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.160
development of your application
from the programming side.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:35.170
Be very careful if you're going to
use this feature to turn on anchor

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:36.640
indexing in the indexing tool.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.620
If you don't do that,
it's not going to work.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.960
Finally, for more information,
you can see these URLs.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.370
I believe that you guys are gonna
get a main URL at the end of this

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.370
that is gonna contain all these,
so don't worry about writing them down.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:53.620
But basically for your reference,
there's an Apple help SDK.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.970
There's a new revision of
the document providing user

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.380
assistance with Apple help.

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:59.920
That's the canonical documentation
for all of this stuff,

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.720
and so look up stuff using that.

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:05.480
Finally, grab the Carbonlib SDK,
the latest version.

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:07.660
That contains the help
viewer for Carbonlib,

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.740
which you'll need if you're a Carbonlib
app and you wanna use our APIs.

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.870
And also the newest help indexing tool,
which is what contains

01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:15.370
the anchor indexing.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.170
Who to contact.

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:21.150
You can use these email addresses
and these lists to get insider

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.270
information about Apple Help.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.710
If you have any questions
or you have any comments,

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:28.140
we really do welcome them,
and so please do get in touch

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:30.490
using any of these methods.

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:34.140
and at this point I'll bring John Galinzi
back up to talk about our user

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.270
experience roadmap and to start the Q&A.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.730
Thanks, Jessica.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.790
So the interface builder
session occurred.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.100
Application packaging occurred.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.210
Feedback forum for ACQA occurred.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.170
Carbon and those-- all of those occurred,
but you can watch them on DVD.

01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:03.450
Speech Recognition is already done.

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:05.940
Using Aqua and designing Aqua icons.

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:06.900
Still to come.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:07.300
Great session.

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.440
You need to come to that tomorrow.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.520
And then the feedback forum
for the high-level toolbox

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.720
if that's of interest to you.
