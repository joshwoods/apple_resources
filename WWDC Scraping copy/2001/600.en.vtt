WEBVTT

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.590
Thank you all very much for coming.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.840
Some of you are just scooting
in at the last second.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.360
How many of you, for you,
is this your first developers conference?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.200
Wow, thank you all so much.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.430
How many of you have been more,
how many of you have been to more

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.620
than two developer conferences?

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.940
Wow.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.040
So all of you people who are newbies,
check out the old folks so you

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.890
know who to bug for questions.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.060
All of you who have been
around for a very long time,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.260
please welcome all these new people who
are helping us expand the community.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.800
It is great to see you all here.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.900
I'm glad we have the civic
auditorium this year.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.020
Those of you who have been here for the
last two years know that we have always

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.590
overflowed the room that we have been in.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.910
That doesn't seem to be a problem today.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.670
At the rate we're growing, though,
it could be a problem

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.580
another year or two,
in which case we'll try and rent

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.630
out the San Jose Arena for the
next WebObjects overview session.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.740
It is great to be here.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.600
We are so excited to have you here.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.620
We got a lot of great stuff to talk
about and a lot of great speakers and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.870
people I want to bring up on stage,
so I'll go ahead and get started.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.890
Just to start out with,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.650
I want to welcome you to
the world of WebObjects,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.470
for those of you who are
here for the first time.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.920
We've got a lot of things to cover.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.700
This is really a whole new beginning.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.310
This is the beginning of my talk.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.970
It's the beginning of
lots of cheesy animations.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.710
More importantly,
it's a week full of learning.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.760
There are so many sessions that people
have been working like crazy for the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.160
last few weeks to get ready for you.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.980
We have some brilliant people,
some fantastic speakers.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.040
You're going to learn so much
here on the WebObjects track,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.780
as well as in the other tracks that
you may have a chance to sample.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.940
It's also the beginning of a
whole new era for WebObjects.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.940
WebObjects, as you know,
really created the app

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.120
server market five years ago.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.600
We've been working very hard to
try and bring it up into the modern

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.150
internet age with the emergence
of Java and internet standards,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.860
as well as being part
of the Apple community.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.950
And we really think we've done
something pretty fantastic.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.230
It's a work in progress like
everything else in this world,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.220
but we're very excited about what
we've done and really want to help

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.460
you get involved in what we're doing.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.250
There's several things
we'll be learning this week.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.000
First of all,
we want to help you get to know

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.300
the people behind WebObjects,
get to know the people that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.760
you've been seeing email from or
code samples from over the years.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.500
We want to give you the
inside scoop on WebObjects,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.500
as you've probably heard
about this morning.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.990
I want to talk to you a little bit
towards the end about some of the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.600
things we're doing with documentation,
some of the training and consulting

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.790
services available for my services,
some information about the different

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.290
sessions you'll want to attend this week,
as well as a few surprises.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.250
So to start with,
I want to invite out the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.500
engineering team behind WebObjects.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.880
These are the people who
have built WebObjects 5.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:10.450
Tony Triovane is the new
director of WebObjects,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.490
recently promoted to director in
charge of WebObjects engineering.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.510
I've got you to hold your
applause to the end or we'll

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.900
never get finished with this.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.800
Genevieve Perugina in charge of the
quality and sustaining engineering.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.630
Andreas Wenker, Jeff Glasson,
Francois Jouault, and Stan German.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.270
Big hand for WebObjects Engineering.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.210
Of course,
all of you know that getting a product

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.950
out the door and building the software
is only a small piece of the puzzle,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.040
so I also wanted to give you
a chance to meet the rest of

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.400
the team behind WebObjects.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.680
Bob, if you could lead out the troops,
please.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.110
This is the WebObjects support team.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.810
Bob and I are in marketing.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.440
We lead.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.100
Other people follow eventually.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.450
Please announce Bob Frazier,
the new WebObjects product manager.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.850
John Gavish, and David Koehn,
and James Trenum.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.900
This is a position that many of
you know I've been trying to fill.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.900
My job is to be in charge of all
the developer stuff we do at Apple.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.330
And I wanted someone who could
really focus on WebObjects,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.210
who really understood the technology,
to really focus 100% on

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.680
building and selling WebObjects.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.280
So very pleased to have
Bob Frazier on board.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.880
Many of you know Tavares Ford.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.900
He's at the end of the DTS email address
that many of you have to deal with.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.730
Matt Rollefson, of course,
is in charge of

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.290
documentation for WebObjects.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.900
He'll be sharing more shortly.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.050
And then, Robert Esquire is in charge of
all the service and support for

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.900
WebObjects and Mac OS X Server in
the AppleCare organization.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.800
And then, Tim Joernsen and James Dempsey
from Apple iServices,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.900
who many of you know.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.890
Thank you guys very much.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.840
and of course the star of our show,
WebObjects 5.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.190
WebObjects 5 is shipping today.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.610
We are very excited to
have WebObjects 5 out here.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.770
I was just telling a number of people
this is the first time I've ever had

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.250
all GM software sitting on my computer.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.910
Mac OS X is GM, WebObjects 5 is GM,
Mac OS X Server is GM,

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.640
and not only is it all GM software,
I can hold it all in one hand

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.700
and carry it around for a full
day without getting tired,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.800
thanks to the new Titanium PowerBook G4.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.300
It's a wonderful time to
be an Apple developer.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.600
We are very excited that the
original web application server

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.300
is now available in Java.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.750
We really want the world to know that
this is the incredibly powerful way

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.800
to create Java server applications.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.240
There's a lot of people building
server applications in Java,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.300
a lot of them putting an
awful lot of effort into it.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.370
We want to say, you know, hey,
we want people who are smart but

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.800
lazy to do it the WebObjects way.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.540
There's really two things we're
focusing on with WebObjects 5.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.640
We really see this as the engine
for powering the Internet,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.330
because the most exciting thing
on the Internet today is rich,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.300
dynamic content.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.260
And this is a great way for large
organizations who have a lot of content,

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.230
whether that's digital multimedia,
whether it's large corporate databases,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.680
or it's enterprise integration systems,
they need to be able to interact

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.290
with that data across the Internet.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.760
This is also a great way for
web developers to bring their

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.300
applications to the Internet.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.000
We have desktop applications,
client server applications,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.300
legacy web applications.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.290
They need something really flexible,
scalable, and maintainable.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.400
We want people to see that WebObjects
really is the smart way to bring

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.300
their applications to the Internet.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.290
Now some of you may be new to WebObjects,
so I just want to step real

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.290
quickly through the architecture
that we use in WebObjects.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.990
Now all of you are familiar with
static websites where you have a

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.300
basic HTML file delivered through
a web server to a browser client.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.300
What an application server does is
it makes that much more dynamic.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.800
This way you don't have all
the same people saying the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.300
same content all the time.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.460
We introduce an application
server into the mix,

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.300
which allows you to put dynamic logic
in the middle of your application.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.130
And then rather than having
to hand code the HTML,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.190
you have templates,
which allow you to easily interject

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.290
the appropriate formatting and
presentation for your application.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.300
And then you have an object model
you pull your information from.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.300
Now a lot of these times
you will have the same file.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.940
People try to put their application
logic and their object model and

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.300
their templates all together.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.590
Some scripting languages,
which will remain unnamed,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.250
are notorious for this sort of thing.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.200
With WebObjects we have a nice strict
separation between our object model and

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.260
our templates and our business logic.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.280
And our object model also isolates
you directly from the databases.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.300
Your HTML file does not know
what database you are using.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.300
It doesn't know the
scheme of your database.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.570
All you know is that there's an object
model which can talk to mainframes,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.300
databases, ERP systems, directories,
or XML files.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.200
data streams.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.400
The other great thing about this,
because of this modular architecture,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.190
you can use that same logic and
the same backends to deliver

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.640
extremely rich clients using Java,
not just HTML.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.520
And also you can use your application
server technology that runs on

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.620
the server to really scale up
the power and flexibility of your

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.340
system to meet increased load.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.330
So with WebObjects 5,
there's really five key

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.550
benefits we're talking about.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.420
Since we have so many new people here,
I really wanted to stress some of the

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.440
things that many of you in the WebObjects
community may have taken for granted.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.430
And what people have failed
to realize is that WebObjects,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.380
even though a lot of other people
have appeared in the last five years,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.700
there's still several powerful
advantages that WebObjects has

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.800
over competing technologies.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.340
These five key technologies
that I want to spend some time

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.520
on are automated data access,
streamlined page generation,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.470
incredibly powerful rich
desktop application support,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.130
of very scalable Java deployment
and integrated developer tools.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.200
So to start with,
I want to talk a little bit more

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.940
about automated data access.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.590
The big thing about WebObjects is you
don't need to write SQL or JDBC code

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.230
in order to talk to a database.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.880
We automate all that hard work for you.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.910
This makes a couple of benefits.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.070
One, it means you're independent
of your database.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.680
You can change databases,
you can modify the schema,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.420
you can use several databases at once.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.230
Your application code doesn't
have to know the intimate

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.550
details of your database.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.860
Much more flexibility.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.980
It also means your application
programmers don't have to be very

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.700
sophisticated database programmers.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.290
We handle all the fetching,
all the caching,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.310
all the updating of your database
objects automatically via this

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.840
transparent persistence layer
known as Enterprise Objects.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.840
To help demonstrate this,
I want to invite up Ernest Kim of

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.740
the WebObjects engineering team
to do a quick demo of how we

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.780
do data modeling in WebObjects.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.830
Ernest?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And can we please switch
to the demo machine?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.500
So we have here WebObjects
5 running on Mac OS X,

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.780
taking advantage of the
gorgeous Aqua user interface,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.040
and we'll go ahead and
create a new data model.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.340
So we just go through and you notice
that JDBC is the preferred database

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.670
access mechanism for WebObjects 5.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.190
You just access it via a standard
URL going over the network or to

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.300
the local host for a database.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.150
For this example, we'll use OpenBase,
which is available as part of the

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.660
developer tools to support our examples.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.590
There are a number of other
databases available for WebObjects,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.600
as we'll be talking about shortly.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.000
And we just find a database table,
we choose some of the information

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.890
that we want to walk through,
and it automatically goes and

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.600
reverse engineers a data model.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.920
And we'll actually, for simplicity,
we'll skip over the relationships,

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.020
but you'll see there's
a whole host of tables,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.540
and it goes through and it figures
out what the tables are and

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.060
generates objects that correspond
to that and defines a model file,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.120
which can optionally include all
the referential integrity checks.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.300
That means that you get a table that
says you get an object model that you

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.400
can work with in your application,
which is mapped to the database,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.900
but it actually knows
about all the relationships

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.460
associated within that table.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.540
So this tool,
just by talking to the database,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.040
knows all the relationships,
the primary keys, the foreign keys, 2, 1,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.600
too many relationships.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.880
Incredibly sophisticated model
that is being figured out

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.240
automatically by the tools.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.340
And this is all work that
you do not have to do.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.720
The tool does it for you.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.410
This means you can get started writing
your application logic and working

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.280
at the high-level object model using
the power of the WebObjects tools.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.960
Thank you very much, Ernest.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.460
So you've got your data model,
so you know what your data is.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.720
Now the next challenge is doing
something interesting with it.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.060
WebObjects provides a couple
of different ways that you can

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.500
really take advantage of that.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.780
One is we handle a lot of the
hard work of page generation.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.230
With WebObjects,
we try to really separate out the

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.520
information needed to generate
a page into three key pieces,

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.960
the HTML template, the business logic,
and the enterprise object

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.600
containing the data persistence.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.660
And we use a technology called
Web Components to really

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.330
encapsulate these things while
isolating the HTML templates

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.970
and the logic from the data.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.370
The Web Component architecture manages
all the hard work of doing HTML request

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.840
response to manage the sessions,
the users, the security,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.380
all the things that become very
complicated when you're doing

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.770
three tier web applications.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.960
This technology is also very flexible
and can be used to generate HTML,

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.380
XML, or even Smile for
multimedia applications.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.650
It also makes it very easy to embed rich
client side scripting and other controls

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.580
into your data templates without having
to corrupt your business logic or your

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.780
database with any of that information.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.780
It also has the ability
to be fully multilingual.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.510
So you can create multilingual
sites using WebObjects technology.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.240
So we're very excited about the
potential this offers to streamline

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.180
page generation and make it easier
for people to keep really rich,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.060
visually compelling websites
very quickly and easily.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.980
So to demonstrate that,
I'm providing up Tom Naughton from

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.260
the WebObjects engineering team.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.320
Tom, push the demo, please.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.600
There's a lot of different ways
that you can create WebObjects

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.300
applications from scratch or using
various tools and assistance.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.470
We're going to create a type
of application known as a

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.790
display group application.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.960
A very common way to view a database
is to look at a certain field and then

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.380
find other tables or fields that are
related to that piece of information.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:13:55.900
[Transcript missing]

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.510
So we'll go ahead and just finish,
and this will go ahead and create

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.020
just a very simple web component.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.800
So let's go into the web components
directory and actually see

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.280
the components that's created.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:10.570
If we just double click on the WoW file,
that should launch WebObjects Builder,

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.800
and maybe you can maximize
that a little bit larger.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.210
So you can see it creates
some interesting elements,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.550
including a repeating
element within the area.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:22.240
And these are just very simple tags
added into an HTML file that say,

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.550
when you get to this tag,
instead of just returning HTML,

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.190
talk to a WebObjects component
and return dynamic data.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.960
Okay, so a very simple file,
a very simple HTML file,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.790
very little piece of Java code.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.600
And you can actually go
and run this application.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.790
And when you do,
it launches WebObjects application.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.470
It'll actually be smart enough to
launch your browser of choice and bring

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.990
up the URL for your web application.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.110
And we'll be turning along,
compiling Java.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:56.050
on Mac OS X,
taking advantage of the project builder.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.470
First time we're launching
Internet Explorer here.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.700
And you see,
we will bring up in seconds a full,

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.950
complete, sophisticated web application.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.270
Go ahead and type in some data.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.780
Go ahead and select an entry,
and it's there.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.210
So we have a full,
sophisticated web application

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.390
created from scratch using
WebObjects in a matter of seconds.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.670
Thank you very much, Tom.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.960
And these are full-featured applications.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.170
You can edit, browse, delete, add rows,
etc.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.000
And you can easily take this simple
application and customize it.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.490
These are things that usually take a
couple of weeks to get up to speed,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.000
to get your data model,
to get your page generation,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.840
to get your session
management all taken care of.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.130
WebObjects does the hard work for you,
and it does it all using frameworks

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.600
rather than generated code for the
bulk of the logic that's going on.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.060
And because it's framework-based,
you know it's our code

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.850
that we have built,
that we have tested,

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.120
that is reused across
all your applications.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.700
So you don't have this huge mass
of generated code to maintain

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.430
as you sometimes get with
other development environments.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.670
The other great thing about this,
because it uses frameworks,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.690
we can substitute in other frameworks
for the viewing of your data.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.300
And one particular way to do this
is using rich desktop applications.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.760
HTML is great for a lot of browsing
and for the greatest possible reach,

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.340
but often you want to have a much richer,
highly interactive user experience,

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.490
which has client-side caching
for great responsiveness,

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.420
very live, active controls,
and very sophisticated

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.820
and complex widgets.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.970
So through that,
we've found a number of tools

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.720
for integrating both Java and
Cocoa technology with WebObjects 5.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.710
And to demonstrate that,
I'd like to invite up Ron Lusong

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.020
from WebObjects Engineering.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.510
Ron?

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.340
Ron will get rid of the
browser because he doesn't

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.130
need that for his kind of apps.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.440
And we'll go in to the project builder,
again, the heart of the

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.210
Mac OS X development experience.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.300
We will create a Cocoa application.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.880
And we'll just go ahead and create
the project using Project Builder.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.050
And again, the important thing
is choosing the model.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.890
The model defines the data access and
persistence of your application and

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.260
provides a strong typing that you can
use to define the other heuristics.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.360
So we'll create a fairly
simple table here using Cocoa.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.140
And again,
we just specify the entity that

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.490
we want to look at as well as
some of the key attributes.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.870
And again, we can use the model to go
ahead and traverse different

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.290
entities and relationships to
walk through the data model.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:33.020
and then add a few forms in
there for a more richer and

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.180
complicated user interface.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.730
And again, add a query field for
what we want to look at.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.280
And that brings us into Project Builder.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.910
And instead of a web component,
we now have resources,

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.600
in particular an interface builder file,
or a Nib.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.800
And the Nib uses the
technology known as EO Palette,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.600
which provides the ability
to drag and drop connections.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.410
So if you bring up a
connection inspector,

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.590
you can see how one of the tables

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:09.010
Those things are actually,
those forms are actually connected

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.010
into the database using the connection
mechanism in Interface Builder.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.900
Little troubles.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.060
Okay.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:20.540
You cleaned up the Nib file
the way you wanted it,

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:20.540
Ron?

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:20.540
Okay, so Ron rearranged some
widgets in the Nib file.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:20.540
Now we go ahead and
build the application.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.690
And it's compiling the
Java down to JAR files,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.400
wrapping it in a shell application,
conforming to the Mac OS X packaging

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.800
guidelines so you get a nice full
double-clickable application.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.460
It'll automatically launch it for you.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:39.050
And we have live in Java a complete
Cocoa application created using

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.520
WebObjects and Enterprise Objects.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.200
It's all live, very quick series.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.290
You don't have to deal with
page refreshes or page resizing.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.990
Everything just works.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.220
Great.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.320
Thank you very much, Ron.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.270
Those are three of the really key
powerful advantages in WebObjects

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.710
and WebObjects 5 in particular.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.680
The other thing is
scalable Java deployment.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.170
We have a nice Aqua compliant monitor
application that you can use to

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.860
browse all the different WebObjects
application servers on your network,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.500
manage instances, controls.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.440
And with WebObjects,
it's really easy to add new machines and

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.430
extend the reach of your application.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.220
We support multiple instances,
multiple threads, multiple processors,

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.930
all running on one or multiple
machines to make it really

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.480
to create very sophisticated
and powerful web applications.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.050
The other thing that's really
exciting about this that I wanted

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.330
to just talk to you about,
a lot of people were concerned when

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.280
they heard about the move to Java,
wondering about, wasn't Java slow?

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.450
Would it hurt performance?

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.040
So we got some very interesting results
back as we've been testing performance.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.290
We did a simple test where we insert,
search for, and delete three movies.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.300
The basic database access loop that is
common in these kinds of applications.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.720
We ran it for basically
three server days,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.500
six machines, three runs,
four hours each.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.500
The results were very impressive.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.260
On Mac OS X, Server Vision 10,
testing it against 4.5.1,

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.810
we found that we were 22% faster
than we were with WebObjects 4.5.1.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.600
On Windows 2000 Pro,
we were over 50% faster than we were.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.900
And of course you think, okay,
well that's for certain platforms.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.600
What if I want to do some really
heavy-duty deployment on Solaris?

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.470
With Solaris, we were 187% faster.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.240
So, I mean, there's several things you
can take away from this.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.060
Obviously,
every application is different.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.100
Every application has its own
performance characteristics.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.660
This is a very simple test,
but it's the test that we've

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.080
been using to monitor the
performance of our runtime.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.860
And one of the things this tells
you is the Objective-C stack was

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.420
highly optimized on Mac OS X.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.710
It's been very optimized on Mac OS X.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.180
The Java stack has also
been optimized on Mac OS X.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.000
And you can see that we got a
benefit even just using Java versus

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.380
a highly tuned Objective-C stack.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.840
On other platforms, such as Solaris,
where there's a lot of people working

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.930
on the Java stack and relatively few
people working on the Objective-C stack,

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.520
performance is even more impressive.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.430
So this is the fact that we're
able to take advantage of all

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.820
the work that all the industry
is doing on Java performance,

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.220
on their database drivers,
on their runtime stack,

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.480
on their threading model.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.860
It makes it very easy to
deliver very powerful,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.820
scalable Java applications
using WebObjects 5.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.250
But last but certainly not least is
the fantastic suite of tools that

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.520
make WebObjects such a joy to use.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.590
Most people think of web application
development as this incredibly tedious,

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.400
painful, grungy thing.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.890
With WebObjects, it's fun.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.400
How many of you are addicted
to WebObjects development?

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.350
Those of you who have
been using it for a while,

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.400
there's a sense of which, if I can't,
I mean, some of you may know my history.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.400
I started out doing next step
development while I was in college.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.200
And when I graduated,
I ended up going into

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.400
management consulting.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.350
Because if I could not use the tools
that I was used to using on my desktop,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.300
there's no point in being a programmer.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.750
And with Apple acquiring next
in the WebObjects technology

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.400
and making it available in the
mainstream in the mass market,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.440
you know, in gorgeous places like
the Apple retail stores,

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.380
you know,
there's a chance for this technology

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.370
to really become mainstream and it
actually gets fun to program again.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.840
I'm very excited,
as you probably guessed.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.730
So there's five key technologies
that are part of WebObjects

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.530
in the application tool space.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.080
WebObjects Builder for
HTML layout and design,

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.500
Interface Builder for laying
out Java and Cocoa applications,

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.340
the Project Builder, of course,
the heart of our development experience,

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.450
the fantastic
Enterprise Object Modeling tool,

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.380
and of course, Rule Editor.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.260
Some people may not be
as familiar with that,

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.180
which is used for the direct-to-Java
client and direct-to-web

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.330
applications to manage these
automatically generated applications.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.630
And there's really four key
advantages we're stressing to people

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.840
as we go and talk to the press,
talk to analysts,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.800
talk to customers about why they really
should want to consider WebObjects.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.770
The first one is rapid time to market.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.800
WebObjects is really designed to support
very sophisticated modular development.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.230
In fact, you can build things in parallel
with very good isolation where the

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.800
frameworks do the hard work for you of
application design and partitioning,

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.110
as well as some of the really painful
grunt work of session management,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.800
page generation, and data access.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.960
As well as a really comprehensive
suite of smart tools to streamline

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.680
the way you build your application.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.390
This is really a dream environment
for a lot of people who don't really

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.800
believe the web development can
be this easy and can be this fast.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.800
And I've talked to someone at
lunch today who is in a business,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.800
an industry, where they have projects
that are six months long,

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.680
and they can't afford to spend
six months doing the design

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.800
of their application server.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.650
They want something where they can
turn on an application that's robust

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.800
and tested in three months so they can
get their job done that much quicker.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.800
And this is the tool
for people like that.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.800
In addition,
there are the very powerful assistants.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.500
They allow you to create fully
functional prototypes in just

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.800
seconds using the direct-to-web and
direct-to-Java client functionality.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.800
They allow you to browse your database,
access your data from anywhere,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.970
and then iterate on the important
pieces to create more sophisticated

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.800
and complicated web applications.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.670
The second one is quality.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.570
A lot of people, you know,
they rush things to market and

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.800
they have to sacrifice quality.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.760
With WebObjects,
we try to reduce the problems there.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.800
One is that we have a very
mature set of frameworks.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.800
Again, WebObjects 5 is the first with
a version entirely in Java,

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.250
but a lot of the technology
has been part of Java client

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.790
WebObjects for several generations.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.900
And the frameworks themselves
were designed by people who

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.780
really understand WebObjects,
who understand object technology

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:15.090
and object orientation,
and are able to really design things that

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.200
simplify the way that you develop your
application and be able to refine that

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.800
over the five generations and five years
that WebObjects has been in existence.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:24.920
Also,
the way to get around Murphy's Law is

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.000
to have fewer things that can go wrong,
because we all know that

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.800
anything that can go wrong will.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.780
But if you're running a small
amount of application-specific code,

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.800
anything that can go wrong with
your application is much smaller,

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.780
and therefore you're much more
likely to get a fully functional

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.750
application much quicker.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.330
And because the same frameworks
are leveraged by so many

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.610
people over so much time,
they have much greater ability to

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.800
ensure the quality of those things.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.820
WebObjects really tries hard
to isolate pieces of the

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.590
application one from another.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.120
Your data access, your HTML,
your business logic are all

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.800
isolated from one another.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.800
When you see the kind of programming
models where you have web designers

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.800
working on pages which have scripting
code embedded inside the web page,

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.890
which talk directly to a database,
that means if your beautiful,

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.800
creative graphic designer puts
a wrong comma in their code,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.780
they could corrupt your
corporate database.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.740
This is not a good idea!

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.790
We really want people to understand
the importance of properly architecting

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.800
their applications to ensure scalability
and security of your application.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.810
Things like Java Client,
where with WebObjects you have

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.170
three-tiered Java clients where
the sensitive code is on the

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.800
server rather than on the client.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.800
So if someone decompiles
your Java client,

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.800
they don't have access to all
your sensitive business logic,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.800
where they can talk directly
to your data center.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.700
Very powerful partitioning technologies
that really improve the security

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.800
and reliability of your application.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.850
And last but certainly not least,
having all the referential

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.800
integrity constraints embedded
declaratively in the data model.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.880
I mean, we all know what it's like
to work on a long project in

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.800
the wee hours of the morning,
trying to beat a deadline.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.800
And it's very hard to make sure that you
remember all the little things that are

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.800
the dependencies between different pieces
of your database and your application.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.490
And WebObjects handles all the hard work
remembering those tedious details for

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.710
you to make sure your data stays safe,
no matter how tired you may be.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.710
And certainly the big thing
for WebObjects 5 is full

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:10.710
accessibility to Java.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.990
WebObjects runs pretty much
anywhere with Java 2 platform,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.730
standard edition 1.3.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.040
Obviously,
in order to be qualified and supported,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.940
you need to run one of the configurations
we've actually tested it against,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.640
such as Solaris 2.8, Windows 2000,
or Mac OS X Server.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.710
But the fact that it's in
Java makes it much easier to run

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.040
in a bunch of different places,
makes it more familiar

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.350
to Java programmers,
and also makes it easy to interoperate

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.620
with other Java solutions.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.240
There are already people who started
working with the beta or early

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.100
releases of WebObjects to integrate
it in with servlets or EGB containers

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.260
or other Java technologies out there,
web services, etc.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.290
One of the more exciting things is we
integrate the latest Xerxes XML parser

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.780
from the Apache Software Foundation based
on some very important IBM technology.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.070
And it allows you to import
and export XML data into

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.620
your WebObjects application,
integrate it into your

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.020
Enterprise Object models,
to make it very easy for you to

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.960
create things like web services,
create things like

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.760
XML SOAP on top of WebObjects.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.850
There are some very exciting
things we've done with WebObjects.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.670
People are doing WebObjects today.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.640
There are some even more exciting
things that we expect to be

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.760
able to do with WebObjects 5,
with the Java interoperability.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.160
We're looking at some really
interesting technologies like

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.690
Enterprise Java Beans and web services,
and how to make it even easier

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.730
for you to create those kinds of
great solutions with WebObjects.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.980
But even today,
because of the power of Java,

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.760
because you can run on
standard Java virtual machines,

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.490
it is very easy for you today
to go out and integrate these

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.760
things with standards-based
technologies wherever you need to,

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.740
to get your job done in the
environments that you're working in.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.790
in your networks.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.040
And last,
and this can't be stressed enough,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.040
Avi mentioned this in the keynote,
WebObjects is a proven solution.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.910
Some of the best brands on the
internet have deployed very

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:48.300
sophisticated mission-critical
web applications using WebObjects.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.170
Whether it's customers doing
consumer-oriented websites,

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.300
higher education sites like the
University of Michigan Portal,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.450
creative solutions like
Adobe InScope or the BBC News site,

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.430
or business solutions
like the MCI WorldCom or

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.300
AT&T Wireless Billing Solutions.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.300
These are mission-critical
applications serving many customers.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.520
And of course,
that doesn't even mention some of the

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.520
incredible Apple solutions available
like the Apple Store and iTools that

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.300
service millions of our customers.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.680
Of course,
the greatest thing about WebObjects 5,

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.670
especially for those of you like me
who have been around for a while,

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.130
is that it's available today, here,
it's shipping.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.690
Feel free to applaud.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.700
As you know,
Apple decided this was just way too

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.940
powerful a technology to just leave
in the hands of a few very large

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.540
corporations with deep pockets.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.370
So we've priced it at $699.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.990
We put it in retail outlets
like the Apple Store,

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.630
so you can walk down
to Glendale and McLean,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.230
Virginia,
or soon any of the other 25 Apple Stores,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.200
and pick up a copy of WebObjects,
start building sophisticated

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.450
enterprise-scale web applications today.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.180
It's available worldwide via the
Apple Store and authorized resellers.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.200
There's evaluation copies available.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.680
How many of you have already
installed your developer tools

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.800
CD you got in your backpack?

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.260
Okay, some of you have started.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.660
For those of you who didn't notice,
the developer key that's associated

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.640
with it expires at the end of September,
and that is located in the

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.090
PDF file at the top level there.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.700
So make sure you read through the README.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.560
I know all of you read through
the README before you install,

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.090
but in case you don't,
be sure to do it this time so you

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.200
can get the license key that you'll
need in order to install WebObjects.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.060
I'm also pleased to announce
that we will be providing very

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:25.770
steep discounts to ADC members.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.650
Premier members will get
WebObjects 5 for free.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.890
Select members will be able
to purchase it for $399,

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:31.800
almost half the price.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.890
We think this is fantastic technology.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.960
We want to get it out
to all our developers.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.490
The other thing which isn't mentioned
here is that WebObjects 5 deployment,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.380
the full unlimited deployment,
will be available as part of

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.890
Mac OS X Server version 10.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.480
So if you buy Mac OS X Server version 10,
you can deploy your WebObjects

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.200
application for free as part of that very
high-performance Java 2 implementation.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.300
WebObjects 5 will be
available as a single product.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.430
It will be a single box containing
the developer tools for both

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.440
Mac OS X and Windows 2000,
as well as deployments

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.300
for Mac OS X Server,
Windows 2000, and for Unix.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.650
A single box,
if you buy it from anywhere,

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.950
has all the pieces you need
to develop applications on the

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.760
leading desktop operating systems,
as well as deploy on

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.290
virtually any Java platform.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:25.810
So that's the product of WebObjects 5.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.690
Of course, there's more to it than that.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.020
Just to give you a quick roadmap,
of course, WebObjects 4.5 was the

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.390
version released last year,
really bringing it to Mac OS X server.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.320
The last release of the
WebObjects 4.5 train,

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.020
4.5.1, was released in May,
which supports

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.360
Objective-C applications on Mac OS X.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.710
It provides a number of important
bug fixes for other environments.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:52.280
And WebObjects 5, of course,
was released this week.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.600
WebObjects 4.5 will be end of life.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.740
In order to support WebObjects 5,
it will be in the channel.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.300
WebObjects 4.5.1 will continue
to be available via phone order

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.120
from the Apple Store for quite
some time to come to enable our

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.160
legacy customers in the transition.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.470
We definitely want to see
all of you moving to Java.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.340
This is the future of database
development on the Internet.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.910
And we're working very closely
to make sure that we have a good

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.260
transition story for our customers.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.590
The Java converter provided in both 4.5
and 5.5 is a great way to get started.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.010
WebObjects 4.5.1 and WebObjects
5 will convert your Java code,

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.550
as well as having a lot of the grunt
work of Objective-C to Java translation.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.210
Obviously, there's semantic differences,
which requires some effort.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.540
WebObjects 4.5.1 is also available for
those who have existing applications,

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.440
whether those are WebObjects applications
or legacy Cocoa EUF applications,

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.280
to enable you to run those
applications on Mac OS X.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.020
However, I do want to stress the future
of WebObjects and of database

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.920
development on Mac OS X is Java.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.210
At that point, that's all I had to
say about the product.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.800
At this point,
I'd like to welcome up Matt Rollefson,

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.960
the Documentation Manager for
Technical Publications,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.010
to share a few words about
the documentation strategy.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:58.810
Raleigh?

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.470
Thanks Ernie.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.480
So WebObjects is a pretty
large and complex product.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.980
It makes it really easy to do a
lot of things but it also lets

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.260
you do a lot of different things.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.820
And we have documentation to cover
these different areas of the product.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.140
There's reference documentation for the
APIs in multiple different frameworks,

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.290
some of which you use everyday,
some of which you might only use when

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:32.080
you're doing some very specialized
type of custom configuration.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.230
There's tutorial and overview information
to get you started so that you can get a

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:42.100
nice gentle introduction to the product
and figure out how do I approach this.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:47.580
There is deployment information which
is something that's sort of unique to

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.980
WebObjects because it is not only a
sophisticated development environment

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.790
but it also has a very sophisticated
deployment story where you're going to

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.920
integrate multiple different servers,
potentially several machines,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.880
running different instances
of your application.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.470
. So there's a lot of information there.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.620
Dynamic load balancing,
talking to different web servers

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.920
that may be running on completely
different operating systems.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.970
And there's a lot of technology
built into WebObjects to

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.600
help you get that done.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.530
And then we also have information
about specific focus tasks.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:23.790
We've got a sales force that has
been working with large customers and

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.960
also small customers for a long time.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:30.560
They've encountered specific scenarios
that seem to come up again and again.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.100
Everybody wants to do this one thing.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.920
And if only it were
described in just this way,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.320
we could in fact get it done quickly.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.020
So those are available as part of the
documentation that's online on your CDs,

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.540
gets installed on the system when
you install the developer tools.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.290
You can also find that type of
information in the tech notes from

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.730
the website developer.apple.com.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:34:01.960
Now, as part of Apple rolling
this out to a wider audience,

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:06.790
tutorial and introductory information
has been really important.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:13.090
And we know that people like to
access things online for quick access,

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.590
but they don't necessarily like to
read lots of documentation online.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.840
You know, sitting down and reading
through a 30-page PDF is

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.360
about as much as I can handle,
at least, on a screen,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.600
let alone a 200-page book that is
going to give me a complete overview.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.420
So, Technical Publications has a deal
with Fatbrain to publish documentation

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:38.560
online and also make it available
print-on-demand from Fatbrain.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.000
So, the first book for WebObjects
that we released in this is

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.590
called Inside WebObjects,
and it came out this past winter.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600
I believe we released it last year.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.560
We released it in January.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.470
It is an overview of WebObjects 5,
gives you information about what are

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:57.070
some of the new technologies in here,
what are the four major development

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:02.010
approaches that I might take when
I'm looking at WebObjects and my

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.930
problem and whatever I want to solve,
and gives you some guidance

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.940
as to what are the tradeoffs,
what are some of the performance

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.600
implications of taking
one approach or another,

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:16.600
what are some of the flexibilities that
I might get from a very high level,

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:16.600
where I might be able to get some
of the information that I need.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:16.600
So, that's the first part.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.870
And then the second part is,
if I'm looking at a high level,

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.670
why should I choose one or the
other of these different approaches?

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.400
Very shortly,
we will have another book available

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:30.600
from FatBrain called Inside Web Objects:
Discovering Web Objects for HTML.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.820
So this is the first of what is
going to be a series of books

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.200
examining the different approaches
to development on web objects,

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.840
taking you through a fairly
complex tutorial application,

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.890
teaching as you go,
so that you can figure out exactly how

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:52.090
do I write a web objects application
that presents a nice HTML interface

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.370
to users through a standard
browser that is highly scalable,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.500
available,
and gives them access to all the

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.590
information they need from your database.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.600
So look for that on our
website coming very shortly,

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.600
and more coming up in the
next six months or more.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.540
All right.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.180
Thank you very much, Raleigh.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:20.840
Ron Lee's had an amazing job because he's
had two basically completely new versions

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:25.880
of fairly mature applications coming out,
both Mac OS X and WebObjects 5,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.040
in the space of about two months.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.550
And having to then, of course,
everyone who's used to the older

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.920
versions wants to have complete,
comprehensive information

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.330
about everything on day one,
the way they're used to after ten

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.620
years of development in other places.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.450
So he's got a major challenge.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.970
We're staffing up very hard to
try and really keep up with the

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.770
demand for information about this.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.100
And it's going to take a little
while for us to catch up with all the

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.630
great work our engineers have done.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.660
But we're very excited about the plan we
have in place to really try and address

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:54.380
that and get this information more out
to you sooner and more comprehensively.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.880
Of course, having information is great.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.040
Having people is even better.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.240
We're proud to have some of the
best people in the business working

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.620
with Apple Professional Services.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.610
At this point,
I'd like to welcome up Tim Joernsen

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.400
and James Dempsey from Apple iServices.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.230
Hi, James and I are going to take a few
minutes to talk about Apple iServices

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.650
and what we've been up to.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.970
About a year ago we were chartered
with delivering professional services

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:27.990
around Apple and Apple's technology,
WebObjects being a fundamental

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.580
cornerstone to that plan.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.740
We also offer integration services
around Mac OS X and Mac OS X networks,

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.390
technical training,
which is really what James is

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.730
going to spend some time on,
as well as technical support.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:46.310
On the consulting side,
we offer a full range of professional

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:51.470
services from project management to
software development to integration

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:56.390
and migration planning with
WebObjects and third-party solutions.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.200
I just want to throw out some
synergies that you might think about.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:05.060
For example, WebObjects could be used to
develop applications to help

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.040
manage Mac OS X networks and the
information in directory services

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.390
like LDAP to help manage that.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.690
So there's a lot of exciting things that
can be done around Apple technologies

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.400
and how they can be leveraged together.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.310
We continue to offer technical
support for WebObjects

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:29.470
development and deployment,
and we offer that in two levels,

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.170
the silver and gold.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:37.810
We do this through support personnel
who are not only expert in their field,

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.080
they also strive to deliver that
information in a personalized

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.630
fashion with the goal of delivering,
of establishing a relationship

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.480
between Apple and you.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.640
And as you would expect
with any professional,

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:58.220
any technical support organization,
they deliver that in a

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:58.220
timely and quick fashion.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.200
Thanks, Tim.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.810
So,
I wanted to talk just a little bit about

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:07.600
technical training in Apple iServices.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.230
As Tim mentioned,
last year we were given the task to

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.920
bring what has historically been,
in the three years I've

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.240
been with the department,
a web objects training organization,

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:23.130
and deal more with all of the core
technologies of Apple computer.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.210
We've been very, very busy.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:30.210
In the next four weeks,
we are going to be rolling one a week

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.380
for brand new or revised courses.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:39.520
We are going to be revising web
objects development one and two.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.160
Those will be shipping
in about two weeks.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.700
And we are also working on revising
web objects deployment for five.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.460
In addition, we are very happy to
announce today two new system

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.320
administration courses for Mac.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.820
We are also working on revising
web objects deployment for

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.650
Mac OS X and Mac OS X server,
as well as certification

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.680
programs around that.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:08.080
Finally, we are also currently shipping a
Cocoa development course that we've

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.260
been working very hard on that we've
also been using internally to train over

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.690
200 of Apple's own software engineers.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:20.330
I guess the final thing I'd like
to say is that in your bag that you

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.720
received today when you registered,
you'll find a card that

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.050
entitles you to the program.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:31.480
It entitles you to 25% off any of
our developer training courses.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.780
That is a deal that is good
as long as you sign up for the

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.900
training while you are here at
the show by visiting our booth.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.220
After the show, it's a 10% discount that
lasts for a few months.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.080
The details are in the
fine print on the card.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.070
So we're very,
very excited about being able to

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:54.800
support Web Objects 5 with training
that's been time tested over years.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.800
We're planning it,
updating it for the new Java,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.920
pure Java version of Web Objects.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:01.470
Thank you very much.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:12.540
Just to throw out, for more information,
you can go to our website

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.150
at apple.com/iServices.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:17.510
But again,
I would encourage you to visit the

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.310
exhibit fair where you can get the
extra discount on the training and

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.490
in addition answer any questions.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.590
Thanks a lot.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:26.590
All right.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:26.590
Thank you, Tim and James.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.300
So as I mentioned before,
we have a little surprise for you.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.180
One of the questions that
people have asked is,

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.000
why is Apple doing WebObjects?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.600
And there's a couple of answers to that.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.890
One is that it's just so cool.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.990
How could we not?

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:42.990
But...

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.800
But the other thing is that, you know,
as you heard this morning,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.730
we are now the largest
reseller of Unix systems.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:55.190
The people who build the
internet run on Unix.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:58.690
And we are committed to making sure that
we can really live up to that legacy.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:03.560
I come from a long time using BSD 4.2
way back in the Unix community.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.320
I'm a card-carrying Usenix member.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.470
I really like the culture
and the community of Unix and

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.220
the power and the mindset.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:13.110
I've always been sort of appalled
by the graphical interfaces that

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.610
we've had in the Unix world,
which is why I fell in love with

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.450
Next Step and Open Step and so forth.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.460
And the great thing about Mac OS X,
we really bring the power of Unix

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.240
with the simplicity of the Mac.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.880
And we're really able to really
try and marry some of these things.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.570
And one of my goals in development
platforms is to really make Mac OS X the

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.640
best platform for web development.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.940
And so we're really trying very hard to
make sure that we work with the Java,

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.680
the Unix, the WebObjects,
the other technologies we have to

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.160
really create a very powerful and
compelling solution for Unix users.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:41.560
And so we're really trying to make
sure that we work with the Java,

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560
the Unix, the WebObjects,
and Java developers

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.800
doing web development,
as well as helping all of you people

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:52.180
who've been maybe involved with the
WebObjects or the Apple community for

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:52.180
years really take advantage of some
of the great things and opportunities

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:52.180
available in web development.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.700
We have a lot of sessions
going on this week,

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.290
starting with the technical overview.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.280
This is sort of just the real broad
brush of the WebObjects community.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.160
Some of the key features to really
start digging into the technology

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.570
and how to start building stuff.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.300
There's the overview.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.100
We're also trying to make sure that we
allow you to overlap with some of the

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.300
key sessions from the Mac OS X track,
like the project builder introduction,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.150
to allow you to understand the
tools that you're using on Mac OS X.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.300
There's sort of a break point.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.250
The first couple of days are really
focused on introductions to WebObjects

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.300
and the key technologies for all the
people who are new to the community,

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.300
for some of the old hands who've
been through this a couple of times.

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.820
You might want to start checking
in on some of the advanced sessions

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.300
available later on in the week,
starting around Wednesday afternoon.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.300
So we're trying to make sure there's
something in here for everyone.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.300
There's a lot of content in here.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.280
The WebObjects team not only shipped
a product at the developer conference,

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.300
they shipped 17 sessions in
partnership with iServices,

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.300
which is just a fantastic job.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.380
And I want to give them another
round of appreciation for all

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.050
the work that went into that.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.450
And of course,
although we all believe that

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.610
WebObjects 5 is wonderful and it's
a great way to develop your apps,

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.120
it's still a work in progress.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.270
We know there's going to be a few
things that we missed that may

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.190
have annoyed you or certain things
that you want to do with this

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:02.340
product we may not have considered.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.550
And we want to hear that.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.400
I'm here.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.720
Bob Frazier, my product manager, is here.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.970
We are here to listen to you,
to understand what it is you need,

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.640
what you want to do with WebObjects,
how we can make your life better,

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.860
how we can help you get
WebObjects in even more places,

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:18.740
how we can really help make Mac OS X the
best platform for web development,

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.250
how we can make Mac OS X Server the
best platform for deploying rich

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:25.660
Internet content using WebObjects,
Apache, and QuickTime streaming.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.940
That's what we're here for.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.320
If you don't catch us during the week,
you can catch us at the feedback

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.310
forum and lend us your ears.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.110
So for more information,
we have a couple of

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.840
different places to go.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.160
Actually,
a lot of different places to go.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.750
The WebObjects at Apple.com is the
best single e-mail address to use.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.570
That will go to both marketing
and engineering to make sure that

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.070
we track feedback and information
that you may have for us.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.780
For things that may
require communication,

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.670
our code snippets are more lengthy
examples than we can jot down.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.680
It's a great place to send us
information about what you need.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:58.160
For iServices, for consulting,
integration, training, and support,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.880
there's an 800 number
as well as websites.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.760
There's several different websites.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.340
There's an Apple.com WebObjects page,
which has been recently updated by Bob,

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.900
to cover all the great new
features in WebObjects 5.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.200
There's a developer.apple.com website,
which will be updated soon,

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.090
to cover developer
resources for WebObjects.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.180
There's the iServices website.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.060
There's also an Apple.com website.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.600
There's a mobile support site
maintained by Robert and his team,

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.510
which has discussion boards,
tech info library articles,

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.160
lists of updates, and other information.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.880
We've also just recently created a
WebObjects announce mailing list,

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:32.050
which I need to go finish
and send an e-mail out to as

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.080
soon as I get out of here,
to provide people information

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.880
about new releases of WebObjects,
as well as other important information

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.780
affecting the WebObjects community.
