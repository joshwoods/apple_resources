WEBVTT

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.300
Good morning.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.300
Thank you for coming.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.500
It's early.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.680
So we're going to talk about
QuickTime 5 today and we're going to

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.300
give you a little bit of a glimpse
into the future for QuickTime.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.160
But before we start that,
I thought it would be only appropriate

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.690
to close the chapter on QuickTime 4.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.250
We've been working with
QuickTime 4 for a long time now.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.880
I thought you'd summarize
how things went for us.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.400
The first thing we have to say,
of course,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.470
is thank you to all of you developers,
all of our content partners,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.020
and other partners around the world.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.950
This has been a really big effort and
it's been a fantastic success and it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.730
wouldn't have happened without your
help and support and most importantly

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.610
feedback about what we're doing
right and what we're doing wrong.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.540
For QuickTime 4,
we set some fairly basic goals.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.700
We wanted to make streaming a
first-class citizen inside of QuickTime.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.800
We wanted to build a parallel
network with the software to be

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.200
able to allow us to distribute
the content around the world.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.080
And we wanted to make sure
that in doing all of this,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.200
we didn't lose all of the traditional
strengths of QuickTime in the areas

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.610
that you're all very familiar with.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.620
So how did we do?

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.430
At the end of the day,
it turns out we distributed over

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.100
150 million copies of the player.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.680
It's really quite a large number.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.470
Somewhat possibly even more interesting
is we distributed over 150,000

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600
copies of the streaming server.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.280
This is, as you know,
the streaming server is a body of

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.460
software that we make available
through the Darwin open source program.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.810
And developers can go
up and pull it down.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.580
You create this very
simple licensing agreement.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.210
And we've had over 150,000
people go and do that.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.720
This is a really wild one.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.690
There have been over 8,000 new
products built on top of QuickTime 4.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.430
This is not all QuickTime products.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.100
This is just on top of QuickTime 4
from 5,000 different companies.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.030
And of course,
in the process of doing all of this,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.170
we've seen a large ecosystem of partner
companies develop around QuickTime just

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.510
over the last couple of years.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.440
It's really, really fantastic.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.630
QuickTime TV, as you know,
it's our broadcast network.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.160
We've got over 50 channels.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.270
We've got some of the biggest names
in media participating in the program.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.840
And we've also hosted hundreds of
special and live events around the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.440
world over the last couple of years.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.460
Big success.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.060
You may not be aware,
but QuickTime is a very

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.460
popular technology for the
enhanced music CD marketplace.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.030
As the record publishers are looking
for ways to promote the CDs over the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.630
songs that are available on the internet,
say, they're looking to things like

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.460
enhancing the CDs with videos and so on.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.460
And QuickTime's been by far the most
popular option for enhanced music CD.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.210
We've had some of the biggest names
from some of the best publishers.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.220
In the space of digital cameras,
we've had fantastic success here.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.250
Virtually all of the major
camera manufacturers are

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.080
licensing QuickTime today.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.470
And some of them have even gone
so far as to build support for

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.220
QuickTime right into the cameras.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.220
It's really remarkable.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.220
And last, of course,
we've got the digital hub.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.960
Apple's been bringing new
products to market built around

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.220
the concept of the digital hub.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.210
And QuickTime is at the foundation
of most of these products.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.680
iMovie, Final Cut Pro for video editing,
iDVD, DVD Studio Pro,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.920
more recently iTunes.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.370
And this will continue, I'm sure,
but QuickTime is at the foundation

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.220
of Apple's media strategy.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.570
So today I'd like to say
goodbye to QuickTime 4.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.270
It's been a great product,
but it's time to say goodbye.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.450
And it's time to say
hello to QuickTime 5.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.480
So for most of the rest of the
presentation today I'd like to

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.620
talk about what's in QuickTime 5.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.880
So far,
we need to talk about how the product's

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.220
been doing in the marketplace.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.090
As you probably know,
we introduced QuickTime 5 last fall and

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.220
we started a public preview program.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.320
This gives us a chance to do a
broad seeding of the software,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.120
find out what people like,
what they don't like, and of course,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.070
working with all of the developers
to make sure that the software

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.670
works in your applications.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.880
We had over 2 million people
participate in the public preview.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.420
Really remarkable.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.370
About a month ago,
at the National Association of

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.790
Broadcasters show,
we launched QuickTime 5 officially.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.260
So this was the time at which
the software was officially done.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.060
In the last month,
we've had over 7 million downloads from

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.700
just our US servers of QuickTime 5.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.980
So this is going at a really good clip.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.790
Just to give you some
perspective on this,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.860
this is more QuickTime than we
distributed for all of QuickTime 3.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.850
It's one month.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.860
On Monday this week we announced the
availability of the QuickTime streaming

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.180
server version 3 that was launched
on Monday and it's available in the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.240
Mac OS X server product version 10.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.260
It's also available through
the Darwin open source project

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.690
as I had mentioned earlier.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.890
And you can go up to the website
and obtain the source code for

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.350
the streaming server and compile
it for your operating system.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.950
We support all of the
major operating systems.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.260
So that's great.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.000
QuickTime 5 has got a
bucket of new features.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.200
And let's go take a look.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.020
We listened to your feedback about
the player interface and we made

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.560
a lot of changes in this release.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.200
We've refined the interface such
that there's sort of a cleaner,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.940
simpler look.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.000
The windows can be more easily managed.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.850
We said goodbye to the channel drawer.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.000
There's some good
feedback we got from you.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.940
We've come up with a whole new mechanism
for managing the favorites and channels,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.000
which we think is a whole lot easier.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.760
We've added some new audio and
video controls that will be good

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.000
for consumers to adjust the video
for their personal preferences.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
We came up with a simplified
movie info summary panel.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.800
And then we added a feature that will
allow customers who might not know

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.550
a lot about QuickTime to find out
about interesting events that are

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.000
happening in the QuickTime community.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.990
So this panel is made
available to customers.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.000
What happens is we push movies,
or QuickTime movies,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
up to the clients on a regular basis.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.070
And they basically highlight
all the interesting things

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.000
that might be going on.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.300
So if you think you've got
interesting content or news that

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.380
might be of import to our customers,
you should get in touch with our

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.370
marketing group and let them know
about it and maybe you can get your

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.950
stuff noticed in the hot picks.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.140
So QuickTime's got support for many,
many different types of media.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.240
We support dozens and
dozens of file formats,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.480
dozens of different formats of data.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.460
Every release of QuickTime,
we work to enhance the media

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.490
support that's in there.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.780
And this release is no different.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.130
Cubic VR is a technology that
we introduced a while ago.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.090
It's finally shipping in the product
and it's a really exciting technology.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.410
It provides the capabilities for
photographers to be able to access

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.660
and view a much broader range
of content that might have been

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.160
available with just the cylindrical
panoramas previously supported.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.920
Now of course,
the Cubic VRs are new and available,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.770
but your cylindrical panoramas
are still available and

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.960
everything is still compatible.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.900
If you've written software
to work with VR panoramas,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.100
your software is still going to work.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.050
It's completely compatible
at the API level.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.640
At this time,
I'd like to bring Jim Batson up,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.760
Chief Architect, for QuickTime.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.480
He's going to help me do some demos.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.130
Now, I know that you've all seen
QuickTime VR and Cubic VR before,

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.850
but this is exciting stuff for us.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.960
I mean,
when we have an opportunity to engage

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.420
with the kind of creative people that
are out there in the world today and

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.100
see some of the things they're doing,
it's just sort of impossible not

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.640
to want to bring some of this
stuff here and show you today.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.310
So what we have here is we have
a Cubic VR that was produced by

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.350
Claudio Batter at Web Identity,
and this is a VR that was shot at the

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.480
peak of one of the taller mountains
in Switzerland called Jungfraujoch,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.130
and it's really quite stunning.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.400
It's a very high resolution panorama.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.910
As you can see, you can look down,
and it's not clear that you would

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.390
want to look down on this one.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.990
Very cool.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.160
There's a lot of interesting things
going on there and we're seeing

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.470
a lot of support from third-party
developers to support the new format,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.400
so I think the content creation challenge
will be well addressed on Cubic VR.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.690
Thanks, Jim.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.100
Let's go back to slides.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.730
OK.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.290
So QuickTime 5 brings a new
music synthesizer to the mix.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:10.680
QuickTime has had a MIDI-based software
synthesizer built in for several years.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.710
But in light of all the
development that we're doing on

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.610
Mac OS X in the area of audio,
we thought it would be appropriate

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.780
to bring a whole new version
of the software to the system.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.150
So we went back and rethought the
architecture and completely rewrote

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.980
the synthesizer for QuickTime 5.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.940
It's a very advanced
wavetable synthesizer.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.730
It's got lots and lots of features that
you can tweak from your applications.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.720
And it supports all
the popular standards.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.040
It's general MIDI compliant.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.970
Of course,
it supports standard MIDI files.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.490
It's compatible with the
Roland's GS specification

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.040
for instrument libraries.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.920
We're very happy about this one.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.980
It supports the brand new downloadable
sample specification called DLS-2.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.260
It's also compatible with Soundfont 2.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.860
DLS-2 is an interesting format
because it's actually part

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.800
of the MPEG-4 specification,
which we'll be talking a little

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.220
bit more about later today.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.710
It's truly a professional quality
synthesizer and when you combine

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.730
it with the ultra-low latency
that's available in Mac OS X,

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.870
it's a fantastic technology
and it's going to be a

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.260
fantastic boon for customers.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.540
And I think there are some
tremendous opportunities in

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.910
here for you as developers.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.220
We watched for years and years
people struggling to create

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.960
software-based instructional products
on Macintosh and Windows for that

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.310
matter that provided an appropriate
and adequate level of keyboard

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.840
responsiveness and sound quality.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.100
And it really wasn't
possible until today.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.530
With the new synthesizer,
I think you'll be very

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.690
impressed and I'd like to,
again, go to the demos and give you

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.060
a little bit of a sample.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.620
Now you saw, before you start this, Jim,
let me say a couple more things.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.040
You saw Avi in his keynote
do a demonstration that

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.060
shows off the low latency,
the very responsiveness of the keyboard

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.560
and shows how in Mac OS X you're
able to continue to perform with

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.250
the low latency at the same time
that you're doing other things in

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.150
the OS and it doesn't disturb things.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.200
Today I want to show you what some
of the power of the extensibility of

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.080
the sound library infrastructure is.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.200
So Jim, go ahead.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.400
The way that people put those things
together is you've got a music authoring

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.460
package to do the basic MIDI authoring,
and then they work with the

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.000
samplers to create a custom set of
sounds that you can then plug into

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.850
QuickTime and package all up together
and create a very unique sound.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.690
This is not the sort of sound you'd
expect from a standard MIDI file.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:18.040
If you want to learn more about the
audio services in QuickTime 5 and in 10,

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.740
here's three sessions you can go to,
some later today and some on Friday,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.540
or tomorrow and some on Friday.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:30.990
And then to learn more about
VR and how that's done,

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.160
some of the other interactive
aspects of QuickTime,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.160
come to the session later today.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.900
So DV.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.270
As you know,
DV is a very important format for Apple.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.800
DV is the video format that's
at the foundation of the new

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.000
generation of digital camcorders.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.050
DV plus FireWire have enabled
this fantastic convergence

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.440
between the consumer electronics
industry and the computer industry

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.660
in the area of applications
like iMovie and Final Cut Pro.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.430
For the first time,
they're bringing professional

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.220
quality at price points that
are accessible to consumers.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.250
We've done tremendous enhancements
to DV and QuickTime 5.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:11.420
We've made dramatic improvements in the
speed of compression and decompression.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.980
We've taken advantage of all
the tricks available to us

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.890
on Macintosh to support this.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.000
We've also taken a whole other
look at the detailed math in the

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.380
system and we've provided a much
higher level of accuracy and color

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.510
fidelity over multiple generations.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.210
I think you'll be very pleased with that.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.180
QuickTime has supported software
effects for a number of years now,

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.540
and with QuickTime 5,
I'm very pleased to be able

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.920
to say that we now can support
hardware-accelerated real-time effects.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.990
This is kind of the meat and
potatoes of the pro video world.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.340
And now with QuickTime 5,
applications like Final Cut Pro,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.740
Adobe Premiere,
you can support hardware-based real-time

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.770
effects without having to leave the
QuickTime authoring environment.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.850
This is a very cool one.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.430
You can learn a lot more about
these details at the professional

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.170
video session later today.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.480
Amen.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.240
MPEG-1.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.200
This is another technology
that we've supported in

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.930
QuickTime for a number of years.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.110
It's been Mac only until now.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.900
MPEG-1 is a foundation technology
for the video CD standard.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.100
It's also a de facto standard for a
wide variety of intranet type streaming.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.560
Enterprise streaming in the range
of say 500 kilobits up to maybe

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.180
one and a half megabits per second.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.850
Very popular format.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.750
Today with QuickTime 5 we can now
stream these industry standard formats

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.300
into QuickTime on both Mac and Windows.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.160
Very exciting.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.270
The streaming itself conforms to the
Internet Engineering Task Force standard

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.300
protocols.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.500
Again, it's all standards-based stuff.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.680
And we support pretty much
all of the MPEG-1 formats

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.300
you'd expect us to support.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.550
Very cool.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.720
Now, as you know,
QuickTime has always been a

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.950
very extensible architecture.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.760
This is one of these things we've talked
about for years and years and years.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.070
There are lots of different
ways that you as developers

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.660
can plug into the architecture,
extend the functionality of QuickTime.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.990
But one of the big problems
that we've had is that it's been

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.520
virtually impossible as a small
developer to be able to come

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.840
up with a groovy new component,
some innovative technology,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.800
and then get it distributed
to customers around the world.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.770
In the age of the Internet,
it's virtually impossible.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.640
You can't get the attention of the
content publishers if you've got a

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.340
new compression format without the
capacity to distribute on a broad scale

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.740
and without being able to convince them
that you've got that taken care of.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.840
They just won't talk to you.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.490
With QuickTime 5,
we've introduced some new technology

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.080
that allows us to solve this problem.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.960
When the system goes out,
the customer is surfing the web,

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.070
whatever,
they come across a movie that contains

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.580
some content that's not a part of
the standard QuickTime software set.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.880
We can automatically detect this.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.280
And we can go back and check on a central
server that we keep here at Apple and

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.160
determine if we've got some additional
software that could be your software.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.480
And then on demand,
we can install this and

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.100
automatically continue.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.850
So the customer gets a fairly
seamless experience as they surf the

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.670
web and you have a chance to be able
to distribute your technology far

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.080
and wide more effectively than ever.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.400
So far, we've got three companies
participating in this program.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.860
Be here, they do a sort of interesting,
innovative 360-degree

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.060
panoramic video technology.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.570
On to, they have a great,
great codec for the

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.180
internet and elsewhere.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.130
And then Pulse,
who make interesting 3D interactive 3Ds.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.220
3D scalable web streamable technology.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.340
Very cool.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.540
This is a plea to you.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.110
We would like to get more
components into this program.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.430
We've talked to dozens and
dozens of developers who've been

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.100
doing development in this area.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.580
We would love to talk to you again
and get you signed up in the program.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.500
You can go to this website and get a
lot more information about the program.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.370
I think you'll like it.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.230
XML.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.960
So with QuickTime 5,
QuickTime is going to

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.620
start to support XML.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.300
XML is a very important standard
in the internet these days.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.400
It's a great way to start
to describe data sets,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.800
complex interactions
between clients and servers.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.510
We've added rudimentary support
in QuickTime for XML and we've

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.970
provided a number of helper
routines that you can take advantage

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.800
of in parsing the XML files.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.800
This can be a complicated process.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.980
We're going to take
that work over for you.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.030
And what happens is that
when QuickTime goes out,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.590
it's able to detect the presence of XML.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.740
We start to import it and then
based upon typing information

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.680
that's built into the XML files,
we can detect which components are

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.230
required to be able to process the XML.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.280
So we will search through the file
based upon the various MIME types

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.350
that will be specified in the file.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.820
We can invoke customized importers
and those importers can come in and

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.260
then they can process the data that's
in the XML stream and do pretty much

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.340
anything you want with QuickTime.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.350
And this is a very powerful technology
for creating a variety of applications,

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.880
client server applications.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.640
My personal favorite is the
template-driven authoring.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.570
Very powerful technique employed
on a server but also very

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.930
interesting from the client.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.110
Let's take a look at a demo of that.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.160
So what we have here is,
why don't we go back and

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.560
first start with the pictures.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.250
So we've got a set of photographs here.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:37.920
These were taken during one member of the
team's sort of hijinks from an airplane.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.660
And what I want to do-- this is
my favorite demo of all time.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.720
I love taking slideshows and
putting music to them and making

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.470
that not be a big pain in the neck.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.100
So we've got 16 slides here.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.980
We've got some music.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.180
And then we've got this little XML file.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.960
Why don't you open that up?

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.900
Very simple structure.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.180
We define this language.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.990
You can define it any way you want.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.240
You've got the elements and
attributes that are central to XML,

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.930
basically describing a
sequencing of images,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.950
durations for the images,
transition effect between images,

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.140
and then a music segment to go with that.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.540
So we take this and we can open
this up inside of QuickTime.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.540
We wrote a little bit of
code for the importer.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.960
Go ahead.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.710
The importer is invoked, it runs,
it builds the movie.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.220
And here you go, no sweat.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.600
I think he's a very smart guy.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.490
This is actually a series of
photographs of a guy named Maynard

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.080
Hanley who works on our team.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.730
He's one of the smartest guys around.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.340
He's written most of the
MPEG code that we have today.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.640
Really brilliant guy.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.090
is foolish in his personal life, however.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.220
So let's talk about the
improvements we made to streaming.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.900
I said we introduced
streaming in QuickTime 4.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.820
We've made a lot of enhancements
over the last couple of years.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:03.420
Let's talk about what's
new in QuickTime 5.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.300
The big one, you heard Avi talk about it,
skip protection.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:04.300
Skip protection is actually

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.700
A coordinated technology that works
between the client and the server

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.710
and it uses three basic techniques
for improving the overall quality of

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.500
service of the streaming experience.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.220
The first technology is the
ability to retransmit lost packets.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.530
As you know, when you're streaming
things over the internet,

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.570
especially when you're using
unreliable transport such as UDP,

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.420
packets will get lost.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:30.250
When the client observes that
there are packets being lost,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.530
it has the ability to obtain
retransmitted packets,

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.240
fill in the holes.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.940
In addition,
when the server notices that the

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.360
network is beginning to be congested,
it has the ability to dynamically scale

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.900
the stream in order to cut down on
the congestion that's being produced

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.920
by the server itself and to maximize
the likelihood that the stream will

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.560
fit through the available bandwidth.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.930
And then the last technology that's
involved in skip detection is an

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.850
aggressive buffering of the media.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.280
Basically,
there are times when the network

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.360
bandwidth is less than you want,
and we've applied the first

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.820
two techniques to improve
the experience there.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.980
There are other times when the network
bandwidth exceeds the necessary bandwidth

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.380
for the media that you're trying to play,
and we take advantage of that opportunity

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.030
to buffer more data into the client,
thereby enabling you to break the cable

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.070
and life goes on very nicely for a while.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.830
So we've had the ability to
broadcast live streams in QuickTime,

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.860
again since QuickTime 4,
but this has not been a technology that's

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.590
been available to you as developers.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.800
With QuickTime 5,
we're introducing public APIs that

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.100
will allow you to write your
own broadcasting applications.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.620
It's a very flexible architecture.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.310
It allows you to introduce
your own sources.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.180
It doesn't have to be a video source.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.910
You can write plug-ins to
access any kind of input source,

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.640
audio, video, otherwise.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.780
We also added the capability
for live broadcast to be able

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.850
to support the transport over
reliable protocols like TCP.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.280
This is very important because if
you're trying to set up a live webcast,

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.240
unless you are willing
to go to the trouble of

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.660
obtaining dedicated lines,
leased ISDN lines or otherwise,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.290
what you will often experience
is the process of getting from

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:21.620
your webcast site to the streaming
server introduces packet loss.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.410
That's going to be replicated, you know,
we can have 100% replication

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.320
through the rest of the
infrastructure of the Internet,

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.350
but if you're already at 95% packet loss
by the time you get to the entry server,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.340
you're not going to be
able to overcome that.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:38.460
This technique allows us to guarantee
100% packet fidelity up to the

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.960
server if you need to use that.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.020
The APIs are available on Mac OS.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.700
Of course, if you're a Windows developer,
there's nothing that keeps you from going

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.230
out and developing your own broadcast
capability because all of streaming

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.320
is built on open standards after all.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.110
So you can go out and you can
write the software if you need

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.680
to be in a Windows environment.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.180
You can learn a lot more about
the details of the live streaming

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.830
capabilities of QuickTime 5
at the session later today.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.440
today.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.780
We added support for
another sort of streaming,

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.950
Shoutcast, very popular format.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.550
We've supported MP3 for a long time now.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.240
With Shoutcast support,
what you basically have is you've got

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.690
MP3 streaming over an HTTP protocol.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.770
And we've added support for that.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.810
You can use it to integrate internet
radio stations into your presentations.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.500
I think the most interesting thing about
this in the context of QuickTime is not

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.970
so much that we can handle the streams,
we're not trying to be a replacement

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.880
for iTunes or be your radio player.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.780
That's not what we're up to here.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.000
But it's that you can take these
kinds of streams and you can integrate

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.360
them with other QuickTime content.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.870
You can apply all the other powerful
interactivity techniques around Shoutcast

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.900
streams to provide just a much more
interesting experience for customers.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.620
Let's talk about the
streaming server for a minute.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.050
So I told you we had a lot
of downloads of the server,

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.880
over 150,000 downloads.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.580
We've had more than 250 companies
license the source code.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.940
Some of the biggest names in the
server business are working with

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.410
the QuickTime streaming server.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.670
This project really opened our eyes
up to the power of open standards.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.600
When we made this source code available
to companies around the world,

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.090
they were beating a path to our door.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.790
We've been amazed at the number of
companies who are coming to work

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.920
with us around QuickTime because
of this server project.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.830
It's been great.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.260
For the version 3 of
the streaming server,

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.090
we've added several new features that
will be helpful for people who are

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.080
working at the server end of things.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.980
There's a very easy to use web-based
server administration capability now so

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:45.100
you can administer the server no matter
where you are if you've got web access.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.370
We've improved the security
of streams so that when you're

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:52.490
streaming over the live internet,
your content will be protected between

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.550
the source and the destination.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.250
We support the reliable delivery
technology that I was just referring

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.200
to in the live broadcast capability.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.640
We've made improvements to the
support for caching proxy servers.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.360
And of course we work with
the skip protection technology

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.250
we were describing earlier,
streaming server version 3.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.260
There are a couple of sessions
to allow you to learn about the

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.800
basics of the server as well as how
to extend the server on Thursday.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.040
So now let's shift gears and
talk about the interactive

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.210
capabilities of QuickTime.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.500
QuickTime has a very,
very rich infrastructure and, you know,

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.840
almost no matter what your
knowledge base is as a content

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.430
publisher or a software developer,
we've probably got a technology in here

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.320
that's going to allow you to be able to
be comfortable working with QuickTime.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:40.620
The first thing I want to talk
about is Flash 4 for Macromedia.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.130
We have integrated
Flash 4 into the system.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.620
It brings a number of key capabilities.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.820
Flash is very powerful for
web-based graphic animations.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.840
It's great for some lightweight
interactivity capabilities.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.700
With Flash 4,
they've also provided very powerful

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.760
techniques for manipulating
text in forms and doing

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.300
client-server kinds of interactions.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.810
that you've not been able to do before.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.430
We've also taken the trouble not just
to build Flash 4 into the system.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.360
Again,
the goal here is not to replace the

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.290
Flash player in your web browser.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.370
The goal is to identify opportunities
to leverage QuickTime plus Flash to

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.300
do things that you couldn't do
with the two technologies alone.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.380
So we've built a number of new
capabilities into QuickTime that directly

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.300
interface to the new features in Flash 4.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.270
I'd like to show you a demo
of a couple of those things.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.680
One of the things that's very
interesting if you want to start

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.300
to talk about doing more elaborate,
more interesting presentations of media

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.200
in the internet is the idea of how
do you put these interfaces together.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.820
A lot of places you'll go and you'll
look at the web page and they'll reserve

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.560
this column over here for part of the
interface and they'll create other

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.300
controls over here on the web page.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.220
And they basically end up
taking your full screen display

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.270
and turning it into a tiny,
tiny video space.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.300
We think that this is the
wrong way to approach things.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.890
And we've got some technologies
in QuickTime with Flash that

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.290
allow you to do a much,
much better job of this.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.300
So Jim, why don't you bring up the movie.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.150
So what we've got here is we've got an
interface that's the interactive elements

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:21.290
are built with Flash and it's sitting
over the top of a QuickTime interface.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.620
And Mr.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.300
Schaffer,
would you prefer window or aisle?

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.300
So go ahead and let it play.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.300
Middle.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.300
Why don't you close
the menu for a second.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.300
Middle.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.500
So when you don't want
to see the interface,

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.300
you can make it go away.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.300
You've got the effect of the
whole display area for your video.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.300
When you want to bring the controls in,
you can do that.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.240
Middle.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.290
So when you bring the controls in,
just go over to the menu.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.260
It pulls in the controls.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.300
They're translucent so you
can still see the video.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.240
You can still tell what's going on.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.300
We think the overall effect
is a very powerful effect.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.260
We think this is kind of the wave
of the future for interfaces.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:52.700
Thanks, Jim.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.930
That's good.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.580
So that's Flash 4.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.790
Now, the foundation for interactivity
in QuickTime is built upon this

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.700
concept we call Wired Movies.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.760
Basically,
QuickTime's got a virtual machine

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.620
like you'd expect in any kind
of interactive environment.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.350
And we've got a series of media
objects in QuickTime that support

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.430
various properties and methods
for communicating between them,

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.650
and we have an elaborate event
model for handling user events.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.680
For QuickTime 5,
we've added over 100 new Wired

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.800
behaviors and properties to the system
across a whole range of media types.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.780
We've also enabled a new type of
interaction called QT List Actions,

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:37.020
which are XML-based transactions that
can go on between clients and servers.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.710
So QuickTime is now beginning
to support servers in a more

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.970
integral way than we have before.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.770
One of the most exciting features
that I see in QuickTime 5 is

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.100
something we call media skins.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.190
Sometimes we refer to it
as customized interfaces.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.070
The idea here is not that
you're skinning the player.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.180
Player skins are like
something that end users do.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:00.150
They change the behavior,
they change the look of their players.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.200
They don't change the behavior.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.060
It's all the same controls
that you would normally see.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.200
They just change the appearance.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.080
We think that, again, that's a fine idea,
but we don't think that's

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.180
the most powerful concept.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:14.010
We wanted to create an ability for
content publishers to easily alter

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:19.200
the appearance of their media and wrap
their media in attractive containers

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.740
that allow you to do great branding of
your content or to integrate with the

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:30.200
interactive capabilities of QuickTime in
new ways that are visually stunning.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.150
So let's take a look at
a couple demos of that.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.250
So this first demo we'll look at
comes from a very creative artist,

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.960
developer named Michael Schaaff,
Small Hands Software.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.340
Why don't you fire it up.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:51.680
This is a QuickTime VR panorama
in an interactive skin.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:54.160
So it's a non-rectangular window.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.060
As you see he's able to move around.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.620
He's using Live Stage Pro to create
the interactivity elements here.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.100
And it's all wired up and very cool.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.620
You can't do this with
other software products.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.240
So why don't we take a
look at the second one.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.500
The second one is a
very simple treatment.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.250
This is something that Apple's used
for its own branding of Mac.com.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.830
and Liquidator 5.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:24.820
Larry Apparee.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.760
Optimistic@mac.com.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.290
Squirrel82.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.840
They're very elaborate to look at,
they're very beautiful, very,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.870
very simple to create.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.080
Just a couple of minutes in Photoshop,
we've got Apple scripts that help you

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.310
assemble all the elements together.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.980
You can do this,
anybody can do these things.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.350
We're going to see these
all over the web shortly.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.640
You're going to learn about the
details of how these are created at

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.240
the interactive session later today.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.220
There's also great support for Java.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.740
If you're a Java developer
and you care about QuickTime,

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.010
there is great,
great support in QuickTime for

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.470
Java and in Java for QuickTime.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.330
With Mac OS X,
we've enhanced this even further.

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.620
And with QuickTime 5,
we've made the full capabilities of

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.430
the new feature set in QuickTime 5
available to Java programmers.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.850
And you can learn more about
that at the session tomorrow.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.060
So let's talk a little bit
about QuickTime and Mac OS X.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.710
You've heard people talking about
the power and flexibility of Unix

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.300
and the simplicity of Macintosh.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.600
I'd like to add one more element to this,
and this is the power of the

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.290
QuickTime creation and publishing
integrated with these other two elements.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.100
This has not been done before in such
an open and powerful environment.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.410
And we've got a little demo that we put
together to kind of give you a hint,

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.840
sort of a quick glimpse of what
might be possible in this area.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.080
I think it's going to be a really,
really big deal.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.300
Thank you.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.190
We call it proxy editing.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.040
And so what we've got set up
here is over on Jim's right,

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.850
he's got a titanium power
book that's running Mac OS X.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.300
He's going to be using
an Apache web server,

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.630
he's PHP scripts.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:10.610
We need the Mac OS 9, machine 8, please,
on the screens.

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:17.290
So Jim's got a Mac OS X-based server
running on his Titanium PowerBook.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.660
Over here on the client,
we've just got a web page that we've

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.860
set up to interact with the server.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.260
And what we're going to
do is we're going to,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.650
go ahead, first step.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:31.560
We're looking, basically just looking at
what's available on the server.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.530
So Jim's going to select
one of these videos.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.760
On the server,
what we've got is very high

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.810
resolution versions of the videos.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.510
Jim's going to pull down a very
low resolution copy of the video,

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.620
so it comes down very quickly.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.740
He's going to perform a
simple edit on the video.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.550
So he trims a little piece out of it.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.610
He's going to save that locally.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.490
He's just saving a reference movie,
so it's a very tiny movie.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.800
We're then going to push
that back up to the server.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:20.670
So now what's happening is he
sent it back up to the server.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:24.320
The server has now invoked a whole
bunch of new processes that are running,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.610
that are integrating the-- What's
happened is the server actually went and

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.380
did the edit on the high res content.

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:35.620
It's produced a number of different
formats that we can then view.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:40.610
So we've got a web page
version of a higher res output.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.930
And then we also, at the same time,
produced a version that can

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.010
stream live to you over the web.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.690
All driven by the server.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.700
So the client's a very
unsophisticated client.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.340
The server's got all
this power built into it.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.980
I think this is going to be a technology
direction that you're going to see

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.950
a lot of developers moving into.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:00.550
There's some tremendous opportunities
with all the power of the

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.690
infrastructure of Mac OS X combined
with all the authoring and

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.580
publishing power of QuickTime.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.530
Thanks.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:18.840
So that's QuickTime 5 and the
QuickTime Streaming Server 3.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.450
I encourage you to please go take a look.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.900
There's a lot of stuff in there.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:35.290
We've been barely able to
scratch the surface of the

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:35.290
new features in QuickTime 5.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:35.290
I'd like to do a segue
now to a whole new topic.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:42.440
I think that the industry is at a
real crossroads here and you don't

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.340
have to have lived through the
last year to be able to tell that,

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.480
but for those of us who have going
through the difficulties and the trials

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:54.770
and tribulations of the dot-com meltdown,
I think you're all well versed in the

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.950
pain and suffering that it's created.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.950
Now,

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.420
We in the streaming media
world are not immune to this.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.690
There are real problems in our industry.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.600
The production costs associated
with streaming media are exorbitant,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.440
way too high.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.810
The cost of distributing your
media is incredibly high.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.970
It does not scale.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.740
If you want to do a webcast
to millions of people,

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.250
you are going to,
if you can make it work at all,

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.780
you're going to be talking about major,
major expenditures.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.950
As you know,
every year the media companies

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.250
come out with new players,
and new formats, and new codecs.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.110
This kind of churn just
takes these other costs,

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.520
which are inherent in the
technologies we have today,

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.670
and multiplies those by N.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.790
It's quite a dramatic effect.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.560
As a content publisher,
you're constantly struggling,

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.490
how do I know what formats to publish in?

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.180
How can I reach the largest
number of people possible?

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.540
Because of the software churn,
the lack of compatibility

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.160
from one version to the next,
that you see in many of the players,

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.520
the customer is basically cut
off from the content publisher.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.030
When the proposition for the customer is,
I've got to download a new piece of

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.620
software to be able to watch this media,
but you're losing customers.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.290
You're going to lose those
customers every single time.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.380
And of course,
the fact that we've got all these

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.180
different formats vying in the
big food fight of streaming media,

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.610
that means that the broadcast,
the compatibility isn't

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.580
going to be there.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.570
It's a bad experience for customers,
it's a bad experience for publishers.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:34.580
I believe that the proprietary
technologies that we've been

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.470
building on are the problem.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.580
It's a big part of the problem.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.080
And I think that there
are some answers to this.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.080
So I want to talk about this.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.590
You will hear people talk about
standards as if it's the problem.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.630
Standards impede innovation.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.750
The whole process of developing a
standard is so slow and cumbersome.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.610
It's the worst of design by committee.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:02.570
The standards take so long to complete
that by the time they're released,

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.440
the technologies involved
are already obsolete.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.620
And of course,
the standards can't possibly

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.490
be optimizing for high quality
because they're late to market,

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.700
they're designed by committee.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:17.280
Is this true?

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.560
Could this possibly be true?

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.600
I don't think so.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.360
I don't think this is
anything like the truth.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:25.680
I think this is wishful thinking
that serves the purposes and the

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.500
interests of certain companies,
but it is not the truth.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.230
The truth of the matter is
that standards build markets.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:37.070
The TV industry would not be
possible without standards.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.150
The telecommunications industry is
premised on a standards-based approach.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.530
The consumer electronics industry
could not achieve the compatibility

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.610
that customers demand and expect
from one generation of product to the

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.920
next without the help of standards.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.760
And of course,
the Internet wouldn't exist

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.490
at all without standards.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.090
Standards actually solve problems.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.090
They solve the problems we need to solve.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.090
The discipline of a
standard helps to ensure,

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.090
helps to maximize the likelihood of
compatibility over the long haul.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.090
Standards encourage and support the
notion of interoperable implementations,

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.090
interoperable media,
interoperable software between vendors.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:50.650
And standards also help
to minimize a dangerous

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:50.650
over-reliance on a single vendor.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:50.650
The fact of the matter
is that no one company,

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:50.650
no matter how large the company,
can service all the

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:50.650
needs of the marketplace.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:50.650
And there's no way that a single
implementation can service all

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:50.650
the needs of every customer.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:50.650
The standards enable customers,
developers to get together,

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:50.650
craft solutions that are right for them,
and create markets and grow businesses.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.160
Standards actually fuel innovation.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.660
We're seeing this right now.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.000
It's playing out in our industry today.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Music players, cameras, camcorders.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.730
The music player is a
spin-off of the MP3 standard.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:09.800
It wouldn't happen without the MP3
standard becoming so important.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.170
Cameras, JPEG.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:15.030
I mean, it's,
I guess it's pretty obvious here.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.280
These are very important technologies.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.610
Camcorders, of course, DV, FireWire.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.340
The technologies that allow these
portable devices to connect to the PC,

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.660
USB and FireWire, all standards.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.960
And they have fueled, you know,
this huge, huge movement at

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.190
Apple around the digital hub.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.570
New optical disc capabilities.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:40.540
Again, completely standards-based,
driving whole new models

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.690
for authoring content,
totally revitalizing the

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.100
industry for movie distribution.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.010
Couldn't happen without standards.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:53.310
And as we look forward,
we're going to see new standards

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.840
that are going to be bringing
web access to new kinds of

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.130
devices that consumers will have.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.920
And I guarantee you,
this will change the way

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.310
that the internet looks.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.410
It's going to change the way that
people interact with the internet,

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.290
and it's going to change the
way that content publishers

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.140
start to publish their content.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:12.550
Very exciting.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.510
Simple case in point.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.060
MPEG-2.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.330
Well,
it was standardized way back in 1994.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.410
So clearly, it must be irrelevant.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:27.150
It didn't use the most aggressive
compression algorithm that was possible.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:27.600
I mean, after all,
they were concerned about making

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.300
sure that it would be able to be
implemented in hardware at the time.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.790
Nevertheless,
what we see over the last couple of years

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.430
is not the momentum of MPEG-2 going down.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:38.880
Instead, we're seeing explosive growth
around the technology of MPEG-2.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:43.140
Digital satellite, terrestrial cable,
DVD, HDTV.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:46.360
HDTV, which is the next
generation of television,

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.400
is built on MPEG-2.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:50.190
This seven-year-old standard.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.800
It's really quite remarkable.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.800
The thing that's critical to notice
in all of this is that the quality of

00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.920
the media that is being produced today
in MPEG-2 is better than ever before.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.650
This happens because

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:08.920
We're not talking about 50 or even
100 engineers working on a piece

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.430
of technology to make it better.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.370
We're talking about hundreds
of companies with thousands of

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.560
engineers looking at the software,
looking at the standard and

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.730
looking for ways that they
can improve the technology.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.340
The standard defines the bitstream.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.830
It doesn't define what the
encoder is supposed to look like.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.440
It doesn't define what the
decoder is supposed to do.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.600
It's about the bitstream.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.520
And the innovative work of the
thousands of engineers who can work

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.900
on the standards is very powerful.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.530
It's something to be reckoned with.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.800
Likewise,
the costs of doing MPEG-2 have gone

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.440
down and down and down over the years.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.870
As these thousands of engineers and
hundreds of companies are working

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:53.120
together to iterate on the designs
and to solve the problems of industry,

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.250
they're at the same time working on
solutions to the problems of cost.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.920
This is something that can be
applied to all of the industry.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.790
This is the work that we do.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.950
QuickTime has paid attention
to MPEG in the past.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.080
Apple's made a huge investment in
MPEG-2 with our line of DVD products.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.570
We announced about a month ago
that we're going to be supporting

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.440
MPEG-2 inside of QuickTime.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:21.670
And we have a demo here of our own MPEG-2
technology sitting on top of QuickTime 5.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.050
This isn't shipping yet,
but we wanted to give you a glimpse

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:28.430
of what is possible and let you know
and reassure you that this is going

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.000
to happen in QuickTime as well.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.160
Thank you.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:06.510
So, great.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:11.250
So, MPEG is a very important standard.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.140
We're going to be supporting
this in QuickTime 5.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.040
That file, you can put that on a DVD.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.610
It's the same media.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:19.610
It's the same media.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:27.000
There's another very important
standard which is just now coming

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.400
to the market called MPEG-4.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.620
Apple was involved,
has been involved with

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.600
MPEG-4 for a number of years.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:37.240
As you probably know,
the file format for MPEG-4 is

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.840
based upon QuickTime's file format.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.100
We think this is going to be an
incredibly important revolution

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.920
for the realm of streaming media.

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:48.020
Let's talk a little bit
about what MPEG-4 really is,

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.780
because there are some
significant misconceptions in

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.060
the marketplace about this.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:56.810
I think a lot of people see
MPEG-4 as being a better codec,

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.700
a better video codec.

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.860
And it is a better video codec,
there's no doubt about that.

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:05.100
But it's actually a complete architecture
for doing multimedia systems.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:10.560
It incorporates all the data storage
and transport that you'd expect.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.500
It incorporates intellectual
property management features.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.950
It provides a rich support for audio,
video and other media types.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.600
It provides an interactive,
interactivity framework

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:23.820
built around Java.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.840
It provides all the synchronization.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:30.060
And it provides the overall,
overarching compositional infrastructure

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.450
so that you can organize media
elements into a presentation.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.250
It's a very complex standard.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.940
There are a lot of people behind MPEG-4.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:45.840
Apple recently had a chance to join,
as a founding member,

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.240
the Internet Streaming Media Alliance.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.620
This is an industry organization
that we're putting together to

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:56.170
help promote the MPEG-4 standard,
but also to help to drive,

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.160
as soon as possible,
as quickly as possible,

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:03.810
interoperable implementations of
MPEG-4 so that you as a developer

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.120
don't have to go to a single vendor
for their implementation of MPEG-4.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.150
You can look at a whole
host of companies.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.800
And likewise, as a content publisher,
you'll have a wide variety of

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:19.280
choices for technology providers
as you publish to MPEG-4.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.920
We are looking for new members,
so if you're interested in MPEG-4,

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.860
I strongly encourage you to go take
a look at the website at isma.tv.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.440
It's a great organization.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.200
We're making tremendous progress
in the area of interoperability,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.440
and I think you'll like
what's happening there.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.030
Now, this is not just a
computer industry endeavor.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:43.330
Like I said,
standards aren't restricted in their use.

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:47.230
Standards can be applied anywhere
anybody thinks they make sense.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.290
And one of the most interesting uses
of MPEG-4 that's coming along is in the

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.540
area of mobile telephone technology.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.380
The next generation
telephones are called 3G,

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.620
and they're beginning to be
deployed around the world.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.410
The United States is
behind on this effort,

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.780
but we'll catch up.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:07.940
These next generation telephones
are really remarkable.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.320
They bring very high bandwidth
internet connections,

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.280
and they provide a much richer set of
functionality in the phone than you

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.030
might have ever been able to have before.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.210
There's a standards body associated
with this work called 3GPP,

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:23.400
Third Generation Partner Project,
and there's an industry forum

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.730
that goes along with this called
the Wireless Multimedia Forum.

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.220
A lot of big-name companies
from the industry are

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:32.790
participants in these endeavors:
the NTT Docomos, the Nokias,

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:34.410
big companies.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.640
They've chosen MPEG-4 as the basis
for their standard going forward.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:39.930
This is going to happen.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.710
You look at JPEG 2000,
it's the next generation

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.540
of JPEG and Motion JPEG.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:46.820
They're basing their work on this.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.850
They're basing their
file format on MPEG-4,

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.770
which by the way is a great thing,
because that means both the phone

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:57.440
world and the next generation
imaging world will be built on

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.340
an infrastructure that's very,
very similar to QuickTime.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.920
Very cool.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.240
So what's Apple up to?

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:05.140
Well, first of all, as I said,
we're going to put

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.440
MPEG-2 into the system.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.740
We're also going to build
MPEG-4 into QuickTime.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:13.240
MPEG-4 is going to be a first-class
citizen inside of QuickTime.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:16.050
Initially,
we're going to focus on the basic core

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:17.990
audio/video streaming capabilities.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:22.700
We want to make sure that we've got the
best audio and video codecs available.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.680
And we want to make sure
that the streaming transport

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.700
technology works fantastically.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.690
And again, as the industry is trying
to get off the ground,

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:35.260
we felt that it was most important
to go for sort of the broad

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.090
support of the basic functionality,
get that up,

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:42.620
prove to the industry the possibility of
interoperability in a realm where people,

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.500
frankly, have doubts.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.700
We're positive this is going to work and
we're going to focus on that part first.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.610
And you'll be able to do
pure MPEG-4 in QuickTime,

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.700
but of course, it is QuickTime.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.700
It's the ultimate in
integration technologies.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.940
You'll be able to combine MPEG-4
with other QuickTime media to create

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.520
presentations like we've seen with the
skins or other interactive capabilities.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:04.380
Very neat.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:08.340
We will announce availability of
shipping products later this year,

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.100
but stay tuned.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.900
It's going to be very exciting.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.620
Now I'd like to give you a brief
demo of our MPEG-4 technology.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:17.640
Jim, why don't you fire it up?

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:23.610
So this is a one megabit stream.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.800
Very high quality.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:36.960
Anybody who tells you that MPEG-4 is
not a good codec has a different agenda.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.610
So if you want to learn
more about MPEG-4,

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.370
believe it or not,
you can hear more about it in the

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.700
live streaming session later today.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.150
So, at this time,
I have been notified that the

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.540
team put together a little
public service announcement.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.930
They asked me to show this to you.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:29.980
is the director of the Web Publishing and
Marketing Department at the University of

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.970
with a disturbing disregard
for careful planning.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.910
But this industrious engineer
has discovered the fun and

00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.560
gratifying results that come with
strict adherence to standards.

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:11.730
Civil Discourse.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.500
Enjoy enriching presentations
guaranteed to thrill,

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.500
excite, and inspire.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:22.590
Regular delivery of exciting
reading material with

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:26.480
easy-to-remember standards names,
too.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
of standards.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:39.000
After all,
it was standards that brought us cheap,

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.520
reliable electricity.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:45.500
Oh, crap.

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.220
I can't work like this.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.460
Somebody call the governor.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.560
Get out of my way.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:07.990
Before we finish, just a couple of
thoughts to wrap up with.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.980
So, first of all,
I want you to walk away with the message,

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.000
Apple is embracing open standards.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:17.000
Everything we're doing at Apple is
about open standards this day.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
You heard a lot about it in Avi's talk.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.890
You've heard a lot about it today.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:21.950
Very, very important.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.100
I'd like to invite all of
you to come with us and help

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.000
make MPEG-4 a big success.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
QuickTime 5, it's available now.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.930
Go take a look.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.000
There's a lot of features in there.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.270
in there, love to have your help
making things better.

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:38.210
And of course, as always,
let us know what you think.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:42.500
We are building these technologies
so your products can thrive.

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.220
We don't do this for
our own gratification.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.880
This is an important area.

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:47.500
You are our customers.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.390
Tell us what you think.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:51.020
Tomorrow afternoon we'll
have a feedback form.

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.570
They're usually pretty fun.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.740
Come bring your rotten fruit, whatever.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.240
Let us know what you think.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.860
We've got a big event
coming up this fall.

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.700
We have had QuickTime live
conferences in the past.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.280
They've been very,
very successful and I have to

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.300
tell you they are a lot of fun.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:12.000
We have a special program this
year for developers and we'd

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.290
love to have you participate.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.300
It's at the Beverly Hills Hilton.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.300
It's a great venue and it's a lot of fun.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.300
You're going to meet a lot of
people from the QuickTime community.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.090
It's a great, great experience.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.300
Please come.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.560
If you have questions about
today's presentation or other

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:29.130
questions about QuickTime,
Jeff Lowe is your guy.

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:34.370
Jeff works in our developer
relations group and he will

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.300
answer all your questions.

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:39.300
If he can't, he will get you to the
right people who can.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.450
Thank you very much.

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.000
Appreciate your patience.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.480
Have a good conference.
