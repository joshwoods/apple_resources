WEBVTT

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.290
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
User Experience Technology Manager,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.690
John Galenzi.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.290
Well, good morning.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.700
Welcome to session 130.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.030
It's the last day at WWDC.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.110
It's been a great week, I think,
and certainly from the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.490
feedback we've gotten from you.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.000
This is a really exciting session.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.030
This is a session about usage
of Aqua icons and the design

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.550
philosophy behind them.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.220
And document icons and application
icons that communicate purpose

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.970
and function have always been
really important on the Macintosh.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.800
And that's particularly true on Mac OS X,
where the quality of

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.400
icons is extremely high.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.820
And as you'll see in this session,
the incredible attention

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150
to detail is unprecedented.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.550
And if you think about the good, better,
best Aqua adoption scenarios that

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.570
I outlined in session 111 on Wednesday,
quality icons was not one of the things

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.580
that you leave to the last minute.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.640
It wasn't one of the things
that you sort of leave,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.840
you know, if we're going to do a really
fantastic product on Mac OS X.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.810
Delivering a quality icon for your
application and for your documents

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.990
was down there in the good scenario.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.220
So for every application on the platform,
you should be delivering a great icon

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.890
for your application and documents.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.170
So to give you the scoop on this,
I'd like to introduce Imran Chaudhri,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.220
who's from the interface
design team at Apple.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.030
And Imran is really the guy who's driven
the vision at Apple around Mac OS X and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.190
the icon story that we have to tell.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.940
So this guy is incredibly creative.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.620
He's a fantastic designer
and really is an icon,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.600
get it, for the group.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.100
So come on up on stage, Imran.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.000
Look forward to hearing
what you have to say.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.760
Welcome.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.090
Thanks for coming out today.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.600
How are you guys doing?

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.550
Right?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.830
It's the last day of the session.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.510
Lunch is about 90 minutes away.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:19.100
Like John mentioned,
Aqua is fairly new in many aspects,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.200
especially with icons.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.390
Icons are a very important
part of your application.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.490
They are the first thing
your users will see,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.000
and also they sometimes serve as the
face of your application as well.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
With the many advancements to
Mac OS X has come a new icon direction.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.990
Many of you out here today are
already developing applications,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.910
and you might be familiar with some of
the new things that we've been doing.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.900
I know some of you are
just getting started.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.910
Hopefully all of you will find
this somewhat interesting.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.780
So I'm going to start talking about
our new icon direction in two terms.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.270
The first being philosophy
and the second being design.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:20.900
In Philosophy, we'll be looking at
Photo Illustrative Icons.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.900
These are

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.080
Icons that sort of present a realism.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.940
It's what we've adopted
as our house style.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.100
It's how we fashion
our icons within Aqua.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.200
In emotive icons,
we'll be looking at icons that express

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.100
Something beyond the symbol,
the basic symbol.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.700
Icons for the first time
can express feeling.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.910
In genres, we'll be looking at a
new concept for Mac OS X,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.960
and that is the ability to classify
your applications and organize them.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.170
It's a really,
really simple way of really identifying

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.700
what type of application something is.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.620
And in families and icon types,
we'll be looking at the different

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.620
types of standard icons and
the families that make them up.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.690
In designing icons,
concept and communication are two very,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.940
very important fundamental elements
in getting your message across.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.460
There are many different
types of materials that you

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.100
can use to render your icons.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.250
We'll be looking at different rendering
styles and how we use them and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.100
what's appropriate in the Aqua sense.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.100
Perspective and shadows have
a lot of meaning in Aqua.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.100
We'll look at what that means.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.250
Tools.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.380
Once you've got all your icons designed,
how do you get them into a format

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.090
the application can understand?

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.310
We'll be looking at that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.640
So this first image is an image of
the Aqua icon in its 128 by 128 glory.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.000
Where we started out from in Mac OS was
a 16 by 16 and a 32 by 32 pixel icon.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.500
In Mac OS X we introduced the 128 by 128
icon and this was done for two reasons.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.980
The first being the ability to show a
really lush preview in the final image.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.080
The second which is the more
interesting reason and that's to

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.990
be able to dynamically scale an
icon in the dock and in the finder.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:40.550
Today I'm happy to announce that we're
going to be shipping the 768 by 768 icon.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.340
You can buy this at the Apple Store now.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.000
Okay, that's a bit of a joke.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.910
We brought this up because we wanted
to examine this icon in great detail.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.700
This icon, which is the preview icon,
it's an icon for an application

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.490
that allows you to view images.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.490
This really embodies...

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.700
Every aspect an icon in Aqua can achieve.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.640
It's really what started it all for us.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:22.730
It's got 32-bit vivid color,
lines and curves are realized

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.500
through anti-aliasing.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.420
You can get brilliant curves this way.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.320
Shadows give a sense of depth
and translucency gives a sense of

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.710
realism to objects like the glass
in the loop in the corner there.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.920
The photo illustrative
style that we've got,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.500
as you see, is a combination of stylized
illustration and image.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.500
The intent is to

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.130
Deliver an object that
is somewhat believable.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.890
Unlike cartoon type objects
or icons of the past,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.400
photo-realism or photo-illustrative
as we tend to call it within the team,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.780
tends to communicate in a different way.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.010
It sort of lays down the foundation
of something that we call emotive.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.030
The emotive nature of this icon
can be described as... well,

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.080
I guess if you were to
just look at this thing,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.790
the pictures are arranged
like they would be on a table.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:31.790
They are like they're being used,
like the viewing... the viewing...

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.430
You've been using the loop to look at the
images and it really sets the scene of

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.590
someone who's actually using this thing.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.200
It communicates the activity
of looking at pictures.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.380
It's really, really effective.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.000
It's what makes this icon emotive.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.420
It's also what makes
this icon not emotive.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:01.670
This icon is a really,
really universally understood symbol.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.820
I'm sure many of you have seen it, well,
the men of you have at least seen it on

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:12.010
the bathrooms all across your travels.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.250
This icon is a really,
really basic symbol.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.000
By no means is it emotive.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.200
What I mean by that is that in the
context of it being on the bathroom door,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.850
it communicates men's bathroom.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.900
You take it out of its context,
it no longer communicates men's bathroom.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.180
Being flashed here on
the screen right now,

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.500
it's just saying "man."
That's all it's communicating.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.020
For it to be an Aqua icon,
it would have to be emotive.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:45.770
It would have to communicate that it's
a men's bathroom outside of its context,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.390
no matter where it would be.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.240
And so if you were to
re-render this thing,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.700
If you were to re-render this thing,
it might look something like this.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:09.860
Which... kind of looks
like me a little bit.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.200
I think the trajectory
is a little bit off,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:12.440
but...

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.810
But the head's close.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.900
The emotive nature of
this icon is so clear.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:29.040
You can totally tell it's a man
and it's someone relieving himself.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.430
It's the emotive nature of the icon.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.170
So that's what emotive icons really are.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.680
They're icons that tell a story.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.300
They're an extension of the basic,
basic symbol.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.800
And they're generally
universally understood.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.550
So, what we've been talking about so far,
the photo illustrative

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.540
quality of our icons,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.800
Emotive nature of the icons
are all building blocks to

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.900
something that we call genres.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:05.900
And genres, like I mentioned earlier on,
are a means to classify applications.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:12.010
This slide here represents a bunch of
applications that are somewhat mixed,

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.860
but looking at them you can tell that
there's some common themes on there.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.620
You can see some have vivid colors,
some are muted, some are angled,

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.900
some are straight.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.810
Um...

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.660
There's obviously two
different things going on.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.780
If you reshuffle them,
you'll see that immediately

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.680
there's a sense of order.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.800
The top row is one particular genre
and the second is another one.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.150
And you can tell this because the ones
in the top are obviously full of color.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.920
They have a consistent angle to them,
while the ones on the bottom

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.760
are muted and they're generally
straight on from a perspective.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.990
This sort of thing really makes
sense in the context of the doc,

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.210
where you can find a whole
bunch of applications,

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.500
as many of you have been finding out.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.070
Here we've got a slide that
has the icons shuffled.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.890
If we reorder them simply,
you'll see that it's really,

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.000
really clear to pick out two
types of things going on,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.230
two genres, as we like to call them.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.050
That's kind of like the dynamics,
the mechanics, rather,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.040
of how these things work,
how the genres work.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:33.100
How we employ them on X is
through something that we call

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.060
the user application and the
utility application genres.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.010
These are the two genres that
we have defined for Aqua.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.990
In the user application genre,
we build upon everything that

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.760
we've known about the Mac OS.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.120
So here is an image of the Mac OS,
original Mac OS application,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.870
not the original original,
for you purists out there,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:12.400
but something that pretty much is close
to the original application diamond.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.430
And to the left of it
is the new translation,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.320
the Aqua translation.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:23.000
The original Macintosh diamond was
a one-bit symbol that was really,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.700
really heavy in meaning,
yet light in feeling.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.560
And when the Mac made the transition
from black and white to color,

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.890
all that was simply done was
the icons were sort of injected

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:43.490
with color in a really dumb way,
like they would in a coloring book.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:50.970
The translation on the right hand
side is paying homage to the diamond.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.470
You can see a subtle reference,
a similarity to the diamond and the

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.090
tool being the pencil and the pen.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:03.460
The translation is now achieved
in more of a photo illustrative,

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.590
emotive, Aqua fashion.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.240
So, things that define the
user application genre,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.680
applications that define the user
application genre are apps that

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.990
tend to create or view media.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:27.180
And these are apps like TextEdit,
a word processor, or Preview,

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.230
an image viewer.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.570
And they're frequently used by your
novice user on a day-to-day basis,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.350
kind of like Mail.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.900
It's a typical app.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.280
So these applications are common
in the day to day productivity and

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.700
recreation of most of your users.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:54.780
Visually, the genre is defined by
a desk-like perspective.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.850
We'll talk about that in a second.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.380
They're designed to be approachable,
friendly, if you will,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.460
because they are typically
used by your novice user,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.960
and for that reason they're inviting.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.430
They're made inviting through
the use of vibrant color,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.760
and they communicate in a emotive
nature by the relationship

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.500
to the media and the tool.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.000
We'll look at the media and
the tool in detail in a moment,

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:27.070
but media can be anything from paper,
film, to CDs, et cetera, and the tool,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.780
which in this case, as you can see,
is the pen,

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:35.790
can be anything that supports or
makes that idea actually more solid.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.500
[Transcript missing]

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:49.410
So here's a real technical
drawing of the perspective.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.890
If you can imagine,

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:57.600
If there's an icon sitting on
the table and your viewpoint

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:03.710
is the camera at the top,
it might look something like this.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.580
So looking from the camera,
through the camera, you'll see this.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.730
And this is a crude drawing
of the text edit icon.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.220
If we were to replace and
swap in the icon in line,

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.930
it would look something like that.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:28.450
So that's an illustration that hopefully
gets across the point of the particular

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:28.460
perspective for the user application.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.920
Here's a view of all perspectives,
or the entire perspective.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.330
On the bottom again we've got the table,
the camera on the outside.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.500
Looking through the
camera on the top left,

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.710
you'll see the icon,
and on the top right,

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.830
it's fully rendered.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:57.230
So, some example applications of
the user application genre.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.230
The first is, um,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:10.420
TextEdit,
we've looked at that earlier on.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:10.420
But something really important
to note about it is that the

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:10.420
relationship between the media
and the tool really speaks to the

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:27.410
Activity of writing.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.410
You'll see that the
paper has been fashioned.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.410
It has a small letter
that's been written on.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.410
And the tool is sort
of a very special tool,

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.410
like a writing pen.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.410
And it really communicates.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.410
This is something you can write with.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:40.400
[Transcript missing]

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.780
Sketch, PDF viewer, the glasses reinforce
the action of reading.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:55.400
Preview and Stickies Stickies
does not have a tool.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.550
Sometimes the media plays
such an important role,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.400
it doesn't actually
need a supportive tool.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.920
Remember that the role of
the tool is supportive,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.400
it's to reinforce the action.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.390
In the case of Stickies,
it's such a well-known media,

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.400
it doesn't actually
need a supportive tool.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:21.350
In the case of Sherlock,
where we sort of push our own

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.900
The same thing is clear.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.710
There's a relationship between
the tool and the media.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.610
The media is a little bit pushed,
but that's because of the

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.180
well-established brand as Sherlock.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.170
A lot of you out there have really,
really strong brands and you

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:46.520
might be asking yourself,
how do I communicate a tool

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.360
when my brand is so strong?

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.320
What we've done is we've gone in
and looked at in a simple exercise,

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.070
an internal exercise,
what it would mean to use your

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.800
brand as the tool to reinforce
the concept of the media.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.960
Remember the user application is one
that creates media or views media.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.820
So the media plays a very,
very important role.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.920
These are some sample applications.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.580
By no means are they shipping apps.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.770
It's something that
we've done internally.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:24.100
But you can see the examples
on screen right now.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:24.100
Quicken,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.930
Palm Desktop and Sound Jam all
communicate what the app can do

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.820
by using the brand as the tool.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:46.460
So, the relationship of the media
and the tool is so tight,

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.570
and we thought we'd try and
play with it for a little bit.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.720
Two well-known icons that we've
got are the preview and mail icon.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.820
What would happen if we were to
mix up the media and the tool?

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.740
So if we were to take the ink stamp icon,
the mail icon,

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:11.770
the hello from Cupertino portion,
and the loop from preview,

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.570
we might have something
that looks like this.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.410
And what does that communicate?

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.080
It could be an application
that lets you send postcards,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.080
right?

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:28.520
But if we were to flip that around,
you might have an app that is for

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.580
stamp collectors or something.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:51.100
[Transcript missing]

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.340
A group of apps that process
the media that is normally

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.940
created by the user apps.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.530
This could be something
like Stuff Expander,

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.230
perhaps.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:08.090
Normally, these apps maintain and monitor
attributes of the system.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.760
Things like terminal
process view come to mind.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.590
They're used infrequently
by your novice user.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:22.140
And they work in the background,
they work in the back end.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.410
Because they're used
infrequently by the novice user,

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.740
they're probably technically complex.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:37.710
The visual cues that define these
apps are a shelf level perspective,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:42.010
different from that of the user app,
a limited use of color,

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:46.150
very muted use of color
to convey a serious tone.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.240
Let's take a look at some of those.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.440
Oops,
we'll look at the perspective first.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.590
The perspective is straight,
it's dead on,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.800
like we were looking at in the user apps
where we've got a desk level perspective.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.230
Here we just have a
straight on perspective.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.270
The image at the bottom

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.530
The camera is straight on, one to one.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.820
At the top left you'll see what it looks
like if you look through the camera.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.160
And then at the top right,
what it would look like if it

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.290
was rendered in that perspective.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.980
Here's a group of applications
that represent selections from

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.760
the utility application genre.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.840
You can see that they're all
straight for the most part.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.190
They have muted color.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.440
They're very serious.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.640
They communicate one simple idea.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.720
They're not layered objects
like the user applications where

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.120
you've got a tool and a media.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.870
It's just one simple idea.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.030
A note about the perspectives.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.640
For the most part,
things are straight on,

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.930
but as you'll see in
the case of the printer,

00:21:54.930 --> 00:22:01.120
the print center icon in the top
left for you and the bottom right,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.390
There's sort of a raised
frontal perspective,

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.310
so if I go back to...

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:14.200
[Transcript missing]

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.070
So you have a little bit more
of an interesting composition so

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:25.010
you can communicate that element
in a much more successful way.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.490
So up until this point we've been looking
at applications and what it means to

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.930
be emotive and photo illustrative.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.740
There are other aspects to icons on X.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:48.500
Those can be illustrated when we
start looking at the families.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.840
Families are, again,
they're a way to relate objects

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.590
to the application icon.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:01.970
It's actually an old concept,
but we've just sort of carried

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.970
it forward in Mac OS X.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.880
So here in this illustration you'll
see that the document icons at the

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.560
bottom relate to the preview icon.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.770
They're branded, if you will.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:15.650
They all communicate some
relationship to the preview icon.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.360
The next image, the iTunes family.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.740
You'll see that the MusicNote brand
is carried off into every aspect.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.770
There's a preferences icon at the bottom,
a playlist.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.600
and a sound document.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.590
But it all communicates iTunes.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.180
The relationship is clear.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.900
So, with the document icon,
like we did with the application icon,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.300
the application diamond,
we built upon what was already there.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.820
But this time, gone are the black lines,
gone are the restrictions

00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.900
of 45 and 90 degrees,
and in comes the subtleties

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.400
and the dimension of the
dog ear created by shadow.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.720
So, with the document icon,
like we did with the application icon,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.960
the application diamond,
we built upon what was already there.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.240
But this time, gone are the black lines,
gone are the restrictions

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.200
of 45 and 90 degrees,
and in comes the subtleties

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.090
and the dimension of the
dog ear created by shadow.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:26.110
So the relationship to the application
and the document is made through using

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.800
the media on the document itself.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.560
So you'll note the document icon
has the media from the preview,

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.790
but the tool has been removed.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.800
And that's to communicate a sense
of media that's been created.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.780
The tool again reinforces
the idea of the application,

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.480
not the media.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.780
So therefore,
it makes sense to just remove the tool.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.150
there.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:05.300
[Transcript missing]

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.100
We call that labeling.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:16.300
The image up here on screen communicates
a preview icon that is a kind of JPEG.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.280
So the difference that you'll find is,

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.260
This information,
the supplemental information,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.700
is integrated within the document.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.900
It's not appended to the
document as a placard.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.060
It's really just sort of
integrated in a clean manner,

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.790
and it doesn't clutter
up the document at all.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:45.980
In the case of the preferences icon,
we've got two elements that

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.170
describe the preference.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:54.800
On the right hand side,
we've got the branded element of iTunes.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.090
And on the left hand side,
we have the element that

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:02.340
describes it as a preference file.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.050
And this relationship is made
clear by this next slide.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.440
You'll see that the music notes
from the iTunes application icon

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.860
are branded on the right hand side,
while the light switch draws a

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.190
reference to the system preferences
icon on the left hand side.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.040
So branding is a very,
very important function of

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.150
a lot of the document icons.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:33.940
Looking at device icons in 10,
you note that the items on the

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.400
top row are of a pluggable nature.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.870
These are drives that are external
but are sort of hot pluggable drives,

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.200
things that can come and go,
physical drives, if you will.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.080
They're branded in a way that they
indicate the bus that they're mounted on.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.300
So we've got the FireWire drive,
the USB drive, and the SCSI drive.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:01.340
And drives below that are drives
that are internal in a sense that

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.120
you can't really see them or it's
not that important to see them.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:13.100
We've got with the blue globe iDisk,
next to it is the internal hard disk.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:21.400
[Transcript missing]

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.330
A note about the internal hard disk.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:31.090
Because what we're trying to do is
communicate physicality to these objects,

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.300
It really communicates
the internal hard disk.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.300
It really gives you a sense of
what it looks like from the inside.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.400
Although people may never see it,
it's probably a good idea to let

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.610
them know what it really looks like.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.570
With devices,
it's about the physical nature,

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.630
it is what it is,
versus what it should be or how it

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.700
feels with the application icons.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.240
Looking at removable media,
the focus shifts from the

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.750
device to the media itself.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:09.490
So you don't represent the
zip drive or the CD-ROM drive.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:15.000
It's really more of an intimate
relationship about the media itself.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.210
And here we've got a selection
of different types of media.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:30.240
Floppy disks, Zip disk, Jazz disk, DVD,
and another CD, it's a compact disk,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.580
and a PC card.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.100
You'll note though that the perspective
is different from that of the

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:43.490
"So hard, pluggable, or internal devices
in that it's straight.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:48.460
And that's because that's what your
relationship is with that type of media.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:53.710
You normally hold ZIP cartridges
in your hand and CDs in your hand.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:04.350
So, looking at toolbars,
this is an illustration

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.700
of the Finder toolbar.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.690
Something that's important to note
is that unlike the other icons that

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:16.420
we've been talking about this far,
especially the user applications,

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.170
which are layered objects upon objects,
items in the toolbar are

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.640
designed to be singular objects.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:28.770
So they communicate the
action with one icon,

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.560
one object.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.670
I'll get to the
contradiction in a minute.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.910
The computer communicates what it is.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.620
The home is a single object.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.990
The heart is a single
object for favorites.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:51.310
And the three objects that represent
applications are fashioned in a way

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.900
to really communicate a single object.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.040
So they really form an A.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.930
So it's read first as a single object,
then in closer detail, close examination,

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.400
you'll see that it's made up of three.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.200
And also,
there's a singular color usage for

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.800
all these objects on the toolbar.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.940
The computer is predominantly dark blue.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:25.800
[Transcript missing]

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:36.190
The perspective for items on the
toolbar are similar to that of items

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.150
in the utility application genre.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.930
They are dead on.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.710
And that can be illustrated in
another crude drawing like this.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.710
You'll see, again,
if we were to look through the

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.710
camera like we have been at the
bottom and look in the top left,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.710
you would see something like
the home in that perspective.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.710
And then on the top right,
what it would look like if it was

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.710
rendered out in that perspective.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:09.540
There's quite a bit of function
that comes to designing a toolbar.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:16.160
The singular item icon,
the attention to form,

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:24.850
and the singular color usage all plays
a great sort of functional purpose in

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:29.650
that it really makes it easy to pick out
objects on the toolbar at a quick scan.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.170
In this illustration,
you'll note that objects can be

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.890
broken down into really easily
understandable primitives.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.650
In the computer, we've just got a square.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:45.060
In the home, there's a triangle that
sits on top of a square.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.550
In favorites,
there's just a simple heart,

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.460
and the apps can be
communicated as a triangle.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.780
It really makes it easy to
quickly scan through and pick

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.990
something out based on its shape.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.600
And then that's reinforcement.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.960
It's reinforced by the
other elements as well.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.980
So, in practice,

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:14.800
[Transcript missing]

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:19.430
Elements on the toolbar within an
application should be consistent

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.360
and use common elements.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:29.890
We say that because using consistent
elements through color or repurposing

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:35.540
elements allows for each application
to develop a sense of character.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.510
In this case,
you'll see that the Mail toolbar

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:45.130
reinforces the language that was
started or originated by the application

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:52.160
icon by using stamps and the color of
blue is carried all across the toolbar.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.820
Objects on the right hand side
are a little bit different because

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.730
they have different functions,
yet they still relate

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.040
visually in terms of color.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:07.080
And a little stamp
element in the corner as

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:14.690
Materials are a really
new concept for Mac OS X.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.920
We've never looked at materials.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.770
What I mean by that is that
we've never really looked at

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:30.980
what it means to communicate,
say, the plasticity of the CD in iTunes

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.540
or any of the other details.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:39.530
We study a lot of real world objects
when we go off and we render our objects.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.940
And that's to fully
communicate the realism,

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:43.940
to

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:49.440
Reinforce the photo-illustrative
nature and to really

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.360
So there's really no question when you
come across these things what it is.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:03.470
If we were to look at some of them,
the middle icon is an icon for Sketch.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.690
You can see it has pieces of tape,
Scotch tape.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:14.290
You can almost see the 3M logo in there.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:14.290
The stickies

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:19.410
It really has a sense of the sticky
type of paper where there's glue on

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:24.250
the back and the way it's frayed up
on the top because it's only glued

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.670
on the top portion of the paper.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:32.130
The glass loop in preview and the metal
brim around the Sherlock magnifying

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.140
glass really gives it a sense of weight.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.010
You'll know how that
feels when you pick it up.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:46.700
And the battery monitor,
which we call the AquaCell inside.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.600
really communicates a sense of glass.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:59.970
A note about transparency-- we tend to
use transparency in a meaningful way.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.720
The only time we sort of
break away from that is in the

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.680
case of the battery monitor.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:09.150
And that's because it
communicates a function.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:14.190
The transparent battery allows you
to examine the level of your battery,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.740
your battery level, any time you want.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:22.200
So it's actually a functional
usage of transparency there.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.810
I don't know if you can see,
there's some bubbles that are inside

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:34.230
the battery right now and they sort of
communicate the batteries in charge mode,

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:38.230
which is reinforced by that glyph on top.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:44.610
So we study a lot of real world objects.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.520
It's a bit of a quick
walkthrough on certain things,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:56.540
but I guess the idea that we'd
like to get across is that

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.880
A lot of attention is paid to
items in the Aqua Icon family.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.740
We spend a lot of time on these things
and we imagine that many of you will.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:17.810
I've been told that a lot of you
have been asking about icons,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:23.410
application icons,
and have been told that some of them

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:23.980
need work and some of them are really,
really good.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.800
A lot of you out there are really
amazing at doing this sort of thing,

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.360
but some of you might need some help.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.950
We have on site here,
I don't know if they're still here,

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.630
but they have been all week,
Icon Factory,

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:43.260
which Apple has invited to come
and consult with developers.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:49.330
They do some amazing work.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:49.330
You can always sort of

00:36:49.700 --> 00:37:03.300
[Transcript missing]

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.200
So now that you've actually, say,
gone out and rendered these icons,

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:21.210
and you've got gorgeous resources,
how would you put them to use?

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:26.910
There's a number of ways that you
can get your icons into a format

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.130
that the application understands.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.420
They need to be in a format called ICNS.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:39.920
And there are a few tools that
convert resources into an ICNS format.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.230
A few tools that we've got
listed here are Icon Composer.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.800
That's our own tool.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.440
Icon Builder is a tool by Icon Factory.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:57.110
It works within Photoshop and only
works on Mac OS 9 at the moment,

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.640
or in Classic.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:05.240
Iconata is a new tool by a
company called Fabricata.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:12.380
Iconographer is by Emscape
Software also a fairly decent tool.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.540
So once you get these
icons into an ICNS format,

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:26.410
the thing to do is to
have them point to the

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.700
The application through a plist.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.540
You can do this in two forms.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.950
The first is an Info.plist,
and that's for packaged

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.700
apps through app packaging.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:41.140
And the second one is a plist resource,
and that's for single file applications.

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:44.420
You can get all the information
that you want on this sort of thing

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:46.320
through the developer website.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:52.710
I'm fairly certain there's quite a
bit of detail that's gone into on

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:56.700
any sort of documentation about that.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.520
That's what we've got for you today.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.190
There's a few extra resources
that you can use here.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:17.430
Thanks for listening.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.430
I think we're going to do a
bit of Q&A since the nature of

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.430
this stuff is probably things
that you've got questions with.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.800
Thank you.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.870
Let's just go through some more,
a couple of last slides about where to

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.350
get some more information on this stuff.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:32.810
And while that's happening,
if the members of the HI team

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.700
who are going to be on
stage for Q&A would come up.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.190
So you can get a lot more information
about this material actually that was

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:42.670
talked about in this session in the
new version of the interface guidelines

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.720
that are available for download today.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.800
Actually they went up
on Wednesday I believe.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.800
And the URL for that is there.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.490
As well as for general information about
creating a great citizen on Mac OS X,

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:58.080
a great citizen product on Mac OS X,
you can hit the general page which

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.800
is developer.available.com/ue.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.340
And there's connections to or
links to a Carbon and Cocoa related

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.760
technical documentation on how
to create great dialogues and

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.790
toolbars and this sort of stuff.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.800
There's a human interface design
discussion list which is listed up there.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.090
And actually there's a single
URL at the end here that you're

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.790
going to be able to visit and get
links to all this information.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.970
-

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.700
Just to go over the roadmap for those of
you who are watching this session on DVD,

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.930
clearly you're not doing that now,
but those, you know,

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.300
eventually you will be able to.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.260
There's some other sessions listed
here that relate to providing a

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:32.970
really great user experience on X,
and you should take a look

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.300
at this material there.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.280
And as well as these.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:43.780
And of course,
my contact information is on the slide.
