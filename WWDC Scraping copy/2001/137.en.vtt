WEBVTT

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.160
So, my name is Toni Childress.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.420
I'm Director of Tech Pubs at Apple.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.120
And what we're going to do today is
show you how you can effectively use

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480
the documentation to do your job,
okay,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.000
in the tasks that you do as developers.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.150
So, what we're going to do is we're
going to actually demo a range of

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.570
content and how you access that.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.430
We also have a surprise guest,
and I'm going to save the guest

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.130
until after the demo as added
incentive to get you guys to,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.960
you know,
recover from last night and stick

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.490
around and hear what he has to say.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
We're trying to provide
documentation every way you like it.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.100
And based on feedback that
we got from last year's WPBs,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.580
we know that you want to
have the material locally,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.090
you know, on your hard disk.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.990
You want to have it integrated
with your development environment.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.080
When you go to the web,
you want to have quick

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.080
and easy searching.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.980
You know, you want to have printed
books and so forth.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.600
So, we've been working really hard to
put in place procedures to author

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.660
and publish and deliver documentation
so that I think that we can deliver

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.740
it to you every way you like it.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.110
And where we can't,
we're partnering with third

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.820
parties to be able to do it.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.120
So, here's what we're going to do.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.020
We're going to go through a
couple of developer scenarios.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.330
And these are generally
applicable on how you would use

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.690
the documentation to do a task.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.940
So, we're going to go through
Cocoa app development,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.040
particularly using Project Builder
and sort of hardcore Carbon porting.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.140
and here's what you'll learn.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.900
Key document titles.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.520
These are titles that
everyone should have,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.390
you know, on your bookshelf or
your virtual bookshelf.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.330
The easiest way to access them,
using Project Builder to search

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.400
API reference in particular,
okay?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.020
And then our newest venue,
which we're going to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.400
hold off until later.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.240
So to do that,
I'm going to introduce a couple of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.880
our writing managers here at Apple,
and I hope that they have

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.400
recovered sufficiently.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.520
The first fellow,
he manages our Cocoa and

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.400
Developer Tools documentation.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
His name is Matt Rollefsson.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.770
And the second guy,
he manages our Carbon and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.350
Core Technologies,
and that's Tony Francis.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.400
So we're going to take you
through a few developer scenarios,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.400
some typical ways you
might access documentation.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.120
But before we do that,
I want to talk a little bit about

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.320
some key titles that we've come
out in the past little while.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.400
So how many of you
were at WWDC last year?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.360
see last year.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.530
Fair number.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.260
So you all received, at that point,
a preliminary version of

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.940
the system overview book.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.940
So what do you think of that book?

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.890
Helpful?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.080
Not helpful?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.360
Thumbs up, thumbs down, don't care?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.800
Who read it?

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.610
Okay, at least people read it.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.200
Hopefully you found it helpful.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.200
In the time since then,
we've come out with a revised version.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.840
It is no longer marked as preliminary.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.820
It is a good bit thicker
than it used to be.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.680
And it's got updated
information about localization,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.560
booting, integration,
and various other bits and pieces.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.820
So it's available from
Fatbrain in this form.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.800
You can also get it on our
website in HTML and PDF.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.340
And it's also available on your CD.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.440
So, Tony, I think you've got a book that
people might be interested in.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.240
Sure.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.440
One thing that every application
developer needs to consider,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.940
whether you're developing
a Cocoa application,

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.770
Java, or Carbon application,
is the user interface

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.150
for your application.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.900
So those of you with new applications,
or those of you porting your

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.370
existing classic Mac applications,
you should get this book.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.520
The brand new version of the
AquaHuman Interface Guidelines became

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.790
available in the middle of this week.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.170
We released an earlier version of this,
a preliminary draft, in January,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.970
and a bunch of you downloaded
100,000 copies of this book,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.200
so we know you're paying attention.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.150
This book has been updated now,
it's final,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.390
and it includes some additional
information about creating icons,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.600
and there's a new chapter
on user domain directories.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.920
There's more information about
localization and accessibility,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.070
and a lot of additional illustrations.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.590
You can find this book and download
it for free at developer.apple.com

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.030
or as you can see here,
it's also available in hard

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.260
copy version from fatbrain.com.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.250
And it'll be, they'll have it to you in
a couple of weeks or so,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.920
if you order it today.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.000
All right,
I've got one more title I think you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.390
guys might be somewhat interested in.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.460
So how many of you have code
running on Mac OS X right now?

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.660
How many of you wish that
that code would run faster?

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:28.680
So one thing that we've heard from folks
pretty consistently is that Mac OS X's

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.150
got a lot of great features to it.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.440
There's a lot of neat things there,
but performance is not as

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.520
good as it could be and not
as good as it needs to be.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.060
Now there's some things that
we can do to improve that,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.020
and we're working really hard on those.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.480
But there are also things that you
can do to make your applications

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.420
run as fast as possible on Mac OS.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.170
And to help you out with that,
we've got a book called

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.940
Inside Mac OS X Performance.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.730
Think we could come up with better
names for some of these books,

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.320
Toni?

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.460
We'll work on that too.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.740
Anyways, this is also available from
Fatbrain on the website,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.380
on the CD that you got
with your WWDC materials.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.080
So take a look at it.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.190
Use those tips.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.650
Make your code run great.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.440
And hopefully we will all have a
lot of really spiffy applications

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.800
for customers to go out and buy.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.770
Raleigh,
I have a question for the audience.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.300
How many of you made it
to the party last night?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.300
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.290
You guys should come back more often.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.300
That was great.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.990
Of you all, how many of you are creating
brand new Carbon applications?

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.060
A few of you, huh?

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.900
Then I hope you'll be sure to read the
new Learning Carbon book from O'Reilly.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.900
I hope you already got it at the
O'Reilly booth here at the conference,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.410
or you bought a copy from
Developer Depot while you were here.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.630
A number of Apple writers with a lot of
help from Apple engineering prepared this

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.200
book because many of you requested an
introductory Carbon Programming Guide.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.730
So there's System Overview,
there is AquaHuman Interface Guidelines,

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.040
the Performance Book, Learning Carbon.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.260
These are some of the books
that we've completed since

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.930
we all met last year at WWDC.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.950
Besides writing these high-level guides,
we at TechPubs also write

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.550
about the down and dirty,
low down, delta singing API documentation

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.030
that you need to get your job done.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.860
My writing group, in particular,
has been busy documenting

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.180
Carbon porting information.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.460
So how many of you out there are
actively carbonizing your code?

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:50.520
How many of you are planning to start
a Carbon project in the near future?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.200
Okay, great.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.440
Well, hopefully this will be of
particular interest to you.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.180
Raleigh and I will show you how
to get the information you need

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.600
to carbonize your application.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:06.140
First, let's take a look at what you got
on your Mac OS X Developer Tools CD.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.620
Here at the conference,
many of you have told us that you want

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.610
documentation local to your system.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.780
So we're supplying all of our
developer documentation as

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:21.300
part of the Developer Tools CD,
distributed with every copy of Mac OS X.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.490
By the way, Apple is planning to release
periodic updates of the

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.860
Mac OS X Developer Tools CD with updated
documentation to registered developers.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.030
The Developer Tools CD that you got
here at the conference is the first

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.540
installment of this update series.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.070
When you install the packages
on the Developer Tools CD,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.600
you get a bunch of great programming
tools and the Developer Help Center.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.510
The Developer Help Center provides
all of the documentation that

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.340
Apple supplies for Mac OS X development.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.940
The Developer Help Center is displayed
by the Help Viewer application.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.390
The Help Viewer is the
built-in Mac OS X facility

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.940
for displaying on-screen help.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.420
Let's take a look at the Carbon area.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.240
From the
Carbon Developer Documentation page,

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.110
you gain access to over 20,000
pages of documentation for nearly

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.700
100 Carbon-compatible managers.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.490
As you can see,
this page is organized by topic.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.700
We try to make all of our books
available in both PDF and HTML.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.670
Now, we don't have all of our
books in both formats yet,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.240
but we're getting there.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.730
Notice the Related Resources banner
at the top of the page.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.430
Under this topic,
there's a link to the Carbon Porting

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.000
Tools and information.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.350
Rolle, let's follow that link.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.360
Here you'll find the books, the tools,
and the TechNote articles

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.960
that are particularly valuable
to your porting efforts.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.980
Let's take a closer look at
the Carbon Porting Guide.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.670
Clicking the link for this
particular title opens a

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.660
PDF formatted version of the book.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.630
The Carbon Porting Guide is an essential
resource for those of you bringing

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.160
your Mac applications forward to X.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.080
This book offers a cookbook list
of changes to make your code

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.730
Carbon compliant and offers step-by-step
explanations of how to port a sample

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.410
application and offers an example of
how to adopt the new Carbon event model.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.770
The book is available on your developer
tool CD for you to read online,

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.850
but the main reason we make
documents available in PDF format

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.900
is so that you can print them.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.370
Many of you have told us that you
prefer to read hard copy documentation,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.190
at least part of the time.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.320
In addition to sending the
Carbon Porting Guide to your printer,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.100
you can also take it on disk to a
reproduction service like a Kinko's

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.170
and they'll print it for you.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.860
So many of you have asked us to
print the documentation for you.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.540
Well, we've made the selected
documents available as bound

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.400
books through fatbrain.com.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.880
The Carbon Reporting Guide is
one of these titles.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.540
You can link to order forms for this
and other important developer books,

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.260
like the Human Interface Guidelines
and Mac OS X Performance,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.590
directly from the Developer Help Center.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.540
Well, let's return to the
Help Viewer application,

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.500
where the Carbon Porting Tools and
Information page is displayed.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.200
Right here, you'll find a link to order
that book from Fat Brain.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.280
Click here,
and if you're connected to the internet,

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.190
you'll go directly to the
order page at fatbrain.com.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.910
Well,
as the Carbon Reporting Guide explains,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.310
an essential first step in carbonizing
an application is to analyze

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.300
it with the Carbon Dator tool.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.790
Returning to the Help Viewer,
we'll show you that we've provided a

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.370
link to Carbon Dator from this page.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.840
The tool itself is not
included on the CD.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.330
You use it in conjunction with the
Apple developer website because we want

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.740
to make sure that you always get the
latest and greatest porting information.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.000
When you use CarbonDater,
it will produce an

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.760
HTML Carbon compatibility
report for your application.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.350
This customized document lists
function calls and code usage from your

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.960
application that you may need to change,
along with suggestions about

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.570
how to make those changes.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.220
So here's an example of the first
page of the Carbon Compatibility

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.890
Report for Traffic Light.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:21.380
The Traffic Light application is used as
a porting example in the porting guide.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.940
Traffic Light,
some of you veterans may remember,

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.800
is an old, old sample application that
DTS wrote years and years ago.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:37.600
And the writer of the Carbon Porting
Guide used it as an example for porting.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.740
When the writer received
his Carbon Compatibility

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.360
Report for Traffic Light,
he saw that among other

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.200
unsupported functions,
the application was calling the old

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.220
WindowManager function "CloseWindow."
The Carbon Compatibility Report noted

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.140
that "CloseWindow" is not supported
because Carbon applications don't

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.760
allocate their own memory for Windows.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.770
The Report noted that
"DisposeWindow" should be used

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.800
in the place of "CloseWindow."

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.730
If you receive this information
in your application's

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.870
Carbon Compatibility Report,
you'll probably want to look

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.450
at the documentation for both
Close Window and Dispose Window.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.940
If you want to find
documentation for an API,

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.740
just ask for it.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.990
Last ask help viewer, O'Reilly,
for the documentation for closed window.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.100
The Help Viewer application
returns a list of search hits,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.380
ranked by relevancy.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.500
This search facility works for the rest
of the API documentation on your tool CD.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.490
Documentation for Cocoa, QuickTime,
Core Technologies, and so forth.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.300
Clicking the most relevant link
takes us to the formal reference

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.520
documentation for Close Window.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.760
You see that this function is
tagged as unsupported in Carbon.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.950
As you scroll to the bottom
of the page for Close Window,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.480
we see the Carbon porting notes.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.600
These notes also appear in the
compatibility report for Traffic Light.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.600
These notes include the
prescription to use Dispose Window.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.780
Let's take a look at the
documentation for Dispose Window.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.280
We can also look at the Dispose
Window documentation in Help Viewer.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.740
But currently,
Help Viewer doesn't support

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.840
multiple browser windows.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.330
It would be really nice to be
able to have a window open for

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.660
both Close Window and Dispose
Window to compare the two.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.620
So until Help Viewer
supports multiple windows,

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.080
most of us use a web browser
when we're intensively studying

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.820
API documentation like this.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.330
In case you're not already doing this,
O'Reilly and I will show you how.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.290
When you install the Developer Tools CD,
you get a Developer folder.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.670
Inside that folder is
a Documentation folder.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.290
There you'll find all the
developer documentation that's

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.340
in the Developer Help Center.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.240
Let's take a look at the Carbon folder.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.730
You'll see that it contains additional
folders and a single HTML file,

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.420
Carbon.html.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.390
Let's open this file.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.020
If this page looks remarkably similar
to the one displayed by Help Viewer,

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.050
that's because Internet Explorer is
using the very same HTML source

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.610
that Help Viewer uses.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.640
We can find a exposed window by
going to the function index under

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.520
the site information banner at the
top of the page and then navigating

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.680
down to the relevant documentation.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.300
But, forget it, Raleigh,
finding information this

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.480
way is kind of pokey.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.190
Browsers don't return the type
of rapid search results that

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.640
we saw help viewer return.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.460
Sherlock does, however.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.140
So let's quickly index a portion of the
Carbon developer documentation and use

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.750
Sherlock to find what we're looking for.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.310
Raleigh and I happen to know
that Close Window and Dispose

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.300
Window are window manager calls.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.490
So to expedite our indexing task,
right now we'll index just the

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.150
Human Interface Toolbox documentation
by dragging its folder onto Sherlock.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.920
And then Sherlock on 10
automatically indexes this for us.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.060
After clicking the
checkbox for this folder,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.620
we're ready to search its contents.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.420
"Rolley,
take a look at the close window."

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:06.230
We've tagged these guys so that the
API reference page automatically

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.580
becomes the most relevant hit for you.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.010
So it's always at the top of the list.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.110
Let's take a look at the
documentation for Dispose Window.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.860
We find that by dragging the result
onto the IE icon in the dock,

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.540
we get a separate window.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.080
And now we have two windows open,
so we can compare the two calls.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.510
We,
uh... You need a cinema display so you

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.810
can really see them next to each other.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.100
We see that the functions
are very similar.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.320
Both take the same window
reference as a parameter.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.400
And so we can see that substituting
disposeWindow for closeWindow

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.980
will be a piece of cake.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.600
So now you know that we have
tens of thousands of pages of

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.970
Carbon documentation available for you on
your system in an easily searchable form.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.100
And thousands of pages are
also there that you can print.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.080
And if you don't want to
print a document yourself,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.100
Fat Brain will gladly do it for you.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:16.240
However, many of you also want the
absolute latest documentation.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.070
Because while we're
periodically updating the CD,

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.500
many of you can't stand to use stale,
two-month-old documentation.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.490
Well, it's our mission to give you
documentation every way you want it.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.550
And if you want it timely,
you'll be glad to know that we

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.890
update our website just about daily.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.720
Let's look at the
Carbon Developer Documentation

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.570
website then.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.630
It's at developer.apple.com/techpub/well,
just go to developer.apple.com and

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.200
navigate your way down to our website.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.290
This page looks very similar
to the one that you saw in the

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.190
developer center on your disk.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.780
That's because we basically take a
snapshot of our website the day that

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.200
we submit our content to the CD.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.000
But by the next day,
we're already updating the website.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.220
Let's see what's new to this site.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.550
Have you seen this, Raleigh?

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.340
Raleigh's been sick all week.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:03.910
Not recently.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:04.860
He's been sick all week.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.900
He's been missing out
on a lot of the fun.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.890
He just looks hungover.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.890
He's not really hungover.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:16.080
So if you look at new and updated
documentation from the Carbon page,

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.080
you'll see that we see a list of
the documents that have been added

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.920
and revised so far this month.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.810
Let's jump over to the
Mac OS X Developer Doc home page.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:37.850
and we'll look at the new
Core Technologies page.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.130
We just added this in
the middle of the week.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:46.810
From this page you'll find links
to some Quartz 2D documentation.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:55.180
In particular we have a brand
new document that's really nice.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:55.180
It's called Drawing with Quartz 2D.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.200
You'll also find documentation here,
a bunch of printing documentation.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:07.990
And we'll also be adding some
core audio and image capture

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.830
documentation here soon.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.700
So come back periodically
and check out our site.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.830
Better yet,
become a registered Apple developer

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.120
and we'll tell you what's new.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.810
You'll receive a notification of new
and updated documentation automatically

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.660
through a weekly email newsletter.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.510
If you're not a registered developer,
go to the ADC booth here in

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.440
the Internet Cafe and join.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.640
There's always the free online
program that will get you this

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.020
email newsletter to let you
know what documentation is new.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.060
And, hey, it's free.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.750
You might as well join, huh?

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.270
I hope this has given those of
you starting your Carbon porting

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.960
efforts some help on where and how
to find the documentation you need.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.010
Plus, consider those of you interested
in Cocoa documentation.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.440
Rolle manages that effort,
so now he'll guide you through a

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.670
few more of our documentation access
features with your needs in mind.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.890
Thanks, Toni.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:04.380
So one of the things that we didn't
go over that you might find useful,

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.520
especially when accessing the website,
is that we've got-- Apple search, right?

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.200
We've got Sherlock plugin.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.420
We've got plugins that you can download
that will allow you to do custom

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.780
Sherlock searches of the website,
you know,

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.850
getting relevant hits for the specific
area that you're interested in.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.730
So the search functionality
is available on the website,

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.190
but the default just
searches all of the area.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.350
You can download these Sherlock plugins,
which are--we've got links scattered

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.680
at strategic areas on our site.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.240
And you can use those to search just
in Carbon or just in Cocoa or just

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.370
in QuickTime or whatever area of the
documentation you're most interested in.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.970
Okay.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:55.300
How many of you are working
on a Cocoa application?

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.900
Okay, a few of you.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.140
How many of you are just learning Cocoa?

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.870
whole bunch.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.540
So, in order to help you sort
of get your feet wet,

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.200
I imagine you have already seen
this book and picked a copy up.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.760
We wrote this book to try and give
people a good start and introduction

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.010
to all of the different parts of Cocoa.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.470
A nice tutorial,
really hands on introduction

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.950
of how do I use this stuff?

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.620
How do I get my head around it?

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.450
So, we hope that you find that extremely
useful as you're coming up to speed

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.830
on Cocoa and then you'll start diving
down into some more of the specific

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.700
reference material that we've got.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.040
So, Toni,
let's take a look at Project Builder

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.470
and see what Project Builder looks like.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.940
So Project Builder is the integrated
development environment that's

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.960
provided by Apple for your use.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.290
And as such,
it's pretty much the center of

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.490
your universe as you're developing.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:06.260
Because we have documentation on the
hard drive that ships with Mac OS X,

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.440
and because we write the IDE,
we can take advantage of

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.040
some integrations between the
environment you're using to

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.080
develop and the documentation.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.580
So if we just look in Project Builder,
it's got a help menu.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:24.620
And it has links not only to online
help about Project Builder itself,

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:29.280
but also to the different technology
areas that we might be interested in.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.050
So let's take a look first at Cocoa Help.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.960
So when you click on Cocoa Help,
Project Builder brings up Help Viewer,

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.500
brings us to the
Cocoa Documentation home page.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.470
You'll see that the Cocoa home
page is designed very much like

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.120
the Carbon home page and all of
the other home pages that we have.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.580
This is not an accident.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.390
We want to make it as easy as
possible for you to get oriented to

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.250
the pages and understand where you
are so you can access things quickly.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.880
We've got site information,
getting started, related resources,

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.240
and then reference documentation,
programming topics, what have you.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:13.160
So, down in the programming topics area,
we have conceptual material

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:18.300
that is related to the
material in the API reference.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.620
Now you may find as you're
looking through this documentation

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.290
that it is not complete yet.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.300
We've been working on it.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.300
We will continue to flesh it out and look
for updates over the next several months

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.280
that will be more and more complete.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.300
For now, your best bet when
learning specific things,

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.480
when trying to get a general
idea of what's going on,

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.250
is to check out this book for specifics.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.760
You can come here.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.150
You can also check out the
reference pages themselves,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.300
the actual spec sheets.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.300
Okay.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.330
No.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:59.080
So, documentation is great.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.900
Tutorial information
helps you get up to speed.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.650
Documentation gives you
an idea of what you need.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.140
But sometimes you've got a specific
problem and the documentation

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.890
doesn't directly tell you how
to address that specific problem.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.900
It tells you how to do lots and lots
of different things with a class,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.250
but it doesn't necessarily show
you exactly what do I need to

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.870
do in order to say animate a
progress bar and just display it.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.710
So, for things like this,
source code can often

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:29.600
be your best friend.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:35.490
And examples are a really good way of
seeing how to do very specific things.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.650
and the rest of the
Mac OS X development team.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.400
The Mac OS X Documentation
is the underlying foundation,

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.010
if you will, portion of Cocoa,
where you have things like strings

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.930
and Unicode support and collections,
arrays, dictionaries, what have you.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.580
So, if you're interested in how that
stuff works and seeing some examples,

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.420
Foundation's the place to look.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.930
If you're interested in
some of the GUI widgets,

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.140
AppKit is the place that has examples.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.020
There are a whole bunch of
really interesting examples,

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.940
some of them very, very complete.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.490
Sketch, for example, is a demonstration.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.200
Drawing application.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.680
And it's got a whole lot
of information in it.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.570
For now, let's take a look at a
somewhat more simple one,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:43.620
which is Rulers.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.540
We go and double click on rulers.pbproj.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.640
It goes ahead and opens
up in Project Builder.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.750
And from here you can use
Project Builder's normal

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:58.630
browsing abilities to take a
look through the source code.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:04.510
So another integration between
Project Builder and our documentation

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.000
is API reference lookup.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.060
So Project Builder knows where the
documentation is located and also what

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.640
form it takes in your source code.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.560
So if you go ahead and
index your project,

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.440
Project Builder understands
is this a class?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.680
Is this a method?

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.920
What is this particular symbol?

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.380
And it can then go and ask
Help Viewer to display the

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.130
documentation for that symbol,
if it's available.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.670
So if we scroll down here,
we see there's this interesting line,

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.320
mainBundle equals NSBundle mainBundle.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.600
So first of all,
what exactly is NSBundle?

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.210
Let's see if there's
documentation on that.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.540
So you go to the Find menu,
and you see there's this nice menu item

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.010
that said Find Selected Definition.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.580
Go ahead and select that.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.410
It does a find for us,
finds a whole bunch of different results,

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:03.790
showing one of the interesting
features of Objective-C,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.270
which is categories,
where there are categories that

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:11.200
come from different source files
that actually extend NSBundle.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.600
But for now,
let's look at the main NSBundle.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.090
So we see we've got the header file,
NSBundle.h, and right next to it,

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.700
there's this little book icon.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.380
That book icon indicates that
Project Builder knows that there's some

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.270
help documentation available for this.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.550
So if we click on that icon,
it brings up the NSBundle reference

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.950
sheet in Help Viewer.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.230
And you can go through and read
all the different documentation

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.700
that's available there.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.390
OK, let's go back to Project Builder.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.870
Now let's say that I'm interested
in one specific method on NSBundle.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.880
So here we're calling
NSBundle main bundle.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.400
I want to know what does that do.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.660
Again, I go, say,
find selected definition.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:59.110
Comes back, tells me-- actually,
with a couple of hits,

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.350
there's a function,
CFBundle get main bundle,

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.930
which is sort of interesting.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:08.280
But for now, let's take a look at the
NSBundle actual method.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.660
So again, we click on the book icon.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.380
It scrolls us directly to that method.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.900
Alright.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.860
So, that's a quick overview of
some of the ways that you

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.200
can access our documentation.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.400
We've got reference material,
we've got conceptual material,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.970
we have tutorials,
and we've got searching in Help Viewer,

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:38.080
searching in Project Builder, API Lookup,
documentation available

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.250
on your local disk,
on the website,

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:48.000
in hard copy from Frat Brain,
and also now in hard copy from O'Reilly.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.690
So, hopefully we're getting
the documentation to you,

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:56.110
whichever way you want it,
and it'll help you get your job done.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.580
Thanks very much, Toni.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.100
Great.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.910
So, to summarize,
you've got to get a hold

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.260
of these key titles,
okay?

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.110
If you're new to the 10 platform,
get oriented with the

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.780
system overview book.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:25.580
It's been updated.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.750
Get the Aqua Hig.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.620
You know, get one of the new tutorials.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.000
You know, if you're into Carbon porting,
I hope you started with

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.480
a Carbon porting guide.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.140
You know, no matter what you're doing,
you know,

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.350
where you are in your development cycle,
get the new performance book

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.580
because that's really cool.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.460
You know, on the developer CD that
we shipped in March,

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.810
there was over 200
megabytes of material on it.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.980
There's more than that on the CD that
you got here at the conference,

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.600
and there's even more on the website.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.840
As you can see,
we're putting stuff up sort of weekly.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.380
So, there's lots of material
out there for you.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.500
You can access a lot of different ways.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.230
Don't forget searching
from Project Builder.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.320
And lastly, I want to talk a little
bit about O'Reilly,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.480
and you can tell what's coming here.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.080
So... I hope you're as pleased as I am.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.920
And as Apple is, and as we all are,
that O'Reilly has decided to move

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.580
into the Macintosh developer market.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.410
You know, O'Reilly is probably
the most well-respected

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.700
publisher of developer books.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.080
In the universe, you know.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:35.130
They're incredibly strong in
open source and Java and Unix,

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.410
where there's a lot of
interest around Mac OS X.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.410
So it's my very great pleasure
to introduce Troy Mott.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.520
He's the executive editor
at O'Reilly and Associates,

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.220
and he's going to talk a little
bit more about what it means

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.940
to you guys to have them,
you know,

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.310
join the Mac developer community
in the way of resources for you

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.780
in the future and a little bit
about our relationship with them.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.290
Okay, Troy.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.610
Good morning.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.600
My name is Troy Mott.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.940
I'm an executive editor at
O'Reilly and Associates.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.840
I'm here this morning to tell you
a little bit about who we are,

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.800
what we do,
why we're interested in Mac OS X,

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.400
and a little bit of how we edit books,
and also about this O'Reilly-Apple

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.030
agreement and some of the
products we're creating.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.000
As many of you may know,
O'Reilly and Associates

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.540
is where information,
we deliver information technology,

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.970
and we communicate expert
knowledge through books,

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.120
conferences, and websites.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.110
Our books, of course,
most of them have the

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.970
animals on the cover,
and we've covered

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:08.190
technologies such as Unix,
Linux, Java, Perl, and many others.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.640
We also have a conferences division,
and a good example of that is the

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.180
open source convention that we're
hosting in July of this year.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:23.300
For our websites, there's O'Reilly.com,
and we also have an O'Reilly Network,

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.260
where we have a Mac Dev Center,
which is a collection of all sorts of

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.880
information and articles on Mac OS X,
which you can find at

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.220
O'ReillyNet.com slash Mac.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.860
We even have a new product called Safari,
which is a subscription-based

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.220
service for online O'Reilly books.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:46.540
For more information on any of this,
you can go to the O'Reilly

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.200
booth over in the Internet Cafe,
if you haven't been there already.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:58.040
So first of all,
what do we find of interest with OS X?

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.340
Of course, the coupling of the stability
of Unix with the beauty of

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.360
Aqua is very compelling.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:10.760
We're also very interested in the open
source nature of the Darwin kernel.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.470
O'Reilly and Associates has
published a lot of documentation

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.870
to the open source community,
and Tim O'Reilly is very involved

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.290
in the different communities.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:25.630
So our goal now is to deliver
the same high level of content

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.590
to Mac OS X developers.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.200
You know,
the way we work editorially at O'Reilly

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.670
is a little bit unique for the industry.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:39.770
Our editors are involved in all stages
of the process from acquisitions

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.320
to the developing of content,
working closely with an

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.450
author or group of authors.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.120
Even involved in some levels of the book
going through production and marketing.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.170
We work with product marketing managers.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.580
So, what is the O'Reilly-Apple
Agreement all about?

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:03.430
Basically, we're delivering a new series
of Mac OS X developer books.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:08.510
These books are reviewed by
Apple engineers and also recommended

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:12.070
by Apple Developer Connection.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.830
So any books in this
series have the ADC logo,

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.500
which if you've seen,
I'm sure you've seen the

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.740
Cocoa or Carbon books,
you see the logo on the front, the spine,

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.120
and back cover.

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:28.180
I actually edited these two
books and it was a pleasure

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.900
for me working with Apple who
actually authored these two books.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.920
The next book coming up in this
series is titled Apple Script in a

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.900
Nutshell by Bruce Perry and that will
be released in a couple of weeks.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.230
I'm excited also about that title.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.890
I look forward to fielding
any questions or hearing any

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:54.600
comments in the Q&A session,
part of the session, you know, following.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.650
And thank you very much for your time.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.280
So, these are the two books
that are available now.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.200
There's new books coming up.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.850
This is going to be a great
resource for you guys,

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.700
you know, out there.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.270
You're going to be able to go into
a bookstore now and not have to

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.970
look for a MacBook on the shelf,
right?

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:15.400
You know?

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.850
We're now going to have MacBooks
on the shelf in the bookstore

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.400
along with all the Windows stuff.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:23.930
So I hope you got one of your books here.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:26.990
And this is going to be a
great thing for you guys.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.940
Okay,
a little bit about staying up to date,

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.120
and Raleigh and Toni talked about this.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.920
We're working like crazy on getting this
content for the new operating system,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.790
but there's still stuff to do.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.440
So check the ADC website for
new and updated documentation.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.200
We put it up there regularly.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.240
It's a hassle to do that,
so like Toni says, join the free ADC news

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.310
subscription thing,
because that's where we list the

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:54.260
titles that came out that week,
and it's an easy way to know what's new.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.540
And just join the
selector premier programs.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.910
You know,
get yourself in a position so you

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:04.260
can be eligible for seating programs,
where we do pre-release documentation

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.900
that gets out to you guys earlier,
you know,

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.890
than the final stuff that gets published.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.360
So that's a good way, too.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:15.540
So we're working on more content,
fixing some bugs in the material,

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.520
and working to improve the local access.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.650
And I'd like to say a
little bit about that.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.220
Toni and Raleigh demoed
the Apple Help Center,

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:29.350
which is... our viewing mechanism on 10
now for viewing developer documentation.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.570
It's not yet feature complete
for features that developers

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:36.160
would want to use it,
you know.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.960
So if you caught any of the
Project Builder sessions,

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.760
you know that we're working on
integrating documentation viewing more

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.380
closely into Project Builder itself.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.870
And, in fact, we have a demo running
downstairs in the lab.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.430
If you haven't checked it out,
you should go down there

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.870
and give us some feedback,
where you can see some of the features

00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:01.480
that we're looking at to provide,
you know, as far as viewing features,

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:06.150
like the ability to bring up to Windows,
a fine panel that lets you

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.760
search down through a page,
copy and paste, you know,

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.200
man pages in HTML,
that kind of stuff that's really

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:15.680
tailored to a developer audience.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.630
So if you haven't checked out
that demo and given us some

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.820
feedback on those features,
please do.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.820
Okay, that's the lab,
one way to give us feedback.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.440
Then we also have a feedback
link on the website,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.090
which is where we get a lot
of comments from you folks,

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.640
so please keep them coming.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.330
And then a roadmap.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:39.270
There's a really interesting session
coming up right after this one on

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:44.890
the Darwin Documentation Project,
contributing documentation to the

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:49.620
Darwin Project using the HedrDoc
tool for creating documentation.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:56.880
And I think this is actually of probably
broader interest than you might think.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.240
I really recommend that you go to it.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.040
For example,
if you're doing driver development

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.320
or I/O Kit or something like that,
I think you're going to find that the

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:10.440
Darwin site is a good resource for
you for technical materials as well.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.040
So, you know, you might think about
catching this session.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.860
It's coming right up.
