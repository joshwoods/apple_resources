[ Music ]

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:30.526
[ Applause ]

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:31.996
>> Thank you all for coming.

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:33.876
And welcome to the session,

00:00:34.146 --> 00:00:36.186
Advances in Rresearch and Care

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:36.866
Frameworks.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:38.936
My name is Srinath and I'm a

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:39.706
software engineer.

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:41.916
Now, if you're familiar with our

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.066
WW talks in the past, you might

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.146
remember that our sessions have

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.016
focused primarily on our two

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.776
open source health frameworks.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.686
ResearchKit and CareKit.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.916
This year, although we'll still

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:56.626
be talking a lot about these

00:00:56.626 --> 00:00:58.266
frameworks, we'll also be

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.206
covering some new APIs and

00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:01.986
features that we've been working

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:03.936
on in the larger health space.

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:05.826
But for those of you who are

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:06.896
somewhat new to these

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:09.086
frameworks, I highly recommend

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:11.016
checking out our two sessions

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:11.866
from last year.

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:14.866
What's new in CareKit and

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.636
ResearchKit was hosted by Sam

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:17.116
Mravca.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.056
Where she gives a really good

00:01:19.056 --> 00:01:21.526
overview of both ResearchKit and

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:21.996
CareKit.

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:24.446
The other session, Connecting

00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:26.446
CareKit to the Cloud was by

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.136
Kelsey Dedoshka, where we

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:30.236
introduced a new CareKit bridge

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:32.546
API that allows developers to

00:01:32.546 --> 00:01:34.826
sync care plans between patients

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:37.066
and providers using any HIPAA

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.236
compliant backend.

00:01:38.646 --> 00:01:40.926
And on that note, I'm really

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:42.806
excited to show you all some of

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:44.426
the amazing work that's been

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:46.266
happening at Penn Medicine.

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:48.796
The Penn Life Gained Appl

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:51.366
utilizes CareKit and the CareKit

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.786
bridge API to help patients

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:55.316
through both pre and

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.576
post-bariatric surgery at Penn

00:01:57.576 --> 00:01:58.146
Medicine.

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.126
The app leverages care plans,

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:03.156
healthcare data and other

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.836
interactive components to help

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:07.806
patients go through their weight

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:08.526
loss journey.

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:11.906
Data is constantly being synced

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:14.176
between the iOS apps used by the

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:16.686
patients, and the iPad apps used

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:18.566
by care providers in order to

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.626
closely monitor and interact

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:22.136
with their patients in real

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:22.606
time.

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:25.086
The team has received extremely

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:26.656
positive feedback from both

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.876
patients as well as clinicians

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:30.986
with regards to the impact that

00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:32.776
these apps have had on their

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:33.986
bariatric program.

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:36.326
And now that we have touched

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:37.676
upon where we have come since

00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:39.866
last year, I would like to take

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:42.376
a quick step-out to all of our

00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:43.626
health frameworks as a whole.

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.086
The creation of these frameworks

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.766
stems from our overarching

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.526
desire to improve the world of

00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:51.196
health, through technology.

00:02:51.636 --> 00:02:53.506
And in that process, we really

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.526
want to empower our users and

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:57.496
provide more tools to developers

00:02:57.566 --> 00:02:59.356
and researchers, so at the end

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:01.806
of the day, you and all of us

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:04.216
can help improve and advance two

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.766
core areas of interest, research

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:07.656
and care.

00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:10.716
This year, I'm really excited to

00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:12.566
be talking to you about some of

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:13.906
these topics which we care so

00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:16.016
deeply about in a variety of

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:16.346
ways.

00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:18.376
Starting with the framework

00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:20.016
focus, where I'll talk to you

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:21.576
about updates we have made to

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:22.956
our ResearchKit framework.

00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:25.116
From there, we'll move on to a

00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:27.106
more condition focused approach,

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.386
specifically around movement

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:30.956
disorders like Parkinson's,

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:33.016
where Gabriel will come on stage

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:34.556
and talk to you about this

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:35.486
brand-new API.

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:38.286
And finally, we'll bring it all

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:39.896
together with a demo where we

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:41.746
will showcase how you can

00:03:41.746 --> 00:03:43.476
utilize these new APIs and

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:45.476
features directly in code.

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:48.466
Now let's get started with

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:49.086
ResearchKit.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.896
Over the past year, we have been

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:53.856
putting in a lot of effort to

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:55.546
improve out openness and

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:57.196
engagement with our community.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.386
Some updates to our ResearchKit

00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:02.956
UI and modules, as well as some

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:05.356
new additions to our existing

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.046
library of Active Tasks.

00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:09.456
Now, let's get started with

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:10.656
community updates.

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:12.966
I want to cover two main topics,

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:15.106
repository privileges and

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:16.156
schedule updates.

00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:18.526
Over the past few months, we

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:20.505
have been expanding our access

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.026
rights and providing write

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:23.586
privileges to members of our

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:24.216
community.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.756
In fact, we've chosen five

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:28.756
all-star contributors and given

00:04:28.756 --> 00:04:30.146
them direct access to the

00:04:30.146 --> 00:04:32.206
ResearchKit repository that also

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:34.326
allows them to merge MPRs.

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:36.416
A huge thank you and

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:38.466
congratulations to Erin,

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:41.286
Fernando, Nino, Ricardo, and

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:41.936
Shannon.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.286
Next, I want to touch on our

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.436
schedule updates.

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:48.726
Historically, we've been pushing

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:51.126
to master and stable at the same

00:04:51.126 --> 00:04:51.566
time.

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:53.696
Now, we realize that this

00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:55.116
inhibits the ability for

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:56.976
developers, like you, to

00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.656
leverage some of our in-house

00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:00.376
features like localization,

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:03.386
accessibility, and QA, which is

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.456
why this year we will be pushing

00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:07.366
to stable two to three months

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:09.026
after our push to master.

00:05:09.846 --> 00:05:11.436
We hope that you can use this

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.486
time to check out our latest

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.926
updates, provide feedback and

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:16.926
submit PRs.

00:05:17.556 --> 00:05:18.976
And the changes that you make,

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.906
will make it soon into our

00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:24.126
stable, tagged release branch as

00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:25.656
opposed to you having to wait

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:27.646
for an entire release cycle.

00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:30.126
And now that we have touched

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:31.806
upon community updates, I would

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.886
like to dive a little bit deeper

00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:35.436
and talk about updates we have

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:36.896
made to the ResearchKit

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:38.846
framework itself, starting with

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:40.436
UI updates.

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:43.986
Now, for comparison, this is

00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:45.796
what our Mini Form step looks

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:48.716
like in ResearchKit 1.5, as

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.596
taken from our ORK test app.

00:05:51.806 --> 00:05:53.376
And here is the same Mini Form

00:05:53.376 --> 00:05:56.176
step as it will be available in

00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:57.386
ResearchKit 2.0.

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:00.636
As you can see, we have worked

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:03.486
very hard to update the overall

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:05.316
look and feel of ResearchKit UI

00:06:05.316 --> 00:06:07.766
to closely resemble the latest

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:09.036
iOS style guidelines.

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:11.006
Let's take a closer look.

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:15.086
We've moved the progress label

00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:15.916
from the center of the

00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:17.396
navigation bar to the right side

00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:18.646
and applied some styling.

00:06:19.226 --> 00:06:21.266
This allows us to leverage the

00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:23.506
large titles feature in nav bars

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.516
and apply it to all of our step

00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:26.036
titles.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:28.446
Now, to keep the consistent

00:06:28.446 --> 00:06:30.426
styling, we are also adding a

00:06:30.426 --> 00:06:32.506
new card view in order to

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:34.076
improve the overall user

00:06:34.076 --> 00:06:35.916
experience for those who are

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:37.816
answering multiple questions and

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:39.896
surveys, as it now provides a

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:41.366
clear break in action that

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:42.796
you're requested to perform.

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:46.316
Now, this card view is applied

00:06:46.316 --> 00:06:48.866
by default to all our steps and

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:49.336
forms.

00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:50.946
But we are also exposing a

00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:52.676
Boolean property that you can

00:06:52.676 --> 00:06:53.996
set to falls for backwards

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:54.886
compatibility.

00:06:55.646 --> 00:06:57.646
And finally, we are also adding

00:06:57.696 --> 00:06:59.706
a footer container view, to

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:01.396
improve the navigation flow.

00:07:01.846 --> 00:07:03.676
The cancel button is now part of

00:07:03.676 --> 00:07:05.376
the footer view, which is always

00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:06.466
sticky to the bottom.

00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:08.476
What this means is that your

00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:10.406
users will no longer have to

00:07:10.406 --> 00:07:12.036
scroll all the way to the bottom

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:14.146
of the step, in order to access

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:15.646
forward navigation options.

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.796
And having all these controls in

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:19.996
one place makes it much more

00:07:19.996 --> 00:07:20.586
intuitive.

00:07:21.736 --> 00:07:23.966
And now, moving on, one of the

00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:26.016
most commonly used modules in

00:07:26.016 --> 00:07:28.476
ResearchKit is informed consent,

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:30.856
which is used to generate a PDF

00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:33.016
and attach a user signature to

00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:33.206
it.

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:36.056
Now, we realized how important

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:37.816
it is to be able to survey some

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:39.526
of these confidential documents

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:41.836
to your users within the context

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:42.356
of your app.

00:07:42.786 --> 00:07:44.806
Which is why we are adding a new

00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:46.826
ORK PDF viewer step.

00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:49.336
This is built on top of the PDF

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:51.226
Kit framework that came to iOS

00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:51.946
just last year.

00:07:51.946 --> 00:07:54.526
Let's take a closer look at some

00:07:54.526 --> 00:07:56.366
of the functionalities that this

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:57.126
step provides.

00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:01.226
Quick navigation to easily

00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:02.326
switch between pages.

00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:05.876
Real-time annotations to mark up

00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:07.226
the document if necessary.

00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:09.516
Search functionality for your

00:08:09.516 --> 00:08:11.026
users to query the entire

00:08:11.026 --> 00:08:12.356
document for keywords or

00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:12.996
phrases.

00:08:13.446 --> 00:08:15.416
And the ability to share this

00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:17.466
PDF or save it using the

00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:19.106
standard iOS share sheet.

00:08:19.726 --> 00:08:21.866
And what's even better is how

00:08:21.866 --> 00:08:23.506
easy it is to incorporate this

00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:24.126
in your app.

00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:27.166
You create an instance of ORK

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:29.266
PDF viewer step with a unique

00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:31.296
identifier, and simply provide

00:08:31.296 --> 00:08:32.846
us the file path to the PDF

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.006
document that you wish to

00:08:34.006 --> 00:08:34.566
display.

00:08:35.976 --> 00:08:37.996
And now, I'd actually like to

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:40.395
switch gears and talk about one

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.035
of the core components of

00:08:42.035 --> 00:08:42.856
ResearchKit.

00:08:43.216 --> 00:08:45.296
Active Tasks.

00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:47.126
For those of you who are

00:08:47.196 --> 00:08:49.376
unfamiliar, Active Tasks are

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:52.156
prepackaged modules that allows

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:54.386
users to perform certain tasks

00:08:54.746 --> 00:08:57.056
or take certain tests in a given

00:08:57.056 --> 00:08:57.936
amount of time.

00:08:58.026 --> 00:08:59.896
When the user completes the

00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:02.036
step, the developer receives a

00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:03.876
delegate call back with an ORK

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:04.936
resolved object.

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:06.786
Now, this object consists of a

00:09:06.786 --> 00:09:08.196
variety of data points, which

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:09.686
include things like user

00:09:09.686 --> 00:09:11.896
responses, timing information

00:09:12.056 --> 00:09:13.856
and data recorded from different

00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:15.846
sources like Accelerometer,

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:18.066
Gyroscope, healthcare data, and

00:09:18.066 --> 00:09:19.226
even from your microphone.

00:09:20.216 --> 00:09:21.926
And this year, we are also

00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:23.436
adding support for health

00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:23.926
records.

00:09:24.906 --> 00:09:26.416
Now, let's take a look at how

00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.876
you can utilize this in your

00:09:27.876 --> 00:09:28.136
app.

00:09:28.826 --> 00:09:30.436
Now, your objective here is to

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.546
create a recorder configuration

00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:34.556
that can query health clinical

00:09:34.556 --> 00:09:35.326
data types.

00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:37.066
And you need to provide us with

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:38.426
two important parameters.

00:09:38.756 --> 00:09:41.706
First is of HKClinicalType, and

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.866
a second is an optional of type

00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:45.536
HKFIRResourceType.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:47.746
And once you have created this

00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:49.406
record of configuration, you

00:09:49.406 --> 00:09:50.486
attach it to the step.

00:09:51.206 --> 00:09:53.446
So, now when the user is about

00:09:53.446 --> 00:09:55.106
to perform the task, they will

00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:57.286
be prompted with HealthKits new

00:09:57.286 --> 00:09:58.336
authorization UI.

00:09:59.116 --> 00:10:00.986
And only if they grant access

00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:02.286
will we be able to run the

00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:02.726
query.

00:10:03.276 --> 00:10:04.696
And once the user completes the

00:10:04.696 --> 00:10:06.236
task as part of the delegate

00:10:06.236 --> 00:10:07.846
call back in your ORK result

00:10:07.846 --> 00:10:09.606
object, you will also have

00:10:09.646 --> 00:10:11.256
information that you requested

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:12.796
for from health records.

00:10:13.656 --> 00:10:15.506
Now, to understand and leaner

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:16.856
more about these different

00:10:16.856 --> 00:10:19.006
health records types, I highly

00:10:19.006 --> 00:10:21.626
recommend everyone here, to also

00:10:21.846 --> 00:10:23.746
visit the session, Accessing

00:10:23.746 --> 00:10:25.066
Health Records with HealthKit,

00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:26.756
that is happening right here at

00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:28.596
3 p.m., where they will talk

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:29.846
about everything related to

00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:31.446
health records in great detail,

00:10:31.736 --> 00:10:33.346
including some very important

00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:34.156
best practices.

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:37.146
And now that we have covered

00:10:37.496 --> 00:10:38.936
updates to the Active Task

00:10:38.936 --> 00:10:42.556
module as a whole, let's talk

00:10:42.556 --> 00:10:43.796
about the Active Tasks

00:10:43.796 --> 00:10:44.346
themselves.

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:46.426
This year, we are adding new

00:10:46.426 --> 00:10:48.936
modules focusing on three main

00:10:48.936 --> 00:10:51.366
areas of health; hearing,

00:10:51.746 --> 00:10:53.336
speech, and vision.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.846
Let's get started with hearing.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:11:00.256
We are adding a new dBHL tone

00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:01.656
audiometry step.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:03.846
This implements the

00:11:03.846 --> 00:11:05.916
Hughson-Westlake Method and

00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.336
allows you to determine the

00:11:07.496 --> 00:11:08.746
hearing threshold level of a

00:11:08.746 --> 00:11:11.206
user in the dBHL scale.

00:11:11.696 --> 00:11:14.256
And to facilitate this, and

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:15.896
ensure that you get the most

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:16.886
accurate results.

00:11:17.246 --> 00:11:18.816
I'm really excited to say that

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.826
for the very first time we are

00:11:20.916 --> 00:11:22.886
open sourcing calibration data

00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:23.996
for our AirPods.

00:11:24.646 --> 00:11:26.336
Now, this comes with three

00:11:26.336 --> 00:11:26.866
tables.

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:29.476
The first one is a volume curve

00:11:29.926 --> 00:11:32.396
for AirPods on all iOS devices.

00:11:32.866 --> 00:11:34.366
The second one is the

00:11:34.366 --> 00:11:36.096
sensitivity per frequency.

00:11:36.136 --> 00:11:38.266
Where sensitivity is measured in

00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:39.656
decibels sound pressure level.

00:11:40.036 --> 00:11:41.426
And finally, we are also

00:11:41.426 --> 00:11:42.936
providing the reference

00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:44.386
equivalent threshold sound

00:11:44.386 --> 00:11:46.596
pressure level tables or RETSPL.

00:11:46.596 --> 00:11:49.996
Now, it's really important to

00:11:49.996 --> 00:11:52.796
note that the RETSPL table is

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:53.606
still in beta.

00:11:54.216 --> 00:11:56.066
This means that we are actively

00:11:56.066 --> 00:11:57.966
running internal validations and

00:11:57.966 --> 00:11:58.466
tests.

00:11:58.636 --> 00:12:00.086
And over the next few weeks, we

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.066
will be updating these tables as

00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:03.996
we start converging on accurate

00:12:03.996 --> 00:12:04.526
data.

00:12:05.946 --> 00:12:07.496
Now let's take a look at how

00:12:07.496 --> 00:12:09.636
this Active Task actually works.

00:12:10.766 --> 00:12:12.956
The user is required to hear

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:15.576
tones at a particular frequency

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:18.616
at varying levels of dBHL value.

00:12:19.496 --> 00:12:20.866
When the user hears a tone, they

00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:22.486
are expected to tap the button

00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:23.816
to indicate that they have heard

00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:24.006
it.

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:25.746
And at that point we will start

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:28.196
decreasing the dBHL value as

00:12:28.246 --> 00:12:29.876
indicated here by the green

00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:30.306
dots.

00:12:30.776 --> 00:12:32.276
Now, when the user fails to tap

00:12:32.276 --> 00:12:34.846
the button after a given timeout

00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:36.636
period, we will start increasing

00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:38.476
the dBHL values as indicated by

00:12:38.476 --> 00:12:39.296
the red dots.

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:41.326
And over time we will feed these

00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:42.226
data points to the

00:12:42.226 --> 00:12:44.256
Hughson-Westlake Method in order

00:12:44.256 --> 00:12:45.566
to determine the hearing

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:48.586
threshold level of the user in

00:12:49.096 --> 00:12:51.966
the dBHL scale.

00:12:52.036 --> 00:12:53.086
Now, from a developer

00:12:53.086 --> 00:12:55.076
perspective, the entirety of

00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:57.226
tone generation occurs in three

00:12:57.226 --> 00:12:57.736
phases.

00:12:58.466 --> 00:13:00.636
The first one, is a pre-stimulus

00:13:00.636 --> 00:13:01.746
delay, which is a

00:13:01.746 --> 00:13:03.706
developer-specified maximum

00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:05.876
number in seconds that we use to

00:13:05.876 --> 00:13:08.086
generate a random delay between

00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:09.976
one and that value before we

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:11.126
start playing the tone to the

00:13:11.126 --> 00:13:11.616
user.

00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:13.876
This is to ensure that the user

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.556
cannot cheat the test by just

00:13:15.556 --> 00:13:18.446
randomly tapping on the button.

00:13:18.596 --> 00:13:20.526
Next, we are also providing a

00:13:20.526 --> 00:13:22.176
property for tone duration,

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.406
which governs the actual

00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:24.786
duration for which the tone will

00:13:24.786 --> 00:13:25.416
be played.

00:13:26.216 --> 00:13:28.026
And finally, is the post

00:13:28.026 --> 00:13:29.286
stimulus delay, which is the

00:13:29.286 --> 00:13:31.136
amount of time allocated to the

00:13:31.136 --> 00:13:33.226
user to respond for that

00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:34.186
specific tone.

00:13:35.136 --> 00:13:36.696
To incorporate this in your app,

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:39.266
you create an instance of

00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:42.016
ORKdBHL tone audiometry step

00:13:42.016 --> 00:13:44.226
with a unique identifier and

00:13:44.226 --> 00:13:45.796
provide us values for some of

00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:47.506
the parameters, including a

00:13:47.506 --> 00:13:49.216
frequency list, which is an

00:13:49.216 --> 00:13:51.326
array of frequency that you wish

00:13:51.326 --> 00:13:52.776
to be played back to your user.

00:13:53.396 --> 00:13:54.766
We're also exposing more

00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:56.166
properties that you can further

00:13:56.206 --> 00:13:58.146
customize for your specific use

00:13:58.146 --> 00:13:58.626
case.

00:13:59.086 --> 00:14:01.886
Now, when the user completes

00:14:01.886 --> 00:14:03.106
this task as part of the

00:14:03.106 --> 00:14:05.166
delegate call-back, the ORK

00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:06.636
result object will be returned

00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:06.966
to you.

00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:08.906
Let's take a look at what that

00:14:08.906 --> 00:14:10.306
object looks like for this

00:14:10.306 --> 00:14:11.926
particular task.

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:13.386
So, at the top level you get a

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:14.726
variety of information that

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:16.086
includes things like output

00:14:16.086 --> 00:14:18.326
volume, and also includes an

00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:19.916
array of sample objects.

00:14:20.436 --> 00:14:22.036
These objects in turn

00:14:22.076 --> 00:14:23.416
encapsulate things like

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:24.946
channels, which refers to

00:14:24.946 --> 00:14:26.366
whether the tone was being

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.766
played in the left or right

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.956
channel to the user, as well as

00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:31.166
the threshold value, as

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:31.936
determined by the

00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:33.176
Hughson-Westlake Method.

00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:35.466
This also consists of an array

00:14:35.466 --> 00:14:36.666
of unit objects.

00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:38.936
And the unit objects in turn,

00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:40.886
provide details like the dBHl

00:14:40.886 --> 00:14:42.916
value at which that particular

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:44.426
tone was being played, and a

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.006
variety of timestamps, which

00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:48.576
also includes when exactly did

00:14:48.576 --> 00:14:49.886
the user tap the button.

00:14:51.036 --> 00:14:52.996
So, now let's move on to our

00:14:52.996 --> 00:14:54.686
next task that falls under the

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:55.716
hearing category.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.686
We are adding an environment SPL

00:14:58.686 --> 00:14:59.166
meter.

00:15:00.196 --> 00:15:02.256
This implements an A-weighted

00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:04.316
filter, in order to measure the

00:15:04.316 --> 00:15:05.596
environmental sound pressure

00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:08.726
level in DBA, or in other words,

00:15:08.986 --> 00:15:10.276
it tells you how noisy it is.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:13.226
Now, this step also accepts a

00:15:13.226 --> 00:15:15.576
threshold value, and this makes

00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:17.506
things interesting, because now

00:15:17.836 --> 00:15:19.896
you can use the step as a gating

00:15:19.896 --> 00:15:20.286
step.

00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.196
So, for example, if you want

00:15:22.196 --> 00:15:23.846
your users to perform the tone

00:15:23.846 --> 00:15:25.906
audiometry task, you can add

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.956
this task before that to ensure

00:15:27.956 --> 00:15:30.086
that your users are not in an

00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:31.896
environment that is too noisy to

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:36.296
accurately perform the task.

00:15:36.446 --> 00:15:37.946
To add this you create an

00:15:37.946 --> 00:15:39.606
instance of ORK environment,

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.226
SPLMeterStep with a unique

00:15:41.226 --> 00:15:43.096
identifier and provide us the

00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:43.966
threshold value.

00:15:44.826 --> 00:15:46.386
We're also exposing additional

00:15:46.386 --> 00:15:47.656
properties that you can further

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:48.336
customize.

00:15:49.976 --> 00:15:51.486
And now, let's take a quick

00:15:51.486 --> 00:15:53.696
detour and move on to our next

00:15:53.696 --> 00:15:55.906
category, speech.

00:15:57.186 --> 00:15:58.596
We're adding a speech

00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.606
recognition module, which

00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:02.166
leverages the speech recognition

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:04.586
framework on iOS, now, this

00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:06.846
gives us direct access to a

00:16:06.846 --> 00:16:08.486
real-time speech recognizers

00:16:08.486 --> 00:16:10.056
that supports over 50 different

00:16:10.056 --> 00:16:11.326
languages, or locales.

00:16:11.726 --> 00:16:14.066
As part of this task, the user

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:15.836
is asked to either repeat a

00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:18.456
sentence, or describe an image.

00:16:19.236 --> 00:16:20.996
And once they are done speaking,

00:16:21.366 --> 00:16:23.266
the users will be automatically

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:25.846
taken to a next step, where they

00:16:25.846 --> 00:16:27.566
can edit the generated

00:16:27.566 --> 00:16:28.216
transcript.

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:30.436
So, for example in this case

00:16:30.676 --> 00:16:32.336
quick and fox were incorrectly

00:16:32.336 --> 00:16:34.036
interpreted as quite and box.

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:36.506
Your users can just tap on these

00:16:36.506 --> 00:16:38.916
words an edit them if necessary.

00:16:39.426 --> 00:16:41.466
Now, it's important to note,

00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:42.906
that as part of this task, we

00:16:42.906 --> 00:16:45.046
are returning to you a very,

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.986
very rich dataset that consists

00:16:46.986 --> 00:16:48.006
of three main things.

00:16:48.736 --> 00:16:50.806
A direct audio recording to what

00:16:50.806 --> 00:16:53.286
the user said, the transcription

00:16:53.286 --> 00:16:54.236
generated by the speech

00:16:54.236 --> 00:16:56.586
recognition engine, and the

00:16:56.586 --> 00:16:58.586
edited transcript by the user.

00:16:58.886 --> 00:17:01.656
To add this to your app, you

00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:03.376
create an instance of ORK

00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:05.056
speechRecognitionStep, and

00:17:05.056 --> 00:17:06.596
provide us with either a UI

00:17:06.596 --> 00:17:07.915
image, or a string.

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:10.386
You can also customize the

00:17:10.386 --> 00:17:12.286
locale for this recognition.

00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:14.266
And also, you can surface

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:16.316
real-time transcription as the

00:17:16.316 --> 00:17:17.326
user is speaking.

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:20.695
Now, let's take a closer look at

00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:22.746
one of the subsets of our result

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:23.326
object.

00:17:24.536 --> 00:17:26.816
This is of type FS transcription

00:17:27.086 --> 00:17:28.306
as surface by the speech

00:17:28.306 --> 00:17:29.406
recognition framework.

00:17:29.896 --> 00:17:31.576
The formattedString provides the

00:17:31.576 --> 00:17:33.316
transcript, and the array of

00:17:33.316 --> 00:17:35.276
segment objects, essentially

00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:37.006
breakdown the transcript into

00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:39.186
substrings, as well as provide a

00:17:39.256 --> 00:17:40.496
confidence letter for each

00:17:40.496 --> 00:17:41.076
substring.

00:17:41.636 --> 00:17:42.866
On top of this, they also

00:17:42.866 --> 00:17:44.926
provide an array of alternative

00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:46.846
string, as you can see here in

00:17:46.846 --> 00:17:48.146
this illustrative example.

00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:51.536
Now, these results can be used

00:17:51.536 --> 00:17:53.896
to derive syntactic, semantic

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:55.986
and linguistic features, as well

00:17:55.986 --> 00:17:58.146
as speaking rate in order to

00:17:58.146 --> 00:18:00.446
evaluate the speech patterns for

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.036
various medical conditions,

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:07.196
including cognition and mood.

00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:09.446
Our next task, Interestingly, is

00:18:09.446 --> 00:18:12.126
a combination of speech and

00:18:12.126 --> 00:18:12.536
hearing.

00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:15.626
The speech and noise Active

00:18:16.186 --> 00:18:16.376
Task.

00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:18.786
This allows you to perform fully

00:18:18.786 --> 00:18:20.446
automated speech audiometry.

00:18:21.706 --> 00:18:24.176
And conventional tone audiometry

00:18:24.176 --> 00:18:26.006
uses pure tones, which are

00:18:26.006 --> 00:18:27.396
essentially sign waves.

00:18:28.176 --> 00:18:29.276
Now, there have been recorded

00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:30.896
instances, where users are able

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:32.656
to clearly distinguish pure

00:18:32.656 --> 00:18:34.066
tones, but find it extremely

00:18:34.066 --> 00:18:35.976
difficult to distinguish words

00:18:36.136 --> 00:18:37.366
when they are intermixed with

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:37.806
noise.

00:18:38.946 --> 00:18:40.686
And this closely reflects

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:42.596
real-world examples of

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.536
early-stage hearing loss.

00:18:44.746 --> 00:18:46.786
For example, when you are unable

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.576
to understand what the person

00:18:48.576 --> 00:18:49.546
sitting in front of you is

00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:51.086
telling you in a noisy

00:18:51.086 --> 00:18:51.686
restaurant.

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.426
Now, before I go into further

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:56.406
details let's take a look at how

00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:57.976
this task actually works.

00:19:03.906 --> 00:19:05.206
>> The actor tried three green

00:19:05.206 --> 00:19:05.596
pictures.

00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:09.776
>> Now, as you notice an audio

00:19:09.776 --> 00:19:11.556
file was played to the user, and

00:19:11.556 --> 00:19:12.646
once it completes, they are

00:19:12.646 --> 00:19:14.606
immediately requested to repeat

00:19:14.646 --> 00:19:16.406
what they have just heard.

00:19:17.576 --> 00:19:19.986
Now, the speech and noise Active

00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:22.906
Task uses audio files generated

00:19:22.906 --> 00:19:24.706
by combining five words from a

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.696
close-set matrix, that was

00:19:26.696 --> 00:19:28.756
validated internally for things

00:19:28.756 --> 00:19:30.306
like word familiarity,

00:19:30.676 --> 00:19:33.476
uniformity, difficulty, and also

00:19:33.476 --> 00:19:35.146
to ensure that the sentences

00:19:35.146 --> 00:19:36.816
generated by the synthesizer

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:39.056
were phonetically balanced and

00:19:39.056 --> 00:19:40.676
more importantly, consistent.

00:19:41.926 --> 00:19:43.106
These files are then

00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:44.766
programmatically mixed with

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.376
background noise at varying

00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:48.166
levels of signal to noise ratio,

00:19:48.466 --> 00:19:49.196
or SNR.

00:19:50.136 --> 00:19:51.576
And developers will also have

00:19:51.576 --> 00:19:53.696
the option to set the value for

00:19:53.696 --> 00:19:55.436
the gain for all of the noise

00:19:55.436 --> 00:19:56.116
signals.

00:19:56.606 --> 00:20:00.076
Now, speech reception threshold,

00:20:00.126 --> 00:20:02.506
is defined as the minimum value

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:04.836
in SNR at which a user can

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:06.726
understand only 50% of the

00:20:06.726 --> 00:20:09.916
spoken words.

00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:12.676
Now, our vision for this test is

00:20:12.896 --> 00:20:14.286
over the next few weeks, we'll

00:20:14.286 --> 00:20:17.126
be uploading over 175 different

00:20:17.126 --> 00:20:20.296
files that corresponds to 25

00:20:20.296 --> 00:20:22.126
lists, each with 7 sentences.

00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:24.566
And in the long-run, we want to

00:20:24.566 --> 00:20:26.356
be able to support this test for

00:20:26.356 --> 00:20:28.676
multiple languages, especially

00:20:28.676 --> 00:20:30.506
ones where currently speech and

00:20:30.506 --> 00:20:32.856
noise is not possible due to a

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:34.816
lack of speech database or other

00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:35.926
testing resources.

00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:38.296
So, if you are a researcher in

00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:39.886
this particular field and if you

00:20:39.886 --> 00:20:41.226
have a request for specific

00:20:41.226 --> 00:20:43.576
locale, I highly encourage you

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.306
to reach out to us and we'll do

00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:46.396
our best to accommodate your

00:20:46.396 --> 00:20:46.896
request.

00:20:46.896 --> 00:20:50.886
To add this to your app, you

00:20:50.886 --> 00:20:51.926
create an instance of

00:20:51.926 --> 00:20:54.466
ORKSpeechInNoiseStep, and point

00:20:54.466 --> 00:20:55.706
us to the audio file that you

00:20:55.706 --> 00:20:56.296
wish to play.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.616
You can also specify the gain

00:20:58.616 --> 00:20:59.966
applied to the noise signal.

00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:04.756
And lastly, let's touch on

00:21:04.756 --> 00:21:05.206
vision.

00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:10.456
the Amsler grid is a tool that

00:21:10.456 --> 00:21:12.846
is used to detect problems in a

00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:14.696
user's vision that can be caused

00:21:14.696 --> 00:21:18.416
due to conditions like macular

00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:19.316
degeneration.

00:21:20.586 --> 00:21:23.526
Now, this test is conventionally

00:21:23.526 --> 00:21:25.556
performed in a doctor's office

00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:27.476
on a traditional piece of paper,

00:21:27.476 --> 00:21:28.996
displaying a graphic like the

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.056
one you see right here.

00:21:30.926 --> 00:21:32.926
Users with perfect vision would

00:21:32.926 --> 00:21:35.216
see exactly this, whereas users

00:21:35.216 --> 00:21:36.736
who suffer from some conditions

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:38.626
would start seeing distortions

00:21:38.626 --> 00:21:39.296
on this graph.

00:21:40.206 --> 00:21:42.266
Now, please don't panic if

00:21:42.266 --> 00:21:43.486
you're seeing distortions right

00:21:43.486 --> 00:21:43.776
now.

00:21:44.186 --> 00:21:45.696
That was intentional and it was

00:21:45.736 --> 00:21:46.916
added for dramatic effect.

00:21:48.126 --> 00:21:49.776
Now, users simply have to point

00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:50.906
to places on the grid where they

00:21:50.906 --> 00:21:51.766
see distortions.

00:21:52.226 --> 00:21:54.856
By replicating this grid, we are

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:56.406
able to bring the functionality

00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:58.256
of this task to the users at

00:21:58.446 --> 00:21:59.646
home on their device.

00:22:00.036 --> 00:22:01.646
Users simply have to annotate

00:22:01.646 --> 00:22:03.106
areas on the grid where they see

00:22:03.106 --> 00:22:03.936
distortions.

00:22:05.066 --> 00:22:07.426
And we believe that developers

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:09.876
can leverage some exciting iOS

00:22:09.876 --> 00:22:11.726
features like [inaudible] or the

00:22:11.726 --> 00:22:14.546
depth sensing camera to increase

00:22:14.546 --> 00:22:16.656
the experience of a user who is

00:22:16.656 --> 00:22:19.006
taking this particular task.

00:22:19.356 --> 00:22:21.176
Now, all of these Active Tasks

00:22:21.266 --> 00:22:22.956
are really great for data

00:22:22.956 --> 00:22:24.656
collection and analysis.

00:22:25.336 --> 00:22:26.416
But they are designed to be

00:22:26.416 --> 00:22:28.546
performed at a specified time

00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:30.046
for a given period.

00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:33.016
And as we start to dig into

00:22:33.016 --> 00:22:34.886
specific conditions, we have

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:35.996
realized that some of the more

00:22:35.996 --> 00:22:37.636
complex problems in health

00:22:38.016 --> 00:22:40.396
require constant monitoring, and

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:42.086
therefore, introduce the need

00:22:42.386 --> 00:22:44.826
for passive, noninvasive data

00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:45.436
collection.

00:22:46.046 --> 00:22:47.686
And to talk more about that I

00:22:47.686 --> 00:22:48.936
would like to introduce Gabriel

00:22:49.016 --> 00:22:49.706
up on stage.

00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:55.976
[ Applause ]

00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:59.236
>> Hello. My name is Gabriel and

00:22:59.236 --> 00:23:00.566
I'm here on behalf of the core

00:23:00.566 --> 00:23:02.946
motion team to introduce a new

00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:03.766
research API.

00:23:04.606 --> 00:23:06.556
The movement disorder API.

00:23:09.116 --> 00:23:10.776
As Srinath was mentioning, this

00:23:10.776 --> 00:23:12.716
is a passive, all-day monitoring

00:23:12.716 --> 00:23:15.336
API, available on Apple Watch,

00:23:15.636 --> 00:23:17.016
which will allow you to monitor

00:23:17.016 --> 00:23:18.216
the symptoms of movement

00:23:18.216 --> 00:23:18.816
disorders.

00:23:19.186 --> 00:23:21.056
Specifically, two movements

00:23:21.056 --> 00:23:22.906
disorders which are relevant to

00:23:23.176 --> 00:23:24.176
the study of Parkinson's

00:23:24.216 --> 00:23:24.616
disease.

00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:28.216
Now, because of the targeted use

00:23:28.216 --> 00:23:30.476
case as a research API, you will

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:31.786
need to apply for a special code

00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:33.446
signing entitlement in order to

00:23:33.446 --> 00:23:34.156
use this API.

00:23:35.136 --> 00:23:36.316
This application process will be

00:23:36.316 --> 00:23:37.826
done through the Apple developer

00:23:37.826 --> 00:23:39.556
web portal, starting in seed

00:23:39.646 --> 00:23:42.016
two, though if you just can't

00:23:42.016 --> 00:23:43.336
wait and I don't blame you,

00:23:44.246 --> 00:23:46.106
there will be sample data sets

00:23:46.106 --> 00:23:47.836
as well as demo code available

00:23:47.836 --> 00:23:49.256
in the research kit, GitHub

00:23:49.256 --> 00:23:50.776
repository for this talk.

00:23:51.956 --> 00:23:53.786
So, let's start talking about

00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:55.346
those two movement disorder

00:23:55.346 --> 00:23:55.826
symptoms.

00:23:58.546 --> 00:23:59.826
As some of you may know,

00:24:00.516 --> 00:24:02.256
Parkinson's is a degenerative

00:24:02.386 --> 00:24:04.416
neurological disorder which can

00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:05.726
affect the motor functions of

00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:06.696
those with the disease.

00:24:07.806 --> 00:24:09.606
One of the identifiable symptoms

00:24:09.606 --> 00:24:11.666
of Parkinson's is a tremor.

00:24:12.226 --> 00:24:14.016
And this API monitors for tremor

00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:16.746
at rest, characterized by a

00:24:16.746 --> 00:24:19.946
shaking, or a trembling of the

00:24:19.946 --> 00:24:22.506
body when somebody is not

00:24:22.506 --> 00:24:23.406
intending to move.

00:24:24.706 --> 00:24:26.736
Now, there are treatments

00:24:27.076 --> 00:24:28.956
including medications, which can

00:24:28.956 --> 00:24:31.076
help suppress and control the

00:24:31.076 --> 00:24:32.016
symptoms of Parkinson's.

00:24:32.706 --> 00:24:34.436
However, these very same

00:24:34.436 --> 00:24:35.506
treatments can often have

00:24:35.766 --> 00:24:36.856
negative side effects.

00:24:37.656 --> 00:24:39.036
Side effects such as

00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:40.646
dyskinesias.

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:43.406
And one dyskinetic symptom that

00:24:43.406 --> 00:24:45.486
this API is able to monitor for

00:24:45.936 --> 00:24:47.886
is a fidgeting or swaying of the

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:49.406
body known as choreiform

00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:49.756
movement.

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:54.306
So, to recap, you have tremor, a

00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:56.406
symptom of the disease as well

00:24:56.406 --> 00:24:58.886
as dyskinesia, a side effect of

00:24:58.886 --> 00:24:59.406
the treatment.

00:25:00.306 --> 00:25:01.956
Let's take a quick look at what

00:25:01.986 --> 00:25:03.736
tools researchers and clinicians

00:25:03.856 --> 00:25:05.456
currently have in order to

00:25:05.456 --> 00:25:08.666
assess these symptoms.

00:25:08.906 --> 00:25:09.946
Typically, these types of

00:25:09.946 --> 00:25:11.796
assessments are done in clinic.

00:25:12.586 --> 00:25:14.636
A clinician will ask a patient

00:25:14.636 --> 00:25:16.186
with Parkinson's disease to

00:25:16.186 --> 00:25:18.146
perform physical diagnostic

00:25:18.396 --> 00:25:20.666
tests in order to rate and

00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:22.006
evaluate the severity of their

00:25:22.006 --> 00:25:22.436
condition.

00:25:23.476 --> 00:25:24.686
These ratings provide a

00:25:24.686 --> 00:25:26.816
quantitative, though subjected

00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:28.496
to the rater, measurement of

00:25:28.496 --> 00:25:29.956
their condition at that point in

00:25:29.956 --> 00:25:31.026
time, when they're in the

00:25:31.026 --> 00:25:31.416
clinic.

00:25:32.616 --> 00:25:33.716
In order to get a broader and

00:25:33.716 --> 00:25:35.506
more complete picture, patients

00:25:35.506 --> 00:25:36.616
are also encouraged to keep

00:25:36.796 --> 00:25:38.446
diaries where they log their

00:25:38.446 --> 00:25:39.586
symptoms manually.

00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:42.236
However, this can be cumbersome

00:25:42.236 --> 00:25:43.746
for patients and some will

00:25:43.746 --> 00:25:45.726
understandably forget or be

00:25:45.816 --> 00:25:48.256
unable to describe the full

00:25:48.256 --> 00:25:49.876
extent of their symptoms every

00:25:50.116 --> 00:25:50.946
single day.

00:25:51.376 --> 00:25:54.796
Wouldn't it be great if there

00:25:54.796 --> 00:25:57.846
was a passive, unobtrusive way

00:25:58.616 --> 00:25:59.826
to monitor for these symptoms.

00:26:01.166 --> 00:26:03.106
Well, by using the movement

00:26:03.106 --> 00:26:05.496
disorder API, researchers and

00:26:05.496 --> 00:26:07.646
developers like yourselves, will

00:26:07.646 --> 00:26:08.996
be able to build apps which

00:26:08.996 --> 00:26:10.406
collect these types of the

00:26:10.406 --> 00:26:13.946
metrics, continuously whenever a

00:26:13.946 --> 00:26:15.886
patient is wearing their Apple

00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:16.336
Watch.

00:26:17.346 --> 00:26:18.416
Not only does this give you a

00:26:18.416 --> 00:26:19.936
quantitative measurement of

00:26:19.936 --> 00:26:21.816
those symptoms, displayed here

00:26:21.816 --> 00:26:23.126
as the percentage of the time

00:26:23.436 --> 00:26:24.096
observed.

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:26.006
But it also gives you a

00:26:26.006 --> 00:26:28.136
longitudinal analysis, where you

00:26:28.136 --> 00:26:29.226
can track changes to those

00:26:29.226 --> 00:26:30.516
symptoms over time.

00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:33.106
These algorithms were designed

00:26:33.446 --> 00:26:35.346
and piloted using data collected

00:26:35.726 --> 00:26:38.106
from Parkinson's patients in

00:26:38.106 --> 00:26:39.266
internal clinical studies.

00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:41.656
And we hope that you can use

00:26:41.756 --> 00:26:43.946
these tools and these learnings

00:26:44.476 --> 00:26:47.556
to build new care experiences

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.396
that improve the quality of life

00:26:49.576 --> 00:26:50.696
of people with Parkinson's.

00:26:51.316 --> 00:26:53.816
But before you can do any of

00:26:53.816 --> 00:26:55.296
that, you're going to need to

00:26:55.296 --> 00:26:56.836
know how to use the API, right?

00:26:57.656 --> 00:26:58.276
All right.

00:26:58.536 --> 00:26:59.656
Well, let's take a look at some

00:27:00.246 --> 00:27:00.366
code.

00:27:01.696 --> 00:27:03.326
The first thing you're going to

00:27:03.326 --> 00:27:04.866
want to do is request motion

00:27:04.906 --> 00:27:06.586
authorization from the user in

00:27:06.586 --> 00:27:07.936
order to use their movement

00:27:07.936 --> 00:27:08.556
disorder data.

00:27:09.956 --> 00:27:12.416
Once you've done that, you'll

00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:13.906
want to call the monitorKinesias

00:27:13.906 --> 00:27:15.976
function in order to enable

00:27:16.046 --> 00:27:16.816
symptom monitoring.

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.376
Now, this symptom monitoring

00:27:19.546 --> 00:27:21.296
does turn on additional Apple

00:27:21.296 --> 00:27:23.196
Watch sensors, so this will have

00:27:23.196 --> 00:27:24.846
an impact on the battery life of

00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:26.286
your users, though they should

00:27:26.286 --> 00:27:27.806
still be able to have a days'

00:27:27.806 --> 00:27:28.876
worth of data collection on a

00:27:28.876 --> 00:27:29.566
single charge.

00:27:29.976 --> 00:27:33.216
As you can see, the maximum

00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:34.476
recording duration is seven

00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:34.806
days.

00:27:35.636 --> 00:27:36.586
I know that many of you are

00:27:36.586 --> 00:27:37.706
going to be conducting studies

00:27:37.886 --> 00:27:39.176
that are longer than seven days,

00:27:39.526 --> 00:27:41.086
and if that's the case, simply

00:27:41.156 --> 00:27:42.346
call the monitorKinesias

00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:44.226
function again in order to

00:27:44.226 --> 00:27:45.476
extend your data collection

00:27:45.476 --> 00:27:45.776
interval.

00:27:46.896 --> 00:27:49.696
This will begin to store tremor

00:27:49.696 --> 00:27:51.376
and dyskinesia results on the

00:27:51.376 --> 00:27:53.086
user's device, on your behalf.

00:27:54.226 --> 00:27:55.766
At a certain point afterwards,

00:27:55.766 --> 00:27:56.666
you're going to want to return

00:27:56.666 --> 00:27:58.146
to that application so you can

00:27:58.146 --> 00:27:59.046
query for those records.

00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:00.446
Let's take a look at what the

00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:01.476
query function looks like.

00:28:01.896 --> 00:28:05.596
As you can see, in this line,

00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:07.566
recording for any new tremor

00:28:07.566 --> 00:28:09.056
records that were stored on the

00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:10.896
device since our last query

00:28:11.086 --> 00:28:11.306
date.

00:28:12.776 --> 00:28:14.956
These records are stored on

00:28:14.956 --> 00:28:17.736
device by the API, but they also

00:28:17.736 --> 00:28:19.426
will expire after seven days.

00:28:20.036 --> 00:28:21.656
And so, before it expires,

00:28:21.916 --> 00:28:22.826
you're going to want to take

00:28:22.986 --> 00:28:24.596
ownership of those records

00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:27.486
either by serializing them and

00:28:27.486 --> 00:28:28.756
storing them on this device

00:28:28.756 --> 00:28:30.586
yourself, or transferring it to

00:28:30.586 --> 00:28:32.046
a different platform so you can

00:28:32.046 --> 00:28:33.206
visualize it and analyze it.

00:28:34.436 --> 00:28:35.846
The data will be returned to you

00:28:35.846 --> 00:28:37.626
as an array of minute long

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:38.786
object results.

00:28:39.306 --> 00:28:42.006
So, one hour's worth of data, 60

00:28:42.176 --> 00:28:43.236
result objects.

00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:45.256
Let's take a look at what one of

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.406
those result objects will look

00:28:46.406 --> 00:28:46.556
like.

00:28:52.186 --> 00:28:53.706
As you can see, the result

00:28:53.706 --> 00:28:55.656
objects return the percentage of

00:28:55.656 --> 00:28:57.096
the time the percentage of that

00:28:57.096 --> 00:28:58.686
one minute that the algorithm

00:28:58.686 --> 00:29:00.006
was able to observe the

00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:02.566
presence, or the absence of the

00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:03.066
symptom.

00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:05.186
For dyskinesia, here on the

00:29:05.186 --> 00:29:06.766
right, you can see that that's

00:29:06.766 --> 00:29:09.176
pretty simple; unlikely or

00:29:09.176 --> 00:29:09.526
likely.

00:29:10.856 --> 00:29:11.906
tremor gives you a few more

00:29:11.906 --> 00:29:12.326
options.

00:29:12.976 --> 00:29:13.666
Let's go through them.

00:29:14.136 --> 00:29:18.446
Since this is a tremor at rest

00:29:18.886 --> 00:29:20.516
any active or chaotic motion

00:29:20.516 --> 00:29:22.246
will simply be returned as

00:29:22.466 --> 00:29:23.306
percent unknown.

00:29:23.786 --> 00:29:25.186
And this is the same category

00:29:25.186 --> 00:29:26.806
that we use for low signal

00:29:26.806 --> 00:29:28.216
levels we're unable to make a

00:29:28.216 --> 00:29:28.866
determination.

00:29:29.676 --> 00:29:31.306
However, if the algorithm is

00:29:31.306 --> 00:29:32.646
able to make a determination, it

00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:34.146
will also return the severity of

00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:35.946
the tremor, ranging from slight

00:29:36.586 --> 00:29:37.336
up until strong.

00:29:37.926 --> 00:29:41.046
Now, to show you just how well

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:42.846
the passive monitoring of the

00:29:42.846 --> 00:29:45.006
movement disorder API is able to

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:46.496
work in conjunction with the

00:29:46.546 --> 00:29:47.836
active monitoring of a

00:29:47.836 --> 00:29:49.896
ResearchKit Active Task, I would

00:29:49.896 --> 00:29:51.196
like to invite up to the stage

00:29:51.476 --> 00:29:52.736
Akshay, who is going to

00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:55.206
integrate both into one stellar

00:29:55.266 --> 00:29:56.246
research application.

00:29:57.516 --> 00:30:03.086
[ Applause ]

00:30:03.586 --> 00:30:04.176
>> Hello, everyone.

00:30:04.476 --> 00:30:05.786
And welcome to the Advances in

00:30:05.786 --> 00:30:06.746
Research in Care demo.

00:30:07.356 --> 00:30:08.936
In this demo, we'll see some

00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:10.546
research get update and also

00:30:10.546 --> 00:30:11.796
implement the movement disorder

00:30:11.796 --> 00:30:12.076
API.

00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:14.096
As part of our research kit

00:30:14.096 --> 00:30:15.486
repository on GitHub, we have

00:30:15.486 --> 00:30:17.276
already added an ORK Parkinson's

00:30:17.276 --> 00:30:17.746
study app.

00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:20.006
This app implements the movement

00:30:20.006 --> 00:30:22.836
disorder API and also visualizes

00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:24.866
the tremor and dyskinesia

00:30:24.866 --> 00:30:26.036
symptom data points that we just

00:30:26.036 --> 00:30:26.176
saw.

00:30:26.176 --> 00:30:27.796
Let's go ahead and see what this

00:30:27.796 --> 00:30:28.526
app looks like right now.

00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:38.846
We have an Apple Watch app where

00:30:38.846 --> 00:30:39.916
we implement the movement

00:30:39.916 --> 00:30:41.866
disorder API, collect the tremor

00:30:41.866 --> 00:30:42.936
and dyskinesia symptom data

00:30:42.936 --> 00:30:44.276
points and send them to our

00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:44.656
phone app.

00:30:45.346 --> 00:30:46.646
In our iPhone app, we have a

00:30:46.646 --> 00:30:48.146
questionnaire, a few Active

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:50.356
Tasks, and also visualize these

00:30:50.356 --> 00:30:51.386
tremor and dyskinesia symptom

00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:51.906
data points.

00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:53.926
Let's look at what the code

00:30:53.926 --> 00:30:55.316
looks like, and for this demo,

00:30:55.736 --> 00:30:56.846
we'll start with the basic bald

00:30:56.846 --> 00:30:58.126
plate application and try to

00:30:58.126 --> 00:30:58.826
recreate this app.

00:31:03.046 --> 00:31:04.586
Here's my Xcode workspace, and

00:31:04.586 --> 00:31:05.886
as you can see, in my

00:31:05.886 --> 00:31:07.426
ResearchKit, I now have ORK

00:31:07.426 --> 00:31:08.336
Parkinson's Study App.

00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:09.776
We have a task list

00:31:09.776 --> 00:31:11.426
viewController, where we'll be

00:31:11.426 --> 00:31:12.796
adding all our Active Tasks and

00:31:12.796 --> 00:31:13.246
questionnaires.

00:31:13.856 --> 00:31:15.376
A graphviewController, where

00:31:15.376 --> 00:31:16.626
we'll be visualizing these

00:31:16.626 --> 00:31:17.696
tremor and dyskinesia symptom

00:31:17.696 --> 00:31:18.186
data points.

00:31:18.706 --> 00:31:20.066
And an assessment manager, where

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:21.246
we will be implementing the

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:22.876
movement disorder API.

00:31:23.596 --> 00:31:24.986
When a Parkinson's disease

00:31:25.026 --> 00:31:26.606
patient, or a PD patient visits

00:31:26.606 --> 00:31:28.136
their doctor, they're asked a

00:31:28.136 --> 00:31:29.656
certain set of questions, and

00:31:29.656 --> 00:31:30.876
these questions include

00:31:30.876 --> 00:31:31.996
questions about their activities

00:31:31.996 --> 00:31:33.076
of daily life, something for

00:31:33.076 --> 00:31:34.876
example on a scale of 0 to 10,

00:31:35.096 --> 00:31:36.116
how is your pain level today.

00:31:36.886 --> 00:31:38.086
Or, what kind of non-motor

00:31:38.086 --> 00:31:38.946
symptoms are you feeling?

00:31:38.946 --> 00:31:41.016
We have already added a subset

00:31:41.016 --> 00:31:42.226
of such questions in our app.

00:31:42.876 --> 00:31:44.396
Now, these questionnaires are

00:31:44.396 --> 00:31:45.416
usually followed by seven

00:31:45.416 --> 00:31:46.126
physical tests.

00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:47.636
And one of the physical tests is

00:31:47.666 --> 00:31:48.976
assessing the clarity of speech.

00:31:49.436 --> 00:31:50.876
So, let's go ahead and add the

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:52.196
speech recognition Active Task.

00:31:53.526 --> 00:31:54.806
In my task list view controller,

00:31:55.616 --> 00:31:57.106
I'll go ahead and add the speech

00:31:57.106 --> 00:31:58.066
recognition Active Task.

00:31:58.676 --> 00:31:59.886
And as you can see, we just

00:31:59.886 --> 00:32:01.426
added an ORK ordered task of

00:32:01.426 --> 00:32:02.386
type speech recognition.

00:32:02.956 --> 00:32:05.106
And if you notice, one of the

00:32:05.106 --> 00:32:06.166
parameters is the speech

00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:07.916
recognizer locale, which is an

00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:09.586
item provided by ResearchKit

00:32:09.906 --> 00:32:12.076
that represent all the locales

00:32:12.136 --> 00:32:13.306
that are supported by speech

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:15.206
recognition API, so that you, as

00:32:15.206 --> 00:32:16.566
developers don't have to worry

00:32:16.566 --> 00:32:18.376
about conforming if your locale

00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:19.476
is supported by these speech

00:32:19.476 --> 00:32:20.096
recognition API.

00:32:21.436 --> 00:32:22.776
Now, let's move on to our

00:32:22.776 --> 00:32:23.486
assessment manager.

00:32:23.996 --> 00:32:26.816
As Gabriel mentioned, we have a

00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:28.186
variable call manager, which is

00:32:28.186 --> 00:32:29.456
of type see and movement

00:32:29.576 --> 00:32:30.396
disorder manager.

00:32:30.966 --> 00:32:32.436
And if you notice, we have a

00:32:32.436 --> 00:32:33.526
function that calls the

00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:35.266
monitorKinesias method for the

00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:36.716
maximum duration of seven days.

00:32:37.396 --> 00:32:38.536
Let's call this matter in our

00:32:38.536 --> 00:32:39.156
initializer.

00:32:40.736 --> 00:32:43.026
Now, whoever creates an object

00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:45.346
of a type assessment manager

00:32:45.716 --> 00:32:47.076
will simply start the tremor and

00:32:47.076 --> 00:32:48.086
dyskinesia symptom query.

00:32:49.096 --> 00:32:50.056
Once we have collected these

00:32:50.056 --> 00:32:51.586
data, we need a way to query

00:32:51.586 --> 00:32:52.476
these data points also.

00:32:52.826 --> 00:32:53.976
So, let's go ahead and add a

00:32:53.976 --> 00:32:55.476
method that record these data.

00:32:56.516 --> 00:32:57.966
I add a new, query new

00:32:57.966 --> 00:32:59.896
assessments method, where I'm

00:32:59.896 --> 00:33:01.126
calling the query tremor method

00:33:01.306 --> 00:33:02.436
for a given start date and an

00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:04.006
end date, and the query

00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:05.636
dyskinesia symptoms method, for

00:33:05.636 --> 00:33:07.066
the same start date and the end

00:33:07.516 --> 00:33:07.626
date.

00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:10.936
For this demo, we have already

00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:12.466
ran this query and collected the

00:33:12.466 --> 00:33:13.616
tremor and dyskinesia symptom

00:33:13.616 --> 00:33:14.686
data points and saved them as

00:33:14.716 --> 00:33:15.566
part of JSON file.

00:33:16.196 --> 00:33:17.626
Let's go ahead, use those JSON

00:33:17.626 --> 00:33:19.096
files and create ResearchKit

00:33:19.096 --> 00:33:19.806
graphs on them.

00:33:21.136 --> 00:33:22.456
I'll move over to my graph view

00:33:22.456 --> 00:33:24.896
controller, and here, as you can

00:33:24.896 --> 00:33:26.186
see, I have a create graph

00:33:26.186 --> 00:33:27.696
method, which reads the JSON

00:33:27.696 --> 00:33:29.136
files and creates ResearchKit

00:33:29.136 --> 00:33:29.756
graphs from them.

00:33:30.326 --> 00:33:31.506
Let's call these methods in our

00:33:31.506 --> 00:33:32.666
view data log.

00:33:34.116 --> 00:33:36.886
Perfect. Now, let's run this.

00:33:37.456 --> 00:33:40.126
As you can see, we added this

00:33:40.126 --> 00:33:41.256
speech recognition Active Task,

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:43.736
and added the movement disorder

00:33:43.736 --> 00:33:44.016
API.

00:33:44.946 --> 00:33:45.936
Here's what our Parkinson's

00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:46.666
study app looks like.

00:33:47.026 --> 00:33:47.996
We have the questionnaire on

00:33:47.996 --> 00:33:48.206
top.

00:33:48.686 --> 00:33:49.726
Let's quickly go ahead and run

00:33:49.726 --> 00:33:50.336
through one questionnaire.

00:33:51.816 --> 00:33:53.156
As Srinath mentioned earlier, we

00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:54.606
now have a card view for all

00:33:54.606 --> 00:33:55.476
these survey items.

00:33:56.066 --> 00:33:57.536
And also, all these steps in

00:33:57.536 --> 00:34:00.166
ResearchKit adhere to the iOS

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:00.556
paradigm.

00:34:01.876 --> 00:34:02.826
Let's quickly finish this

00:34:02.826 --> 00:34:04.996
questionnaire, and that's it.

00:34:05.136 --> 00:34:06.636
Now, let's move on to the speech

00:34:06.636 --> 00:34:07.516
recognition Active Task.

00:34:08.406 --> 00:34:09.826
The first two steps talk about

00:34:09.826 --> 00:34:10.766
how to use the speech

00:34:10.766 --> 00:34:11.366
recognition step.

00:34:11.746 --> 00:34:13.166
And as soon as I press the start

00:34:13.166 --> 00:34:14.456
recording button, I would be

00:34:14.456 --> 00:34:15.596
repeating the text that I see.

00:34:16.206 --> 00:34:19.505
A quick brown fox jumps over the

00:34:19.505 --> 00:34:19.976
lazy dog.

00:34:22.735 --> 00:34:24.556
I am directed to the next step,

00:34:24.556 --> 00:34:25.726
which is the other transcription

00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:26.186
step.

00:34:26.186 --> 00:34:27.516
And as Srinath mentioned, this

00:34:27.516 --> 00:34:28.886
step is optional and could be

00:34:29.005 --> 00:34:30.235
replaced from the task by

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:32.045
setting the property allow edit

00:34:32.045 --> 00:34:34.985
transcript to no.

00:34:35.186 --> 00:34:37.786
Perfect. Now, let's look at the

00:34:37.786 --> 00:34:39.036
graphs that we created off of

00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:40.176
tremor and dyskinesia symptom

00:34:40.176 --> 00:34:40.686
data points.

00:34:41.025 --> 00:34:42.136
Since the ResearchKit graphs

00:34:42.136 --> 00:34:42.906
look really nice in the

00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:44.126
landscape mode, I'll quickly

00:34:44.126 --> 00:34:46.286
turn my phone, and let's look at

00:34:46.286 --> 00:34:46.696
the graphs.

00:34:47.505 --> 00:34:49.525
Here as we can see, we have all

00:34:49.525 --> 00:34:50.696
the tremor and dyskinesia

00:34:50.696 --> 00:34:51.775
symptom data points for a

00:34:51.775 --> 00:34:53.366
particular day starting from 7

00:34:53.366 --> 00:34:56.016
a.m. to 6 p.m. We can see tremor

00:34:56.016 --> 00:34:58.326
slight, mild, moderate, and

00:34:58.326 --> 00:34:58.656
strong.

00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:00.196
And also, dyskinesia likely.

00:35:01.366 --> 00:35:03.006
Perfect. With this, I would like

00:35:03.006 --> 00:35:04.416
to call Srinath back up on stage

00:35:04.856 --> 00:35:05.826
and continue with the session.

00:35:06.446 --> 00:35:06.716
Thank you.

00:35:07.516 --> 00:35:12.566
[ Applause ]

00:35:13.066 --> 00:35:14.326
>> Thanks for that great demo.

00:35:15.286 --> 00:35:17.366
So, now let's take a look at a

00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:18.856
quick recap of what we went over

00:35:18.856 --> 00:35:18.976
today.

00:35:22.046 --> 00:35:23.286
We started off by talking about

00:35:23.286 --> 00:35:24.446
updates that we have made to our

00:35:24.446 --> 00:35:26.476
community by expanding

00:35:26.476 --> 00:35:28.386
privileges and also updating our

00:35:28.386 --> 00:35:29.116
release schedule.

00:35:30.016 --> 00:35:31.666
We showcased the look and feel

00:35:31.666 --> 00:35:33.866
of ResearchKits new UI, and we

00:35:33.866 --> 00:35:35.466
also added some new Active Tasks

00:35:35.516 --> 00:35:37.016
focusing on three main areas of

00:35:37.016 --> 00:35:37.376
health.

00:35:37.816 --> 00:35:39.396
Hearing, speech and vision.

00:35:40.036 --> 00:35:41.526
Gabriel spoke to you about the

00:35:41.526 --> 00:35:43.186
new movement disorder API that's

00:35:43.186 --> 00:35:45.026
available on the Apple Watch

00:35:45.236 --> 00:35:46.296
from WatchOS 5.

00:35:47.456 --> 00:35:49.896
And now, we'll look to all of

00:35:49.896 --> 00:35:52.276
you as current or new members of

00:35:52.276 --> 00:35:54.016
the community to continue to

00:35:54.016 --> 00:35:55.316
engage with us and provide

00:35:55.316 --> 00:35:55.896
feedback.

00:35:56.706 --> 00:35:58.326
We also encourage you to take

00:35:58.326 --> 00:35:59.976
advantage of our new release

00:35:59.976 --> 00:36:01.936
schedule so that way you'll be

00:36:01.936 --> 00:36:03.336
able to leverage some of our

00:36:03.386 --> 00:36:05.156
in-house features like

00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:09.336
accessibility, localization and

00:36:09.336 --> 00:36:09.836
QA.

00:36:10.886 --> 00:36:12.976
And on that note, as we continue

00:36:12.976 --> 00:36:15.136
to expand on our library of

00:36:15.136 --> 00:36:17.166
Active Tasks, we look to all of

00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:19.266
our developers, researchers and

00:36:19.266 --> 00:36:21.226
health professionals to help us

00:36:21.276 --> 00:36:22.366
improve on these.

00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:24.106
These Active Tasks are just

00:36:24.106 --> 00:36:25.926
building blocks, which we hope

00:36:25.926 --> 00:36:28.226
you can utilize to create much

00:36:28.226 --> 00:36:30.066
bigger research studies, care

00:36:30.066 --> 00:36:31.916
plans and treatment mechanisms.

00:36:32.336 --> 00:36:34.706
And as you do, we encourage you

00:36:34.706 --> 00:36:35.956
to contribute back to

00:36:35.956 --> 00:36:38.146
ResearchKit, so we can continue

00:36:38.146 --> 00:36:40.396
to improve our foundation and

00:36:40.396 --> 00:36:42.066
expand on the breadth of Active

00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:43.676
Task that's available for

00:36:43.816 --> 00:36:45.626
everyone to use.

00:36:46.256 --> 00:36:47.866

our lab session today.

00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:02.856
Our teams will be down there and

00:37:02.856 --> 00:37:04.496
will be really excited to answer

00:37:04.496 --> 00:37:06.196
