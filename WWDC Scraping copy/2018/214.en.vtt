>> Hello, everyone, and welcome

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:28.756
to Building Voice with Siri

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:29.226
Shortcuts.

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:31.866
My name is Amit, and I'm here

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.386
today with my colleague Ayaka

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:33.826
Nonaka.

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:36.056
And we are so excited to be here

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:37.796
and talk to you about Shortcuts.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.316
And you all know, shortcuts

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:43.366
allow you to accelerate your

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.716
users to the things they value

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:46.896
the most in your apps.

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.586
What we are really excited about

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:52.636
is that your users can add these

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.176
shortcuts to Siri and perform

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:56.976
them with their voice wherever

00:00:56.976 --> 00:00:57.376
they are.

00:00:58.196 --> 00:01:00.536
So, it's paramount that we build

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:02.796
a great voice experience for all

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.366
of our users accessing them

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:04.946
through voice.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:06.956
And that's what we'll focus on

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:08.456
today.

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:10.756
So, let's get started.

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:13.486
First, we'll talk about how your

00:01:13.486 --> 00:01:15.726
users can add shortcuts to Siri

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.066
and how simple it is to write --

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.406
use it right away.

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.896
Then, we'll talk about how you

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:24.986
can provide downloads that can

00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:26.466
be spoken by Siri, through

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.396
custom responses.

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:30.456
Then Ayaka will go over some of

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:31.716
the best practices that you

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.706
should adopt to create great

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:35.836
voice and UI experiences for

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:36.576
your shortcuts.

00:01:37.336 --> 00:01:39.826
And finally, we'll go over how

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:41.826
you can bring the experience of

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:47.236
setting shortcuts to your apps.

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.986
So, before we dive into all the

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:52.186
exciting details of adopting

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:54.156
shortcuts and custom responses,

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:56.996
let's take a look at the

00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:58.916
experience of setting a shortcut

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:00.156
with Siri.

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.976
My teammates and I have been

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:06.776
working on this app called Soup

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:06.966
Chef.

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:09.076
It lets you order soup.

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:13.376
Now Soup Chef adopts all our new

00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:16.356
shortcut APIs, and every time a

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:18.836
user places an order, Soup Chef

00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:21.526
lets the system know by donating

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:24.016
a custom intent to Siri.

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:27.026
So, yesterday, I ordered some

00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:27.666
tomato soup.

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:29.066
And it was really great.

00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:32.396
So much so, that I would like to

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:33.116
order it again.

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.446
And wouldn't it be great if I

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:36.686
can just do that from Siri?

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:40.566
Well, now we can.

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:41.906
So, when we go to Siri's

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:44.236
Settings UI, you see that Siri's

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:46.586
already suggesting that donated

00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:48.496
intent to be created into a

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:48.956
shortcut.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.186
So, let's tap on it.

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:53.716
And we are presented with this

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.416
screen, where we can set up a

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:57.506
phrase that you can say to Siri

00:02:57.506 --> 00:02:58.536
and perform your shortcut.

00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:00.446
There are also a lot of details

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.956
on this screen from Soup Chef

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:04.266
that convey to me as a user what

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:05.806
this shortcut would exactly do.

00:03:06.596 --> 00:03:07.696
How to get these right, we'll

00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:08.996
talk about that in a little bit.

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.006
But for now, I would like to

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:12.696
associate a phrase with this

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:13.086
shortcut.

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:14.806
Something that is short.

00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:17.036
Something that's memorable and I

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:18.146
can say it again and again.

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:20.946
It's not always easy to come up

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:22.356
with that right in the moment,

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:24.916
so I figure that Soup Chef is

00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:27.666
suggesting I call it, Soup Time.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:28.136
I like that.

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:29.296
I'll take it.

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:33.406
Now, when I record the phrase, I

00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:36.916
have a shortcut to order soup

00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:37.646
with Siri.

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:39.136
Let's try it out.

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:42.446
Now, when I say to Siri, "Soup

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:45.626
Time," I'm asked to confirm

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:46.556
whether I would like to run the

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:49.296
intent, and when I say, "Yes,"

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:50.776
the order is placed.

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:52.346
And it's that easy.

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:56.446
Your users will set up shortcuts

00:03:56.446 --> 00:03:58.176
for things they do most often.

00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:00.526
And they can use these shortcuts

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:02.586
wherever they are, from their

00:04:02.686 --> 00:04:04.526
iOS devices, from their wrist

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:06.546
using the Apple Watch, in their

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.996
homes using the HomePod, as well

00:04:08.996 --> 00:04:10.906
as on the go with CarPlay.

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:13.606
So, we should pay a lot of

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:15.606
attention to the voice

00:04:15.606 --> 00:04:17.646
experience that they encounter.

00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:21.356
Towards that goal, let's talk

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:23.386
about custom responses.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:27.726
Shortcuts allow you to provide

00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:29.846
dialogues that can be spoken by

00:04:29.846 --> 00:04:31.626
Siri, and this gives you the

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.436
ability to provide relevant

00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:35.026
information, important

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:38.196
information, right with voice.

00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:40.416
Fundamentally, shortcuts are --

00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:42.596
custom responses are template

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:44.036
strings whose structure you

00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:45.356
define in the Intent Definition

00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:45.606
File.

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:49.166
And based on the type of

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:50.866
information you provide in your

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:53.056
responses, shortcuts can be one

00:04:53.056 --> 00:04:53.996
of four types.

00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:57.786
The first is a confirmation

00:04:57.786 --> 00:04:59.196
custom response.

00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:02.476
This gives you the opportunity

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:04.166
to provide critical information

00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:06.626
before your users commit to

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:07.546
running the shortcut.

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:12.166
Next, is a success response.

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:14.036
And it gives you a chance to

00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:16.146
provide an auxiliary relevant

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:17.826
information, after the shortcut

00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:19.806
has run, and the structure of a

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:22.146
success response consists of

00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:24.596
Siri letting the users know that

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:26.646
their order was successful, or

00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:28.046
their shortcut ran successfully,

00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:30.176
followed by any information that

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:32.066
you provide attributed to your

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:32.806
app.

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:36.316
The third type of custom

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:38.156
response is an informational

00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:38.686
response.

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:41.466
And we are really excited about

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:42.276
this.

00:05:42.496 --> 00:05:44.516
Informational response allows

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:46.086
you to provide information like

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:48.986
transit schedules or ski

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:52.606
forecast right within Siri, with

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:53.436
voice.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.076
This opens the door for a whole

00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:57.106
new category of apps which was

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:59.296
not possible before with Siri.

00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:03.686
And finally, when things do not

00:06:03.686 --> 00:06:06.406
work as expected, custom error

00:06:06.406 --> 00:06:07.936
responses give you the

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.866
opportunity to explain what went

00:06:09.866 --> 00:06:11.856
wrong instead of just saying,

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:13.886
"Something didn't work."

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:16.516
The structure consists of Siri

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:18.296
communicating to the users that

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:19.116
their intent did not

00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:21.116
successfully execute, followed

00:06:21.116 --> 00:06:23.026
by information from your app,

00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:24.756
and the interaction punctuated

00:06:24.756 --> 00:06:26.696
by Siri, advising users to

00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:30.916
continue in your apps.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:33.336
Now, that we understand what

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:37.186
custom responses are, let's take

00:06:37.186 --> 00:06:39.166
a look at how you would adopt

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.066
them in your apps.

00:06:42.796 --> 00:06:45.526
Custom responses work hand in

00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:47.466
hand with custom intents.

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:50.486
So, the first step is to define

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.636
an intent that models the use

00:06:52.636 --> 00:06:54.056
case you are trying to create a

00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:54.746
shortcut for.

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:58.256
For Soup Chef, we created an

00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.666
intent called Order Soup, and it

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:02.596
lets you, you guessed it, order

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:02.926
soup.

00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:08.316
Alongside the intent, you have

00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:09.756
to pick a category for your

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:09.986
intent.

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:12.266
And the category you pick

00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:14.746
influences how Siri speaks about

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:17.286
it or what you see across the OS

00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:18.246
like the order buttons.

00:07:19.076 --> 00:07:20.636
So, pick something that feels

00:07:20.636 --> 00:07:22.536
natural, that works well with

00:07:22.536 --> 00:07:24.846
your use case.

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:26.936
Once we have defined our custom

00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:29.166
intent, let's go over to the

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:31.056
Responses Tab.

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:32.706
And in the Responses Tab, you

00:07:32.706 --> 00:07:34.166
see that we already have a

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:36.226
success and failure response

00:07:36.226 --> 00:07:36.626
codes.

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:38.676
But these are just a generic

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:39.806
response codes which don't

00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:41.096
convey much more information

00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:42.506
besides the status of the

00:07:42.506 --> 00:07:42.996
operation.

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:45.906
What I would like to do, is let

00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:48.096
our users know how long it will

00:07:48.096 --> 00:07:50.336
be until their order is ready

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.446
and they can to the store and

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:51.806
pick it up.

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:54.476
So, what I want to do is define

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.006
a custom success response for

00:07:56.086 --> 00:07:56.216
that.

00:07:57.186 --> 00:08:00.036
Towards that goal, the next step

00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:05.436
is to declare the response

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:07.316
properties that you will use in

00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:08.566
your templates to provide

00:08:08.566 --> 00:08:11.116
information at run time.

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:12.476
So, if you go over to the

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:15.026
Properties Section, I'm going to

00:08:15.026 --> 00:08:16.896
add a Wait Time and a Soup

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:17.366
Property.

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:21.466
With that in place, the only

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:22.396
thing left to do in our

00:08:22.396 --> 00:08:24.146
definition of custom responses

00:08:25.206 --> 00:08:26.556
is to define the template.

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:28.966
The template is what is spoken

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:29.736
out by Siri.

00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:32.895
So, when we look at the template

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.446
section of our Intent Definition

00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:37.236
File, now I'm going to add my

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:38.135
success template.

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:40.506
Not just that.

00:08:41.316 --> 00:08:42.576
Our store is getting a little

00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:43.976
popular and we tend to run out

00:08:43.976 --> 00:08:44.826
of soup these days.

00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:47.096
So, it will be great if instead

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:48.566
of just throwing a random error,

00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:50.266
I can let the users know that

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:51.166
the soup is out of stock.

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:54.386
So, I will add another response

00:08:54.386 --> 00:08:55.946
code called, "Failure Out of

00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:57.916
Stock," with a template that

00:08:57.916 --> 00:08:59.416
communicates that the soup is

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:02.806
out of stock.

00:09:03.006 --> 00:09:05.376
With that, we have defined our

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:06.296
intent responses.

00:09:06.756 --> 00:09:08.526
And when you do that, XCode

00:09:08.526 --> 00:09:10.826
automatically cogenerates a

00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:12.886
custom response subclass.

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:15.006
This subclass has all the

00:09:15.006 --> 00:09:17.336
properties that you defined as

00:09:17.336 --> 00:09:19.066
well as custom constructors for

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:20.936
your templates, which take all

00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:22.256
the important properties that

00:09:22.256 --> 00:09:23.176
you need to construct that

00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:23.506
template.

00:09:27.116 --> 00:09:29.336
Now the last step that is left

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:31.576
to do, is to use these responses

00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:32.666
in our Intent Handler.

00:09:34.676 --> 00:09:36.586
Handling a custom intent

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:39.746
comprises of two steps: confirm

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:40.746
and handle.

00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:44.906
In confirmation, we are asked

00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:46.836
whether we are ready to handle

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.196
this intent at this time.

00:09:49.306 --> 00:09:51.526
So, we'll first find out whether

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:53.116
the soup the user has requested

00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:54.806
is in our menu.

00:09:56.286 --> 00:09:57.826
If it is, we'll let the system

00:09:57.826 --> 00:09:59.456
know that we are ready to place

00:09:59.456 --> 00:09:59.796
the order.

00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:02.936
But this is our chance to also

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.656
check that the soup is available

00:10:04.656 --> 00:10:05.516
right now, and that we can place

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:05.976
the order of that.

00:10:06.116 --> 00:10:08.766
So, let's do that.

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:11.196
First, I'll grab a reference to

00:10:11.196 --> 00:10:11.936
my menu item.

00:10:13.156 --> 00:10:15.036
Then check if it's available.

00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:17.626
And if it isn't, I'm going to

00:10:17.626 --> 00:10:19.406
call the Completion Handler with

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:21.246
our new custom Failure Out of

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.216
Stock Response Code.

00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:25.866
If everything looks great, we'll

00:10:26.296 --> 00:10:27.526
continue as before.

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:30.216
This is also our chance to

00:10:30.216 --> 00:10:32.696
provide custom response --

00:10:32.696 --> 00:10:34.176
custom confirmation response.

00:10:34.606 --> 00:10:36.026
Support for those will be coming

00:10:36.026 --> 00:10:37.176
in upcoming [inaudible].

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:40.176
Alright, that was confirmation.

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:43.596
Now, it's time to handle the

00:10:43.596 --> 00:10:43.966
intent.

00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:46.276
For us, that means to place the

00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:46.956
order for the soup.

00:10:47.726 --> 00:10:49.466
So, I'm going to build an order

00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:51.256
from all the information that is

00:10:51.296 --> 00:10:52.636
present on my intent.

00:10:53.946 --> 00:10:55.896
And then place the order with

00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:56.616
our Order Manager.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:58.846
And if it's successful, we'll

00:10:58.846 --> 00:11:00.516
let the system know, by calling

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:01.926
the Completion Handler with the

00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:04.046
Success Response Code.

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:06.486
However, since we defined the

00:11:06.546 --> 00:11:08.106
Custom Success Response

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:10.216
Template, this is our chance to

00:11:10.216 --> 00:11:11.416
provide the wait time.

00:11:12.516 --> 00:11:13.436
So, let's do just that.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:17.336
And with that, we have added

00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:19.276
support for two really useful

00:11:19.276 --> 00:11:21.796
custom responses to our custom

00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:22.196
intent.

00:11:22.326 --> 00:11:24.866
Let's see how it looks.

00:11:25.416 --> 00:11:28.976
So before, all we could let the

00:11:28.976 --> 00:11:30.726
users know was, "Your order was

00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:31.066
placed."

00:11:32.246 --> 00:11:35.466
But now, Siri can speak out that

00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:36.896
it will be about 10 minutes

00:11:37.406 --> 00:11:38.716
before they should come down to

00:11:38.716 --> 00:11:39.176
the store.

00:11:39.236 --> 00:11:40.086
And that's really helpful.

00:11:40.436 --> 00:11:43.866
The improvement to the usability

00:11:43.866 --> 00:11:45.656
is even more stark if you look

00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:46.476
at the error case.

00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:49.116
Before, "Sorry, there was a

00:11:49.116 --> 00:11:50.116
problem with the app."

00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:52.896
But now, we can let the users

00:11:52.896 --> 00:11:54.396
know that the soup is out of

00:11:54.396 --> 00:11:57.196
stock and then they can decide

00:11:57.196 --> 00:11:58.636
what they would like to do.

00:11:58.636 --> 00:12:00.086
Either, they can go into our app

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:01.786
and order something else or try

00:12:01.786 --> 00:12:02.516
again later.

00:12:05.896 --> 00:12:08.336
So, you saw that Siri and

00:12:08.336 --> 00:12:09.816
shortcuts allowed you to provide

00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:13.186
custom dialogues, but that's not

00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:13.606
all.

00:12:14.246 --> 00:12:16.436
As soup engineers, we work

00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:19.656
really hard to build superb

00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:21.446
experiences for our users.

00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:27.166
[ Applause ]

00:12:27.666 --> 00:12:30.886
And wouldn't it be great if we

00:12:30.886 --> 00:12:32.756
can bring those experiences from

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:34.616
our apps to our shortcuts

00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:36.286
wherever they are run?

00:12:36.536 --> 00:12:38.856
With Intents UI extensions, you

00:12:38.856 --> 00:12:41.536
can do just that.

00:12:41.536 --> 00:12:43.716
Intents UI extensions allow you

00:12:43.716 --> 00:12:46.166
to provide custom UI, familiar

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.676
UI from your apps, to shortcuts.

00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:50.296
And it is displayed all across

00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:52.316
the OS, on Lock Screen, in

00:12:52.316 --> 00:12:54.286
Search , and of course, within

00:12:54.286 --> 00:12:54.646
Siri.

00:12:55.996 --> 00:12:57.986
To learn more about how you can

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.926
build great, Intents UI

00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:01.796
extensions, please take a look

00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:04.066
at the WWDC 2017 session,

00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:05.686
"What's New in SiriKit?"

00:13:06.596 --> 00:13:09.326
So, we built a custom Intents UI

00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:11.346
extension for Soup Chef app.

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:13.696
And let's see how that looks.

00:13:13.786 --> 00:13:15.506
Again, this is where we started

00:13:15.506 --> 00:13:15.846
out with.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.816
But with a custom Intents UI

00:13:18.816 --> 00:13:21.376
Extension, now I'm able to show

00:13:21.376 --> 00:13:23.836
the users the entire invoice and

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.916
convince that we got all the

00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:27.476
details right, that it will be

00:13:27.476 --> 00:13:29.216
2.95, before they place the

00:13:29.216 --> 00:13:30.446
order, which is incredibly

00:13:30.446 --> 00:13:30.826
helpful.

00:13:32.036 --> 00:13:33.386
Once they place the order,

00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:34.986
instead of just saying, "It's

00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:37.846
done," we can now show them the

00:13:37.876 --> 00:13:40.276
receipt and reaffirm that we got

00:13:40.276 --> 00:13:41.706
everything right and it will be

00:13:41.706 --> 00:13:42.836
ten minutes before they should

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:45.656
come down there.

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:49.976
Alright, so you saw how easy it

00:13:49.976 --> 00:13:52.286
is to add support for Custom UI

00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:53.806
and Custom Responses.

00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.056
Now, let's take a look at how we

00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:57.756
did that in Soup Chef.

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:16.096
Alright, what you see here is

00:14:16.096 --> 00:14:16.976
our app Soup Chef.

00:14:17.496 --> 00:14:20.356
If we go to the Intents

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:22.216
Definition File, you can see

00:14:22.216 --> 00:14:24.366
that we have a custom order soup

00:14:24.366 --> 00:14:25.166
intent defined.

00:14:26.046 --> 00:14:28.446
This intent is off-category

00:14:28.686 --> 00:14:29.036
order.

00:14:29.576 --> 00:14:32.386
Now, let's look at the response

00:14:32.386 --> 00:14:33.776
section that is associated with

00:14:33.776 --> 00:14:34.336
my intent.

00:14:35.226 --> 00:14:37.266
Here, I have properties and

00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:38.006
template sections.

00:14:38.556 --> 00:14:40.146
What I would like to do is add

00:14:40.376 --> 00:14:42.876
the custom success response that

00:14:42.876 --> 00:14:44.036
we just talked about.

00:14:44.896 --> 00:14:46.386
So, let's start by adding the

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.326
wait time property.

00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:50.206
I'll click the Plus button, and

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:52.176
name my property Wait Time.

00:14:52.786 --> 00:14:53.896
I'll leave it of the Type

00:14:53.896 --> 00:14:56.046
String, so I can format the date

00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:57.816
however I see fit before

00:14:57.816 --> 00:14:59.176
providing it into the dialogue.

00:15:00.676 --> 00:15:02.596
To reaffirm which soup the user

00:15:02.596 --> 00:15:04.516
ordered, I'm also going to add

00:15:05.056 --> 00:15:05.706
the soup property.

00:15:06.466 --> 00:15:08.566
Now, soup is a custom object in

00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:09.166
our app.

00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:10.766
So, I'm going to select the type

00:15:11.256 --> 00:15:11.626
"Custom."

00:15:12.136 --> 00:15:15.856
Now, let's take a look at the

00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:16.606
response codes.

00:15:17.126 --> 00:15:18.886
We have a failure and a success

00:15:18.916 --> 00:15:19.126
code.

00:15:20.556 --> 00:15:22.006
Here, I'm going to define the

00:15:22.006 --> 00:15:23.906
template for our Wait Time

00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:25.186
Response Template.

00:15:25.186 --> 00:15:27.866
So, let's do that.

00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:34.646
"Your Soup Will Be Ready in Wait

00:15:35.316 --> 00:15:35.476
Time."

00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:39.356
I would also like to add our Out

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:40.466
of Stock Error Code.

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:42.846
For that, I'll click the Plus

00:15:42.846 --> 00:15:44.936
Button and create another

00:15:44.936 --> 00:15:45.636
response code.

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:49.036
I'll call it "Failure, Out of

00:15:49.826 --> 00:15:50.436
Stock."

00:15:52.346 --> 00:15:53.716
Since this is an error code,

00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:55.836
I'll uncheck the Success

00:15:56.026 --> 00:15:56.666
checkbox.

00:15:57.726 --> 00:15:59.766
And now, finally, let's define

00:15:59.766 --> 00:16:01.156
the template for it.

00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:06.866
"Sorry, Soup is Out of Stock."

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:11.666
And with that, we have defined

00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:12.876
our custom responses.

00:16:13.376 --> 00:16:14.796
Now, let's head over to the

00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:15.976
Intent Handler file.

00:16:24.656 --> 00:16:27.956
Alright, here we are.

00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:30.686
As you see here, we have a

00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:32.556
Confirm and a Handle Method.

00:16:33.136 --> 00:16:34.356
Let's look at Confirm first.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.776
We find out which soup the user

00:16:36.776 --> 00:16:39.926
has requested, and then check

00:16:39.926 --> 00:16:41.276
with our menu manager whether

00:16:41.276 --> 00:16:42.896
that soup exists on our menu.

00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:44.946
If it does, we return the

00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:45.866
response code "Ready."

00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:48.786
What I would like to do here, is

00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:50.926
to check whether that soup item

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:53.016
is available currently to order.

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:55.516
So first, let's grab reference

00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:57.206
to the menu item from our menu

00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:57.566
manager.

00:16:59.116 --> 00:17:00.986
Then, I'm going to check if it's

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:01.466
available.

00:17:06.656 --> 00:17:09.086
If it isn't, I'm going to call

00:17:09.086 --> 00:17:10.646
the Completion Handler with our

00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:12.076
new Failure, Out of Stock Error.

00:17:18.096 --> 00:17:20.175
And provided the soup object

00:17:20.175 --> 00:17:21.126
that the user requested.

00:17:25.215 --> 00:17:27.526
Alright, so we have provided the

00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:29.006
custom error code here in

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:29.546
completion.

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:31.206
Let's take a look at Handle.

00:17:32.416 --> 00:17:34.926
Handling this intent means

00:17:34.926 --> 00:17:35.736
ordering our soup.

00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:38.146
So first, we build the Order

00:17:38.146 --> 00:17:39.586
Object from Intent.

00:17:41.006 --> 00:17:42.976
Then we place the order, using

00:17:42.976 --> 00:17:43.736
our order manager.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:47.166
And finally, let the system know

00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:48.626
that the order was successful.

00:17:49.556 --> 00:17:50.976
But this is our chance to

00:17:50.976 --> 00:17:52.766
provide users with more helpful

00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:54.206
information like wait time.

00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:55.776
So, let's call the Completion

00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:57.316
Handler with our New Custom

00:17:57.316 --> 00:17:58.466
Response Code.

00:18:03.556 --> 00:18:05.786
This response template takes the

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:07.536
soup and wait time strengths.

00:18:08.496 --> 00:18:10.946
So, I'll provide that from my

00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:11.356
intent.

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:20.776
And we can grab the wait time

00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:21.546
from our order.

00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:26.346
And that's it.

00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:29.886
So, you saw how easy it is to

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:31.996
add support for custom responses

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:34.186
to our custom intent.

00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:37.976
You start by defining a custom

00:18:37.976 --> 00:18:39.986
intent that works for your use

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:40.336
case.

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.846
You follow it up by defining

00:18:43.166 --> 00:18:45.386
custom responses that you want

00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:46.166
Siri to speak out.

00:18:46.496 --> 00:18:48.516
And finally, you provide them in

00:18:48.516 --> 00:18:49.286
your Intent Handler.

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:52.416
Now, I placed that order for

00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:54.096
that soup earlier, so I better

00:18:54.096 --> 00:18:55.146
head back and get it.

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:59.016
So, please welcome Ayaka Nonaka,

00:18:59.016 --> 00:19:01.086
who will talk to you about some

00:19:01.086 --> 00:19:02.656
of the best practices that you

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:04.646
should adopt in order to create

00:19:04.646 --> 00:19:06.616
great voice and UI experiences

00:19:06.786 --> 00:19:07.386
in your apps.

00:19:07.716 --> 00:19:09.046
Thank you and welcome Ayaka.

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:14.396
[ Applause ]

00:19:14.896 --> 00:19:15.416
>> Thanks so much.

00:19:16.516 --> 00:19:19.636
[ Applause ]

00:19:20.136 --> 00:19:20.726
Hi, everyone.

00:19:21.796 --> 00:19:23.166
So, as Amit just showed you,

00:19:23.316 --> 00:19:24.926
it's super easy to get started

00:19:24.926 --> 00:19:25.766
with Siri Shortcuts.

00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:28.006
Once a shortcut is donated, it

00:19:28.006 --> 00:19:29.636
is available for the system to

00:19:29.636 --> 00:19:31.196
suggest as a shortcut to use

00:19:31.196 --> 00:19:32.576
with Siri straight out of the

00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:32.886
box.

00:19:32.986 --> 00:19:35.256
I'm going to be showing you some

00:19:35.256 --> 00:19:37.176
more new shortcuts APIs, and the

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.576
best practices to help bring the

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:39.906
greatest experience to our

00:19:39.906 --> 00:19:40.306
users.

00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:41.756
And I know you care about this

00:19:41.756 --> 00:19:43.216
because your users are going to

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:44.796
notice these small details and

00:19:44.796 --> 00:19:46.096
the large amount of care that

00:19:46.096 --> 00:19:47.806
you put into your apps.

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:49.446
If you saw the first session,

00:19:49.696 --> 00:19:50.676
"Introduction to Siri

00:19:50.676 --> 00:19:51.996
Shortcuts," you learned that

00:19:51.996 --> 00:19:53.266
there are two ways to donate

00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:53.636
shortcuts.

00:19:54.406 --> 00:19:55.486
The first way is through NS User

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:56.396
Activity.

00:19:57.336 --> 00:19:58.916
User Activities are great if you

00:19:58.916 --> 00:20:00.406
want to do a basic integration,

00:20:00.696 --> 00:20:02.166
where you just want to open the

00:20:02.196 --> 00:20:03.176
app and show your user a

00:20:03.176 --> 00:20:04.306
particular piece of content.

00:20:04.306 --> 00:20:06.596
And the second way is through

00:20:06.596 --> 00:20:07.006
Intents.

00:20:07.926 --> 00:20:09.346
Intents are great if you want to

00:20:09.346 --> 00:20:10.776
do a deeper integration where

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.656
you can run things in the

00:20:11.656 --> 00:20:13.526
background and inline within the

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:15.016
Siri experience, so you don't

00:20:15.016 --> 00:20:16.596
have to context with your users

00:20:16.886 --> 00:20:17.976
out of that to get things done.

00:20:18.136 --> 00:20:21.816
And for both NS User Activities

00:20:21.816 --> 00:20:23.426
and Intents, there are several

00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:24.226
parameters that we can

00:20:24.226 --> 00:20:24.676
configure.

00:20:25.886 --> 00:20:27.296
The first one is the title.

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:29.756
So, in this case, Order Clam

00:20:29.756 --> 00:20:31.636
Chowder, with the subtitle

00:20:31.636 --> 00:20:33.386
underneath it and image next to

00:20:33.386 --> 00:20:35.656
it, and finally, a suggested

00:20:35.716 --> 00:20:37.126
invocation phrase which you'll

00:20:37.126 --> 00:20:37.796
get to later.

00:20:39.376 --> 00:20:40.276
For each of these, we're going

00:20:40.276 --> 00:20:41.736
to go over how best to configure

00:20:41.736 --> 00:20:41.936
them.

00:20:42.506 --> 00:20:43.686
So, let's get started with the

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:44.786
title and subtitle.

00:20:45.426 --> 00:20:47.496
So, when you're thinking about

00:20:47.576 --> 00:20:49.516
titles and subtitles, there are

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:50.626
two high-level things that you

00:20:50.626 --> 00:20:51.296
should keep in mind.

00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:53.646
First, the title should

00:20:53.646 --> 00:20:55.066
represent what happens when the

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:56.376
user runs the shortcut.

00:20:56.786 --> 00:20:57.826
Your user is going to want to

00:20:57.826 --> 00:20:59.526
know exactly what happens before

00:20:59.526 --> 00:21:00.696
they run the shortcut or add

00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:02.166
that shortcut to use with Siri.

00:21:02.236 --> 00:21:05.106
And secondly, the subtitles will

00:21:05.106 --> 00:21:06.536
provide more information, but

00:21:06.536 --> 00:21:07.426
only if you need it.

00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:10.036
So, let's dive into a little bit

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:12.306
more of the details.

00:21:12.436 --> 00:21:14.136
The first easy thing to do is

00:21:14.136 --> 00:21:14.956
see a sentence case.

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:16.626
This is to make sure that we

00:21:16.816 --> 00:21:18.486
provide a consistent experience

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.876
across all different apps and

00:21:19.876 --> 00:21:20.586
their shortcuts.

00:21:21.356 --> 00:21:24.266
Next, it's important to keep the

00:21:24.266 --> 00:21:24.996
title concise.

00:21:25.456 --> 00:21:26.716
This is because we're dealing

00:21:26.716 --> 00:21:27.986
with potentially a limited

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:28.856
amount of [inaudible].

00:21:28.916 --> 00:21:31.156
And you can do this by dropping

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.806
articles like "a" and "an" if

00:21:32.806 --> 00:21:34.606
your language allows for it.

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:37.336
Next, it's super important to

00:21:37.336 --> 00:21:38.646
include critical information.

00:21:38.906 --> 00:21:39.956
For example, if you have a

00:21:39.956 --> 00:21:41.816
payments app that lets you send

00:21:41.816 --> 00:21:43.186
money to your friends and you

00:21:43.186 --> 00:21:44.266
have a shortcut for that, it's

00:21:44.266 --> 00:21:45.886
important to put the dollar

00:21:45.886 --> 00:21:47.276
amount or your currency amount

00:21:47.276 --> 00:21:47.566
in that.

00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:50.086
Probably in the title in this

00:21:51.516 --> 00:21:51.626
case.

00:21:51.846 --> 00:21:53.096
Next, if we're working with

00:21:53.096 --> 00:21:54.306
Intents, it's important to

00:21:54.306 --> 00:21:55.256
include a verb.

00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:56.276
And if you're working with

00:21:56.276 --> 00:21:57.496
English, we should put that at

00:21:57.496 --> 00:21:58.626
the beginning and prepend the

00:21:58.626 --> 00:21:59.766
verb to your phrase.

00:21:59.906 --> 00:22:03.076
And last but not least, to make

00:22:03.076 --> 00:22:03.906
sure that we provide the

00:22:03.966 --> 00:22:05.316
shortcuts experience to everyone

00:22:05.316 --> 00:22:06.856
around the world, it's very

00:22:06.856 --> 00:22:07.816
important to localize.

00:22:08.486 --> 00:22:10.706
So, not let's take a look at

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:11.526
some things that we should

00:22:11.526 --> 00:22:11.916
avoid.

00:22:12.796 --> 00:22:13.706
So, the first thing that we

00:22:13.706 --> 00:22:14.976
don't need to include, is the

00:22:14.976 --> 00:22:15.576
name of your app.

00:22:16.316 --> 00:22:18.076
This is because our RUI already

00:22:18.076 --> 00:22:19.246
attributes the name of your app,

00:22:19.246 --> 00:22:20.466
and by not including this, you

00:22:20.466 --> 00:22:21.516
can save even more space.

00:22:22.126 --> 00:22:25.226
And second, we don't need to put

00:22:25.226 --> 00:22:26.496
duplicate information in the

00:22:26.496 --> 00:22:27.996
title and subtitle for similar

00:22:27.996 --> 00:22:29.656
reasons to save space and leave

00:22:29.656 --> 00:22:30.916
room for critical information.

00:22:31.456 --> 00:22:34.636
And lastly, we don't want to use

00:22:34.636 --> 00:22:36.056
quotation marks unless you're

00:22:36.056 --> 00:22:37.156
actually quoting something

00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:38.536
that's going to be used verbatim

00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:39.176
in the shortcut.

00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:40.716
For example, if you have a

00:22:40.896 --> 00:22:42.016
shortcut to send a message, you

00:22:42.016 --> 00:22:43.096
can put the content of the

00:22:43.096 --> 00:22:45.146
message in the quotation marks.

00:22:45.216 --> 00:22:48.596
So, let's take a look at an

00:22:48.596 --> 00:22:49.106
example.

00:22:49.706 --> 00:22:53.446
This example says, "A clam

00:22:53.446 --> 00:22:54.476
chowder from Soup Chef.

00:22:54.896 --> 00:22:56.306
The best way to get soup, Soup

00:22:56.306 --> 00:22:56.676
Chef."

00:22:57.736 --> 00:22:59.346
And just based on what we

00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:00.476
learned about, I think we can

00:23:00.476 --> 00:23:02.076
all agree that this is not a

00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:02.806
good example.

00:23:03.356 --> 00:23:04.346
So, let's try to make it better.

00:23:05.146 --> 00:23:06.706
So, the first easy thing that we

00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:08.526
can do is to drop the "From Soup

00:23:08.526 --> 00:23:10.146
Chef," because as you see, Soup

00:23:10.146 --> 00:23:11.566
Chef is already attributed in

00:23:11.566 --> 00:23:11.876
this UI.

00:23:12.686 --> 00:23:15.676
So, now we have "A Clam

00:23:15.676 --> 00:23:16.016
Chowder."

00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:18.176
But when I'm looking at this,

00:23:18.346 --> 00:23:19.526
I'm not sure what's going to

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:20.836
happen when I run the shortcut.

00:23:20.836 --> 00:23:23.346
Am I ordering the soup or just

00:23:23.346 --> 00:23:23.996
looking at it?

00:23:24.286 --> 00:23:24.676
Who knows?

00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:26.466
So, let's fix that by adding a

00:23:26.466 --> 00:23:26.816
verb.

00:23:27.466 --> 00:23:28.376
And while I'm doing that, I'm

00:23:28.376 --> 00:23:30.076
also going to drop the article

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:34.526
"a" to save some space.

00:23:34.726 --> 00:23:36.066
So now I have "Order Clam

00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:36.496
Chowder."

00:23:37.746 --> 00:23:38.916
So, when I'm looking at this,

00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:40.586
I'm thinking, "I want to order a

00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:42.176
Clam Chowder, not a Clam

00:23:42.256 --> 00:23:43.666
Chowder, which doesn't sound

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:44.926
very delicious and we're trying

00:23:44.926 --> 00:23:46.806
to sell soup here, so that's

00:23:46.806 --> 00:23:47.996
really not ideal.

00:23:48.746 --> 00:23:51.316
But the good thing is, we can

00:23:51.366 --> 00:23:52.886
fix this really easily by simply

00:23:52.886 --> 00:23:54.206
dropping the quotation marks.

00:23:55.466 --> 00:23:56.586
And now we have, "Order Clam

00:23:56.586 --> 00:23:56.976
Chowder."

00:23:56.976 --> 00:23:58.316
And I think at this point, our

00:23:58.466 --> 00:23:59.606
title's looking pretty good.

00:24:00.196 --> 00:24:00.996
But let's take a look at the

00:24:00.996 --> 00:24:01.536
subtitle.

00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:04.136
The subtitle says, "The best way

00:24:04.136 --> 00:24:04.756
to get soup."

00:24:05.516 --> 00:24:07.546
But that's basically Soup Chef's

00:24:07.576 --> 00:24:07.936
tag line.

00:24:07.936 --> 00:24:09.506
I already know that Soup Chef is

00:24:09.506 --> 00:24:10.516
the best way to get my soup.

00:24:10.846 --> 00:24:12.336
And it's not adding any extra

00:24:12.336 --> 00:24:13.816
information that is specific to

00:24:13.816 --> 00:24:14.316
the shortcut.

00:24:15.236 --> 00:24:18.086
And, so that's already not good,

00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:20.816
but a more critically bad thing

00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:23.696
is that Soup Chef recently

00:24:23.696 --> 00:24:25.096
started offering delivery

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:26.606
service, and I don't know where

00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:27.656
I'm getting my soup delivered

00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:27.886
to.

00:24:28.096 --> 00:24:29.326
Am I getting it to my home, my

00:24:29.326 --> 00:24:30.626
office, someone else's office,

00:24:30.956 --> 00:24:31.456
no idea.

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:33.346
So, let's fix that by adding a

00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:34.326
delivery location.

00:24:35.736 --> 00:24:37.216
So, now I have "Order Clam

00:24:37.256 --> 00:24:39.136
Chowder to 1 Apple Park Way."

00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:41.036
And now I know exactly what

00:24:41.036 --> 00:24:42.776
happens when I run the shortcut.

00:24:43.216 --> 00:24:43.936
So, that is great.

00:24:44.586 --> 00:24:47.626
And in the Settings UI, it might

00:24:47.626 --> 00:24:48.466
look something like this.

00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:51.336
And this is looking pretty good.

00:24:51.336 --> 00:24:52.606
But I think we can do a little

00:24:52.606 --> 00:24:53.036
bit better.

00:24:53.846 --> 00:24:55.396
So, as you can see, the Soup

00:24:55.396 --> 00:24:57.216
Chef app icon is used for both

00:24:57.216 --> 00:24:58.586
the Clam Chowder and Tomato Soup

00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.446
cases, but wouldn't it be great

00:25:00.446 --> 00:25:01.986
if we can show an image of a

00:25:01.986 --> 00:25:02.996
clam chowder for the clam

00:25:02.996 --> 00:25:04.306
chowder case and an image for

00:25:04.306 --> 00:25:05.506
the tomato soup for the tomato

00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:05.916
soup case?

00:25:06.506 --> 00:25:08.676
Sort of like this.

00:25:08.896 --> 00:25:10.506
And for this, we provide two

00:25:10.506 --> 00:25:10.866
APIs.

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:12.336
One for User Activities and

00:25:12.336 --> 00:25:13.286
another for Intents.

00:25:13.406 --> 00:25:15.806
So, let's take a look.

00:25:16.006 --> 00:25:17.916
So, to set some context, the

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.536
user has just viewed one of

00:25:19.536 --> 00:25:21.626
their past soup orders and we

00:25:21.626 --> 00:25:22.756
want to donate it, so we can

00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:24.626
associate it -- we can associate

00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:25.546
that with a shortcut.

00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:27.606
So, the first thing that we want

00:25:27.606 --> 00:25:29.716
to do is create a CS Searchable

00:25:29.926 --> 00:25:31.546
Item Attribute Set which by the

00:25:31.546 --> 00:25:32.646
way is the same thing that you

00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:33.526
want to use if you want to

00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:35.166
provide a subtitle to your user

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:36.566
activity, but in this case, I

00:25:36.566 --> 00:25:37.786
want to set an image

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:38.046
[inaudible].

00:25:38.046 --> 00:25:39.766
First, make an image with

00:25:39.766 --> 00:25:40.526
chowder.

00:25:41.086 --> 00:25:43.076
Get the PNG data out of it and

00:25:43.216 --> 00:25:44.426
set it as the thumbnail data

00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:45.606
property on my Attributes.

00:25:46.236 --> 00:25:47.486
And next, I'm going to take

00:25:47.486 --> 00:25:48.846
those attributes, set it as the

00:25:48.846 --> 00:25:50.226
Content Attribute Set on the

00:25:50.226 --> 00:25:51.876
User Activity, and finally I'm

00:25:51.876 --> 00:25:52.826
going to donate the User

00:25:52.826 --> 00:25:54.186
Activity by setting it as the

00:25:54.186 --> 00:25:55.786
User Activity property on my

00:25:55.786 --> 00:25:56.346
view controller.

00:25:56.766 --> 00:25:59.786
So, let's take a look at how it

00:25:59.786 --> 00:26:00.586
works during Intents.

00:26:01.556 --> 00:26:02.936
For Intents, I'm actually able

00:26:02.936 --> 00:26:04.366
to set multiple images.

00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:06.256
One for each parameter that is

00:26:06.286 --> 00:26:07.166
defined as an intent.

00:26:08.046 --> 00:26:10.386
So, I'm going to set an image of

00:26:10.386 --> 00:26:11.556
a chowder for the parameter

00:26:11.556 --> 00:26:13.506
named "Soup," and an image of an

00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:14.916
office for the parameter named

00:26:14.916 --> 00:26:15.816
"Delivery Location."

00:26:16.236 --> 00:26:17.496
And once I have that, I'm going

00:26:17.496 --> 00:26:18.856
to create an IN Interaction out

00:26:18.856 --> 00:26:20.726
of it and donate it.

00:26:21.396 --> 00:26:22.706
So, at this point, you might be

00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:24.676
wondering, "If I have a shortcut

00:26:24.676 --> 00:26:25.876
that is based on a shortcut type

00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:27.526
that contains multiple

00:26:27.526 --> 00:26:29.406
parameters that have images, how

00:26:29.406 --> 00:26:31.026
do I know which image gets

00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:31.396
used?"

00:26:31.886 --> 00:26:34.066
For that, we're going to go to

00:26:34.066 --> 00:26:35.416
our Intent Definition File.

00:26:35.976 --> 00:26:38.036
And in particular, the

00:26:38.036 --> 00:26:38.966
Parameters Section.

00:26:39.856 --> 00:26:40.906
So, in the Parameters Section,

00:26:40.906 --> 00:26:42.186
we want to make sure that these

00:26:42.186 --> 00:26:43.546
parameters, at least the ones

00:26:43.546 --> 00:26:44.906
with images are ordered from

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:47.146
least specific to most specific.

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:48.876
So, in my case, I care more

00:26:48.876 --> 00:26:50.396
about the soup image than the

00:26:50.396 --> 00:26:51.926
delivery location.

00:26:51.926 --> 00:26:52.646
So, I'm going to make sure the

00:26:52.646 --> 00:26:54.266
soup comes below delivery

00:26:54.266 --> 00:26:54.806
location.

00:26:55.326 --> 00:26:57.886
And once I do that, my list of

00:26:57.886 --> 00:26:59.176
shortcuts might look like this.

00:27:00.246 --> 00:27:01.496
So, in the first two cases,

00:27:01.756 --> 00:27:03.516
where the shortcut type contains

00:27:03.516 --> 00:27:05.106
both a soup and a delivery

00:27:05.106 --> 00:27:07.176
location, I see an image of a

00:27:07.216 --> 00:27:08.536
soup, but in the last case,

00:27:08.656 --> 00:27:10.286
where the shortcut type just

00:27:10.286 --> 00:27:12.136
contains a delivery location, I

00:27:12.176 --> 00:27:13.966
just see the image of a delivery

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:14.526
location.

00:27:15.716 --> 00:27:16.906
Now, these shortcuts are looking

00:27:16.946 --> 00:27:18.096
so great, that I just want to

00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:19.766
tap on one and add it to Siri,

00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:20.386
so I can use it.

00:27:21.456 --> 00:27:23.306
And our users are super excited

00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:24.566
about this new feature too, and

00:27:24.566 --> 00:27:26.556
they're all so eager to start

00:27:26.556 --> 00:27:27.856
setting up new shortcuts to use

00:27:27.856 --> 00:27:28.706
with Siri.

00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:30.366
But as more users starting using

00:27:30.366 --> 00:27:31.666
this feature, we noticed

00:27:31.666 --> 00:27:31.966
something.

00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:32.846
We noticed a problem.

00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:35.606
When they got to the recording

00:27:35.676 --> 00:27:36.796
screen, they had no idea what to

00:27:36.796 --> 00:27:37.096
say.

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:39.206
They could use some creative

00:27:39.206 --> 00:27:41.356
inspiration in choosing a great

00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:42.606
suggested shortcut phrase.

00:27:43.376 --> 00:27:45.496
And as Soup Chef app developers

00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:47.336
and general soup enthusiasts, we

00:27:47.336 --> 00:27:48.576
think we have some pretty great

00:27:48.576 --> 00:27:50.406
ideas on what would make a great

00:27:50.436 --> 00:27:51.226
soup ordering phrase.

00:27:51.226 --> 00:27:52.206
You know, something like

00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:54.226
"Tomato, Tomato" or "Chowder

00:27:54.226 --> 00:27:54.696
Time."

00:27:55.686 --> 00:27:57.846
So, would it be great if we can

00:27:57.846 --> 00:27:59.476
show a suggestion like this?

00:28:00.016 --> 00:28:01.336
"Hey user, you can say something

00:28:01.336 --> 00:28:02.546
like, 'Chowder Time.'"

00:28:03.186 --> 00:28:04.746
And of course, we have an API

00:28:04.746 --> 00:28:05.846
for this, so let's take a look.

00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:08.066
So, building on a previous

00:28:08.066 --> 00:28:09.596
example, all we have to do is

00:28:09.626 --> 00:28:10.586
add one line.

00:28:11.336 --> 00:28:12.766
So, User Activity has a property

00:28:12.766 --> 00:28:14.246
called Suggested Indication

00:28:14.246 --> 00:28:14.516
Phrase.

00:28:14.516 --> 00:28:15.666
And I'm going to set that to

00:28:15.736 --> 00:28:16.256
Chowder Time.

00:28:17.206 --> 00:28:18.576
And for Intents, it's the exact

00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:18.996
same thing.

00:28:19.786 --> 00:28:21.326
Intents also have a property

00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:22.886
called Suggested Indication

00:28:22.886 --> 00:28:24.316
Phrase which I'll also set to

00:28:24.346 --> 00:28:24.946
"Chowder Time."

00:28:25.836 --> 00:28:27.346
So, the API for this as you can

00:28:27.346 --> 00:28:28.436
see, is super simple.

00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:30.356
But what actually makes a good

00:28:30.356 --> 00:28:31.686
suggested invocation phrase?

00:28:34.356 --> 00:28:35.896
So, the most important thing to

00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:37.596
keep in mind is that the

00:28:37.656 --> 00:28:39.246
suggested invocation phrase is

00:28:39.246 --> 00:28:40.796
both short and memorable.

00:28:41.106 --> 00:28:42.436
You have to remember that your

00:28:42.436 --> 00:28:43.326
users are going to have to say

00:28:43.326 --> 00:28:45.116
this phrase exactly every,

00:28:45.116 --> 00:28:45.966
single time they run their

00:28:45.966 --> 00:28:46.436
shortcut.

00:28:46.806 --> 00:28:47.736
So, ideally it would be

00:28:47.776 --> 00:28:48.876
somewhere between two to three

00:28:48.876 --> 00:28:49.330
words.

00:28:51.526 --> 00:28:53.016
Next, it's important to not

00:28:53.016 --> 00:28:54.846
include the phrase, "Hey Siri,"

00:28:54.846 --> 00:28:56.896
in your shortcut phrase, because

00:28:57.006 --> 00:28:58.736
if your user accidentally sets

00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:00.286
their shortcut phrase as "Hey,

00:29:00.286 --> 00:29:01.586
Siri, Chowder Time," when they

00:29:01.586 --> 00:29:02.806
actually run the shortcut, they

00:29:02.806 --> 00:29:04.166
might have to say, "Hey Siri,

00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:06.026
Hey Siri, Chowder Time," and no

00:29:06.026 --> 00:29:09.856
one wants to do that.

00:29:09.976 --> 00:29:11.206
So, let's take a look at some

00:29:11.206 --> 00:29:11.726
examples.

00:29:12.286 --> 00:29:15.996
This example says, "Hey, Siri,

00:29:15.996 --> 00:29:17.476
please place an order, thank

00:29:17.476 --> 00:29:17.646
you."

00:29:18.226 --> 00:29:20.936
Although this example is polite,

00:29:21.046 --> 00:29:22.976
it's not a good example.

00:29:23.806 --> 00:29:25.256
First, it contains, "Hey, Siri,"

00:29:25.256 --> 00:29:27.126
which is pretty obvious, but

00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:28.356
it's a little bit too long for

00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:29.656
me to want to repeat it every,

00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:30.796
single time I want to run the

00:29:30.856 --> 00:29:31.656
shortcut.

00:29:31.656 --> 00:29:32.226
So, that's out.

00:29:33.366 --> 00:29:34.316
What about this example?

00:29:35.016 --> 00:29:36.766
This example says, "Order a clam

00:29:36.766 --> 00:29:38.146
chowder to my office."

00:29:38.726 --> 00:29:40.726
Seems pretty reasonable, but

00:29:40.726 --> 00:29:42.296
this is still not good because

00:29:42.856 --> 00:29:43.836
it's still too long.

00:29:43.836 --> 00:29:44.916
Like, it's not short and

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:45.456
memorable.

00:29:45.546 --> 00:29:47.176
And I don't think I can or want

00:29:47.176 --> 00:29:48.486
to remember to say this phrase

00:29:48.696 --> 00:29:50.276
every, single time I want clam

00:29:50.276 --> 00:29:51.666
chowder delivered to my office.

00:29:53.216 --> 00:29:54.386
What about this example?

00:29:55.076 --> 00:29:56.486
This simply says, "Chowder

00:29:56.486 --> 00:29:56.776
Time."

00:29:57.206 --> 00:29:59.366
This is both short and memorable

00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.856
and doesn't include the phrase,

00:30:00.936 --> 00:30:01.696
"Hey, Siri."

00:30:02.056 --> 00:30:03.796
So, this passes all of our tests

00:30:03.796 --> 00:30:04.796
and that's awesome.

00:30:06.026 --> 00:30:07.366
But we can't [inaudible] in

00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:10.416
order to provide a truly great

00:30:10.706 --> 00:30:12.116
shortcuts experience to your

00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:13.996
users, around the world, you

00:30:13.996 --> 00:30:14.756
have to make sure it's

00:30:14.756 --> 00:30:15.306
localized.

00:30:15.666 --> 00:30:16.906
For example, I speak both

00:30:16.906 --> 00:30:18.216
English and Japanese, and it

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:19.646
would be great if I can suggest

00:30:20.256 --> 00:30:21.646
a Use Shortcuts in Japanese sort

00:30:21.646 --> 00:30:21.976
of like this.

00:30:22.056 --> 00:30:24.786
So, instead of "Chowder Time," I

00:30:24.786 --> 00:30:26.096
can be like [foreign language

00:30:26.736 --> 00:30:27.536
spoken] which means, "I'll eat

00:30:27.606 --> 00:30:27.996
chowder."

00:30:28.956 --> 00:30:32.306
To do this, we can localize.

00:30:32.486 --> 00:30:33.866
And when we're thinking about

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:36.056
localization, there are a couple

00:30:36.056 --> 00:30:37.116
of things to keep in mind.

00:30:37.526 --> 00:30:39.336
So, in addition to localizing

00:30:39.336 --> 00:30:40.556
your code, we want to make sure

00:30:40.556 --> 00:30:42.726
to localize the content in the

00:30:42.726 --> 00:30:44.216
Intent Definition Files, because

00:30:44.216 --> 00:30:45.556
as you can remember, there are a

00:30:45.556 --> 00:30:46.506
lot of strings in there.

00:30:47.546 --> 00:30:48.976
And second, we have to think

00:30:48.976 --> 00:30:49.946
about pluralization.

00:30:50.116 --> 00:30:51.246
So, even if you're not

00:30:51.246 --> 00:30:52.826
localizing to any other language

00:30:52.826 --> 00:30:54.606
besides English, if you have to

00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:56.296
handle things like, "Order one

00:30:56.296 --> 00:30:57.856
clam chowder," versus, "Order

00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.356
three clam chowders," you have

00:30:59.356 --> 00:31:00.526
to think about localization.

00:31:00.976 --> 00:31:02.866
And to learn about all of this

00:31:02.866 --> 00:31:03.506
stuff, check out the

00:31:03.506 --> 00:31:05.446
Localization Session and their

00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:05.776
labs.

00:31:06.126 --> 00:31:07.096
They'll teach you everything

00:31:07.096 --> 00:31:08.026
that you need to know, and more.

00:31:09.306 --> 00:31:09.646
So, cool.

00:31:09.646 --> 00:31:11.346
For now, let's go back to

00:31:11.376 --> 00:31:11.666
English.

00:31:12.386 --> 00:31:15.306
Now, that we've followed these

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:16.856
best practices, when we go to

00:31:16.856 --> 00:31:17.606
the Settings UI, you are

00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:19.526
presented with a beautiful list

00:31:19.566 --> 00:31:20.836
of suggested shortcuts.

00:31:21.356 --> 00:31:22.916
And right now, these are based

00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.906
on a combination of suggestions

00:31:24.906 --> 00:31:26.056
based on the user's past

00:31:26.056 --> 00:31:27.276
routines and the things that the

00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:28.196
user did recently.

00:31:29.126 --> 00:31:30.686
But in addition, we provide an

00:31:30.686 --> 00:31:32.356
API to allow developers to

00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:33.676
suggest their own shortcuts.

00:31:34.176 --> 00:31:35.456
And this is useful because this

00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:36.856
allows you to suggest things for

00:31:36.856 --> 00:31:37.886
things that the user hasn't

00:31:37.886 --> 00:31:39.536
necessarily done yet or hasn't

00:31:39.536 --> 00:31:40.126
done recently.

00:31:40.836 --> 00:31:42.326
For example, if you have a music

00:31:42.326 --> 00:31:43.936
app, you might want to offer a

00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:45.366
shortcut for playing a

00:31:45.366 --> 00:31:46.726
particular playlist, even if the

00:31:46.726 --> 00:31:48.206
user hasn't played it before or

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.216
hasn't played it recently,

00:31:49.466 --> 00:31:51.566
because presumably, if a user

00:31:51.566 --> 00:31:52.786
has created the playlist, they

00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:53.786
probably ought to play it at

00:31:53.856 --> 00:31:54.646
some point in the future.

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.476
So, in the Soup Chef app, I

00:31:57.476 --> 00:31:58.796
think it'd be great if we can

00:31:58.796 --> 00:32:01.236
suggest a shortcut for ordering

00:32:01.236 --> 00:32:02.726
the soup of the day, even if

00:32:02.726 --> 00:32:03.446
they haven't ordered it

00:32:03.446 --> 00:32:04.696
recently, or have never ordered

00:32:04.696 --> 00:32:06.336
it, because based on past

00:32:06.336 --> 00:32:07.736
experience, our users seem to

00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:09.066
love it because it's both

00:32:09.066 --> 00:32:10.276
delicious and offered at a

00:32:10.276 --> 00:32:10.966
special price.

00:32:11.736 --> 00:32:13.466
So, let's take a look at the API

00:32:13.586 --> 00:32:15.906
on how to do this.

00:32:16.036 --> 00:32:19.056
So, for Intents, you can create

00:32:19.056 --> 00:32:20.226
an IN Shortcut out of Intent,

00:32:20.506 --> 00:32:21.946
well, and for User Activities,

00:32:21.946 --> 00:32:23.056
you can also create an IN

00:32:23.056 --> 00:32:23.816
Shortcut out of it.

00:32:23.816 --> 00:32:25.166
I'm going to wrap it in a

00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:27.146
suggestions list and pass it

00:32:27.146 --> 00:32:28.726
into IN Voice Shortcut Centers

00:32:29.026 --> 00:32:31.126
Set Shortcut Suggestions Method.

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:33.766
And once you do that, you'll see

00:32:34.136 --> 00:32:36.486
my suggestions alongside all the

00:32:36.486 --> 00:32:38.006
other system's suggestions.

00:32:38.796 --> 00:32:40.286
And by the way, the same set of

00:32:40.486 --> 00:32:42.286
suggestions is shown in the

00:32:42.346 --> 00:32:43.936
shortcuts app, so you can create

00:32:43.936 --> 00:32:45.416
custom shortcuts, using your

00:32:45.416 --> 00:32:45.926
shortcuts.

00:32:49.496 --> 00:32:52.236
So, now that we put in all this

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:54.336
work to provide a great voice

00:32:54.336 --> 00:32:55.766
experience for your users, we

00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:56.976
want to make sure that your

00:32:56.976 --> 00:32:58.566
users know that they can add

00:32:58.826 --> 00:33:00.366
shortcuts to use with Siri.

00:33:00.486 --> 00:33:02.016
And the best way to do that is

00:33:02.106 --> 00:33:03.716
bringing shortcuts into your

00:33:03.716 --> 00:33:05.806
app, so that users can create

00:33:05.806 --> 00:33:07.676
shortcuts right from inside your

00:33:08.016 --> 00:33:08.086
app.

00:33:09.316 --> 00:33:11.556
So, for example, I just ordered

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:14.396
a soup, and I'm going to need a

00:33:14.396 --> 00:33:16.316
suggestion to add this to Siri.

00:33:16.916 --> 00:33:20.286
And when I tap, "Add to Siri,"

00:33:21.186 --> 00:33:22.576
I'm presented with the same

00:33:22.776 --> 00:33:24.596
system UI that allows you to

00:33:24.596 --> 00:33:26.976
configure a new shortcut to use

00:33:26.976 --> 00:33:27.526
with Siri.

00:33:28.926 --> 00:33:30.226
So, let's take a look at the API

00:33:30.226 --> 00:33:32.136
to do this.

00:33:32.356 --> 00:33:33.656
So again, I'm going to take my

00:33:33.656 --> 00:33:35.736
User Activity and create an IN

00:33:35.776 --> 00:33:37.386
Shortcut out of it, and then

00:33:37.386 --> 00:33:39.266
using that, I'm going to create

00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:41.616
an IN UI Voice Shortcut View

00:33:41.616 --> 00:33:43.586
Controller, set the Delegate,

00:33:43.586 --> 00:33:44.656
and present it.

00:33:45.756 --> 00:33:46.756
And it's the same thing for

00:33:46.756 --> 00:33:47.206
Intents.

00:33:47.576 --> 00:33:49.306
So, instead of creating the IN

00:33:49.816 --> 00:33:51.516
Shortcut with a User Activity, I

00:33:51.516 --> 00:33:52.666
will create it with Intent,

00:33:53.126 --> 00:33:54.766
create my View Controller, set

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.706
the Delegate, and present it.

00:33:57.726 --> 00:33:59.466
And once I do that, your user

00:33:59.466 --> 00:34:01.426
will see this setup screen,

00:34:01.426 --> 00:34:02.736
right from inside of your app.

00:34:04.186 --> 00:34:06.046
In addition, rewrite an API to

00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:07.906
allow users to delete and edit

00:34:07.996 --> 00:34:09.366
any existing shortcuts.

00:34:12.976 --> 00:34:15.616
We also have an API that lets

00:34:15.616 --> 00:34:17.476
you get a list of shortcuts that

00:34:17.476 --> 00:34:19.176
are already added to Siri by our

00:34:19.176 --> 00:34:19.576
users.

00:34:19.966 --> 00:34:21.485
So, for example I can use this

00:34:21.485 --> 00:34:23.216
information to indicate which

00:34:23.216 --> 00:34:26.286
soups on my menu have the user

00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:28.536
has already added the shortcut

00:34:29.216 --> 00:34:30.036
to use with Siri.

00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:32.485
So, as you can see, for clam

00:34:32.485 --> 00:34:33.676
chowder, I have "Chowder Time"

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:37.085
associated and for tomato soup,

00:34:37.636 --> 00:34:38.916
I have "Tomato, Tomato."

00:34:39.466 --> 00:34:42.446
Awesome. So, to summarize, let's

00:34:42.446 --> 00:34:43.606
go over what we learned about

00:34:43.606 --> 00:34:43.866
today.

00:34:45.076 --> 00:34:46.396
First, we learned that Custom

00:34:46.396 --> 00:34:47.906
Responses are critical in

00:34:47.906 --> 00:34:49.676
providing a great voice

00:34:49.676 --> 00:34:50.835
experience to our users.

00:34:51.466 --> 00:34:52.676
And Amit showed us just how

00:34:52.676 --> 00:34:55.646
simple that can be.

00:34:55.906 --> 00:34:57.906
Next, we saw how Custom Intents

00:34:57.906 --> 00:34:59.126
UI can help bring the apps

00:34:59.126 --> 00:35:01.086
experience into Siri and to the

00:35:01.086 --> 00:35:02.796
other places in the system like

00:35:02.886 --> 00:35:04.796
Search and Lock Screen.

00:35:06.156 --> 00:35:08.156
We also saw that details matter.

00:35:08.526 --> 00:35:10.316
Even something small like adding

00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:11.786
an image to your shortcuts, or

00:35:11.786 --> 00:35:13.026
just dropping the quotation

00:35:13.026 --> 00:35:14.206
marks from around "clam chowder"

00:35:14.206 --> 00:35:15.516
to make it a big difference.

00:35:15.516 --> 00:35:17.016
And bigger details like

00:35:17.016 --> 00:35:18.806
localization can make a huge

00:35:18.806 --> 00:35:19.216
difference.

00:35:19.736 --> 00:35:22.476
Lastly, we learned about the

00:35:22.476 --> 00:35:23.836
various different APIs that you

00:35:23.836 --> 00:35:25.126
can use to bring the shortcuts

00:35:25.126 --> 00:35:26.856
experience into your app, so

00:35:26.856 --> 00:35:28.276
that your users can create

00:35:28.276 --> 00:35:29.786
shortcuts to user with Siri at

00:35:29.816 --> 00:35:31.236
the most relevant moments in

00:35:31.236 --> 00:35:32.266
your app.

00:35:33.076 --> 00:35:35.136
So, the documentation on how to

00:35:35.136 --> 00:35:36.316
do this is all on

00:35:36.316 --> 00:35:38.196
developer.apple.com, and in

00:35:38.196 --> 00:35:39.106
addition, we'll be holding

00:35:39.106 --> 00:35:40.386
shortcuts labs throughout the

00:35:40.386 --> 00:35:42.186
week, including one later today.

00:35:42.226 --> 00:35:44.576
And we also have a Watch Session

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:46.126
right after this, that will show

00:35:46.126 --> 00:35:47.126
you how to bring the shortcuts

00:35:47.126 --> 00:35:48.826
experience to the Watch and to

00:35:48.826 --> 00:35:50.636
the Siri Watch face so that --

00:35:50.716 --> 00:35:51.676
and they're also going to show

00:35:51.676 --> 00:35:52.876
you how it works, even if you

00:35:52.876 --> 00:35:53.996
don't have a Watch app.

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:55.666
So, it's a total must watch.

00:35:56.516 --> 00:35:57.186
Alright.

00:35:59.516 --> 00:36:04.476
[ Applause ]

00:36:04.976 --> 00:36:06.746
Alright, well, now you know

00:36:06.916 --> 00:36:08.356
everything that you need to know

00:36:08.356 --> 00:36:09.886
to create a great shortcuts

00:36:09.886 --> 00:36:11.146
experience for your users.

00:36:11.326 --> 00:36:12.516
We can't wait to see what you

00:36:12.516 --> 00:36:13.766
build with our new APIs.

00:36:14.066 --> 00:36:15.126
Thank you for listening, and I

00:36:15.126 --> 00:36:16.476
hope you have a great rest of

00:36:16.476 --> 00:36:16.976
WWDC.
