00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:30.026
>> Good morning.

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:31.916
Welcome to Session 204,

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:33.636
Automatic Strong Passwords and

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:35.066
Security Code Autofill.

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:36.616
My name is Chelsea.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.766
You may have seen Automatic

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.176
Strong Passwords and Security

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:41.496
Code Autofill in the State of

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:42.526
the Union, yesterday.

00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:44.216
I'm really excited to tell you

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:45.326
more about these features,

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:45.756
today.

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.816
These new features and other

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:50.406
features in iOS 12 will help

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:52.246
users log into and create

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:54.866
accounts with ease in your app.

00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:58.026
If you have a login screen or an

00:00:58.026 --> 00:00:59.336
account creation screen in your

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:00.916
app, this session is for you.

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:04.366
A major pain point for users is

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.446
dealing with passwords.

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:08.196
They can be a pain point, even

00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:09.446
for people that use the best

00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:11.056
practice, which is to use a

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:13.236
password manager to create and

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.536
fill passwords for them.

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:16.956
For everyone else it can be

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:18.616
tempting to do something easy

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:20.936
but insecure, like reuse a

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:22.266
password they're already using

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.326
on another service or use an

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:26.466
easy to guess password that they

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.276
can memorize.

00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:30.546
We know that the most private

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:32.916
secure thing for your users is

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:35.126
to use strong unique passwords

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:36.916
for each service that they use.

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:39.686
We've all heard of breaches in

00:01:39.686 --> 00:01:41.946
services that result in users'

00:01:41.946 --> 00:01:44.866
passwords being exposed.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.516
Users then need to go and change

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:48.286
their password on every service

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:49.436
where they were using it.

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.146
The features that we'll discuss

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:54.456
today will help users choose

00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:56.296
strong unique passwords for your

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:56.666
apps.

00:01:57.406 --> 00:01:59.096
This way, you both help users

00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:00.876
that are trying to consciously

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:03.206
use best password practices, as

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:04.416
well as your users that would

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.536
rather not think about

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:06.186
passwords.

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:09.566
Many of your users use the

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:10.675
iCloud Keychain.

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:12.336
The features that we're going to

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:13.746
talk about today are built on

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:14.736
top of the Keychain.

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.256
It has best in class security

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:19.176
and it protects users' passwords

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:21.016
behind biometric authentication.

00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:24.486
Apple does not have access to

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:25.526
the credentials stored in

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:27.446
Keychain, so users' privacy is

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.296
preserved, as well.

00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:30.586
The iCloud Password Keychain

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:33.106
Manager can help users log into

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:34.386
and create accounts in your app.

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:36.926
We've added some new features on

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.886
iOS 12 to help make account

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:40.546
creation and login even easier.

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:42.346
I'm really excited to show you

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:43.716
these features with a demo.

00:02:48.156 --> 00:02:49.616
So, I'm going to go to the Shiny

00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:49.686
app.

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:52.886
This is my favorite demo app for

00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:55.536
creating an account and logging

00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:56.146
back into it.

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:57.806
So, I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.486
create-- and tap create account.

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:02.346
I'll focus the email field and

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:03.596
you'll see that I've been given

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:04.856
a suggested username.

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:07.286
This is a new feature on iOS 12.

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:09.716
These suggested usernames are

00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:11.086
based on credentials that the

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:12.386
user already has stored in the

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:13.036
Keychain.

00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:14.816
Since I always use

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:16.556
Chelsea@example.com, I'm going

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:18.106
to select that as my username.

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:20.206
Without another tap, the

00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:22.116
password field is focused for me

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:23.886
and a strong unique password has

00:03:23.886 --> 00:03:24.586
been provided.

00:03:25.136 --> 00:03:27.666
I'm also told that I can go and

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:28.646
look up this password in

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:29.866
Settings at any time.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:31.066
So, if I need to go and type it

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:32.696
onto another device where iCloud

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:34.176
Keychain is available, it's

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:35.026
available to me.

00:03:35.496 --> 00:03:36.446
So, I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:37.596
use this strong password and

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:38.046
sign up.

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:40.536
So, with just a couple of taps

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:42.106
I'm logged back into the Shiny,

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:43.416
or I'm signed up for the Shine

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:43.666
app.

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:46.236
Now, let's fast forward through

00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:47.616
all of the other account setup.

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:48.886
I've turned on second factor

00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:49.776
authentication.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.486
And let's look at what logging

00:03:51.486 --> 00:03:52.846
back into Shiny looks like.

00:03:52.846 --> 00:03:54.616
So, I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:55.796
tap the email field.

00:03:56.696 --> 00:03:57.956
As you can see, the credential I

00:03:57.956 --> 00:03:59.636
just created is suggested right

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:00.526
on the QuickType bar.

00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:01.966
Going to select that.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:04.586
And then, after Face ID, my

00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:05.976
password and username are filled

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:06.826
and I can log in.

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:10.246
Now, I've set up second factor

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:11.096
authentication.

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:12.806
Normally, I'd need to try to

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:14.326
memorize this code or go back to

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:14.906
Messages.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:16.625
But as you can see, the code

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.106
that I just received for second

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:19.536
factor authentication is right

00:04:19.536 --> 00:04:20.416
on the QuickType bar.

00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:22.536
So, with one tap I can fill the

00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:22.956
code.

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:25.536
Yeah. It's really awesome.

00:04:26.508 --> 00:04:28.508
[ Applause ]

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:30.336
So, I can fill that code,

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:33.136
submit, and again, with a

00:04:33.136 --> 00:04:34.696
minimal number of taps I'm

00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:36.916
logged back into Shiny.

00:04:37.206 --> 00:04:39.706
Back to the slides.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.836
So, as you saw, creating an

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:43.186
account with Automatic Strong

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:45.366
Passwords is quick and easy.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:46.656
I didn't think about the

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.436
password, since one was provided

00:04:48.436 --> 00:04:50.036
for me and inserted into the

00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:50.846
password field.

00:04:52.136 --> 00:04:53.286
I also didn't think about the

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:54.806
password when logging back into

00:04:54.806 --> 00:04:55.316
Shiny.

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:57.376
Passwords have truly become an

00:04:57.376 --> 00:04:59.186
implementation detail to logging

00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:00.826
into my app with Automatic

00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:02.246
Strong Passwords and Password

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:02.746
Autofill.

00:05:03.256 --> 00:05:05.976
Here's today's agenda.

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:07.676
First, we're going to do a quick

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:09.266
recap of Password Autofill,

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:11.046
since many of the features that

00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:12.416
we'll talk about today are built

00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:13.696
upon that feature.

00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:15.986
Next, we'll talk about how to

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:17.366
ensure that Automatic Strong

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.516
Passwords works in your app.

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:21.136
Then, we'll talk about Security

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:21.936
Code Autofill.

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:24.506
Next, we'll talk about federated

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:25.496
authentication with a

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:26.656
third-party service.

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:28.946
And finally, we'll discuss some

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:30.616
new password management features

00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:31.276
that the iCloud Password

00:05:31.276 --> 00:05:33.046
Keychain Manager provides.

00:05:33.756 --> 00:05:37.146
In iOS 11, we introduced

00:05:37.146 --> 00:05:38.366
Password Autofill for apps.

00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:40.806
Some of the new features that

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:42.306
we're going to discuss today are

00:05:42.306 --> 00:05:43.826
built upon the same adoption you

00:05:43.826 --> 00:05:45.156
may have done for that feature.

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:50.616
Password Autofill helps users

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.286
log into your app by surfacing

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:53.166
credentials right on the

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:53.896
QuickType bar.

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:55.856
Here's a quick recap of how to

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:56.966
ensure that it works in your

00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:57.866
app.

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:02.166
Passwords in the iCloud Keychain

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:03.896
Password Manager are stored

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.256
based on domains on the Web.

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.526
Like Apple.com.

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:08.696
Thus, it's important to have an

00:06:08.696 --> 00:06:11.106
association between your app and

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:12.466
the domain on the Web.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:14.536
This way, we're able to

00:06:14.536 --> 00:06:16.516
confidently surface credentials

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:17.516
on the QuickType bar.

00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:19.196
You already have this

00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:20.686
association if you've adopted

00:06:20.736 --> 00:06:22.396
Universal Links or Handoff.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.346
The process of adding this

00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:26.916
association is pretty simple.

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:28.686
You'll have a small change to

00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:30.986
your apps Entitlements file and

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:32.346
you'll serve a file from your

00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:33.186
domain on the Web.

00:06:34.246 --> 00:06:35.786
If you'd like to see an in-depth

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.746
look at how to set this up, see

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:39.286
Introducing Password Autofill

00:06:39.286 --> 00:06:41.716
for Apps from WWDC 2017.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:45.426
It's important to always tag

00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:46.876
your fields with text content

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:48.296
type, so that Autofill can be

00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:49.566
offered at the right place.

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:51.886
Tag your username fields with

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:53.226
the username content type.

00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:55.916
Tag fields where users are going

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.276
to be filling, or passwords for

00:06:58.276 --> 00:06:59.796
existing accounts with a

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:00.986
password content type.

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.526
If you've chosen not to use

00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:04.956
Secure Text Entry for your

00:07:04.956 --> 00:07:06.446
password fields, it's

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:08.116
particularly important that you

00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:09.086
tag your fields with the

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:10.186
password content type.

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:11.626
This way, we know we're in a

00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:12.586
password context.

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:15.306
Now, that we've discussed how to

00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:16.746
get Password Autofill working in

00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:18.376
your app, let's talk about some

00:07:18.376 --> 00:07:19.436
improvements that it has.

00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:23.626
Since, iOS 11.3, WKWebView

00:07:23.626 --> 00:07:25.126
supports Password Autofill.

00:07:25.906 --> 00:07:27.236
This helps your users if your

00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:28.626
login screen is implemented

00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:29.996
using Web technologies.

00:07:30.676 --> 00:07:34.316
New to iOS 12, password managers

00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:36.046
from the app store can provide

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:37.406
information to Autofill.

00:07:38.176 --> 00:07:39.896
This means that any work you do

00:07:39.896 --> 00:07:41.586
to support the iCloud Keychain

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:42.856
Password Manager filling

00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:44.556
credentials in your app, also,

00:07:44.556 --> 00:07:45.816
helps users of these other

00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:47.276
password managers, as well.

00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:49.656
If you're a developer of a

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:51.306
password manager, see

00:07:51.306 --> 00:07:52.916
Implementing Autofill Credential

00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:54.146
Provider Extensions.

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:58.976
On iOS 12, we now offer to save

00:07:58.976 --> 00:08:00.836
credentials when a user logs

00:08:00.836 --> 00:08:01.946
into your app with a new

00:08:01.946 --> 00:08:02.396
account.

00:08:03.556 --> 00:08:05.166
This way, users can then use

00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:06.726
these credentials in your app

00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.426
and website on all of their

00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:09.066
devices.

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:11.576
Let's talk about how to ensure

00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:13.186
users are prompted to save and

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:15.226
update passwords in your app.

00:08:16.136 --> 00:08:17.646
Here's how saving works.

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:19.996
First, Autofill infers that

00:08:19.996 --> 00:08:21.346
we're in a login scenario.

00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:24.086
Then, Autofill checks the

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.106
eligibility of your app based on

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:27.286
if there's an association

00:08:27.286 --> 00:08:28.626
between your app and the domain

00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:29.086
on the Web.

00:08:29.856 --> 00:08:32.046
Without this association saving

00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:33.416
passwords will not be offered.

00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:37.015
Next, it finds the username and

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:38.566
password fields so that it knows

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:39.856
which data to save in the new

00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:40.476
credential.

00:08:41.866 --> 00:08:43.246
Then, it detects that a sign in

00:08:43.326 --> 00:08:44.166
action has occurred.

00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:47.276
And finally, Autofill decided

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:49.246
whether to prompt to save or

00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:51.346
update the password based on if

00:08:51.536 --> 00:08:52.846
this is as brand new credential

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:54.146
that's not yet in the Keychain.

00:08:54.496 --> 00:08:56.126
Or if the user is updating an

00:08:56.126 --> 00:08:57.136
existing credential.

00:08:57.706 --> 00:09:00.776
Now, this may work with no

00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:02.496
changes to your app on iOS12.

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:04.106
But let's talk about some steps

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:05.296
you can take to ensure that it

00:09:05.296 --> 00:09:05.736
works.

00:09:06.576 --> 00:09:08.186
First, make sure to tag your

00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:09.546
fields with the username and

00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:11.296
password content types, like,

00:09:11.296 --> 00:09:12.316
with filling passwords.

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:15.176
Make sure to remove your

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:16.716
username and password fields

00:09:16.716 --> 00:09:17.936
from the view hierarchy when a

00:09:17.936 --> 00:09:18.866
sign in occurs.

00:09:19.286 --> 00:09:20.886
This way, Autofill can detect

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:22.146
that a sign in is occurring.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.496
You could do this by dismissing

00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:25.806
the view controller that your

00:09:25.806 --> 00:09:28.636
sign in fields are in.

00:09:28.846 --> 00:09:30.166
Make sure to only clear the

00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:31.886
username and password fields

00:09:31.886 --> 00:09:33.196
after they've been removed from

00:09:33.196 --> 00:09:34.046
the view hierarchy.

00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:35.876
This way, we can read out the

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.166
data and save it into

00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:37.716
credential.

00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:41.256
Make sure the Autofill saves the

00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:42.236
credential to the correct

00:09:42.236 --> 00:09:42.776
domain.

00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:44.556
You can do this by saving a

00:09:44.556 --> 00:09:45.946
password in your app, and then

00:09:45.946 --> 00:09:47.516
going to Settings to check where

00:09:47.516 --> 00:09:48.636
the credential is saved.

00:09:49.426 --> 00:09:50.786
If you notice that Autofill is

00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:52.126
not saving to the correct

00:09:52.126 --> 00:09:53.926
domain, you can override where

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.336
it's saving using the Web

00:09:55.336 --> 00:09:56.936
credentials associated domain

00:09:56.936 --> 00:09:57.386
service.

00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:00.596
Finally, you may have previously

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:01.236
been using

00:10:01.356 --> 00:10:03.046
SecAddSharedWebCredential to

00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:04.486
manually save credentials when a

00:10:04.486 --> 00:10:05.716
user logs into your app.

00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:07.786
However, now that Autofill

00:10:07.786 --> 00:10:09.776
automatically prompts users to

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.916
save passwords you may no longer

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:12.386
need this.

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:15.426
You will still want to use this

00:10:15.426 --> 00:10:17.176
if your app has a web view for

00:10:17.176 --> 00:10:19.436
its login screen because saving

00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:20.426
is not supported there.

00:10:21.006 --> 00:10:24.396
So, here are some of the key

00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:25.736
steps that we've discussed so

00:10:25.736 --> 00:10:26.916
far to make sure that filling

00:10:26.916 --> 00:10:28.356
and saving passwords in your app

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:28.766
works.

00:10:29.436 --> 00:10:30.936
Make sure to associate your app

00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:32.026
with the domain on the Web.

00:10:33.036 --> 00:10:33.886
Tag your fields with the

00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:35.656
username and password content

00:10:35.656 --> 00:10:35.916
type.

00:10:37.256 --> 00:10:39.916
And for saving passwords, ensure

00:10:39.916 --> 00:10:41.636
that login is detected by making

00:10:41.636 --> 00:10:42.826
sure that the saving prompt

00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:44.576
appears when you sign into your

00:10:45.336 --> 00:10:45.406
app.

00:10:46.756 --> 00:10:48.086
By ensuring that Password

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:49.696
Autofill works in your app, you

00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:51.236
help your users log in with

00:10:51.236 --> 00:10:51.636
ease.

00:10:52.326 --> 00:10:55.576
For new users, one of the first

00:10:55.576 --> 00:10:56.656
encounters they'll have with

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.386
your app is creating an account.

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:01.746
In my demo you saw how Automatic

00:11:01.746 --> 00:11:02.946
Strong Passwords made this

00:11:02.946 --> 00:11:04.536
process super easy.

00:11:05.496 --> 00:11:06.846
I'd like to invite Reza to the

00:11:06.846 --> 00:11:08.766
stage to discuss how to ensure

00:11:08.766 --> 00:11:10.446
Automatic Strong Passwords works

00:11:10.446 --> 00:11:11.116
in your app.

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:11.976
Thank you.

00:11:12.516 --> 00:11:17.500
[ Applause ]

00:11:18.486 --> 00:11:19.156
>> Thank you, Chelsea.

00:11:20.676 --> 00:11:21.376
Hi, everyone.

00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:22.666
This is Reza and I'm really

00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:24.286
excited to tell you all about

00:11:24.286 --> 00:11:25.676
Automatic Strong Passwords.

00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:28.846
Account creation is a point of

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.506
frustration for many users.

00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:32.206
They might even leave your app

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:34.326
and never come back, or as many

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.376
of them do, decide to use a weak

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.176
password or keep reusing the

00:11:38.246 --> 00:11:38.606
same one.

00:11:39.316 --> 00:11:41.476
This significantly reduces their

00:11:41.476 --> 00:11:42.076
security.

00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:44.156
Although, it might be an

00:11:44.156 --> 00:11:46.656
alternative to account creation,

00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:48.446
some of you might have concerns

00:11:48.446 --> 00:11:51.176
about allowing social media to

00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:55.256
be used to sign into your apps.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:57.496
Automatic Strong Passwords makes

00:11:57.496 --> 00:11:59.186
account creation just as easy.

00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:01.416
It brings convenience and

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:03.396
security to the signup process.

00:12:04.016 --> 00:12:05.646
Users no longer need to think

00:12:05.646 --> 00:12:07.446
about or worry about passwords.

00:12:08.556 --> 00:12:10.616
Autofill even suggests usernames

00:12:10.716 --> 00:12:12.046
to ease the signup process.

00:12:12.926 --> 00:12:14.466
With Automatic Strong Passwords,

00:12:14.686 --> 00:12:16.346
account creation is only a few

00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:16.956
taps away.

00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:18.836
So, users are more likely to

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:20.436
sign up and user your services.

00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:23.446
Now, I'd like to talk about how

00:12:23.446 --> 00:12:25.026
Automatic Strong Passwords

00:12:25.026 --> 00:12:25.326
works.

00:12:25.856 --> 00:12:28.506
Similar to what Chelsea

00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:30.346
explained in a login scenario,

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.476
when your app presents a view

00:12:32.476 --> 00:12:34.286
controller Autofill infers its

00:12:34.376 --> 00:12:34.586
type.

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:36.506
In this case, it's a signup view

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:36.966
controller.

00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:40.106
It will then check the

00:12:40.106 --> 00:12:42.486
eligibility of your-- it will

00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:43.926
then check the eligibility of

00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:46.326
your app based on the associated

00:12:46.326 --> 00:12:48.296
domains to figure out if it can

00:12:48.356 --> 00:12:49.056
save passwords.

00:12:49.196 --> 00:12:51.346
If that's the case, Autofill

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:53.776
will then detect relevant signup

00:12:53.816 --> 00:12:56.486
form elements; the username and

00:12:57.436 --> 00:12:58.436
the password.

00:12:58.566 --> 00:13:00.206
Once the username field become

00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:02.616
first responder Autofill

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:03.706
suggests usernames.

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:05.436
This is a new feature we're

00:13:05.436 --> 00:13:06.466
adding in iOS 12.

00:13:07.456 --> 00:13:08.886
The user proceeds with the

00:13:08.936 --> 00:13:10.046
suggested username.

00:13:10.996 --> 00:13:12.306
And eventually, the password

00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:13.976
field becomes first responder.

00:13:14.626 --> 00:13:16.346
Autofill automatically inserts a

00:13:16.346 --> 00:13:17.476
strong password into the

00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:18.206
password field.

00:13:18.846 --> 00:13:20.636
At this point, the user only

00:13:20.636 --> 00:13:21.646
needs to proceed with the

00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:23.096
suggested password and sign up.

00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:25.666
Autofill takes care of saving

00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:26.176
the password.

00:13:27.536 --> 00:13:29.246
In many cases, this happens

00:13:29.246 --> 00:13:30.896
automatically without any

00:13:30.896 --> 00:13:32.236
adoption requirements in your

00:13:32.236 --> 00:13:32.556
apps.

00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:35.546
However, in order to ensure your

00:13:35.546 --> 00:13:36.816
app's compatibility with

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.016
Automatic Strong Passwords there

00:13:39.016 --> 00:13:40.586
are a certain number of steps

00:13:40.716 --> 00:13:42.956
you should take.

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:44.536
Many of these steps are

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:46.156
identical to those Chelsea

00:13:46.156 --> 00:13:47.436
explained to make your apps

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:49.256
compatible with saving.

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:53.596
Make sure to tag your username

00:13:53.596 --> 00:13:55.626
field with UI textContentType

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:56.186
username.

00:13:57.406 --> 00:13:59.806
New in iOS 12, make sure to tag

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:01.606
your new password and confirm

00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:03.376
new password fields with UI

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:04.926
textContentType newPassword.

00:14:05.536 --> 00:14:08.616
If you're using a UI table view

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:10.236
to represent your signup form

00:14:11.046 --> 00:14:12.546
make sure to use unique

00:14:12.546 --> 00:14:14.616
instances of UITextField for the

00:14:14.616 --> 00:14:16.346
username and the password field.

00:14:17.006 --> 00:14:18.606
This is important, because once

00:14:18.606 --> 00:14:20.626
Autofill detects username and

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.456
password fields, it expects to

00:14:22.456 --> 00:14:24.226
be able to reliably read their

00:14:24.226 --> 00:14:25.946
values later on.

00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:28.516
Some of you might have changed

00:14:28.516 --> 00:14:29.756
password forms in your apps.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.316
Automatic Strong Passwords is

00:14:32.346 --> 00:14:33.996
compatible with change password

00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:35.676
forms if Autofill is able to

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:37.396
detect username and password

00:14:37.396 --> 00:14:40.976
fields on the same screen.

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:42.256
Note that the username field can

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:42.916
be Read Only.

00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:45.846
Best practices that we discussed

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:47.816
for signup forms, also, apply to

00:14:47.816 --> 00:14:48.796
change password forms.

00:14:49.176 --> 00:14:52.976
Now, let's take a moment and

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:54.546
talk about the format of these

00:14:54.546 --> 00:14:55.546
generated passwords.

00:14:59.176 --> 00:15:00.716
The generated passwords are 20

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:01.556
characters long.

00:15:02.496 --> 00:15:05.516
They contain uppercase, digits,

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:09.036
hyphen, and lowercase

00:15:09.036 --> 00:15:09.566
characters.

00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.356
This gives you a strong password

00:15:12.356 --> 00:15:13.926
with more than 71 bits of

00:15:13.926 --> 00:15:14.406
entropy.

00:15:15.636 --> 00:15:17.386
We designed this to be a strong,

00:15:17.386 --> 00:15:18.716
yet compatible with most

00:15:18.716 --> 00:15:19.276
services.

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:22.526
It is, of course, possible for

00:15:22.526 --> 00:15:24.246
your apps to define their own

00:15:24.246 --> 00:15:25.276
custom password rules.

00:15:26.546 --> 00:15:28.746
As I mentioned before, in most

00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:30.096
cases, you don't need to do this

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:31.526
because the default format of

00:15:31.526 --> 00:15:32.966
Automatic Strong Passwords

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:33.896
should be compatible.

00:15:34.616 --> 00:15:36.846
However, if your app's backend

00:15:36.846 --> 00:15:38.556
requires a separate set of rules

00:15:38.556 --> 00:15:40.216
that are not compatible with the

00:15:40.216 --> 00:15:41.586
default format of Automatic

00:15:41.586 --> 00:15:43.136
Strong Passwords, you could

00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:44.196
define your own rules.

00:15:45.396 --> 00:15:47.526
To do so, use the new password

00:15:47.526 --> 00:15:49.496
rules language in iOS 12.

00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:51.936
Following the format of the

00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:53.846
password rules language, create

00:15:53.846 --> 00:15:54.936
a rulesDescriptor.

00:15:55.446 --> 00:15:57.856
Using the rulesDescriptor create

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.046
an instance of

00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:01.506
UITextInputPasswordRules and

00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:02.816
assign it to the password rules

00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:04.236
property of UITextField.

00:16:04.726 --> 00:16:06.976
Once you do this, Automatic

00:16:06.976 --> 00:16:08.516
Strong Passwords will generate

00:16:08.566 --> 00:16:10.056
passwords based on these rules.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.516
We have also created a new

00:16:13.516 --> 00:16:14.816
web-based Password Rules

00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:15.606
Validation Tool.

00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:18.466
Use this tool to ensure the

00:16:18.466 --> 00:16:19.856
rules that you specify are

00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.196
correct and produce the type of

00:16:22.196 --> 00:16:23.466
passwords that you expect.

00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:25.056
I'll talk more about this,

00:16:25.056 --> 00:16:25.436
shortly.

00:16:25.436 --> 00:16:30.356
Now, that we talked about the

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:32.306
steps it would take to make your

00:16:32.306 --> 00:16:33.886
apps compatible with Automatic

00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:35.596
Strong Passwords, I'd like to

00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:36.306
show you a demo.

00:16:36.956 --> 00:16:39.806
I'm the developer of the Shiny

00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:41.126
app and I want to make sure that

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.526
Shiny is compatible with

00:16:42.526 --> 00:16:43.936
Automatic Strong Passwords in

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:44.706
iOS 12.

00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:47.386
So, the first thing to do is to

00:16:47.386 --> 00:16:49.616
run Shiny using the iOS 12 SDK

00:16:49.616 --> 00:16:50.856
and try it out.

00:16:51.696 --> 00:16:57.666
So, in Xcode I'll click on Run.

00:16:57.846 --> 00:16:58.916
And here is Shiny.

00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:01.056
I'll tap on Create Account.

00:17:02.316 --> 00:17:02.916
Tap on Email.

00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:05.665
And I don't see any suggested

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:06.126
username.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.606
When I tap on the Password field

00:17:08.606 --> 00:17:10.236
I don't see any Automatic Strong

00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:11.406
Passwords suggestion, either.

00:17:11.726 --> 00:17:13.465
So, let's go back to Xcode and

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:14.526
investigate this, further.

00:17:14.636 --> 00:17:20.306
The first thing to make sure of

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.476
is associated domains for your

00:17:22.476 --> 00:17:22.816
apps.

00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:25.136
In this case, I've already

00:17:25.136 --> 00:17:26.576
ensure that Shiny has an

00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:27.536
associated domain.

00:17:27.816 --> 00:17:30.046
In fact, earlier today I was

00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:31.866
able to get Autofill suggestions

00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:33.116
when I wanted to logging into

00:17:33.116 --> 00:17:33.476
Shiny.

00:17:34.496 --> 00:17:37.666
Next, you should take a look.

00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:39.036
You should take a closer look at

00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:40.286
your signup view controller.

00:17:40.856 --> 00:17:44.326
I'll click on the Email field.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:49.266
And here, under Text Input

00:17:49.266 --> 00:17:51.286
Traits, Content Type, I see that

00:17:51.286 --> 00:17:52.706
I'm correctly setting the

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:53.966
content type to username.

00:17:55.266 --> 00:17:57.586
And because I want the format of

00:17:57.586 --> 00:17:58.906
this username to be of type

00:17:58.906 --> 00:18:00.876
email address, I'm also

00:18:00.876 --> 00:18:02.316
correctly setting the Keyboard

00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:03.466
Type to Email Address.

00:18:03.796 --> 00:18:04.476
So, this is good.

00:18:05.006 --> 00:18:06.166
Let's take a closer look at the

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:06.826
Password field.

00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:11.236
I see that the Content Type is

00:18:11.276 --> 00:18:12.406
set to Unspecified.

00:18:12.496 --> 00:18:13.956
This should, actually, be set to

00:18:14.076 --> 00:18:15.526
New Password.

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:19.206
So, I'll select New Password,

00:18:19.756 --> 00:18:19.846
here.

00:18:22.586 --> 00:18:24.986
And because this is a password

00:18:25.046 --> 00:18:26.366
field, I'm going to mark it as

00:18:26.446 --> 00:18:27.436
Secure Text Entry.

00:18:30.516 --> 00:18:31.246
All right.

00:18:31.246 --> 00:18:33.176
Let's run Shiny again and try it

00:18:33.876 --> 00:18:34.000
out.

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:34.226
:15

00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:40.976
Okay. Tap on Create Account.

00:18:41.696 --> 00:18:42.476
Tap on Email.

00:18:42.816 --> 00:18:44.536
Here, I see I'm getting

00:18:44.596 --> 00:18:45.836
suggested username, now.

00:18:46.296 --> 00:18:47.046
I'm going to go ahead and

00:18:47.046 --> 00:18:48.096
proceed with the suggested

00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:48.616
username.

00:18:49.116 --> 00:18:50.776
I also, see Automatic Strong

00:18:50.776 --> 00:18:51.276
Passwords.

00:18:51.906 --> 00:18:53.506
So, in most cases, this should

00:18:53.506 --> 00:18:54.596
be enough and you should be

00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:54.876
done.

00:18:55.356 --> 00:18:57.006
Let's proceed with the signup

00:18:57.006 --> 00:18:57.466
process.

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:01.616
For the purpose of this demo,

00:19:02.096 --> 00:19:04.506
I'm requiring Shiny passwords to

00:19:04.506 --> 00:19:05.596
contain a dollar sign.

00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:07.676
This means that we need to

00:19:07.676 --> 00:19:09.696
specify our own custom password

00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:11.066
rules for Automatic Strong

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:11.586
Passwords.

00:19:12.116 --> 00:19:13.426
And actually, the best way to do

00:19:13.426 --> 00:19:15.426
so is using the new Password

00:19:15.426 --> 00:19:16.526
Rules Validation Tool.

00:19:17.006 --> 00:19:19.106
Using the tool, I will be able

00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:21.156
to specify correct password

00:19:21.156 --> 00:19:22.866
rules, and also, ensure the rule

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:24.736
will produce the type of

00:19:24.736 --> 00:19:25.796
password that I expect.

00:19:26.346 --> 00:19:28.246
So, let's jump right in.

00:19:28.816 --> 00:19:30.436
This is the new Password Rules

00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:31.776
Validation Tool that you can

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.076
have access from

00:19:33.076 --> 00:19:35.876
developer.apple.com.

00:19:36.076 --> 00:19:37.406
For the purpose of this demo,

00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:39.216
I'm allowing uppercase,

00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:43.116
lowercase, digit, and requiring

00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:44.576
at least a dollar sign to be

00:19:44.576 --> 00:19:46.116
present in my password.

00:19:46.676 --> 00:19:50.066
At the bottom of the page I see

00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:51.846
some examples of the password

00:19:51.846 --> 00:19:52.446
generated.

00:19:53.236 --> 00:19:54.506
I also, have the option to

00:19:54.506 --> 00:19:55.776
download a number of these

00:19:55.826 --> 00:19:58.126
passwords in case I need to run

00:19:58.126 --> 00:19:59.936
some tests in my app's backend.

00:20:01.336 --> 00:20:02.646
Once I'm happy with the

00:20:02.646 --> 00:20:05.796
formatting of the passwords I

00:20:05.796 --> 00:20:06.596
have two options.

00:20:07.446 --> 00:20:09.116
If I'm making a native app for

00:20:09.116 --> 00:20:11.846
UIKit, I can go ahead and copy

00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:13.606
the rules formatter for UIKit.

00:20:13.856 --> 00:20:16.636
Or if I'm making a webpage I can

00:20:16.636 --> 00:20:19.526
copy the HTML formatted rules.

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:23.416
For this demo, since we are

00:20:23.416 --> 00:20:24.986
making a native app for UIKit,

00:20:25.176 --> 00:20:26.286
I'm going to go ahead and copy

00:20:26.286 --> 00:20:27.866
the UIKit version.

00:20:30.226 --> 00:20:32.336
And once I've copied it, all I

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:35.246
need to do is go back in Xcode,

00:20:36.566 --> 00:20:39.756
select the password, and paste

00:20:39.756 --> 00:20:42.616
in the rule-- in the Password

00:20:42.756 --> 00:20:43.566
Rule text field.

00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:47.926
Now, let's run Shiny, again.

00:20:52.806 --> 00:20:55.526
Okay. I'll tap on Create

00:20:55.646 --> 00:20:55.866
Account.

00:20:55.866 --> 00:20:59.616
Tap on. I'm going to go ahead

00:20:59.616 --> 00:21:00.836
and proceed with the suggested

00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:01.196
username.

00:21:01.196 --> 00:21:03.796
And at this point, the password

00:21:03.796 --> 00:21:05.056
should be compatible with the

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:06.656
rules that I just specified.

00:21:06.876 --> 00:21:10.546
Let's proceed with the signup.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.000
And just like that, I'm in.

00:21:16.726 --> 00:21:16.996
Thank you.

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.206
We just saw how easy it is to

00:21:21.206 --> 00:21:22.826
make your apps compatible with

00:21:22.826 --> 00:21:24.266
Automatic Strong Passwords.

00:21:26.146 --> 00:21:26.846
>> Than you, Reza.

00:21:27.796 --> 00:21:29.186
As Reza showed you, these are

00:21:29.186 --> 00:21:30.386
some steps you can take to

00:21:30.386 --> 00:21:31.706
ensure that Automatic Strong

00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:32.986
Passwords works in your app.

00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:35.696
Make sure to associate your app

00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:37.266
with the domain on the Web, just

00:21:37.266 --> 00:21:38.296
like filling and saving

00:21:38.296 --> 00:21:38.876
passwords.

00:21:40.246 --> 00:21:41.456
Make sure to tag your fields

00:21:41.456 --> 00:21:42.816
with the username and new

00:21:42.816 --> 00:21:44.406
password content types.

00:21:44.876 --> 00:21:48.276
Ensure that signup is detected

00:21:48.406 --> 00:21:50.116
by checking that when you sign

00:21:50.116 --> 00:21:51.716
up for your app the password is

00:21:51.716 --> 00:21:52.076
saved.

00:21:53.296 --> 00:21:55.086
Most of you will be done after

00:21:55.086 --> 00:21:56.496
doing these three things.

00:21:57.056 --> 00:21:58.836
However, if your service is not

00:21:58.836 --> 00:22:00.636
compatible with Apple's password

00:22:00.636 --> 00:22:02.806
generation format you may want

00:22:02.846 --> 00:22:04.366
to use some password rules on

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:05.536
your password text field.

00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:07.046
To ensure that Automatic Strong

00:22:07.046 --> 00:22:09.046
Passwords generates a compatible

00:22:09.046 --> 00:22:09.596
password.

By ensuring that Automatic

Strong Passwords works well in

00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:16.586
your app, you're setting your

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:18.076
users up for success by

00:22:18.076 --> 00:22:19.946
encouraging them to use a strong

00:22:19.946 --> 00:22:21.986
unique password in your app.

00:22:22.996 --> 00:22:24.906
Some of your apps and services

00:22:24.906 --> 00:22:28.466
may use SMS, or security code

00:22:28.526 --> 00:22:30.326
sent via SMS to your users.

00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:32.866
I'd like to invite Harris to the

00:22:32.866 --> 00:22:34.366
stage to discuss how you can

00:22:34.366 --> 00:22:35.896
service these codes right in

00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:36.846
your app.

Thank you, very much, Chelsea.

00:22:45.166 --> 00:22:45.806
Hello, everyone.

00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:48.876
My name is Harris and I am super

00:22:48.876 --> 00:22:50.016
stoked to talk to you about

00:22:50.016 --> 00:22:51.096
Security Code Autofill.

00:22:52.226 --> 00:22:53.606
But first, this section needs a

00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:54.426
little bit of audience

00:22:54.426 --> 00:22:55.186
participation.

00:22:55.556 --> 00:22:57.846
So, show of hands, how many of

00:22:57.846 --> 00:22:59.016
you have ever gotten a text

00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:00.176
message that looks something

00:23:00.176 --> 00:23:00.716
like this?

00:23:01.236 --> 00:23:02.706
All right.

00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:04.506
I think it's fair to say that

00:23:04.506 --> 00:23:05.746
most of us have to deal with

00:23:05.746 --> 00:23:07.066
these codes on a fairly regular

00:23:07.066 --> 00:23:07.956
basis, these days.

00:23:08.886 --> 00:23:09.216
All right.

00:23:09.216 --> 00:23:10.776
Question of the second, after

00:23:10.776 --> 00:23:11.666
getting one of these text

00:23:11.666 --> 00:23:13.516
messages how many of you go

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:14.726
through a process like this?

00:23:15.466 --> 00:23:16.206
Where you think you have the

00:23:16.206 --> 00:23:18.296
code memorized, you type it in,

00:23:18.936 --> 00:23:20.256
you switch the last two digits

00:23:20.256 --> 00:23:21.896
around, and then you have to do

00:23:21.896 --> 00:23:22.596
it all over, again.

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:24.516
Let me see those hands.

00:23:26.536 --> 00:23:27.146
All right.

00:23:27.786 --> 00:23:28.676
Final question.

00:23:29.896 --> 00:23:30.786
After going through this

00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:33.076
process, how many of you feel

00:23:33.076 --> 00:23:34.826
something like this?

00:23:36.856 --> 00:23:38.086
All right.

00:23:38.086 --> 00:23:40.106
So, let me tell you it doesn't

00:23:40.106 --> 00:23:40.976
have to be this way.

00:23:41.516 --> 00:23:43.586
Because starting in iOS 12 and

00:23:43.586 --> 00:23:45.776
macOS Mojave, we're introducing

00:23:45.956 --> 00:23:47.206
Security Code Autofill.

00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:49.836
A brand new feature which takes

00:23:50.066 --> 00:23:52.076
all the pain and frustration out

00:23:52.076 --> 00:23:53.886
of message based second factor

00:23:53.886 --> 00:23:54.336
flows.

00:23:54.896 --> 00:23:57.876
Now, it is important to note

00:23:58.286 --> 00:24:00.036
that Security Code Autofill does

00:24:00.036 --> 00:24:01.716
not alter the calculus around

00:24:01.716 --> 00:24:03.096
the security of second factor

00:24:03.096 --> 00:24:03.646
methods.

00:24:04.556 --> 00:24:06.556
What it merely does is remove

00:24:06.556 --> 00:24:08.196
the indignity out of having to

00:24:08.316 --> 00:24:10.196
type the code in yourselves in

00:24:10.196 --> 00:24:11.196
the age of computers.

00:24:12.236 --> 00:24:14.756
Nothing more, nothing less.

[ Applause ]

00:24:19.426 --> 00:24:22.216
So, starting in the new iOS and

00:24:22.216 --> 00:24:24.646
macOS, instead of exercising

00:24:24.646 --> 00:24:26.556
your memorizing skills you get

00:24:26.556 --> 00:24:27.656
to do something like this.

00:24:28.726 --> 00:24:30.396
Just one tap, right on the

00:24:30.396 --> 00:24:32.516
QuickType bar, and you're signed

00:24:32.516 --> 00:24:32.746
in.

00:24:34.016 --> 00:24:35.606
And hopefully, at the end of

00:24:35.606 --> 00:24:37.636
this process, you feel a little

00:24:37.636 --> 00:24:39.656
bit more like this.

00:24:40.436 --> 00:24:40.766
All right.

00:24:40.996 --> 00:24:41.916
So, let's talk about some

00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:42.806
technical details.

00:24:44.156 --> 00:24:45.526
As with other Autofill features,

00:24:45.896 --> 00:24:47.506
Security Code Autofill will work

00:24:47.506 --> 00:24:48.886
in your apps right out of the

00:24:48.886 --> 00:24:50.206
box, most of the time.

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:53.286
Still, you can do just a tiny

00:24:53.286 --> 00:24:54.526
bit of work to ensure that

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:55.876
Security Code Autofill works

00:24:56.006 --> 00:24:56.886
every single time.

00:24:57.436 --> 00:25:00.306
We've told you this before but

00:25:00.346 --> 00:25:01.266
tag your fields.

00:25:02.026 --> 00:25:03.736
In iOS 12 we're introducing a

00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:05.956
new UITextContentType with the

00:25:05.956 --> 00:25:07.576
value oneTimeCode.

00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:10.016
Tag your security code fields

00:25:10.016 --> 00:25:11.646
with this and Security Code

00:25:11.646 --> 00:25:15.876
Autofill will work every time.

00:25:15.876 --> 00:25:17.586
Additionally, it is very

00:25:17.586 --> 00:25:19.096
important that you allow usage

00:25:19.096 --> 00:25:20.476
of the system keyboard for

00:25:20.476 --> 00:25:21.546
inputting these codes.

00:25:22.426 --> 00:25:23.836
Tempting as it may be, you

00:25:23.836 --> 00:25:24.956
should refrain from building

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:26.766
Bespoke keyboard UI's within

00:25:26.766 --> 00:25:28.986
your view hierarchy or setting

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:30.196
custom input views in your

00:25:30.196 --> 00:25:30.786
controls.

00:25:31.186 --> 00:25:32.716
Because if you do so you are

00:25:32.716 --> 00:25:34.616
preventing iOS from surfacing

00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:36.776
the necessary UI or injecting

00:25:36.776 --> 00:25:38.186
the appropriate events to type

00:25:38.186 --> 00:25:39.296
the code in on behalf of your

00:25:39.296 --> 00:25:39.886
users.

00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:42.096
And additionally, you may be

00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:43.196
hampering the experience of

00:25:43.196 --> 00:25:44.126
folks that leverage

00:25:44.126 --> 00:25:45.486
accessibility technologies like

00:25:45.486 --> 00:25:46.066
voiceover.

00:25:46.626 --> 00:25:49.116
So, bottom line is let the

00:25:49.116 --> 00:25:50.496
system keyboard do the heavy

00:25:50.496 --> 00:25:52.186
lifting for you and Security

00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:53.766
Code Autofill will work every

00:25:53.766 --> 00:25:54.116
time.

00:25:54.726 --> 00:25:58.116
Another step that you can take

00:25:58.496 --> 00:25:59.736
to ensure that Security Code

00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:01.026

service is to craft your text

00:26:02.906 --> 00:26:03.896
message, accordingly.

00:26:04.906 --> 00:26:07.506
iOS and macOS use data detector

00:26:07.506 --> 00:26:09.026
heuristics to infer that an

00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:10.726
incoming message carries a

00:26:10.726 --> 00:26:11.506
security code.

00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:14.346
Specifically, our heuristics are

00:26:14.346 --> 00:26:16.256
looking for words like code or

00:26:16.256 --> 00:26:18.026
passcode in proximity to the

00:26:18.026 --> 00:26:19.106
actual code string.

00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:21.266
And you can see a few sample

00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:22.946
text messages in different

00:26:22.946 --> 00:26:24.186
languages in the slide behind

Now, verifying that your

00:26:28.146 --> 00:26:29.456
specially crafted message

00:26:29.536 --> 00:26:30.986
properly triggers the iOS and

00:26:30.986 --> 00:26:32.356
macOS heuristics is super

00:26:32.356 --> 00:26:32.706
simple.

00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:34.906
You can be your own best friends

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:36.266
and simply text yourselves.

Then, when you go into the

00:26:38.116 --> 00:26:39.916
message transcript and you see

00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:41.586
the code being underlined and

00:26:41.586 --> 00:26:42.926
tapping the code offers you a

00:26:42.926 --> 00:26:44.876
Copy Code option, you know you

00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:47.946
have it right.

So, so far, we've talked about

00:27:10.786 --> 00:27:12.096
getting Security Code Autofill

00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:14.886
to work within your native iOS

00:27:15.626 --> 00:27:15.736

00:27:23.166 --> 00:27:25.556
cool, if your users are signing

00:27:25.556 --> 00:27:27.366
into your service in Safari on

00:27:27.366 --> 00:27:28.946
their Mac, text message

00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:54.776
Autofill in Safari, we are

00:27:54.776 --> 00:27:56.226
introducing a new input

00:27:56.226 --> 00:27:57.926
autocomplete attribute value

00:27:58.426 --> 00:27:59.216
one-time-code.

00:28:00.226 --> 00:28:02.516
In fact, all of the UI Text

00:28:02.516 --> 00:28:03.706
Content Types that you heard

00:28:03.706 --> 00:28:05.866
about today have web platform

00:28:05.866 --> 00:28:06.966
equivalents that you can

00:28:06.966 --> 00:28:08.926
leverage to ensure a smooth

00:28:09.126 --> 00:28:11.196
seamless autofill experience in

00:28:11.196 --> 00:28:12.956
your websites, just as well as

00:28:12.956 --> 00:28:13.556
in your apps.

00:28:14.596 --> 00:28:16.046
You've heard this before but tag

00:28:16.046 --> 00:28:17.566
your form fields this time and

00:28:17.566 --> 00:28:19.096
Autofill will work great every

00:28:19.096 --> 00:28:19.416
time.

00:28:19.986 --> 00:28:22.666
So, this was a brief

00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:24.366
introduction to Security Code

00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:26.046
Autofill, a brand new addition

00:28:26.046 --> 00:28:28.596
to iOS 12 and macOS Mojave that

00:28:28.596 --> 00:28:30.196
takes all the pain and all the

00:28:30.196 --> 00:28:32.006
frustration out of message based

00:28:32.006 --> 00:28:32.976
second factor flows.

00:28:36.206 --> 00:28:37.846
Now, with the Autofill features

00:28:37.846 --> 00:28:39.426
that we've introduced today, it

00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:41.456
becomes super simple for you to

00:28:41.456 --> 00:28:42.996
build a relationship with your

00:28:42.996 --> 00:28:44.776
users while safeguarding their

00:28:44.776 --> 00:28:46.526
security and respecting their

00:28:46.526 --> 00:28:46.996
privacy.

00:28:48.276 --> 00:28:50.636
Still, some of you may find that

00:28:50.636 --> 00:28:52.246
you have to support federated

00:28:52.246 --> 00:28:53.766
authentication flows with third

00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:55.546
party providers, such as popular

00:28:55.546 --> 00:28:56.476
social networks.

00:28:57.536 --> 00:28:58.576
For those of you among the

00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.506
audience, we are introducing in

00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:03.106
iOS 12 a new API to support such

00:29:03.106 --> 00:29:03.566
flows.

00:29:04.156 --> 00:29:04.916
We call it

00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:06.976
ASWebAuthenticationSession and I

00:29:06.976 --> 00:29:08.086
would like to show you how it

00:29:08.086 --> 00:29:08.476
works.

00:29:09.016 --> 00:29:12.136
Now, here I am back in the Shiny

00:29:12.136 --> 00:29:12.336
app.

00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:14.226
And this time I will choose to

00:29:14.226 --> 00:29:16.696
log in with example.com, a super

00:29:16.696 --> 00:29:17.906
popular social network.

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:21.566
Now, as soon as I tap the button

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.376
the app under the hood calls in

00:29:23.376 --> 00:29:23.976
to the new

00:29:23.976 --> 00:29:25.716
ASWebAuthenticationSession API.

00:29:26.636 --> 00:29:28.316
Now, one of the ways in which

00:29:28.316 --> 00:29:30.096
ASWebAuthenticationSession makes

00:29:30.096 --> 00:29:32.406
logins faster is by sharing its

00:29:32.406 --> 00:29:33.606
underlying cookie storage with

00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:34.136
Safari.

00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:36.896
Now, of course, before we do any

00:29:36.896 --> 00:29:39.176
of this, iOS asks for explicit

00:29:39.176 --> 00:29:39.886
user consent.

00:29:40.316 --> 00:29:43.806
Upon consenting, the user is

00:29:43.806 --> 00:29:44.926
presented with a secure view

00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:46.796
controller and guided through

00:29:46.796 --> 00:29:48.266
the third party's federated

00:29:48.266 --> 00:29:49.206
authentication flow.

00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:52.576
In this case, I'm already signed

00:29:52.576 --> 00:29:55.356
into example.com in Safari on my

00:29:55.356 --> 00:29:57.046
iPhone, so all I have to do is

00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:57.656
tap Allow.

00:29:57.806 --> 00:29:59.976
There we go.

00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:02.626
And with just two taps I've gone

00:30:02.626 --> 00:30:03.816
through a full federated

00:30:03.816 --> 00:30:04.816
authentication flow with a

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:05.896
third-party service.

00:30:06.976 --> 00:30:08.736
So, in the past you may have

00:30:08.736 --> 00:30:10.376
used one of the other iOS

00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:11.886
platform technologies to

00:30:11.886 --> 00:30:12.896
implement federated

00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:14.066
authentication inside of your

00:30:14.066 --> 00:30:14.426
apps.

00:30:15.786 --> 00:30:17.226
Starting with iOS 12,

00:30:17.586 --> 00:30:19.146
ASWebAuthenticationSession is

00:30:19.146 --> 00:30:21.156
the go-to way to implement such

00:30:21.156 --> 00:30:21.606
flows.

00:30:22.126 --> 00:30:24.246
As we mentioned, already,

00:30:24.886 --> 00:30:26.566
ASWebAuthenticationSession makes

00:30:26.566 --> 00:30:28.606
login flows faster by sharing

00:30:28.606 --> 00:30:30.036
its underlying cookie storage

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:31.986
with Safari upon explicit user

00:30:31.986 --> 00:30:32.426
consent.

00:30:33.236 --> 00:30:34.636
Now, what this means is that

00:30:34.636 --> 00:30:36.216
depending on the implementation

00:30:36.216 --> 00:30:37.606
of the federated authentication

00:30:37.606 --> 00:30:38.856
flow by the third party.

00:30:39.066 --> 00:30:40.626
If your user is already signed

00:30:40.626 --> 00:30:42.376
into that service in Safari on

00:30:42.376 --> 00:30:43.966
their device, they may not even

00:30:43.966 --> 00:30:45.156
have to see a login form, at

00:30:45.156 --> 00:30:45.406
all.

00:30:47.046 --> 00:30:48.486
If they do have to see a login

00:30:48.486 --> 00:30:50.576
form ASWebAuthenticationSession

00:30:50.576 --> 00:30:52.466
supports Password Autofill and

00:30:52.466 --> 00:30:54.146
Security Code Autofill to make

00:30:54.146 --> 00:30:55.616
the experience as painless as

00:30:55.616 --> 00:30:56.046
possible.

00:30:57.506 --> 00:30:58.736
And for you developers,

00:30:58.986 --> 00:31:00.486
ASWebAuthenticationSession

00:31:00.486 --> 00:31:01.846
offers a straightforward

00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:03.906
block-based API that makes

00:31:03.906 --> 00:31:05.216
adoption super simple.

00:31:06.246 --> 00:31:08.566
So, let's take a look at it.

00:31:08.796 --> 00:31:10.596
Now, let's see how simple it is

00:31:10.656 --> 00:31:11.756
to implement federated

00:31:11.756 --> 00:31:13.116
authentication using

00:31:13.116 --> 00:31:14.706
ASWebAuthenticationSession.

00:31:16.146 --> 00:31:17.496
You're going to start off by

00:31:17.496 --> 00:31:18.546
importing the brand new

00:31:18.546 --> 00:31:19.636
AuthenticationServices

00:31:19.636 --> 00:31:20.046
framework.

00:31:20.556 --> 00:31:23.536
And then, you simply define the

00:31:23.536 --> 00:31:25.646
oauthURL as it's described to

00:31:25.646 --> 00:31:26.846
you by your third-party

00:31:26.846 --> 00:31:27.896
authentication provider.

00:31:29.366 --> 00:31:31.096
Now, following this you will

00:31:31.096 --> 00:31:31.926
create an

00:31:31.926 --> 00:31:33.306
ASWebAuthenticationSession

00:31:33.306 --> 00:31:33.786
object.

00:31:34.176 --> 00:31:36.126
You're passing the oauthURL and

00:31:36.126 --> 00:31:37.386
a callback handler that gets

00:31:37.386 --> 00:31:38.386
involved at the end of the

00:31:38.386 --> 00:31:39.396
authentication session.

00:31:40.126 --> 00:31:42.466
Now, it is crucial that you hold

00:31:42.466 --> 00:31:43.936
onto a strong reference to the

00:31:43.936 --> 00:31:45.296
authentication session object

00:31:45.476 --> 00:31:46.896
while the session is in flight.

00:31:47.376 --> 00:31:49.056
And by doing so, you also have

00:31:49.056 --> 00:31:50.636
the ability to cancel an ongoing

00:31:50.636 --> 00:31:52.836
session should you choose to do

00:31:53.736 --> 00:31:53.826
so.

00:31:54.006 --> 00:31:55.366
Finally, you call the

00:31:55.366 --> 00:31:56.736
nonblocking start method.

00:31:57.486 --> 00:31:59.956
Upon doing so, first iOS will

00:31:59.956 --> 00:32:01.606
ask for user consent to share

00:32:01.606 --> 00:32:02.656
the underlying Safari, the

00:32:02.656 --> 00:32:04.256
underlying cookie storage that

00:32:04.256 --> 00:32:05.706
Safari has with your session.

00:32:06.066 --> 00:32:07.296
And then, the user is presented

00:32:07.296 --> 00:32:08.526
with a secure view controller

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:09.876
and guided through the

00:32:09.876 --> 00:32:10.766
authentication flow.

00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:13.146
When the user completes the

00:32:13.146 --> 00:32:15.156
authentication flow or if they

00:32:15.156 --> 00:32:16.666
cancel out of the authentication

00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:18.346
session, your completion handler

00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:19.876
gets involved and you can handle

00:32:19.876 --> 00:32:20.286
the result.

00:32:20.796 --> 00:32:24.076
And that's how simple it is to

00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:25.116
implement federated

00:32:25.116 --> 00:32:27.356
authentication in iOS 12, using

00:32:27.356 --> 00:32:28.896
ASWebAuthenticationSession.

00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:30.426
It only takes a few lines of

00:32:30.486 --> 00:32:30.756
code.

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:34.356
Starting with iOS 12 this new

00:32:34.356 --> 00:32:36.796
API is the go-to way to

00:32:36.796 --> 00:32:37.856
implement federated

00:32:37.856 --> 00:32:39.966
authentication and it replaces

00:32:39.996 --> 00:32:41.546
SFAuthenticationSession.

00:32:42.386 --> 00:32:43.686
If you find that you have to

00:32:43.686 --> 00:32:45.346
support federated authentication

00:32:45.346 --> 00:32:47.246
inside of your apps, we strongly

00:32:47.246 --> 00:32:48.776
encourage you to adopt this new

00:32:48.776 --> 00:32:49.066
API.

00:32:49.776 --> 00:32:52.876
And with that, I'll turn things

00:32:52.876 --> 00:32:54.376
over back to Chelsea, to talk to

00:32:54.376 --> 00:32:56.266
you about a number of super cool

00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:57.786
new password management features

00:32:57.976 --> 00:33:00.016
that we built right into iOS 12

00:33:00.116 --> 00:33:01.216
and macOS Mojave.

00:33:01.786 --> 00:33:02.596
Thank you, very much.

00:33:03.516 --> 00:33:07.500
[ Applause ]

00:33:08.656 --> 00:33:09.396
>> Thanks, Harris.

00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:11.486
I'm really excited to tell you

00:33:11.486 --> 00:33:12.846
about some of the new features

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:14.016
that the iCloud Keychain

00:33:14.016 --> 00:33:15.566
Password Manager gives you in

00:33:15.756 --> 00:33:17.566
iOS 12 and macOS Mojave.

00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:19.536
You may have seen some of these

00:33:19.536 --> 00:33:20.426
in the State of the Union,

00:33:20.426 --> 00:33:20.836
yesterday.

00:33:21.506 --> 00:33:24.316
What we've talked about, so far,

00:33:24.716 --> 00:33:26.186
is how you can help users log

00:33:26.186 --> 00:33:27.716
into and create accounts in your

00:33:28.496 --> 00:33:28.563
app.

00:33:28.836 --> 00:33:30.456
However, there are some cases

00:33:30.456 --> 00:33:31.786
when users will be interacting

00:33:31.786 --> 00:33:33.156
with accounts for your app when

00:33:33.156 --> 00:33:34.386
they're outside of the context

00:33:34.386 --> 00:33:34.636
of your app.

00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:37.276
For these cases we've added some

00:33:37.276 --> 00:33:38.646
features to the iCloud Keychain

00:33:38.646 --> 00:33:40.086
Password Manager to make

00:33:40.086 --> 00:33:41.676
managing and interacting with

00:33:41.676 --> 00:33:42.786
these accounts a breeze.

00:33:43.426 --> 00:33:45.776
If a user needs to look up a

00:33:45.776 --> 00:33:47.266
password, they can now simply

00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:48.046
ask Siri.

00:33:48.916 --> 00:33:50.046
They'll be taken right to their

00:33:50.046 --> 00:33:51.686
password after authentication.

00:33:52.206 --> 00:33:53.286
This way, they can read off

00:33:53.286 --> 00:33:54.676
their password to type into

00:33:54.676 --> 00:33:56.886
another device that doesn't have

00:33:57.346 --> 00:33:58.586
iCloud Keychain.

00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:00.226
Some users may share account

00:34:00.226 --> 00:34:01.936
information for services like

00:34:01.936 --> 00:34:02.586
utilities.

00:34:03.796 --> 00:34:04.766
In order to share this

00:34:04.766 --> 00:34:06.316
information, users can now

00:34:06.356 --> 00:34:07.606
AirDrop passwords to their

00:34:07.606 --> 00:34:08.286
contacts.

00:34:09.016 --> 00:34:12.876
On iOS 12 the password list UI

00:34:13.036 --> 00:34:14.806
is redesigned so it's more

00:34:14.806 --> 00:34:16.196
scannable and delightful to

00:34:16.196 --> 00:34:17.545
interact with.

00:34:18.795 --> 00:34:20.976
The password list UI in macOS

00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:22.346
has been redesigned, as well.

00:34:22.496 --> 00:34:25.485
And it looks great.

00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:26.896
Another new feature of the

00:34:26.896 --> 00:34:28.716
iCloud Keychain Password Manager

00:34:29.016 --> 00:34:30.676
is it now warns users if they're

00:34:30.676 --> 00:34:32.045
reusing passwords across

00:34:32.045 --> 00:34:33.036
multiple websites.

00:34:34.396 --> 00:34:35.706
When the user taps on one of

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:37.406
these passwords they'll be given

00:34:37.406 --> 00:34:38.525
the option to change their

00:34:38.525 --> 00:34:39.876
password on the website.

00:34:40.646 --> 00:34:42.085
Automatic Strong Passwords on

00:34:42.085 --> 00:34:43.646
the web can help them update to

00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.666
using a strong unique password

00:34:45.906 --> 00:34:46.696
for that service.

00:34:47.396 --> 00:34:51.036
The Password Reuse Auditing

00:34:51.036 --> 00:34:52.726
feature is built right into the

00:34:52.726 --> 00:34:54.786
Safari Passwords List on macOS,

00:34:54.786 --> 00:34:55.196
as well.

00:34:55.676 --> 00:35:00.076
Last but not least, your tvOS

00:35:00.076 --> 00:35:01.746
apps can now offer to autofill

00:35:01.746 --> 00:35:03.266
from a nearby iOS device.

In order, to learn more about

00:35:10.656 --> 00:35:12.046
this incredibly convenient

00:35:12.046 --> 00:35:13.646
feature see the Password

00:35:15.216 --> 00:35:16.896
New in tvOS 12 session.

00:35:19.316 --> 00:35:21.266
In summary, Autofill is a

00:35:21.316 --> 00:35:23.626
powerful platform feature that

00:35:23.626 --> 00:35:24.916
helps users interact with

00:35:24.916 --> 00:35:26.896
accounts in your apps.

00:35:27.466 --> 00:35:29.566
As we discussed, the features

00:35:29.566 --> 00:35:30.936
that we talked about today may

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:32.256
work with no changes to your

00:35:33.566 --> 00:35:34.886
app, however, it's important

00:35:34.956 --> 00:35:36.026
that you test your app with

00:35:36.026 --> 00:35:37.026
these new features.

00:35:37.686 --> 00:35:39.076

00:35:39.076 --> 00:35:40.796
we discussed today.

If after applying these

00:35:42.826 --> 00:35:45.056
recommendations, Autofill is not

00:35:45.056 --> 00:35:47.076
working as you'd expect, please

00:35:47.076 --> 00:35:48.036
file a bug report.

00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:49.856
