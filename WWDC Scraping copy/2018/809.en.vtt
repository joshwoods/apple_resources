[ Applause ]

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.356
>> Good morning.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.426
Who here has an app on the store

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:25.936
that uses Apple Pencil?

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:28.936
All right, a few of you.

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:31.646
And who has an app on the store

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:32.916
with Apple Pencil features that

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:34.736
is not a drawing or a painting

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:36.136
app?

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.276
Oh, one, yes.

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.516
Well, today, not only are we

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:40.616
going to learn a few things

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:42.676
about how to make your app great

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.156
with Pencil, we're also going to

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.056
see that Pencil can be for so

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:47.586
much more than just drawing.

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:51.906
Pencil can do a lot of things

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:53.896
and it can be a bit daunting to

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:55.076
add Pencil interactions to your

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:56.596
app, especially if you've never

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:57.456
worked with it before.

00:00:58.376 --> 00:00:59.666
Today, we're going to look at

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:02.676
seven properties of Pencil that,

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:04.316
when implemented, will add

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:06.006
entire new dimensions to your

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:06.326
app.

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:08.426
And to do that, we're going to

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:10.056
add Pencil interactions to an

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:11.306
existing app.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:12.896
So, here's my app.

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:14.296
It's a fairly straightforward

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:15.036
sudoku game.

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:16.586
The puzzle screen shows the

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:17.756
current puzzle we're solving.

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:19.716
Tapping a cell brings up the

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:21.306
keyboard where the player can

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:22.686
enter a number, and there are a

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.266
number of buttons for showing or

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.566
hiding the timer, depending on

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.406
how competitive you are, for

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:29.806
getting a hint, and for changing

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:30.746
various settings about the

00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:31.306
current game.

00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.736
So, even though this is not a

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:35.416
drawing app, doesn't it seem

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:36.376
perfect for Pencil?

00:01:37.026 --> 00:01:37.806
Let's make it happen.

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:41.896
And the first thing we're going

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:43.946
to look at is that Pencil makes

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:44.506
marks.

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:46.976
I don't know about you, but if I

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:49.046
pick up a pen and I try to write

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:50.396
with it and it doesn't write, I

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:51.346
toss it out.

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:53.526
We worked really hard on Apple

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:55.186
Pencil and we don't want people

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.386
tossing out their Apple Pencil.

00:01:57.576 --> 00:01:59.696
So, don't require tapping a

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:02.106
button or entering a special

00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:04.056
mode to draw with Pencil.

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:07.706
Pencil should make a mark the

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:09.925
moment it touches the screen.

00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:13.766
When I put Pencil down, I can go

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.086
ahead and write my guess

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:15.876
immediately.

00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:21.456
Pencil is familiar; it should

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:23.116
behave consistently with what

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:24.396
people using our app have come

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:25.546
to expect.

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:28.246
This means that tapping controls

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:29.156
should behave the same whether

00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:30.376
you touch them with Pencil or

00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:31.216
your finger.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:32.816
Here, I can interact with the

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:34.846
various setting sliders using

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:36.446
Pencil just like I would with my

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:37.126
finger.

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:39.156
One thing we definitely never

00:02:39.156 --> 00:02:41.006
want to do is have controls that

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:41.676
will have different

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.496
consequences, or worse, do

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.326
nothing when tapped with Pencil

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:46.336
rather than a finger.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:48.406
This would be very unpredictable

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:49.276
and confusing.

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:53.996
Pencil has a number of sensors.

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:56.726
It can sense tilt, force, and

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:58.736
orientation, and these sensors

00:02:58.736 --> 00:02:59.826
can add layers of depth and

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:01.126
expressivity to our

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:02.646
interactions, but there are a

00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:03.666
few missteps to avoid.

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:06.436
A good way to use the sensors is

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.786
to make marks more expressive.

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:09.326
For example, the continuous

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:10.756
variation of pressure and tilt

00:03:11.096 --> 00:03:12.356
can modulate the thickness of a

00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:12.796
stroke.

00:03:13.356 --> 00:03:15.436
Or the orientation to affect the

00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:16.556
width of a marker.

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:19.886
We don't want to use sensors to

00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:21.086
affect things not directly

00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:22.176
related to Pencil input.

00:03:22.646 --> 00:03:24.096
For example, here, depending on

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:25.726
how hard we press, we get a new

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.226
puzzle of varying difficulty.

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:28.676
That's just a confusing

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:29.516
behavior.

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:31.246
Sensors should affect the kind

00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:33.546
of marks that Pencil makes, not

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:37.676
things disconnected from it.

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:39.356
Another way to handle sensor

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:40.606
data is discretely.

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:41.816
For instance, to modify the

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:42.936
input based on the pressure

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:43.366
exerted.

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:45.576
So, an idea for a game here is

00:03:45.576 --> 00:03:47.416
to let people pencil in a

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:49.416
tentative guess, depending on

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:50.166
how hard they write.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:51.876
Writing lightly lets you put in

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:53.466
a guess in lighter ink, and

00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:55.096
writing with more pressure lets

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:56.656
you commit that answer in black

00:03:56.656 --> 00:03:56.896
ink.

00:03:57.476 --> 00:04:00.746
We can think about a sensor

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:02.536
reading such as pressor as a

00:04:02.536 --> 00:04:04.606
continuum and treat it as such

00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:06.526
to modulate a quality of a mark.

00:04:08.136 --> 00:04:09.646
We can also split that continuum

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:11.246
binarily, as we just did for

00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:12.326
this pencil-in feature.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.206
In this case, we'll want to make

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:15.866
sure to give clear feedback as

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:17.096
to which side of the split we're

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:17.296
on.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.685
We definitely don't want to

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:22.026
break that continuum into more

00:04:22.026 --> 00:04:23.586
than two discrete parts though,

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:25.236
as it would become very hard to

00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:26.176
differentiate.

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:27.816
People can tell the difference

00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:29.326
between writing soft or writing

00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:30.886
hard, but they can't tell the

00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:33.096
difference between 5 or 8 or 15

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:34.146
different levels of pressure.

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.486
Handwriting is tremendously

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:42.106
expressive, and as a result, so

00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:43.216
is Pencil input.

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:45.626
As we get our game for people to

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:47.966
try, we notice that people will

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:49.276
often write slightly outside of

00:04:49.276 --> 00:04:51.376
the boundaries of a cell and

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:52.536
this is a totally normal side

00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:54.406
effect of handwriting being so

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:56.226
personal and freeform, but it

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:57.466
means we need to be flexible

00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:59.186
with how we handle input.

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:01.666
What we shouldn't do is impose

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:03.096
unnecessary constraints on

00:05:03.096 --> 00:05:04.786
input, like rejecting it if it

00:05:04.786 --> 00:05:06.136
doesn't fit perfectly within the

00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:06.446
cell.

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:08.826
So, what we're going to do here

00:05:08.986 --> 00:05:10.736
is assign the answer to the cell

00:05:10.736 --> 00:05:12.736
it covers the most and we also

00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:14.576
scale and move it to make it fit

00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:15.926
neatly into the cell, which is a

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:16.596
nice little touch.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:20.986
Now, an interesting question

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:21.666
comes up.

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:23.736
What should we do if the player

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:25.236
starts drawing or writing

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:27.066
outside of the main sudoku grid?

00:05:28.506 --> 00:05:29.586
One thing we can try doing is

00:05:29.586 --> 00:05:31.716
just nothing, but it doesn't

00:05:31.716 --> 00:05:32.576
feel very good.

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:34.026
It goes back to our earlier

00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:35.736
point about making a mark.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:37.626
It breaks the impression of

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:39.266
fluidity and it might even lead

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:40.616
some people to think that their

00:05:40.616 --> 00:05:42.036
Pencil is impaired, or the

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:43.016
battery is discharged.

00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:46.816
Something we can try is to show

00:05:46.816 --> 00:05:48.766
transient marks, marks that

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:50.516
disappear shortly after they've

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.426
been made, to communicate that

00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:53.956
everything is working fine, just

00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:55.376
the margins don't do anything

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:55.796
special.

00:05:58.016 --> 00:05:59.776
Another option we can try is to

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.876
just let people draw and

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:02.456
annotate in the margins just for

00:06:02.456 --> 00:06:02.826
fun.

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:04.446
And this could be particularly

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:05.806
great if later we add

00:06:05.806 --> 00:06:06.956
multiplayer to our game.

00:06:08.276 --> 00:06:09.616
Now, there is no right or wrong

00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:10.236
answer here.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.336
It is up to you and what you

00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:14.326
want your app to be; but doing

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:15.866
something is always better than

00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:17.546
doing nothing, even if that

00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:19.016
something is just to communicate

00:06:19.016 --> 00:06:20.336
that Pencil is working.

00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:24.666
If you're not drawing with

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:26.266
Pencil, you're writing.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.566
And because you're writing on an

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.226
iPad and not a piece of paper,

00:06:30.226 --> 00:06:31.836
we have to ask ourselves

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.176
questions about whether we want

00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:34.776
to process the input further.

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:37.666
For the case of our game, should

00:06:37.666 --> 00:06:38.726
we convert handwriting to

00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:42.356
digital or should we keep it

00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:44.896
analog as it is?

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:46.766
One reason to convert it to

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.646
digital is to be consistent with

00:06:48.646 --> 00:06:49.406
keyboard input.

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:51.716
And one reason to keep it analog

00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:53.216
is that it's fun and personal.

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:55.786
Again, here there are no right

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:56.636
or wrong answers.

00:06:57.026 --> 00:06:58.226
It will depend on your specific

00:06:58.226 --> 00:06:58.996
circumstances.

00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:00.486
You do want to keep it

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:02.046
consistent so that people using

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.326
your app know what to expect.

00:07:03.536 --> 00:07:05.746
And if we do choose to keep the

00:07:05.746 --> 00:07:07.676
input analog, it's always a good

00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:09.176
idea to digitize it under the

00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:10.736
hood to enable things like

00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:12.786
searching for text or, in the

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:14.096
case of our game, so that we can

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:15.846
validate the final answer to the

00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:20.856
puzzle the player came up with.

00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:22.346
So far, we've been talking a lot

00:07:22.346 --> 00:07:24.136
about Pencil and it can be easy

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:25.336
to forget that there is a human

00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:26.056
holding it.

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:28.636
Different people will hold and

00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:29.696
use Pencil differently.

00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:32.446
For example, if I watch a

00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:33.986
left-handed person use our game,

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.066
we'll notice that their hand and

00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:37.106
arm gets in the way of the

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:38.276
controls on the left side of the

00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:38.666
screen.

00:07:39.686 --> 00:07:40.596
The positioning of these

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:41.966
controls wasn't much of an issue

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:43.526
when our app was used primarily

00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:45.556
with touch, but it becomes an

00:07:45.556 --> 00:07:46.296
issue with Pencil.

00:07:46.876 --> 00:07:49.876
So, what we can do is move the

00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:51.616
control to the top or bottom of

00:07:51.616 --> 00:07:54.466
the screen or just make them

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:55.156
repositionable.

00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:03.546
And, finally, Pencil is really

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:04.636
great when it provides

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:05.366
shortcuts.

00:08:05.976 --> 00:08:07.076
That is, letting people do

00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:08.796
things faster by drawing and

00:08:08.796 --> 00:08:10.326
writing rather than tapping on

00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:10.766
the screen.

00:08:11.276 --> 00:08:13.686
So, how do we erase a cell in

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:14.096
our game?

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:16.226
It's a two-step process.

00:08:17.266 --> 00:08:18.896
The first step is we tap the

00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:20.936
cell we want to erase, and the

00:08:20.936 --> 00:08:22.346
second step is we press the

00:08:22.346 --> 00:08:23.056
backspace key.

00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:25.476
So, can we turn this two-step

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:27.316
interaction into a one-step

00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:28.576
interaction with Pencil?

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:31.176
Something that would feel pretty

00:08:31.176 --> 00:08:32.765
natural is letting people cross

00:08:32.765 --> 00:08:35.006
out their answer, so let's give

00:08:35.006 --> 00:08:35.556
that a try.

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:41.135
Seems to work pretty well.

00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:44.516
But, as I give my game for

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:46.076
people to try, I notice

00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:46.976
something interesting when they

00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:49.606
try to erase a cell.

00:08:49.766 --> 00:08:52.456
Some people will strike it

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:56.306
through, others will scribble it

00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:03.546
over, and yet others might draw

00:09:03.546 --> 00:09:04.686
something like an X mark.

00:09:06.986 --> 00:09:08.616
Handwriting is really

00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:10.406
expressive; different people

00:09:10.406 --> 00:09:11.246
will cross things out

00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:11.756
differently.

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:13.816
So, in this case, it's probably

00:09:13.816 --> 00:09:14.646
better not to ask people to

00:09:14.646 --> 00:09:15.556
perform a specific mark they

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:16.366
would have to remember.

00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:18.786
In addition to being hard to

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:20.116
remember, specific marks might

00:09:20.116 --> 00:09:21.166
have different meanings in

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:21.926
different cultures.

00:09:22.346 --> 00:09:24.006
For example, in the U.S., it's

00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:25.296
pretty common to use a checkmark

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:25.926
to mean correct.

00:09:26.486 --> 00:09:27.776
In other countries, that might

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.756
not mean anything or even mean

00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:30.226
incorrect.

00:09:30.646 --> 00:09:34.086
So, what we do is we just let

00:09:34.086 --> 00:09:35.456
people erase a cell by

00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:36.796
scribbling over it.

00:09:37.216 --> 00:09:39.436
Whether they slash it out, draw

00:09:39.436 --> 00:09:42.056
an X, scribble over it, draw a

00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:43.606
straight line, it doesn't

00:09:43.606 --> 00:09:43.986
matter.

00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:45.436
All of it works and erases the

00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:45.726
cell.

00:09:45.726 --> 00:09:48.946
Let's look at another two-step

00:09:48.946 --> 00:09:50.596
interaction, getting a hint.

00:09:52.396 --> 00:09:54.336
First, we'd have to tap the hint

00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:56.306
button and then we tap the cell

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:57.136
we want a hint for.

00:09:57.666 --> 00:09:59.176
And this is another interaction

00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:00.446
that we can bring down to one

00:10:00.446 --> 00:10:01.666
step using Pencil.

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:05.166
Perhaps we can let the player

00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:06.876
draw a question mark on the cell

00:10:06.876 --> 00:10:07.976
they want an answer to.

00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:09.216
And this feels pretty good.

00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:12.206
And in this case, because the

00:10:12.206 --> 00:10:13.756
question mark is mirrored in the

00:10:13.756 --> 00:10:15.786
icon of our hint button, I feel

00:10:15.786 --> 00:10:17.126
pretty good about using that

00:10:17.126 --> 00:10:22.186
mark as a shortcut for hint.

00:10:22.376 --> 00:10:23.706
Now, these seven properties are

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.726
by no means an exhaustive list

00:10:25.726 --> 00:10:27.316
of all the ways Pencil can make

00:10:27.316 --> 00:10:29.036
your app great, but I hope

00:10:29.036 --> 00:10:30.006
they've shown you a side of

00:10:30.056 --> 00:10:31.366
Pencil that perhaps you did not

00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:33.366
expect and I hope they help you

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.056
start thinking about what adding

00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:36.376
Pencil interactions would mean

00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:37.316
for your app.

00:10:37.816 --> 00:10:38.456
Thank you.
