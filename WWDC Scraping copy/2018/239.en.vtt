00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.136
>> Welcome to designing web

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:22.606
content for watchOS.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.366
My name is Wenson and I'm on the

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.066
WebKit team.

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:27.586
In watchOS 5, we're introducing

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:29.546
the ability to render rich HTML

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:31.176
content on Apple Watch using

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:31.676
WebKit.

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:34.016
Before we explore how it works,

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:35.586
let's go over a couple of the

00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:37.296
ways WebKit enriches the user

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:38.876
experience on watchOS.

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:43.206
Previously in mail, rich HTML

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:44.646
mail messages would be rendered

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.786
in a text-only format requiring

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:48.366
the user to go to another device

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.506
for the full experience.

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:52.936
New in watchOS 5, the full HTML

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:54.326
mail message can now render on

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:55.936
Apple Watch in cases where

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:57.586
text-only formatting cannot

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.066
express the full content of the

00:00:59.066 --> 00:00:59.566
message.

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:02.926
When tapping links in mail or

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:04.836
messages, we'd previously direct

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:06.396
the user to iPhone in order to

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:07.336
view the web page.

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:10.196
Also new in watchOS 5, the user

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:11.746
can now tap links to view and

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:12.996
interact with the web page

00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:14.396
directly on Apple Watch.

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.226
In this session, we'll explore

00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:21.736
the techniques WebKit uses to

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:23.206
adapt existing content to

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:25.266
watchOS and introduce a new

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.506
mechanism you can use to

00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:28.016
optimize your content for

00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:29.296
display on Apple Watch.

00:01:29.696 --> 00:01:31.206
We'll also cover some other

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:32.486
important details you need to

00:01:32.486 --> 00:01:34.126
know to ensure that users

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.316
viewing and interacting with

00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:36.656
your content will have a great

00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:37.436
experience.

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:41.446
I'd like to start by discussing

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:43.176
how WebKit works on Apple Watch.

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:47.066
Out of the box, WebKit supports

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.126
the gestures you're already

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:48.836
familiar with.

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:51.816
Turning the digital crown

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:53.406
scrolls vertically and you can

00:01:53.406 --> 00:01:54.696
also drag your finger on the

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:56.026
screen to scroll the page.

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.566
Double tapping zooms into the

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.256
page and a subsequent double tab

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.376
zooms back out.

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:07.676
Lastly, a firm press reveals

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:09.246
back and forward buttons, but

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.795
you can also swipe forwards or

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:12.036
backwards to navigate through

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:12.646
your history.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.986
It's important to note that we

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:16.276
optimized WebKit for quickly

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:17.286
consuming content.

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:19.106
Therefore, a limited set of

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.396
features are not supported at

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:20.966
this time.

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:23.206
These include video playback,

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.006
service workers, and web fonts.

00:02:26.536 --> 00:02:27.906
Now let's see how WebKit lays

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:29.616
out web pages on Apple Watch.

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:33.436
Most responsive content is

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:34.786
already well proportioned when

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:37.206
laid out at 320 CSS pixels, the

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:38.516
width of iPhone SE.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.146
We ensure that it's also

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:42.626
well-proportioned on Apple Watch

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.196
by laying out at this width and

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.766
then computing the initial scale

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.056
of the page such that the

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:48.396
content width fits within the

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:48.976
viewport.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.206
This means that text and images

00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:52.636
may appear smaller but the

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:54.046
overall layout of the page is

00:02:54.046 --> 00:02:54.626
preserved.

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:58.216
When this technique is used, the

00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:00.056
viewport meta-tags initial scale

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:01.546
is ignored in favor of an

00:03:01.546 --> 00:03:02.926
initial scale that contains the

00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:04.686
entire content of the page.

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:07.846
Additionally, inner width is

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:10.356
inflated to a minimum of 320 CSS

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:10.866
pixels.

00:03:10.896 --> 00:03:12.676
And when using media queries,

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:14.246
the device width will also

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:16.196
appear to be 320 CSS pixels

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:17.746
rather than the true width of

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:18.426
Apple Watch.

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:21.726
By shrinking to fit, we also

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:23.256
avoid horizontal scrolling on

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:24.796
pages where content is wider

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:25.616
than the viewport.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.606
These heuristics adapt existing

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:32.246
content to Apple Watch, but you

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:33.626
can override them when designing

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:34.936
content tailored for this form

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:35.366
factor.

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:37.346
Let's look at an example.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:40.596
I've written a web page that

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:42.056
contains a gallery of photos I

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:43.276
took from a recent trip to

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:44.926
Vietnam, and I'd like to share

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:45.766
it with my friends.

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:48.316
If I send them a link to this

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:49.956
page using messages, they can

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:51.036
view it on Apple Watch.

00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:52.996
Right now it's laying out at a

00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:55.036
width of 320 CSS pixels and

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:56.056
shrinking down to fit.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.286
However, I've also written this

00:03:58.286 --> 00:03:59.746
page to be responsive on Apple

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:01.686
Watch by using a media query to

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:03.476
limit my two-column layout only

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.676
to viewports larger than 320 CSS

00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:06.196
pixels.

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:09.146
Now all I need to do is tell

00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.776
WebKit that this page is already

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:12.616
optimized for Apple Watch and

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:13.556
doesn't need the default

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:14.376
adaptations.

00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:16.636
To do this, I simply include a

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:18.146
new meta-tag in the head of my

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:20.086
document with name equal to

00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:22.346
disabled-adaptations and content

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:23.126
equal to watch.

00:04:24.186 --> 00:04:25.456
I'm using this new disabled

00:04:25.456 --> 00:04:27.556
adaptations meta-tag along side

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:29.026
the existing viewport meta-tag

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:30.616
I'm already using to ensure

00:04:30.616 --> 00:04:32.506
responsive layout on iPhone and

00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:33.776
iPad.

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:35.246
This allows WebKit to treat the

00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:36.706
viewport's device width as the

00:04:36.706 --> 00:04:38.146
real width of Apple Watch.

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:42.276
Let's now switch gears and talk

00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:43.616
about some best practices for

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.446
form controls.

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.866
WebKit supports interaction with

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:48.376
form controls out-of-the-box.

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:50.626
To ensure a great experience for

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:51.836
users when designing form

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:53.496
controls and inputs, it's

00:04:53.496 --> 00:04:54.636
important to keep a couple of

00:04:54.636 --> 00:04:55.476
things in mind.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.386
First, choose the appropriate

00:04:58.386 --> 00:04:59.886
type attribute and element tag

00:04:59.886 --> 00:05:00.886
for your form controls.

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:03.046
WebKit supports a variety of

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:04.496
form control types including

00:05:04.496 --> 00:05:06.396
passwords, numeric and telephone

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:08.376
fields, date, time, and select

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:08.836
menus.

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.846
Choosing the most relevant type

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:12.106
attribute allows WebKit to

00:05:12.106 --> 00:05:13.406
present the most appropriate

00:05:13.406 --> 00:05:15.106
interface to handle user input.

00:05:16.956 --> 00:05:18.426
Secondly, it's important to note

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:20.776
that unlike iOS and macOS, input

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:22.266
methods on watchOS require

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:23.486
full-screen interaction.

00:05:24.646 --> 00:05:25.986
Label your form controls or

00:05:25.986 --> 00:05:27.346
specify aria label or

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:28.566
placeholder attributes to

00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:29.896
provide additional context in

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.176
the status bar when a

00:05:31.176 --> 00:05:32.336
full-screen input view is

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:32.826
presented.

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:36.826
Lastly, let's dive into Safari

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:37.206
Reader.

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:40.156
You may already be familiar with

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:42.346
Safari Reader, a feature on iOS

00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:44.056
and macOS that reformats text

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:45.246
heavy web pages to make them

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:45.976
easier to read.

00:05:49.686 --> 00:05:51.016
We've brought Reader to watchOS

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:52.326
5 where it automatically

00:05:52.326 --> 00:05:53.666
activates when following links

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:54.966
to text heavy web pages.

00:05:55.236 --> 00:05:57.116
It's important to ensure that

00:05:57.116 --> 00:05:58.496
Reader draws out the key parts

00:05:58.496 --> 00:05:59.896
of your web page by using

00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:01.466
semantic markup to reinforce the

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:02.886
meaning and purpose of elements

00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:03.686
in the document.

00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:05.756
Let's walk through an example.

00:06:07.076 --> 00:06:08.936
First, we indicate which parts

00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:09.846
of the page are the most

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:11.166
important by wrapping it in an

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:11.866
article tag.

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:14.166
Specifically, enclosing these

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:15.306
header elements inside the

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:16.886
article ensure that they all

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:17.686
appear in Reader.

00:06:19.326 --> 00:06:20.776
Reader also styles each header

00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:22.316
element differently depending on

00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:23.546
the value of its itemprop

00:06:23.546 --> 00:06:24.236
attribute.

00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:26.476
Using itemprop, we're able to

00:06:26.476 --> 00:06:27.596
ensure that the author,

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.466
publication date, title, and

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:30.786
subheading are prominently

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:31.216
featured.

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:36.146
This paragraph contains content

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.596
that is of strong importance and

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:38.426
other content that is

00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:41.046
emphasized, so we put this text

00:06:41.206 --> 00:06:42.896
under strong and em elements.

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:45.226
Reader recognizes these tags and

00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:46.806
preserves their semantic styles.

00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:52.726
For this image, we use figure

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:54.146
and figcaption elements to let

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:55.386
the Reader know that the image

00:06:55.386 --> 00:06:56.566
is associated with the below

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:57.056
caption.

00:06:57.826 --> 00:06:59.306
Reader then positions the image

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:00.486
alongside its caption.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.956
For this quoted paragraph, we

00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:07.276
use a blockquote element rather

00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:08.166
than a stylediv.

00:07:08.796 --> 00:07:10.096
Reader automatically styles

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.336
these blocksquote elements as

00:07:11.336 --> 00:07:11.956
appropriate.

00:07:14.616 --> 00:07:15.966
Lastly, adding open graph

00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:17.656
meta-tags gives more context to

00:07:17.656 --> 00:07:19.266
Reader and also ensures that

00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:20.536
links to the article look great

00:07:20.536 --> 00:07:21.106
when shared.

00:07:23.246 --> 00:07:24.706
For more information about open

00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:26.176
graph meta-tags and rich links,

00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:28.096
check out our video on Ensuring

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:29.306
Beautiful Rich Links.

00:07:31.446 --> 00:07:32.906
To recap this session, we've

00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:34.426
seen how WebKit adapts existing

00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:34.946
content.

00:07:34.946 --> 00:07:36.746
And we've also seen what you can

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:38.176
do to optimize content for

00:07:38.176 --> 00:07:39.306
layout in Apple Watch.

00:07:40.096 --> 00:07:41.296
Finally, we covered best

00:07:41.296 --> 00:07:43.326
practices for form controls and

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:44.936
also learned how to ensure that

00:07:44.936 --> 00:07:46.496
Reader brings out the key parts

00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:47.536
of your web page.

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:51.016
We're so excited to bring the

00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:52.986
power of the web to watchOS and

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:54.536
can't wait to see what content

00:07:54.536 --> 00:07:55.936
you create for Apple Watch.
