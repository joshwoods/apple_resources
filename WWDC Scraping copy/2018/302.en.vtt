00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.736
>> Good morning, and welcome to

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:27.826
What's New in Managing Apple

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:28.336
Devices.

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.646
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I'm very

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:31.706
pleased to be here with all of

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:32.625
you here in the hall this

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:33.906
morning, as well as those of you

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:35.506
watching this video now or in

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:36.086
the future.

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:39.036
I'd like to cover all the things

00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:40.336
that have changed in the past

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:42.036
year, since we last did this at

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:43.796
WWDC 2017.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.326
But, before we dive into all of

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:47.996
those details, I want to take a

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:49.846
moment to take stock of how far

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:52.246
we've come.

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:53.926
This year, we are very proud to

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.656
celebrate 40 years of Apple in

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:56.356
education.

00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:58.576
And, it's fascinating to see how

00:00:58.576 --> 00:00:59.516
much has changed.

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:01.906
From the audacious goal of an

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:04.956
Apple 2 in every school in 1978,

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:08.396
to an iPad or MacBook in every

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:10.546
student's hands in 2018.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.006
But, it's even more important to

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.276
consider how much has remained

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:15.916
the same over those tumultuous

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:16.626
40 years.

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:20.336
Apple had a unique insight into

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.946
how technology could inspire

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:23.086
people and unleash their

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:24.146
creative genius.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:26.536
And, we believed technology

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:27.646
could help teachers deliver

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:28.896
unique and personalized

00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:30.366
experiences to all of their

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.076
students.

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:33.236
We have never stopped believing

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:34.926
in this goal, and never stopped

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:36.586
working hard to achieve it.

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:39.756
Over the years, we have created

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:40.896
a number of tools to make it

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:42.346
easier for schools to put Apple

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:43.936
devices into the hands of each

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:44.786
of their students.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:46.446
And, I want to highlight one of

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:47.996
those now.

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:50.246
Classroom is now two years old,

00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:51.966
and teachers really appreciate

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.046
the power it puts at their

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.596
fingertips to accelerate

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.656
teaching and learning without

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:58.036
technology getting in the way.

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:00.166
But, we want to provide our

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.536
tools on whichever OS our

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:02.546
customers choose.

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.296
So, we were excited to announce

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:05.596
at our March education event,

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:07.396
that Classroom was coming to the

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:07.756
Mac.

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:10.186
And, it looks like this.

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:12.816
I think Classroom looks

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:13.926
fantastic on the Mac.

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:15.426
It has the same great feature

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:17.236
set already available on iPad,

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:18.846
plus some surprises.

00:02:19.636 --> 00:02:21.126
But, instead of describing those

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:23.016
to you, I'd like to invite Curt

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.676
and Raheel up to actually show

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:25.086
them to you.

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:25.176
Guys?

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:32.686

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.036
Team's been working hard to

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:35.186
bring the great Classroom

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:36.616
experience to the Mac, and we're

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:37.616
thrilled to share it with you

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:37.966
today.

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:40.056
To get started, I can just go to

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:41.516
Launchpad, and click on

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:41.976
Classroom.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:47.606
As you'd expect in a Mac app,

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:49.186
all the actions in Classroom for

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:50.496
Mac are available in the

00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:52.896
toolbar, from menus, and with

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:53.906
keyboard shortcuts.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:56.186
For example, I can hit Command-T

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:57.856
to bring up my teacher info.

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.546
Oh, that photo's a bit much.

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:02.566
Let's go with something a little

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:04.636
more laid back.

00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:05.726
That's better.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:11.046
I can hit Shift-Command-N to

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:12.806
bring up a new Class sheet.

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:14.456
We have all the great icons and

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:15.646
colors that teachers use in

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:16.706
Classroom for iPad.

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:18.286
I have enough Classes for this

00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:19.946
demo, so I just hit Escape to

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:20.646
dismiss that.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.976
In the Classes view, I can drag

00:03:23.976 --> 00:03:24.946
and drop to rearrange my

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:25.436
Classes.

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:28.446
And, I can just double-click to

00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:29.426
start a Class session.

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.706
In a Class session, we have all

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.006
the actions that teachers expect

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:35.316
from Classroom for iPad.

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:36.426
They're available in the

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:39.036
toolbar, from the Actions menu,

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:40.456
and of course, with keyboard

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:41.106
shortcuts.

00:03:41.676 --> 00:03:43.556
And, because this is a Mac app,

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.816
and I'm demoing on a Mac, I can

00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:47.226
use QuickTime to show you what

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:48.496
this looks like from a student's

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:49.096
perspective.

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.026
So, now on your left, we have

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:54.666
Classroom for Mac, and on the

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:56.646
right, we have Raheel's student

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:57.006
iPad.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.136
Let's navigate the students to a

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:01.986
website.

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:04.136
I hit Command-G to bring up the

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:04.946
Navigate sheet.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:06.546
Now, I could use my mouse to

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.246
pick the site to go to here.

00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:09.816
I could also use the arrow keys.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:11.966
Let's open this great National

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.686
Geographic kids' site.

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.766
So, all my student iPads are

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:17.716
taken to this site.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.046
And, I can even click this link

00:04:20.356 --> 00:04:22.076
to go to the same site in Safari

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:22.656
on my Mac.

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:24.596
Now, while I'm browsing the

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:25.566
site, I might find something

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.616
else I want to share with my

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:28.046
students, like this cool Monarch

00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:28.956
butterfly page.

00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:32.766
I can click the Share toolbar

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.576
item, choose to Share via

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:37.276
AirDrop, and in the list my

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:38.686
class, and any manual groups

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:39.716
I've created will show up.

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:40.976
So, I can share this page.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.626
Another thing that I love about

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.926
having Classroom on the Mac, is

00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:56.216
that it gives me a great way to

00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:57.666
keep my students on task.

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.116
I can see what apps they're in

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:00.606
by looking at these icons next

00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:01.516
to their avatars.

00:05:02.046 --> 00:05:03.536
And, through these Smart Groups

00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:05.646
that show what students are in

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:07.106
each app.

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:08.766
It looks like Raheel's getting

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:09.516
distracted.

00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:11.956
Brooklyn and Ella are still in

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:13.706
Safari, but it looks like

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:15.266
Raheel's browsing the App Store.

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:16.756
So, I can use another cool

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:17.796
feature of Classroom.

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:19.606
If I double-click on Raheel's

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:22.296
avatar, I can see his iPad

00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:23.806
screen on my Mac.

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:25.006
And, while I'm looking at a

00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:27.126
student's screen, I can perform

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.916
actions on just that student's

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:29.226
iPad.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.226
So, in the Actions menu, I can

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:33.516
choose Open App, and then

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:35.326
Safari, and click Open, to bring

00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:35.976
Raheel back on task.

files from their iPads to the

00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:47.316
teacher, too.

00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:49.466
For example, I can share an

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.726
image from Photos, like this

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:52.856
great bear picture I found.

All I have to do is tap the

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:56.426
Share button, and then tap

00:05:56.426 --> 00:05:57.786
Doctor C in AirDrop to share.

00:05:58.366 --> 00:06:01.106
>> When a student shares an item

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.336
with me, the Inbox button in my

00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:04.696
toolbar will light up to let me

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:05.856
know that there's something new

00:06:05.856 --> 00:06:06.166
there.

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:08.066
And, I can click to see a list

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:08.936
of shared items.

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:11.706
And, on the Mac, I can tear off

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.426
this Inbox, and place it next to

00:06:13.426 --> 00:06:14.286
my Classroom window.

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:15.206
And, this is great, because I

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:16.366
can get at the items that my

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:17.696
students are sharing with me,

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:19.036
while still keeping an eye on

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:19.936
the class as a whole.

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:22.706

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:27.256
>> I know, right?

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:28.826
It's unbearably great.

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:28.976

[ Laughter ]

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:36.326
Besides Smart Groups, I can also

00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:37.906
create groups manually in

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:38.566
Classroom.

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:40.596
I'll hit Command-N to bring up

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:42.286
the New Group sheet, enter a

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:45.416
group name, and select the

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:46.426
students to include.

00:06:47.936 --> 00:06:49.576
Manual groups are a great way to

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:50.956
get different groups of students

00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:53.146
started on different tasks.

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:55.896
When I'm done with my class

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:58.136
session, I can hit End Class.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:06:59.436
That ends my session.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:00.396
I'm presented with this great

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:01.166
Summary view.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:02.716
I can see all the apps that my

00:07:02.716 --> 00:07:04.556
students used during class, and

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:06.246
for each app, a timeline of when

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:08.336
they were in that app.

00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.996
I also see all the shared items,

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.186
like the great bear photo.

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:14.026
And, for each student, I get a

00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:15.796
timeline of all the apps they

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:16.876
were in, and when they were in

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:17.616
those apps.

00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:19.856
So, that's Classroom for Mac.

00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:21.756
We think with drag and drop,

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:24.386
keyboard navigation, toolbar

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:26.546
items, the menus and the tear

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.576
off inbox, the teachers are

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:28.786
going to love the power and

00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:30.256
convenience of having Classroom

00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:31.106
on their Macs.

00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:34.016
And, of course, any macOS Mojave

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.566
app would not be complete

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:36.976
without support for Dark Mode.

00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:43.146
So, that's Classroom for Mac.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.626
It's available in public beta

00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:46.366
now, and from the App Store this

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:46.726
fall.

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:47.356
Thank you.

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:47.976
Todd?

00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:52.776
[ Applause ]

00:07:53.276 --> 00:07:54.316
>> Thank you very much, guys.

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:55.686
Doesn't Classroom really look

00:07:55.686 --> 00:07:56.556
great in Dark Mode?

00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:57.806
I think teachers are really

00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:58.646
going to appreciate having it

00:07:58.646 --> 00:07:59.676
here, on their Macs.

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:02.096
Now, while education has been

00:08:02.096 --> 00:08:03.436
part of Apple's DNA from the

00:08:03.436 --> 00:08:05.126
very beginning of our company,

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:06.946
over time we've broadened our

00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:07.856
audience to include the

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:08.606
enterprise.

00:08:09.436 --> 00:08:11.646
And, in 2018 and beyond, we want

00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:12.846
to empower people in both

00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:14.546
schools and businesses around

00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:16.346
the world to manage all of their

00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:18.676
Apple devices, from iPad to

00:08:18.676 --> 00:08:20.796
iPhone to MacBook to Apple TV,

00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:23.066
as well as all of their apps,

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:23.856
whether they're in the App

00:08:23.856 --> 00:08:25.396
Store, or custom enterprise

00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:25.816
apps.

00:08:26.366 --> 00:08:27.756
With the same technologies and

00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:29.646
tools running on whichever OS

00:08:29.646 --> 00:08:30.376
they choose.

00:08:31.326 --> 00:08:32.846
And, that's why today I'm going

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.796
to organize the content, first

00:08:34.796 --> 00:08:36.635
covering all the developments

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:38.885
organized by the common features

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.285
available on all our OS's.

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:42.046
And then, continue through

00:08:42.046 --> 00:08:44.275
capabilities specific to one or

00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:45.026
more OS.

00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:47.216
And, just to give you a little

00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:48.606
bit of a legend ahead of time,

00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:50.376
you'll see new badges up in the

00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:51.796
upper right-hand corner on

00:08:51.796 --> 00:08:53.576
slides where all of that content

00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:55.126
is new in our fall releases.

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:56.986
There will also be specific

00:08:56.986 --> 00:08:58.636
version badges on some slides

00:08:58.666 --> 00:08:59.756
for things that have already

00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:01.946
shipped in one or more releases,

00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:04.296
and if there's a slide that has

00:09:04.296 --> 00:09:06.076
some with version badges, and

00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:07.636
some bullets without, everything

00:09:07.636 --> 00:09:09.166
without a version badge is new

00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:10.056
in a fall release.

00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:12.156
So, with that, let's get

00:09:12.156 --> 00:09:12.676
started.

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:14.846
The first thing is to get your

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:15.996
devices enrolled for remote

00:09:15.996 --> 00:09:16.546
management.

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:18.646
And, schools use Apple School

00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:19.616
Manager to do that.

00:09:20.846 --> 00:09:21.956
Take advantage of the device

00:09:21.956 --> 00:09:23.526
enrollment program to enroll all

00:09:23.526 --> 00:09:24.806
of their devices with the

00:09:24.806 --> 00:09:25.986
correct MDM server.

00:09:26.926 --> 00:09:27.766
And, I'd like to bring you up to

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:29.486
date on all the changes in Apple

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:30.826
School Manager over the past

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:31.116
year.

00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:33.726
First, I want to call out, is

00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:35.386
now every student-managed Apple

00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:37.266
ID comes with 200 gigabytes of

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:37.976
iCloud storage.

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:39.936
[ Applause ]

00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:40.466
Definitely.

00:09:40.876 --> 00:09:43.026
Creating more great content,

00:09:43.026 --> 00:09:44.876
presentations and documents.

00:09:45.466 --> 00:09:46.686
We've also made it much easier

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:47.836
for schools to create and

00:09:47.836 --> 00:09:49.396
distribute passwords for those

00:09:49.396 --> 00:09:50.596
student accounts.

00:09:52.036 --> 00:09:53.406
We've dramatically modernized

00:09:53.406 --> 00:09:54.946
and streamlined the experience

00:09:54.946 --> 00:09:56.776
of purchasing apps and books in

00:09:56.776 --> 00:09:59.136
bulk, as well as managing those

00:09:59.136 --> 00:09:59.966
licenses over time.

00:10:00.676 --> 00:10:01.976
Being able to transfer them from

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.426
one content manager to another,

00:10:03.496 --> 00:10:05.806
both within a location, and to

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.566
another location, as your needs

00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:08.096
change.

00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:10.816
And then, finally, a big

00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:12.916
customer request was to enable

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.396
you to set a default MDM server

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:16.746
for a particular device type,

00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:18.636
making it very easy to manage

00:10:18.636 --> 00:10:20.236
all of your Macs with one MDM

00:10:20.236 --> 00:10:21.966
server, and all of your iOS

00:10:21.966 --> 00:10:23.096
devices with another.

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:26.456
But, we didn't want to just make

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:28.136
all this great experience

00:10:28.136 --> 00:10:29.856
available to schools, we also

00:10:29.856 --> 00:10:30.566
wanted to bring it to the

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:31.346
enterprise.

00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:32.816
And so, I'm pleased to let you

00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:34.156
know that we have now created

00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:35.636
Apple Business Manager as well.

00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:38.276
It offers the same great

00:10:38.276 --> 00:10:39.836
features to manage accounts,

00:10:40.396 --> 00:10:42.426
purchase apps and books, and

00:10:42.426 --> 00:10:44.806
manage device enrollment, with

00:10:44.806 --> 00:10:46.386
one important caveat on the

00:10:46.386 --> 00:10:47.026
accounts.

00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:48.676
Apple Business Manager allows

00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:49.766
you to create accounts for all

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:51.246
of your administrators to manage

00:10:51.246 --> 00:10:53.236
these other features, but it

00:10:53.306 --> 00:10:54.436
doesn't not support creating

00:10:54.436 --> 00:10:55.716
managed Apple ID's for all of

00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:56.466
your employees.

00:10:57.236 --> 00:10:59.116
It does offer the same, great,

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:00.476
integrated apps and books

00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:01.926
purchasing experience, including

00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:03.296
the license management features,

00:11:03.686 --> 00:11:05.116
and all of the new features for

00:11:05.116 --> 00:11:06.326
managing device enrollment.

00:11:06.756 --> 00:11:08.716
And, it should very familiar to

00:11:08.716 --> 00:11:09.826
anyone who's ever seen Apple

00:11:09.826 --> 00:11:10.496
School Manager.

00:11:12.036 --> 00:11:13.616
To allow you to create accounts

00:11:13.616 --> 00:11:14.856
for your administrators,

00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:18.396
purchase and manage your apps

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:21.606
and books licenses, and manage

00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:23.326
your MDM servers, including

00:11:23.546 --> 00:11:24.626
default MDM type.

00:11:25.636 --> 00:11:27.336
So, until this week, Apple

00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:28.556
Business Manager has been in a

00:11:28.556 --> 00:11:29.246
private beta.

00:11:30.036 --> 00:11:31.956
But, I'm excited to let you know

00:11:31.956 --> 00:11:32.966
if you haven't seen the

00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:33.876
announcement already, we

00:11:33.876 --> 00:11:34.776
actually launched the United

00:11:34.776 --> 00:11:37.146
States yesterday, and our global

00:11:37.146 --> 00:11:38.456
launch will be in two weeks, on

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:38.976
June 20th.

00:11:39.516 --> 00:11:42.296
[ Applause ]

00:11:42.796 --> 00:11:43.686
We're very excited about

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:45.586
bringing all of this to, this

00:11:45.586 --> 00:11:47.376
integrated experience to all of

00:11:47.376 --> 00:11:48.386
our enterprise customers.

00:11:48.386 --> 00:11:50.546
So, where and when will all that

00:11:50.546 --> 00:11:50.936
happen?

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:53.906
Well, today, Apple School

00:11:53.906 --> 00:11:55.416
Manager is available in 34

00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:57.576
countries, and that's our global

00:11:57.576 --> 00:11:58.616
launch in two weeks.

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:00.666
But, we didn't stop there.

00:12:01.176 --> 00:12:02.406
I'm very excited to announce

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:03.816
that in fact, this summer we're

00:12:03.816 --> 00:12:05.556
also going to expand into 31

00:12:05.556 --> 00:12:06.936
more countries around the world,

00:12:07.406 --> 00:12:09.226
bringing us to 65 with support

00:12:09.226 --> 00:12:10.726
for Apple School Manager and now

00:12:10.726 --> 00:12:11.786
Apple Business Manager.

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:14.206
We're also adding book support

00:12:14.206 --> 00:12:16.116
in Canada and Germany, which

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:17.616
currently only support apps.

00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:20.796
So, I know the map looks great.

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:22.346
You can kind of see where the

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:23.516
expansion was, but I thought it

00:12:23.516 --> 00:12:24.726
would be much easier to actually

00:12:24.726 --> 00:12:25.916
see a list of countries, so you

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:28.456
can see if your country will now

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.406
have support for Apple School

00:12:29.406 --> 00:12:30.376
Manager and Apple Business

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:30.806
Manager.

00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:32.876
And, one thing I noticed,

00:12:32.876 --> 00:12:33.636
looking at this list of

00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:35.406
countries-- this is a World Cup

00:12:35.406 --> 00:12:36.766
year-- that seven of these

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:38.076
countries actually have a team

00:12:38.076 --> 00:12:40.086
in the World Cup, unlike, sadly,

00:12:40.086 --> 00:12:42.236
my country, United States, but

00:12:42.236 --> 00:12:43.496
that means I'm in the market for

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:44.026
a new team.

00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:44.976
So, go Iceland.

00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:49.636
[ Laughter ]

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:51.286
I wanted to tell you also about

00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:52.596
another expansion of one of our

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:54.096
deployment program features.

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:56.276
You can add credit to your

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.206
account via purchase order to

00:12:58.206 --> 00:12:59.396
allow you then to purchase apps

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:00.126
and books later.

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:02.576
Purchasing from either Apple or

00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:03.336
a reseller.

00:13:04.136 --> 00:13:06.156
And, we have just launched last

00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:07.466
week in 10 new countries in

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:07.766
Europe.

00:13:08.036 --> 00:13:09.436
Again, here's the list.

00:13:09.606 --> 00:13:11.616
I believe that doubles our

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.426
access to this program as well.

00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:15.346
The next slide is an evergreen

00:13:15.346 --> 00:13:15.986
topic.

00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:17.346
Every year we add new Setup

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:18.726
Assistant panes in one or more

00:13:18.726 --> 00:13:20.086
of our OS's, and this year is no

00:13:20.086 --> 00:13:20.656
exception.

00:13:21.116 --> 00:13:22.176
And, we continue to want to

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.436
enable organizations to

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:24.846
configure the experience they

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.346
provide to their users as they

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:27.616
set up their devices.

00:13:28.436 --> 00:13:30.136
So, in the spring's release, we

00:13:30.136 --> 00:13:31.876
added a new privacy pane on all

00:13:31.876 --> 00:13:32.726
three OS's.

00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:36.666
We also added a new iCloud

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:38.106
storage pane for macOS.

00:13:39.136 --> 00:13:41.096
And, two new panes for tvOS.

00:13:42.806 --> 00:13:44.596
And, in iOS 12, there'll be new

00:13:44.596 --> 00:13:45.746
panes configuring some of the

00:13:45.746 --> 00:13:47.196
new features, some of which you

00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:48.366
heard about earlier this week.

00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:49.976
We want to continue to give you

00:13:49.976 --> 00:13:52.376
that option to get your users

00:13:52.376 --> 00:13:53.526
right to the desktop or home

00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:54.836
screen as quickly as possible.

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:57.746
So, next, I'd like to cover two

00:13:57.746 --> 00:13:59.396
updates for how MDM servers

00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.746
should handle both enrolling

00:14:00.746 --> 00:14:02.516
devices, as well as ongoing

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:04.476
communication with each of those

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.716
enrolled devices, starting with

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.496
Apple Push Notification service.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:10.926
So, if your MDM solution is

00:14:10.926 --> 00:14:12.496
still using the Legacy Binary

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:15.216
Provider API, we definitely want

00:14:15.216 --> 00:14:16.676
you to adopt the new, modern,

00:14:16.676 --> 00:14:18.896
HTTP/2 API, which is far more

00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:19.836
capable and efficient.

00:14:20.556 --> 00:14:21.856
You can read all about it in the

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:23.486
Communicating with APNs section

00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:24.986
of the Networking documentation.

00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:26.926
And, since I brought up

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.306
documentation, I wanted to take

00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:30.736
a moment here to calm the waters

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:33.226
about the MDM and Profile

00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:34.016
documentation.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.146
The documentation team is going

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:37.096
through a publishing tools

00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:39.176
transition, and the disclaimer

00:14:39.176 --> 00:14:40.056
that you might have noticed

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:41.076
looking at the documentation

00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:42.566
this week is not an indication

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:44.096
of any change in commitment to

00:14:44.096 --> 00:14:45.106
providing up-to-date

00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:46.706
documentation for all these

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:47.376
technologies.

00:14:48.056 --> 00:14:49.536
In fact, the only reason you saw

00:14:49.536 --> 00:14:50.596
that disclaimer is because we

00:14:50.596 --> 00:14:52.456
did update both guides on Monday

00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:54.336
for both the MDM protocol, and

00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:55.486
the Configuration Profile

00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:57.356
reference to cover the changes

00:14:57.356 --> 00:14:59.746
I'm going to talk about today.

00:15:01.386 --> 00:15:02.866
So, next topic is security.

00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:03.906
There'll be number of these

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:04.926
throughout today's session.

00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:06.416
This is something that Bob

00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:08.046
talked about last year, that we

00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:09.296
were going to begin requiring

00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:10.916
transport security this year.

00:15:11.206 --> 00:15:12.336
And, in fact, we're going to do

00:15:12.336 --> 00:15:14.446
that in both iOS and macOS this

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:14.636
year.

00:15:16.156 --> 00:15:17.466
Your SCEP server should make

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:19.076
sure to advertise its

00:15:19.076 --> 00:15:20.686
capabilities, so that we know

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.296
what the highest level of

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.506
security you support, and don't

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.386
have to fall back to a lower

00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:27.286
security encryption algorithm.

00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:30.966
We stopped supporting DES last

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:31.206
year.

00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:33.146
Definitely supports one of the

00:15:33.146 --> 00:15:35.326
modern and much more secure

00:15:35.656 --> 00:15:36.296
algorithms.

00:15:37.906 --> 00:15:39.106
This year, I also wanted to give

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:40.406
you a note on how you can verify

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.496
that your server is ready for

00:15:41.496 --> 00:15:43.116
this transition as we roll out

00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:44.246
the new versions of iOS and

00:15:44.246 --> 00:15:45.036
macOS this year.

00:15:45.676 --> 00:15:48.796
You can use NSCurl against each

00:15:48.796 --> 00:15:49.906
of the URL's that your server

00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:52.126
supports, and verify that there

00:15:52.126 --> 00:15:53.156
are no issues that the

00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:54.466
diagnostics find.

00:15:55.346 --> 00:15:58.096
Now, let's turn to the new

00:15:58.096 --> 00:15:59.596
management controls, commands

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:00.256
and settings.

00:16:00.546 --> 00:16:01.686
And, I'd like to start, again,

00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:02.576
with everything that's supported

00:16:02.576 --> 00:16:04.066
on two or more of our OS's.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.766
You may have heard about some of

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:08.806
the new password features that

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:10.316
we're introducing in this fall's

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:12.146
iOS and macOS releases.

00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:13.376
And, of course, we want to

00:16:13.376 --> 00:16:15.046
enable you to manage them, via

00:16:15.046 --> 00:16:15.626
profile.

00:16:16.296 --> 00:16:17.896
So, the great new automatic

00:16:17.896 --> 00:16:19.766
strong passwords and AutoFill

00:16:19.766 --> 00:16:21.416
features within Safari and

00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:23.086
within apps, we have a new

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:24.616
password AutoFill restriction

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:27.366
that also covers the existing

00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:28.606
Safari AutoFill feature and

00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:29.176
restriction.

00:16:30.346 --> 00:16:32.016
We've also added a new password

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:34.066
sharing restriction that covers

00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:35.936
all versions of the password

00:16:35.936 --> 00:16:37.476
sharing feature, including the

00:16:37.476 --> 00:16:39.156
previous WiFi password sharing.

00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:40.936
And, this restriction prevents

00:16:40.936 --> 00:16:42.306
you from sharing your password

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:42.996
with others.

00:16:44.196 --> 00:16:45.376
The last bullet on the slide,

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.856
password proximity requests.

00:16:47.416 --> 00:16:49.106
This restriction actually is

00:16:49.106 --> 00:16:50.536
supported on tvOS as well,

00:16:50.866 --> 00:16:52.646
because this feature, or this

00:16:52.646 --> 00:16:54.436
restriction, prevents your

00:16:54.436 --> 00:16:56.016
device asking others for their

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:56.566
password.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.236
And, if you didn't attend, you

00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:01.306
can check out the video of the

00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:02.696
password and AutoFill session

00:17:02.696 --> 00:17:03.736
which occurred earlier this

00:17:03.736 --> 00:17:03.996
week.

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:08.146
We added a new restriction to

00:17:08.146 --> 00:17:09.685
prevent users from modifying the

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:11.326
Bluetooth restriction last fall.

00:17:11.846 --> 00:17:13.226
And, in the spring, we added a

00:17:13.226 --> 00:17:14.336
new MDM command to actually be

00:17:14.336 --> 00:17:15.866
able to set the value of that

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:16.256
setting.

00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:17.896
And, I'm even more pleased to

00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:19.256
let you know that it's not in

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.935
Seed 1, but I saw the change go

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:22.776
in yesterday, that this command

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:24.146
will now work even if you have

00:17:24.146 --> 00:17:25.296
that restriction in place.

00:17:25.736 --> 00:17:26.786
And, we think this will be great

00:17:26.786 --> 00:17:29.546
for schools deploying Classroom,

00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:31.366
and in other situations where

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:32.336
you want to make sure that

00:17:32.336 --> 00:17:33.796
Bluetooth is enabled, or

00:17:33.796 --> 00:17:36.066
disabled, as the case may be.

00:17:37.346 --> 00:17:39.176
Big customer request, we have

00:17:39.176 --> 00:17:41.556
enabled OAuth authentication for

00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:42.856
exchange accounts configured via

00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:43.386
profile.

00:17:44.156 --> 00:17:46.986
That's in iOS 12, and in macOS

00:17:46.986 --> 00:17:47.316
Mojave.

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:50.256
And, a really big one, managed

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:52.056
software updates that we brought

00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:53.566
to both OS's this spring.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.246
Thank you.

00:17:55.496 --> 00:17:56.706
One person's excited about that.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:59.376
And when I talked-- just because

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:00.656
I'm excited about it, talk a

00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:01.776
little bit more in detail.

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:02.936
It consists of two different

00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:04.786
restrictions, one to enable the

00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:06.286
feature in the first place, to

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.436
put the device so that it will

00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:09.826
delay when the user will see a

00:18:09.826 --> 00:18:11.216
new update once we release it.

00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:13.456
And, an optional parameter that

00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:14.436
you can configure the delay

00:18:14.436 --> 00:18:16.816
period from 1 day to up to 90

00:18:16.816 --> 00:18:17.276
days.

00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:19.586
If you don't specify that

00:18:19.886 --> 00:18:22.426
setting, it defaults to 30 days.

00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:25.466
The scheduleOSUpdate command has

00:18:25.466 --> 00:18:26.746
been supported on both platforms

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:28.696
for a long time, and on macOS,

00:18:28.696 --> 00:18:29.666
it's always allowed you to

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:30.896
specify which update you

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:32.336
actually wanted to install on

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:32.626
that Mac.

00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:35.286
But, in iOS 12-- I'm sorry, this

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.626
spring, in iOS, we added the

00:18:37.626 --> 00:18:39.106
ability to specify a version

00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:41.436
number for just the iOS version

00:18:41.436 --> 00:18:42.456
that you have tested with all

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:43.716
the software important for your

00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:45.006
organization's devices.

00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:47.356
Wq also added a new Apple

00:18:47.356 --> 00:18:49.036
software lookup service, so that

00:18:49.036 --> 00:18:50.976
your MDM server can look up the

00:18:50.976 --> 00:18:52.536
eligible versions for a

00:18:52.776 --> 00:18:53.766
particular device at a

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:54.576
particular time.

00:18:55.096 --> 00:18:56.996
And, we have documented that API

00:18:57.186 --> 00:18:58.806
to look that up, so that your

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.426
MDM solution can populate the UI

00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:01.516
presented to the admin.

00:19:01.856 --> 00:19:07.376
It's in the MDM protocol guide.

00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:09.126
Alright. And, that brings us to

00:19:09.126 --> 00:19:10.416
the end of our common section.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:11.496
And now, I'd like to talk about

00:19:11.496 --> 00:19:12.936
some iOS-specific changes.

00:19:13.646 --> 00:19:14.806
Again, starting with security.

00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:17.206
Now, some of you may have heard

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:18.986
about this change that we

00:19:19.276 --> 00:19:21.356
started to make in iOS 11.3, and

00:19:21.356 --> 00:19:24.056
now it's back in 11.4.1, and iOS

00:19:24.056 --> 00:19:24.376
12.

00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:25.836
And, of course, we wanted to

00:19:25.836 --> 00:19:27.096
make this manageable as well,

00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:29.296
beyond the switch that's in the

00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:30.916
UI in iOS 12.

00:19:31.636 --> 00:19:33.206
So, there's a new restriction

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:34.616
that allows you to control this

00:19:34.616 --> 00:19:35.946
feature, and whether USB

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:37.226
accessories can still connect

00:19:37.226 --> 00:19:38.496
devices if they're locked.

00:19:39.836 --> 00:19:41.316
And, of course, Configurator

00:19:41.316 --> 00:19:42.996
kind of relies on devices being

00:19:42.996 --> 00:19:44.856
able to connect via USB, so we

00:19:44.856 --> 00:19:46.056
have implemented a special

00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:47.486
behavior for those devices.

00:19:48.016 --> 00:19:49.216
When Configurator prepares a

00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:51.596
device to supervise it, but not

00:19:51.596 --> 00:19:53.346
enroll it in MDM, it will

00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:54.976
automatically install a profile

00:19:55.516 --> 00:19:56.776
that installs this restriction,

00:19:56.776 --> 00:19:58.566
and allows those devices to

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.386
continue connecting to the Mac

00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:00.976
running Configurator.

00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:07.186
Alright. Another topic which is

00:20:07.186 --> 00:20:08.326
not new, we've talked about it

00:20:08.326 --> 00:20:10.076
for a number of years, last year

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:10.686
Prodop [assumed spelling] told

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:12.266
you that we are going to start

00:20:12.776 --> 00:20:14.226
honoring the certain set of

00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:15.746
restrictions which were created

00:20:15.746 --> 00:20:17.366
before supervision existed, but

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:18.736
really should only be honored on

00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:19.876
supervised devices.

00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:21.886
I want to make clear that these

00:20:21.886 --> 00:20:23.356
restrictions are not going away.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.366
They're still going to be

00:20:25.696 --> 00:20:27.086
usable, but they will only be

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:28.886
honored on supervised devices.

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:31.156
But, after hearing your

00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:33.716
feedback, we decided to delay

00:20:33.856 --> 00:20:35.226
one more year, and we'll make

00:20:35.226 --> 00:20:36.516
this change next year to help

00:20:36.516 --> 00:20:37.926
make a smooth transition.

00:20:38.396 --> 00:20:39.366
And, we've also come up with an

00:20:39.366 --> 00:20:40.786
upgrade and migration policy

00:20:40.786 --> 00:20:41.746
that we think will further

00:20:41.746 --> 00:20:43.086
smooth this transition.

00:20:43.996 --> 00:20:46.236
Essentially, if a device which

00:20:46.236 --> 00:20:48.446
is not supervised has one or

00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:49.716
more of these restrictions in

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:51.576
place, they will continue to be

00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:53.896
honored even after upgrading to

00:20:53.896 --> 00:20:55.966
the iOS version that includes

00:20:55.966 --> 00:20:57.666
this change until they're wiped.

00:20:58.846 --> 00:20:59.876
So, we'll remember, and we'll

00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:00.976
continue to allow you to use

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:02.366
them until that device is wiped,

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:03.506
allowing you to time your

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:05.476
refresh more conveniently.

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.066
Of course, any new device

00:21:07.216 --> 00:21:08.816
configured, or if you wipe the

00:21:08.816 --> 00:21:09.696
device and restore from a

00:21:09.696 --> 00:21:11.076
backup, they will get the new

00:21:11.076 --> 00:21:12.466
behavior, where each of these

00:21:12.466 --> 00:21:14.086
restrictions is only honored if

00:21:14.086 --> 00:21:15.156
the device is supervised.

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:16.456
But, of course, if you're wiping

00:21:16.456 --> 00:21:17.506
a device, that's a great

00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:18.536
opportunity to go ahead and

00:21:18.536 --> 00:21:19.586
supervise it before you

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:20.786
configure it again.

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:24.596
Just to refresh your memory,

00:21:24.596 --> 00:21:26.816
this is the list with one minor

00:21:26.816 --> 00:21:28.146
change that we took advantage of

00:21:28.146 --> 00:21:28.966
the fact that we're giving you

00:21:28.966 --> 00:21:29.736
one more year.

00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:31.576
That in fact, the three Siri

00:21:31.576 --> 00:21:33.966
restrictions should also only be

00:21:33.966 --> 00:21:35.396
honored on supervised devices,

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:37.986
so this is the list, and we

00:21:37.986 --> 00:21:39.436
really mean it this time.

00:21:39.436 --> 00:21:40.386
We're going to do it next year.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.106
Be prepared.

00:21:44.456 --> 00:21:46.326
Alright. Managed Open In, it's a

00:21:46.326 --> 00:21:48.726
great feature, most-- more used

00:21:48.726 --> 00:21:50.416
in enterprises, and we've made a

00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:51.686
number of improvements, both in

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:55.746
iOS 11.3, and iOS 12, to make

00:21:55.746 --> 00:21:56.866
sure that the boundary we've

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:58.466
established between managed apps

00:21:58.596 --> 00:22:00.796
and unmanaged apps and sharing

00:22:00.796 --> 00:22:03.086
files and data between them is--

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.386
behaves the way everyone would

00:22:04.386 --> 00:22:04.856
expect.

00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:07.346
This included making the context

00:22:07.346 --> 00:22:09.076
API respect the boundary in iOS

00:22:09.076 --> 00:22:09.856
11.3.

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:11.606
Which of course was exactly what

00:22:11.606 --> 00:22:13.496
many customers wanted, but we

00:22:13.496 --> 00:22:15.536
know that that did have some

00:22:15.686 --> 00:22:17.196
challenges for some

00:22:17.246 --> 00:22:18.076
organizations that were

00:22:18.076 --> 00:22:19.616
deploying in a specific way.

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:21.076
And, I'd just like to make

00:22:21.076 --> 00:22:23.056
clear, that if you are using

00:22:23.056 --> 00:22:24.786
Managed Open In, and want a

00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:26.676
managed app to manage Contacts,

00:22:27.096 --> 00:22:28.606
you need to deploy that managed

00:22:28.606 --> 00:22:29.816
Contacts source as a managed

00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:30.356
source.

00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:33.666
Alright. Now, let's turn to some

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:35.336
of the new settings we've been

00:22:35.596 --> 00:22:37.566
adding in this year's software

00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:38.036
releases.

00:22:38.596 --> 00:22:39.616
A bunch of things we added in

00:22:39.716 --> 00:22:40.766
iOS 11.3.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:43.776
I already mentioned allow USB

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:44.826
accessories while device is

00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:47.246
locked restriction, completing

00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:49.646
our set of restrictions to allow

00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:51.946
you to get classroom behavior on

00:22:51.946 --> 00:22:53.406
a supervised device, even if

00:22:53.406 --> 00:22:54.756
it's a teacher-created class.

00:22:54.876 --> 00:22:57.276
We'll talk a little bit more

00:22:57.276 --> 00:22:58.966
about the remote pairing later

00:22:58.966 --> 00:23:00.176
on in the tvOS section.

00:23:00.756 --> 00:23:02.156
And, that last one I really

00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:03.276
wanted to mention, because this

00:23:03.276 --> 00:23:04.746
is, again, another long-standing

00:23:04.746 --> 00:23:06.736
customer request, that both

00:23:06.736 --> 00:23:07.906
schools and businesses love the

00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:09.656
Home Screen layout payload, but

00:23:09.656 --> 00:23:11.216
they were also using WebClips.

00:23:11.666 --> 00:23:13.956
And now, in iOS 11.3, you can

00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:15.496
use WebClips in Home Screen

00:23:15.496 --> 00:23:15.976
layout payload.

00:23:16.516 --> 00:23:19.776
[ Applause ]

00:23:20.276 --> 00:23:22.706
Thank you very much.

00:23:22.876 --> 00:23:24.396
Moving on to the changes in iOS

00:23:24.396 --> 00:23:24.756
12.

00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:26.486
Added a couple of new

00:23:26.826 --> 00:23:28.196
notification types to the

00:23:28.196 --> 00:23:29.236
Notifications payload.

00:23:29.746 --> 00:23:30.716
And, another big customer

00:23:30.716 --> 00:23:33.296
request, we had a lot of schools

00:23:33.296 --> 00:23:34.556
in particular that wanted to

00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:35.646
prevent students from changing

00:23:35.646 --> 00:23:37.126
the date and time, and there's a

00:23:37.126 --> 00:23:39.296
new restriction that essentially

00:23:39.506 --> 00:23:41.156
turns on set date and time

00:23:41.156 --> 00:23:43.116
automatically on supervised

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:43.686
devices.

00:23:44.206 --> 00:23:45.626
Now, this feature will, of

00:23:45.626 --> 00:23:46.826
course, only work if we can

00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:48.296
reach the time server, or a cell

00:23:48.296 --> 00:23:50.116
tower, or location services is

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:50.516
enabled.

00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:52.826
But, with that caveat, we think

00:23:52.826 --> 00:23:56.866
this is going to meet the need.

00:23:57.066 --> 00:23:57.876
We've also made a lot of

00:23:57.876 --> 00:23:59.356
improvements to how S/MIME is

00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:01.316
managed for Mail and Exchange

00:24:01.316 --> 00:24:03.016
accounts configured via profile.

00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:06.156
Giving users more flexibility

00:24:06.156 --> 00:24:07.496
about when to sign and encrypt,

00:24:07.906 --> 00:24:09.566
as well as an important changes

00:24:09.566 --> 00:24:11.406
to allow them to update the

00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:12.526
certificates that they're using

00:24:12.526 --> 00:24:13.436
for either feature.

00:24:13.676 --> 00:24:15.216
Even when their account has been

00:24:15.216 --> 00:24:16.316
configured via profile.

00:24:17.626 --> 00:24:18.926
We also took the opportunity to

00:24:18.926 --> 00:24:20.216
rename a number of keys to

00:24:20.216 --> 00:24:21.326
clarify the purpose.

00:24:21.366 --> 00:24:22.556
Of course, the existing keys are

00:24:22.556 --> 00:24:23.626
still honored for now.

00:24:23.716 --> 00:24:24.326
But, please check the

00:24:24.326 --> 00:24:25.956
documentation and update your

00:24:25.956 --> 00:24:26.816
implementations.

00:24:28.996 --> 00:24:30.436
There's also a number of new

00:24:30.436 --> 00:24:32.596
settings in the VPN payload for

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.636
configuring IKEv2 connections,

00:24:36.336 --> 00:24:37.796
managing your DNS server

00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:38.316
settings.

00:24:41.366 --> 00:24:44.396
And, one important option that

00:24:44.396 --> 00:24:45.586
we added to the Erase Device

00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:46.086
command.

00:24:46.676 --> 00:24:48.226
Allows you to skip proximity set

00:24:48.226 --> 00:24:49.156
up on your way back through

00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:50.506
Setup Assistant, further

00:24:50.506 --> 00:24:51.756
configuring the device

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:53.076
enrollment experience for an end

00:24:53.076 --> 00:24:53.486
user.

00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:55.226
This is really important for

00:24:55.226 --> 00:24:57.716
deployments for guests that are

00:24:57.716 --> 00:24:59.056
using your devices, and if

00:24:59.056 --> 00:25:00.256
you're using device enrollment

00:25:00.256 --> 00:25:02.306
to provide a fresh experience

00:25:02.306 --> 00:25:03.636
for each new guest using that

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:05.486
particular iPad or other device.

00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:08.216
Thank you, Eric.

00:25:10.696 --> 00:25:12.406
And, finally, due to macOS

00:25:12.406 --> 00:25:13.966
server deprecation, we have

00:25:13.966 --> 00:25:15.336
removed support for the macOS

00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:16.956
server account payload in iOS

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:17.336
12.

00:25:17.786 --> 00:25:18.946
If you're still using some of

00:25:18.946 --> 00:25:20.006
those services as you're

00:25:20.006 --> 00:25:21.506
transitioning to a new solution,

00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:23.846
you can replace those account

00:25:23.846 --> 00:25:25.006
configurations with normal

00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:25.846
account payloads.

00:25:26.586 --> 00:25:28.806
Next, I'd like to give you a few

00:25:28.806 --> 00:25:30.516
tips on troubleshooting issues

00:25:30.516 --> 00:25:31.876
with delivering and executing

00:25:31.876 --> 00:25:33.296
MDM commands on enrolled iOS

00:25:33.296 --> 00:25:33.846
devices.

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.076
There are a number of logging

00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:37.396
profiles which you can obtain at

00:25:37.396 --> 00:25:38.206
the link at the bottom of the

00:25:38.206 --> 00:25:38.716
screen.

00:25:39.116 --> 00:25:40.496
And, all of the URL's are going

00:25:40.496 --> 00:25:41.376
to be available at the More

00:25:41.376 --> 00:25:42.636
Information link, which will be

00:25:42.636 --> 00:25:43.766
at the end of the session, so

00:25:43.766 --> 00:25:45.006
you don't have to feverishly

00:25:45.006 --> 00:25:45.836
copy those down.

00:25:47.146 --> 00:25:48.306
Depending on what type of a

00:25:48.306 --> 00:25:49.346
problem you're investigation,

00:25:49.346 --> 00:25:51.006
you can install either both the

00:25:51.006 --> 00:25:52.576
MDM and/or the Apple Push

00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:54.626
Notification service profiles.

00:25:55.286 --> 00:25:56.236
Once you've reproduced the

00:25:56.236 --> 00:25:57.866
problem, you can get those logs

00:25:57.986 --> 00:25:59.106
using Console or Apple

00:25:59.106 --> 00:26:00.026
Configurator 2.

00:26:01.146 --> 00:26:02.696
And then, look through the logs

00:26:03.056 --> 00:26:04.386
by process, depending on what

00:26:04.386 --> 00:26:05.096
kind of a problem you're

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:05.796
investigating.

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.666
Whether you're looking at

00:26:08.726 --> 00:26:09.936
communication, or connection

00:26:09.936 --> 00:26:10.656
issues.

00:26:11.356 --> 00:26:13.466
Installing profiles or apps, or

00:26:13.466 --> 00:26:14.616
working with Shared iPad.

00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:19.356
Now, next I'd like to turn to

00:26:19.356 --> 00:26:20.586
cover some topics that are a

00:26:20.586 --> 00:26:22.176
particular interest to app

00:26:22.216 --> 00:26:23.306
developers, who would like to

00:26:23.306 --> 00:26:24.406
sell their apps to schools and

00:26:24.406 --> 00:26:24.936
businesses.

00:26:25.646 --> 00:26:26.896
Or, as I like to call it in

00:26:26.896 --> 00:26:28.096
honor of the biggest fan of

00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:30.336
initial iPhone, say it with me,

00:26:30.496 --> 00:26:31.576
the developers, developers,

00:26:31.576 --> 00:26:32.576
developers section.

00:26:34.996 --> 00:26:36.166
I'll first cover some topics

00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:37.556
specific to education apps,

00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:38.986
before continuing with some

00:26:38.986 --> 00:26:40.246
topics for enterprise apps.

00:26:41.076 --> 00:26:43.536
At our education event in

00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:45.666
Chicago in March, we announced a

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:46.986
brand-new app for teachers

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:47.906
called Schoolwork.

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:50.936
Schoolwork allows teachers to

00:26:50.936 --> 00:26:52.456
easily share content with their

00:26:52.456 --> 00:26:54.686
students, leveraging the power

00:26:54.686 --> 00:26:55.596
of your apps.

00:26:56.086 --> 00:26:58.766
And then, they can view student

00:26:58.766 --> 00:26:59.956
progress across all of their

00:26:59.956 --> 00:27:01.296
work within those great apps.

00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:03.356
Helping them to tailor

00:27:03.356 --> 00:27:04.806
instruction to the needs of each

00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:05.676
of their students.

00:27:06.806 --> 00:27:08.686
And, also allowing them to

00:27:08.686 --> 00:27:10.126
collaborate and provide instant

00:27:10.126 --> 00:27:11.466
feedback on what their students

00:27:11.526 --> 00:27:13.396
are learning quickly, and where

00:27:13.396 --> 00:27:14.206
they might need a bit more

00:27:14.206 --> 00:27:14.666
support.

00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:17.956
Now, all of this is based upon a

00:27:17.956 --> 00:27:19.316
new framework called ClassKit.

00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:21.806
And, that's where you come in.

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:23.726
Apps which adopt ClassKit

00:27:23.726 --> 00:27:25.106
integrate with Schoolwork in

00:27:25.106 --> 00:27:26.466
order to help teachers discover

00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:27.726
assignable activities within

00:27:27.726 --> 00:27:29.686
your app, to take students

00:27:29.686 --> 00:27:31.236
directly to the right activity

00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:32.316
for what they're supposed to be

00:27:32.316 --> 00:27:32.946
working on.

00:27:33.636 --> 00:27:34.616
And, most importantly to

00:27:34.616 --> 00:27:36.376
securely and privately share

00:27:36.376 --> 00:27:38.136
that progress data as they work

00:27:38.136 --> 00:27:39.726
through those tasks with their

00:27:39.726 --> 00:27:40.326
teachers.

00:27:41.386 --> 00:27:42.416
Now, they had a session

00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:43.486
yesterday, and I encourage you

00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:44.496
to watch their video.

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:47.106
Alright. While I have,

00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:48.456
hopefully, your attention, I'll,

00:27:48.516 --> 00:27:49.766
you know-- MDM developers are

00:27:49.766 --> 00:27:51.546
developers too, so this is

00:27:51.646 --> 00:27:52.556
really more for them.

00:27:52.946 --> 00:27:54.116
But, I wanted to make sure I

00:27:54.116 --> 00:27:55.146
kept their attention.

00:27:55.146 --> 00:27:56.316
They didn't start tuning me out.

00:27:57.666 --> 00:27:59.506
So, the Roster API is how MDM

00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:01.226
servers can get class

00:28:01.226 --> 00:28:02.656
information from Apple School

00:28:02.656 --> 00:28:03.156
Manager.

00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:06.096
And, we have had this class name

00:28:06.096 --> 00:28:06.916
field for a while.

00:28:07.286 --> 00:28:08.346
And, we want to encourage you to

00:28:08.346 --> 00:28:10.176
use that as a display name in

00:28:10.176 --> 00:28:12.036
your MDM console, as well as

00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:13.526
what you pass along to Classroom

00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:15.096
via the education payload, the

00:28:15.096 --> 00:28:16.456
configure managed classes.

00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:18.146
This is because Schoolwork is

00:28:18.146 --> 00:28:19.656
using that field, and we'd like

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:20.686
to achieve a consistent

00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:21.986
experience for teachers using

00:28:21.986 --> 00:28:22.676
both apps.

00:28:23.376 --> 00:28:24.516
The reason you might not be

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:26.086
already doing this, is because

00:28:26.086 --> 00:28:27.916
of class name's history.

00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:31.056
Before January, it was there in

00:28:31.056 --> 00:28:32.326
the API, but we actually didn't

00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:33.006
return a value.

00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:35.926
In January, we began returning a

00:28:35.926 --> 00:28:37.236
value that was derived using

00:28:37.236 --> 00:28:39.006
logic in Apple School Manager.

00:28:39.606 --> 00:28:41.976
But, this month, we're going to

00:28:41.976 --> 00:28:43.296
start allowing administrators to

00:28:43.296 --> 00:28:45.036
configure that name based on how

00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:46.756
the school names their classes,

00:28:46.756 --> 00:28:47.956
and what the teacher will expect

00:28:48.616 --> 00:28:49.436
right within Apple School

00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:49.876
Manager.

00:28:50.466 --> 00:28:51.656
So, again, if you're not

00:28:51.656 --> 00:28:52.756
currently using that to

00:28:52.756 --> 00:28:54.136
configure the education payload

00:28:54.136 --> 00:28:56.586
for Classroom, please start, so

00:28:56.586 --> 00:28:57.706
we can achieve that great

00:28:57.706 --> 00:28:58.806
experience for teachers.

00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:03.826
Want to, again, remind you about

00:29:03.826 --> 00:29:04.596
shared iPad.

00:29:04.596 --> 00:29:06.486
If you want your app to be used

00:29:06.486 --> 00:29:08.796
in Shared iPad, need to make

00:29:08.796 --> 00:29:10.226
sure that it doesn't depend on

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:11.756
any data being available locally

00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:12.616
on a new device.

00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:14.046
When a student moves, and signs

00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:15.486
into a new Shared iPad.

00:29:16.596 --> 00:29:18.116
Persist all of the app data to

00:29:18.116 --> 00:29:19.376
the cloud, whether that's our

00:29:19.376 --> 00:29:20.396
cloud, or your cloud.

00:29:21.376 --> 00:29:22.366
And, while we'd, of course,

00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:23.706
prefer that you test your app on

00:29:23.706 --> 00:29:25.326
a real Shared iPad, you can

00:29:25.326 --> 00:29:27.886
simulate this by deleting all

00:29:27.886 --> 00:29:29.756
the local data, and then making

00:29:29.756 --> 00:29:30.836
sure that your app still works

00:29:30.836 --> 00:29:31.076
well.

00:29:33.876 --> 00:29:35.376
Also like to encourage you to

00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:37.336
adopt managed app configuration.

00:29:37.616 --> 00:29:38.276
There are thousands of

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.136
developers who have, and have

00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:41.096
created a number of shared

00:29:41.096 --> 00:29:43.076
schemas that can make it-- your

00:29:43.076 --> 00:29:44.306
app much more friendly to

00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:46.176
education and enterprise, by

00:29:46.176 --> 00:29:47.516
enabling them to create a

00:29:47.516 --> 00:29:49.956
customized experience for their

00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:52.536
employees or students, to

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:54.356
customize the look of the app,

00:29:54.356 --> 00:29:56.706
or to prepare some custom data

00:29:56.706 --> 00:29:58.176
to warm up the app so they get

00:29:58.176 --> 00:29:59.516
the right experience at first

00:29:59.516 --> 00:29:59.936
launch.

00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:04.206
Here's the URL for the site to

00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:04.956
learn all about it.

00:30:04.956 --> 00:30:06.946
Again, that will be available on

00:30:06.946 --> 00:30:08.536
the More Information page later

00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:08.816
on.

00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:12.146
We also have a number of great

00:30:12.146 --> 00:30:13.456
enterprise partners, who've

00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:16.216
provided SDK's to make the power

00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:17.666
of their services available to

00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:18.426
your apps.

00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:21.606
From IBM's Watson to allow you

00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:23.326
to do machine-learning models,

00:30:23.456 --> 00:30:26.746
and we have great pages on our

00:30:26.746 --> 00:30:28.266
developer.apple.com website.

00:30:28.266 --> 00:30:29.206
They're really hard to figure

00:30:29.206 --> 00:30:30.716
out, because they're slash and

00:30:30.716 --> 00:30:31.546
then the company name.

00:30:31.626 --> 00:30:33.246
But, I encourage you to check

00:30:33.246 --> 00:30:34.366
those out, and see what you can

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:35.356
do within your apps.

00:30:35.896 --> 00:30:39.626
And, finally if your app depends

00:30:39.626 --> 00:30:41.636
on network performance, for some

00:30:41.636 --> 00:30:42.996
time now, we've enabled you to

00:30:42.996 --> 00:30:45.396
configure that with profiles for

00:30:45.396 --> 00:30:46.956
enterprise apps and MDM

00:30:46.956 --> 00:30:47.586
solutions.

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:49.606
But, this year we've added a

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:51.226
number of new quality of service

00:30:51.226 --> 00:30:52.486
keys to allow you to fine-tune

00:30:52.486 --> 00:30:53.276
it even further.

00:30:54.506 --> 00:30:55.816
Encourage you to check out the

00:30:55.886 --> 00:30:58.586
networking session, if your app

00:30:58.586 --> 00:30:59.806
is sensitive to network

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:00.846
performance, to find out how you

00:31:00.846 --> 00:31:02.036
can achieve the best performance

00:31:02.036 --> 00:31:02.876
on our platforms.

00:31:03.386 --> 00:31:05.506
And, that brings us to the end

00:31:05.506 --> 00:31:06.826
of our iOS-specific section.

00:31:08.246 --> 00:31:09.766
So, following the pattern

00:31:09.766 --> 00:31:10.886
established by this week's

00:31:10.886 --> 00:31:12.416
keynote, let's turn next to

00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:12.726
tvOS.

00:31:13.836 --> 00:31:15.566
Now, with tvOS, we, over the

00:31:15.566 --> 00:31:17.296
past number of years and

00:31:17.296 --> 00:31:18.526
releases have been playing a

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:19.446
little bit of catch up and

00:31:19.566 --> 00:31:20.326
adding some of the great

00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:21.766
features for device management

00:31:21.766 --> 00:31:23.416
that we had previously had for

00:31:23.516 --> 00:31:24.466
iOS and macOS.

00:31:24.906 --> 00:31:26.256
And, I'm very pleased to let you

00:31:26.256 --> 00:31:27.376
know that we continued to do

00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:28.016
that this year.

00:31:28.816 --> 00:31:30.696
This spring, adding the ability

00:31:30.696 --> 00:31:31.806
to configure content

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:33.116
restrictions, just like you can

00:31:33.116 --> 00:31:34.366
on iOS and macOS.

00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:38.266
And, enabling you to lock down

00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:40.396
which app, or which devices, can

00:31:40.396 --> 00:31:41.916
use the Remote app to manage a

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:43.036
particular Apple TV.

00:31:43.446 --> 00:31:44.616
This is great in the classroom,

00:31:44.616 --> 00:31:46.066
so that the teacher can just

00:31:46.066 --> 00:31:47.496
have the Remote app on her

00:31:47.496 --> 00:31:49.886
phone, and you cannot need a

00:31:49.886 --> 00:31:51.076
physical remote in the

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:51.616
classroom.

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:53.946
No student would ever get up to

00:31:53.946 --> 00:31:54.956
no good with one of those.

00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.186
And, perhaps, even more

00:31:58.186 --> 00:31:59.746
important, some great key

00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:00.646
features of the device

00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:01.606
management experience.

00:32:01.736 --> 00:32:02.976
Being able to install App Store

00:32:02.976 --> 00:32:04.236
apps on Apple TV.

00:32:05.236 --> 00:32:05.976
Thank you.

00:32:06.516 --> 00:32:08.976
[ Applause ]

00:32:09.476 --> 00:32:11.126
And, being able to update to the

00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:13.036
latest version of tvOS via MDM

00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:14.806
command, just like another Apple

00:32:14.806 --> 00:32:14.976
device.

00:32:15.061 --> 00:32:17.061
[ Applause ]

00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:17.486
Thank you.

00:32:18.286 --> 00:32:20.226
And, we think that combining

00:32:20.226 --> 00:32:21.576
these new features with some of

00:32:21.576 --> 00:32:23.466
the features that we've added

00:32:23.696 --> 00:32:25.556
over the past few releases, you

00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.856
can do some amazing things with

00:32:26.856 --> 00:32:28.546
Apple TV, on its own, and in

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.716
combination with other Apple

00:32:29.716 --> 00:32:30.296
devices.

00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:31.906
Provide new experiences to your

00:32:31.906 --> 00:32:32.396
guests.

00:32:33.266 --> 00:32:34.156
So, to illustrate the

00:32:34.266 --> 00:32:35.956
possibilities, I'd like to

00:32:35.956 --> 00:32:37.336
welcome you to the entirely

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:38.996
fictional Hotel Cupertino.

00:32:39.926 --> 00:32:40.936
Such a lovely place.

00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:43.616
Where each enrolled Apple TV is

00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:45.286
programmed to receive commands

00:32:45.286 --> 00:32:46.626
from the hotel's MDM server.

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:49.036
For example, including updating

00:32:49.036 --> 00:32:49.976
to the latest version of tvOS.

00:32:54.086 --> 00:32:55.126
And, installing a custom

00:32:55.126 --> 00:32:56.276
enterprise app to allow your

00:32:56.276 --> 00:32:57.116
guests to manage their

00:32:57.116 --> 00:32:59.366
experience, including ordering

00:32:59.366 --> 00:33:01.136
of room service, when they get a

00:33:01.136 --> 00:33:02.526
hankering for pink champagne on

00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:04.406
ice, or informing them about

00:33:04.406 --> 00:33:05.706
options for exploring the area.

00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:08.906
You can also provide your guests

00:33:08.906 --> 00:33:09.706
with great entertainment

00:33:09.706 --> 00:33:11.386
options, when they're actually

00:33:11.386 --> 00:33:12.846
spending time in your room, by

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:14.016
installing App Store apps.

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:16.976
And, this is the time when I

00:33:16.976 --> 00:33:18.826
would love to share a clip of my

00:33:18.826 --> 00:33:20.016
favorite show, Game of Thrones,

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:21.166
with you, but we don't have time

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.086
for that right now.

00:33:22.876 --> 00:33:23.646
So, assuming your guests

00:33:23.646 --> 00:33:25.246
actually ever leave the room,

00:33:25.866 --> 00:33:27.296
and take some photos, they can

00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:29.526
of course, use AirPlay to share

00:33:29.526 --> 00:33:31.466
those photos, and display them

00:33:31.466 --> 00:33:32.936
on the big screen in the room

00:33:32.936 --> 00:33:33.806
you've provided to them.

00:33:34.676 --> 00:33:36.996
So, this is just one example of

00:33:36.996 --> 00:33:38.426
what can now be done with Apple

00:33:38.426 --> 00:33:40.056
TV by managing it remotely.

00:33:40.166 --> 00:33:41.356
But, of course, there are many

00:33:41.356 --> 00:33:42.556
other types of businesses that

00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:43.626
could take advantage of these

00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:45.396
capabilities to provide amazing

00:33:45.396 --> 00:33:46.896
experiences to their guests,

00:33:47.326 --> 00:33:48.356
including integration with the

00:33:48.356 --> 00:33:49.706
Apple devices they're already

00:33:49.706 --> 00:33:50.426
bringing with them.

00:33:51.126 --> 00:33:52.096
We look forward to seeing the

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.016
fruits of your creativity, even

00:33:54.016 --> 00:33:55.246
if it doesn't involve dragons.

00:33:56.756 --> 00:33:58.226
So, that brings us to the end of

00:33:58.226 --> 00:33:59.336
our tvOS section.

00:33:59.636 --> 00:34:02.186
And, last but not least, macOS,

00:34:02.616 --> 00:34:03.536
just like in the keynote.

00:34:03.936 --> 00:34:05.276
So, let's start right at the

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:07.026
beginning, installing macOS.

00:34:07.456 --> 00:34:10.025
And, I'd like to make everyone

00:34:10.025 --> 00:34:11.476
aware of the great new command

00:34:11.536 --> 00:34:12.866
added to the macOS installer

00:34:12.866 --> 00:34:13.896
this spring, called

00:34:13.896 --> 00:34:14.936
startosinstall.

00:34:16.016 --> 00:34:17.726
If you're installing from and to

00:34:17.726 --> 00:34:18.926
your computer startup disk, you

00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:19.835
can use this command.

00:34:20.636 --> 00:34:22.406
And, it supports all the latest

00:34:22.406 --> 00:34:23.106
Mac hardware.

00:34:23.936 --> 00:34:24.966
It also includes some great

00:34:24.966 --> 00:34:25.906
features that allow you to

00:34:25.906 --> 00:34:27.346
install packages on top of the

00:34:27.346 --> 00:34:28.716
freshly installed macOS.

00:34:29.315 --> 00:34:31.156
And, an option to start fresh,

00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:33.005
and erase that partition before

00:34:33.005 --> 00:34:34.646
you install the new version of

00:34:34.646 --> 00:34:35.106
macOS.

00:34:35.886 --> 00:34:38.386
Of course, once you've installed

00:34:38.386 --> 00:34:39.565
the OS, you want to get enrolled

00:34:39.565 --> 00:34:40.496
for remote management.

00:34:41.156 --> 00:34:42.386
And, we received some feedback

00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:43.246
from some of our enterprise

00:34:43.246 --> 00:34:45.216
partners in particular, that

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:46.696
they really prefer the iOS

00:34:46.696 --> 00:34:47.746
experience, and felt it was more

00:34:47.746 --> 00:34:48.456
user friendly.

00:34:48.716 --> 00:34:49.446
So, we're going to take that

00:34:49.446 --> 00:34:52.235
feedback, and simplify, and make

00:34:52.386 --> 00:34:54.096
the macOS MDM enrollment

00:34:54.096 --> 00:34:55.596
experience match iOS.

00:34:56.255 --> 00:34:57.566
It's not in Seed 1, but you will

00:34:57.566 --> 00:34:58.976
see it soon in macOS Mojave.

00:35:03.606 --> 00:35:04.366
I told you there were more

00:35:04.366 --> 00:35:05.176
security topics.

00:35:05.276 --> 00:35:05.986
Here's another one.

00:35:06.736 --> 00:35:08.186
We want to strongly encourage

00:35:08.186 --> 00:35:09.386
our MDM partners to take

00:35:09.386 --> 00:35:10.896
advantage of this new capability

00:35:10.896 --> 00:35:13.296
to make enterprise app manifest

00:35:13.296 --> 00:35:14.486
delivery more secure.

00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:17.136
The transition is easy because

00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:18.296
we're continuing to support the

00:35:18.296 --> 00:35:20.106
existing installApplication MDM

00:35:20.106 --> 00:35:21.396
command to install enterprise

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:23.766
apps, but we really want you to

00:35:23.766 --> 00:35:24.886
switch to one of the new methods

00:35:24.886 --> 00:35:25.786
using the new

00:35:25.786 --> 00:35:27.466
installEnterpriseApplication

00:35:27.576 --> 00:35:29.106
command as soon as possible.

00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:31.036
There're two options.

00:35:31.246 --> 00:35:32.486
You can either specify the

00:35:32.486 --> 00:35:33.556
manifest right within the

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:34.536
command, inline.

00:35:35.506 --> 00:35:37.496
Or, you can specify certs that

00:35:37.496 --> 00:35:39.056
we'll use later to pin our

00:35:39.216 --> 00:35:41.146
request to fetch the manifest.

00:35:43.396 --> 00:35:45.526
Please read up about this, and

00:35:45.526 --> 00:35:47.496
make the switch as soon as you

00:35:49.676 --> 00:35:49.786
can.

00:35:50.006 --> 00:35:50.936
Now, this is not actually a

00:35:50.936 --> 00:35:52.706
change so much, because none of

00:35:52.706 --> 00:35:54.446
these six payloads ever worked

00:35:54.636 --> 00:35:56.146
to install in a system profile.

00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:57.636
But-- because they only make

00:35:57.636 --> 00:35:58.916
sense in a user context.

00:35:59.456 --> 00:36:00.706
But, next year, we're going to

00:36:00.706 --> 00:36:02.546
start treating installing any of

00:36:02.546 --> 00:36:03.596
these payloads in a system

00:36:03.596 --> 00:36:05.106
profile as a hard failure.

00:36:05.466 --> 00:36:06.916
So, you have some time to

00:36:06.916 --> 00:36:07.926
prepare for that, and make sure

00:36:07.926 --> 00:36:10.556
you're not already doing that.

00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:12.086
Now, let's talk about some of

00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:14.186
the new things we've added in

00:36:14.186 --> 00:36:15.516
this year's macOS releases.

00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:17.886
Big customer request, you can

00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.916
now mark generated private keys

00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:21.376
as not exportable, so the user

00:36:21.376 --> 00:36:22.556
can't get access to them on

00:36:22.556 --> 00:36:22.816
their Mac.

00:36:24.436 --> 00:36:25.876
We added content caching last

00:36:25.876 --> 00:36:27.676
fall in macOS High Sierra.

00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:28.976
And now, you can configure it

00:36:28.976 --> 00:36:29.666
via profile.

00:36:30.556 --> 00:36:31.726
And, we've added a number of new

00:36:31.726 --> 00:36:33.176
controls for managing how smart

00:36:33.176 --> 00:36:34.596
cards are used on your

00:36:34.596 --> 00:36:35.606
organization's Macs.

00:36:35.606 --> 00:36:35.836
Thank you.

00:36:36.046 --> 00:36:36.926
Smart cards.

00:36:42.736 --> 00:36:44.296
Last fall, we introduced a new

00:36:44.296 --> 00:36:46.696
concept for enrollments on Macs

00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:48.226
called user-approved MDM.

00:36:49.636 --> 00:36:51.856
And, this is to protect features

00:36:51.856 --> 00:36:53.056
that should really only be

00:36:53.056 --> 00:36:53.876
available on an

00:36:53.876 --> 00:36:55.646
organization-owned Mac, and be

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:57.566
tied to affirmative consent from

00:36:57.566 --> 00:36:59.426
a user or an admin, and not

00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.816
configured via rogue script.

00:37:02.296 --> 00:37:04.156
The first example was the kernel

00:37:04.156 --> 00:37:05.366
extension permissions.

00:37:05.436 --> 00:37:06.846
And, we introduced this in

00:37:06.846 --> 00:37:09.426
10.13.2, although user-approved

00:37:09.426 --> 00:37:11.016
MDM enrollments was not actually

00:37:11.016 --> 00:37:13.176
required until 10.13.4.

00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:15.796
There will be more security

00:37:15.796 --> 00:37:17.296
features that will fall into

00:37:17.296 --> 00:37:17.986
this group.

00:37:18.316 --> 00:37:19.456
So, this is something that's

00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:21.076
going to be with us, and in

00:37:21.076 --> 00:37:22.226
fact, next thing I want to talk

00:37:22.226 --> 00:37:23.316
about also requires

00:37:23.316 --> 00:37:24.156
user-approved MDM.

00:37:24.156 --> 00:37:26.386
And, that's the additional

00:37:26.386 --> 00:37:28.696
support we made for testing apps

00:37:28.736 --> 00:37:30.446
for high stakes testing apps on

00:37:30.446 --> 00:37:32.256
the Mac, so they can achieve the

00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:33.406
controlled environment that they

00:37:33.406 --> 00:37:33.936
require.

00:37:35.596 --> 00:37:37.086
That support requires both an

00:37:37.086 --> 00:37:39.506
entitlement, as well as a Mac

00:37:39.506 --> 00:37:40.956
which has a user-approved

00:37:40.956 --> 00:37:41.396
enrollment.

00:37:44.276 --> 00:37:46.076
And, just like for iOS and tvOS,

00:37:46.076 --> 00:37:47.116
I'd like to give you some tips

00:37:47.116 --> 00:37:48.626
on troubleshooting issues with

00:37:48.626 --> 00:37:50.116
communicating with enrolled

00:37:50.116 --> 00:37:50.786
devices.

00:37:52.126 --> 00:37:53.296
Similarly, you can install the

00:37:53.296 --> 00:37:54.846
right logging profile for a

00:37:54.846 --> 00:37:56.126
managed client, or again, Apple

00:37:56.126 --> 00:37:57.456
Push Notification service.

00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:00.826
Get the logs using Console, and

00:38:01.016 --> 00:38:01.996
it's a lot simpler-- you can

00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:02.956
just filter for the Managed

00:38:02.956 --> 00:38:04.146
Client process on the Mac.

00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:05.956
But, I also wanted to highlight

00:38:05.956 --> 00:38:07.416
the profile's command line tool.

00:38:07.486 --> 00:38:08.726
It's a Mac, we're got Terminal.

00:38:09.466 --> 00:38:10.436
You can, of course, use it to

00:38:10.436 --> 00:38:12.686
install and remove profiles, but

00:38:12.686 --> 00:38:14.076
it also has some great features

00:38:14.686 --> 00:38:16.656
for verifying your deployment.

00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:18.936
The first we added this spring,

00:38:19.236 --> 00:38:21.486
allows you to verify whether the

00:38:21.486 --> 00:38:22.936
enrollment is user-approved,

00:38:23.256 --> 00:38:24.756
with the profile status command.

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.356
And, new in macOS Mojave,

00:38:27.956 --> 00:38:29.536
there's a validate command that

00:38:29.536 --> 00:38:32.386
allows you to confirm, or tells

00:38:32.386 --> 00:38:34.886
you any differences between the

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.536
device enrollment profile in the

00:38:36.536 --> 00:38:38.046
cloud, and what's actually

00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:39.256
configured on the device at that

00:38:39.256 --> 00:38:39.626
moment.

00:38:39.946 --> 00:38:40.816
So that you can more easily

00:38:40.816 --> 00:38:43.296
detect when your change that you

00:38:43.466 --> 00:38:44.526
know you've already made in the

00:38:44.526 --> 00:38:46.566
cloud hasn't been reflected on

00:38:46.566 --> 00:38:48.296
the Mac yet, or the device has

00:38:48.296 --> 00:38:49.326
become unconfigured.

00:38:49.926 --> 00:38:52.076
So, that brings us to the end of

00:38:52.076 --> 00:38:53.186
our content for today.

00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:54.716
And, I'd like to quickly sum up

00:38:55.026 --> 00:38:56.226
some of the takeaways for the

00:38:56.226 --> 00:38:57.346
different groups, and different

00:38:57.346 --> 00:38:58.316
audiences for this talk.

00:38:58.816 --> 00:39:00.836
Administrators, we hope you love

00:39:00.836 --> 00:39:03.316
having access in more places for

00:39:03.316 --> 00:39:04.616
Apple School Manager, and now

00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:06.316
Apple Business Manager to manage

00:39:06.316 --> 00:39:07.586
all of your organization's

00:39:07.586 --> 00:39:09.836
accounts, devices, and apps and

00:39:09.836 --> 00:39:10.316
books.

00:39:11.966 --> 00:39:13.136
Take advantage of all those new

00:39:13.136 --> 00:39:14.396
device management capabilities

00:39:14.396 --> 00:39:15.436
that we've talked about today.

00:39:16.216 --> 00:39:17.316
And, prepare for the security

00:39:17.316 --> 00:39:18.416
changes that will impact your

00:39:18.416 --> 00:39:19.086
deployments.

00:39:19.196 --> 00:39:22.606
For MDM developers, of course,

00:39:22.606 --> 00:39:24.226
we need you to support all these

00:39:24.226 --> 00:39:25.406
new features, because the

00:39:25.406 --> 00:39:26.516
administrators won't be able to

00:39:26.516 --> 00:39:27.896
take advantage of them until you

00:39:27.896 --> 00:39:29.096
do, in the solution that they've

00:39:29.096 --> 00:39:30.216
already paid you for.

00:39:32.006 --> 00:39:33.596
Please get on adoption of those

00:39:33.596 --> 00:39:35.146
security features to help us

00:39:35.146 --> 00:39:37.326
make sure that we are keeping

00:39:37.326 --> 00:39:39.086
the communication between

00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:39.966
enrolled devices and your

00:39:39.966 --> 00:39:41.756
product as securely as possible.

00:39:43.296 --> 00:39:44.726
And, finally, app developers.

00:39:45.436 --> 00:39:46.366
Take advantage of all these

00:39:46.366 --> 00:39:47.426
great technologies that we've

00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:48.856
made available to you on our

00:39:48.856 --> 00:39:50.326
OS's from ClassKit and Shared

00:39:50.386 --> 00:39:52.626
iPad for schools, to managed app

00:39:52.626 --> 00:39:53.856
configuration for all kinds of

00:39:53.856 --> 00:39:55.406
apps, and then the enterprise

00:39:55.406 --> 00:39:56.816
features for enterprise apps.

00:39:57.226 --> 00:40:01.026
We have a number of labs, one

00:40:01.026 --> 00:40:01.976
later today after lunch.

00:40:02.356 --> 00:40:03.356
And then, tomorrow morning.

00:40:03.906 --> 00:40:04.926
And, if you'd like to learn more

00:40:04.926 --> 00:40:06.156
about the new password and

00:40:06.156 --> 00:40:07.386
AutoFill features, they also

00:40:07.386 --> 00:40:08.546
have a lab tomorrow afternoon.

00:40:08.796 --> 00:40:10.676
And, with that, I'll thank you

00:40:10.676 --> 00:40:11.566
for your attention, and hope you

00:40:11.566 --> 00:40:12.236
enjoy the rest of the show.

00:40:12.236 --> 00:40:12.976
Thank you very much.

00:40:13.508 --> 00:40:15.508
