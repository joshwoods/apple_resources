00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.546
>> Hey everyone.

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:28.996
Welcome to our session on what's

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:30.326
new in App Store Connect?

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:31.696
My name is Daniel Miao.

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.276
And I'm an engineering manager

00:00:33.276 --> 00:00:35.216
on the App Store Connect team.

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:37.096
So what's new?

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.136
Well, first off, you may have

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.676
noticed we changed our name.

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:45.666
This is really just a small part

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.786
of our ongoing commitment to

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:48.956
building the best tools and

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:50.786
services focused on you, our

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:53.146
developers building apps for the

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:53.696
App Store.

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:56.696
Now along these lines, we've

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.046
also been undergoing a few

00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:00.596
renovations on our App Store.

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:04.465
So last year, we went back and

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.726
we redesigned the iOS App Store.

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.896
And following the success of

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:12.736
that redesign, this year we also

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:14.556
redesigned the Mac App Store.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:17.546
Now with this Mac App Store

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:19.846
redesign, we've added support

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.126
for a few new features including

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:24.766
app subtitles and app previews.

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:26.446
You can take advantage of these

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.126
features by signing into App

00:01:28.126 --> 00:01:30.246
Store Connect or by using the

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:31.856
XML feed if you use that for

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:32.756
automation today.

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:37.116
Now for today's session, we're

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:40.686
going to focus on enhancements

00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:42.566
we've made to App Store Connect.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.646
And we're going to talk about it

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.686
within the context of your app

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:46.516
lifecycle.

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:49.186
This lifecycle typically begins

00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:50.766
with the design phase.

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:54.426
This phase can be both visual or

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:55.106
in code.

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.126
And as you make your way around

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:58.746
this lifecycle, you eventually

00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:00.486
end up with your app on the App

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.006
Store followed with an analysis

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.806
of how your app is doing on the

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.366
App Store.

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:08.816
Now more specifically, we're

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:10.265
going to focus on a few key

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:11.886
areas of this lifecycle.

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:13.356
We're going to talk about

00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:16.026
changes to provisioning, user

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:18.826
management, delivering your app

00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:22.186
into our system, beta testing

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:25.476
the builds, and analyzing your

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:26.896
biggest business drivers.

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:28.966
Now looking at all these

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:30.996
different areas, you can imagine

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:32.706
how something like automation

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.256
could bring all these together

00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:35.096
quite nicely.

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.826
And we tend to agree which is

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:39.496
why we're very excited because

00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:41.236
this summer we'll be releasing

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:42.996
an all-new product focused

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.176
around automation and we call it

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:47.546
the App Store Connect API.

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:52.296
[ Applause ]

00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:54.616
Now the App Store Connect API is

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:57.386
simply a RESTful interface into

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:59.796
your app management experience.

00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:02.536
To authenticate with the API,

00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:03.546
you'll be using

00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:06.066
industry-standard JSON web token

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:06.916
authentication.

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:08.396
Some of you may already be

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:09.976
familiar with this with other

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:11.646
APIs you've worked with.

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:14.236
In designing the API, we've

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:15.616
designed it around strict

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:16.446
convention.

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:17.996
This means whether you're

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:19.406
looking at something like naming

00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:22.196
or error formats, no matter what

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:23.606
corner of the API you're in,

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:25.936
everything should feel familiar.

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:29.296
And finally, we've been writing

00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:31.006
extensive documentation for this

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:31.336
API.

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:33.116
You might be looking for

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:34.826
references around resources and

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:36.756
their attributes or maybe you're

00:03:36.756 --> 00:03:38.216
simply looking for a guide

00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:40.476
around how to best use this API

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:41.866
for your use cases.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.516
Well, either way and for many

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.876
other scenarios, this

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.656
documentation will be the place

00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:48.306
to go.

00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:51.926
We'll be launching the API this

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:52.256
summer.

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:53.346
And we will be launching with

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:55.216
support for the areas of the

00:03:55.216 --> 00:03:56.346
lifecycle we highlighted

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:56.846
earlier.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.476
Now as we add more features and

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:01.196
support for other areas, we will

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:03.296
be delivering those features to

00:04:03.296 --> 00:04:03.546
you.

00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:07.566
So going back to our lifecycle,

00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:09.136
let's talk through some

00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:11.456
enhancements and some API

00:04:11.486 --> 00:04:12.336
integrations.

00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:14.806
We'll begin by talking about

00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:15.396
provisioning.

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:22.046
Now today, many of you rely on

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:23.406
Xcode to manage your

00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:24.656
provisioning automatically.

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:26.246
But for some of you who are

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:26.976
looking for a little more

00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:29.116
control, today you sign into the

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:31.686
Apple Developer website to

00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:33.086
generate the resources you need

00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:34.806
to sign your apps.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:38.026
Well, with the API this summer,

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:39.656
you'll be able to do a lot of

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:40.786
these things directly.

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:43.276
The API will support generating

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:45.526
provisioning profiles, creating

00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:46.576
and revoking signing

00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:48.726
certificates as well as managing

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:51.156
your devices and your app bundle

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:51.246
IDs.

00:04:51.246 --> 00:04:53.876
This should make it a little bit

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.756
easier for you to integrate your

00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:57.326
provisioning activities into

00:04:57.326 --> 00:04:58.656
your automation process.

00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:05.546
[ Applause ]

00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:07.976
So early on in the lifecycle

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:09.286
while you're thinking about

00:05:09.286 --> 00:05:10.806
provisioning, you're probably

00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:12.816
also thinking about managing

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:13.686
your users.

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:16.726
Now the API is going to support

00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:19.136
inviting new users to App Store

00:05:19.136 --> 00:05:21.906
Connect, modifying which apps

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:24.286
your users can see, managing

00:05:24.286 --> 00:05:26.116
your user's roles as well as

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:28.086
updating profile details.

00:05:29.676 --> 00:05:31.566
Now we didn't want to stop at

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:32.716
simplifying your management

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:34.286
experience with just the API.

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:36.596
We also wanted to take a look at

00:05:36.596 --> 00:05:38.646
how we could simplify where you

00:05:38.646 --> 00:05:40.306
go to manage your users in the

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:41.066
first place.

00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:44.626
Today, you go to both App Store

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:47.156
Connect and the Apple Developer

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:47.736
website.

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:50.536
But starting this summer, you'll

00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:52.746
be able to go to just one place.

00:05:53.516 --> 00:05:58.976
[ Applause ]

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:00.716
And that's App Store Connect.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:03.256
Coming to App Store Connect,

00:06:03.256 --> 00:06:04.266
you'll be able to think about

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:05.836
all of your users within the

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:07.686
context of just one set of

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:08.176
roles.

00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:10.726
And you can manage just one

00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:12.556
account for each of your Apple

00:06:12.556 --> 00:06:13.016
IDs.

00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:16.136
Now we know that App Store

00:06:16.136 --> 00:06:17.536
Connect and the Apple Developer

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:19.046
website, they're very different

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:19.496
systems.

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:21.786
So you might be wondering how is

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:23.206
all this going to come together?

00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:25.056
Well, that's why we've built a

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:26.776
way for you to see how your

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:27.796
user's permissions will be

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.326
changing once this process is

00:06:30.326 --> 00:06:30.856
complete.

00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:33.546
Once we have this preview

00:06:33.546 --> 00:06:35.366
available, we'll let you know

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:37.686
via Developer News and on the

00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:39.306
App Store Connect home page.

00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:42.026
From here, you can click into a

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:43.426
page that looks sort of like

00:06:43.476 --> 00:06:43.896
this.

00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:46.006
Here you'll see a list of all of

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:48.206
your users as well as a summary

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:49.686
of how their roles will be

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:50.206
changing.

00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:52.636
Of course, some of your users

00:06:53.106 --> 00:06:54.136
won't be changing at all.

00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:57.596
Now if you click into a single

00:06:57.596 --> 00:06:58.976
one of these users, you'll be

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:01.136
able to pull up a modal giving

00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:03.376
you much more information about

00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:04.876
that user including what their

00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:06.556
permissions will look like going

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:07.066
forward.

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:09.966
We encourage you to come in to

00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:11.706
App Store Connect and take a

00:07:11.706 --> 00:07:12.946
look at each and every one of

00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:14.626
your users and make any

00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:16.726
necessary changes before we

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.276
began this process.

00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:21.456
And once this process completes,

00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:22.466
we encourage you to come back

00:07:22.846 --> 00:07:24.296
one last time to make sure your

00:07:24.296 --> 00:07:26.296
users are in a state that makes

00:07:26.296 --> 00:07:28.746
sense to you and after that you

00:07:28.746 --> 00:07:30.426
simply come back to App Store

00:07:30.426 --> 00:07:33.136
Connect for any future changes.

00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:35.876
All right.

00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:37.356
So while some of you were

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.426
thinking about provisioning and

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:42.196
user management, others were

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:44.796
working on your apps.

00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:48.086
Now a natural part of the app

00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:49.496
development process is, of

00:07:49.496 --> 00:07:51.486
course, spinning up builds.

00:07:52.496 --> 00:07:54.186
At some point, you reach a build

00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:55.526
that you're ready to deliver,

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.286
that way you can distribute it

00:07:58.396 --> 00:07:59.336
to your customers.

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:01.636
Now many of you today are using

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:03.086
our tool called Transporter.

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:04.426
For those of you who aren't

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:05.866
familiar, Transporter is our

00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:07.476
command line tool that does many

00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:08.966
things and one of those is

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.336
delivering your builds into our

00:08:10.336 --> 00:08:10.766
system.

00:08:11.096 --> 00:08:12.976
For those of you who use

00:08:12.976 --> 00:08:15.076
Transporter today, you know that

00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:17.216
macOS is a supported platform.

00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:20.926
Well, we also know that many of

00:08:20.926 --> 00:08:22.266
you use Linux for things like

00:08:22.366 --> 00:08:24.716
continuous integration, which is

00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:26.556
why this summer we'll be adding

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.826
Linux as a supported platform

00:08:28.906 --> 00:08:29.796
for Transporter.

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:33.856
[ Applause ]

00:08:34.356 --> 00:08:35.256
Now you'll continue using

00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:36.645
Transporter the same way you do

00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:37.025
today.

00:08:37.476 --> 00:08:40.326
And Transporter will continue

00:08:40.326 --> 00:08:42.376
allowing you to validate your

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:44.236
builds before you deliver them.

00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:46.266
This will save you a lot of time

00:08:46.736 --> 00:08:47.716
because you'll know whether your

00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:48.996
builds are in a good state

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:50.946
before you push us all of the

00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:51.436
bits.

00:08:52.996 --> 00:08:54.676
And once we launch the API this

00:08:54.676 --> 00:08:56.726
summer, in addition to the

00:08:56.726 --> 00:08:58.196
username and password

00:08:58.196 --> 00:08:59.256
authentication that you can do

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:00.996
today, you'll also be able to

00:09:00.996 --> 00:09:03.056
use the same API tokens that you

00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:04.816
use with the rest of the App

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:05.996
Store Connect API.

00:09:05.996 --> 00:09:11.456
Okay. So now that we have a few

00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:13.546
builds in the system, it's time

00:09:13.796 --> 00:09:14.646
to beta test them.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.576
And, of course, beta testing

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:18.246
means TestFlight.

00:09:18.656 --> 00:09:20.406
We've got a few enhancements to

00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:20.896
TestFlight.

00:09:20.986 --> 00:09:22.596
And I'd like to invite Tommy

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:24.106
McGlynn up to the stage to tell

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:24.976
you all about them.

00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:28.946
[ Applause ]

00:09:29.446 --> 00:09:30.146
>> Thanks, Daniel.

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:32.866
I'm really excited to be here

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:34.126
again talking to you about

00:09:34.126 --> 00:09:34.686
TestFlight.

00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:36.626
We've got a new feature to tell

00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:38.336
you about, and it deals with

00:09:38.406 --> 00:09:39.846
tester acquisition.

00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:42.756
Today, all you need to invite

00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:44.246
someone to TestFlight is their

00:09:44.246 --> 00:09:44.956
e-mail address.

00:09:45.706 --> 00:09:47.206
You simply enter their e-mail

00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:48.806
and they'll be sent an

00:09:48.806 --> 00:09:49.396
invitation.

00:09:50.986 --> 00:09:52.736
Tapping on the invitation will

00:09:52.736 --> 00:09:54.076
launch TestFlight where they can

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:55.376
install your beta app.

00:09:55.946 --> 00:09:58.086
It's pretty awesome, but if

00:09:58.086 --> 00:09:58.926
you're dealing with a lot of

00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:00.616
testers, it can be cumbersome.

00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:02.426
And if you're working with

00:10:02.426 --> 00:10:04.286
testers who don't have an e-mail

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:06.176
address, there isn't an easy way

00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:06.816
to invite them.

00:10:07.786 --> 00:10:09.166
We think we can do even better,

00:10:09.706 --> 00:10:12.036
and we call it TestFlight public

00:10:12.036 --> 00:10:12.336
link.

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:15.246
[ Applause ]

00:10:15.476 --> 00:10:16.526
This is really exciting.

00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:20.146
Public link is a unique URL that

00:10:20.146 --> 00:10:22.606
represents an open invitation to

00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:23.286
your beta app.

00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:25.946
You can share it anywhere you'd

00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:26.206
like.

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:29.166
And it can be used by anyone to

00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:32.866
become a new tester.

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:35.366
So public links can be shared

00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:36.806
anywhere that a regular link can

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:37.236
be shared.

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:39.156
This means you can send a public

00:10:39.156 --> 00:10:41.526
link directly to someone, or you

00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:42.816
could share it on social media

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:44.246
to reach a wider audience.

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:46.366
If someone wants to become a

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:48.886
tester, they simply tap on a

00:10:49.836 --> 00:10:49.986
link.

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:51.336
This would launch TestFlight

00:10:51.656 --> 00:10:52.736
where they can install your beta

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.796
app and instantly become one of

00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:55.426
your testers.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:56.766
It's really easy.

00:10:56.876 --> 00:10:58.246
You don't have to collect any

00:10:58.246 --> 00:10:58.906
information.

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:00.466
You simply make the link

00:11:00.466 --> 00:11:02.126
available and testers can join.

00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:06.426
So let me show how we can create

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:07.066
a public link.

00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:10.826
In TestFlight, groups allow you

00:11:10.826 --> 00:11:12.506
to organize your testers and

00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:14.706
decide which builds each group

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:16.156
of testers should have access

00:11:16.186 --> 00:11:16.386
to.

00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:18.616
We'll need to create a group

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:19.926
before we can generate a public

00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:20.206
link.

00:11:20.536 --> 00:11:22.066
And we can do that by clicking

00:11:22.326 --> 00:11:24.936
new group in the left nav and

00:11:24.936 --> 00:11:28.746
then giving the group a name.

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.476
Now before we create a public

00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:32.116
link and start bringing testers

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:33.816
in, we want to make sure there

00:11:33.816 --> 00:11:35.246
is a build that they can test.

00:11:35.936 --> 00:11:38.066
So first we'll add a build to

00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:38.526
this group.

00:11:39.036 --> 00:11:41.276
We do that by going to the

00:11:41.276 --> 00:11:43.366
builds tab and clicking the plus

00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:45.146
button next to build.

00:11:46.036 --> 00:11:47.886
This will show all the builds

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:48.496
we've uploaded.

00:11:48.856 --> 00:11:50.266
And we can choose one that we

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:51.006
want to distribute.

00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:55.416
Now that this group has a build,

00:11:55.526 --> 00:11:57.206
we can create a public link for

00:11:57.206 --> 00:11:57.676
this group.

00:11:58.166 --> 00:12:00.726
We'll go back to the testers tab

00:12:01.536 --> 00:12:04.096
and click enable public link.

00:12:05.656 --> 00:12:07.926
This generates a unique URL that

00:12:07.926 --> 00:12:09.656
we can share anywhere to reach

00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:10.356
new testers.

00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:14.536
And testers who join through

00:12:14.536 --> 00:12:16.146
that link are automatically

00:12:16.146 --> 00:12:17.066
added to the group.

00:12:17.676 --> 00:12:19.116
So when you're ready to deliver

00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:20.936
a new build, you simply add the

00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:21.756
build to the group.

00:12:22.646 --> 00:12:24.176
You can see how this is a much

00:12:24.246 --> 00:12:26.226
faster way to bring in up to

00:12:26.226 --> 00:12:27.996
10,000 active testers.

00:12:28.536 --> 00:12:32.066
If you want more control over

00:12:32.066 --> 00:12:33.896
the number of testers or you're

00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:35.126
not quite ready for your beta

00:12:35.126 --> 00:12:37.126
app to go viral, you can easily

00:12:37.126 --> 00:12:39.346
set a custom tester limit on

00:12:39.346 --> 00:12:40.116
each public link.

00:12:41.036 --> 00:12:42.586
This would put a cap on the

00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:44.446
number of testers who could join

00:12:44.446 --> 00:12:44.976
through that link.

00:12:47.676 --> 00:12:49.326
You also have the ability to

00:12:49.326 --> 00:12:50.906
disable the public link at any

00:12:50.906 --> 00:12:53.786
time at which point new testers

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:57.396
would no longer be able to join.

00:12:57.616 --> 00:12:59.036
If someone tries to open a link

00:12:59.296 --> 00:13:01.036
once it's been disabled, they'll

00:13:01.036 --> 00:13:02.516
receive a message letting them

00:13:02.516 --> 00:13:04.616
know this beta isn't accepting

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:05.506
any new testers.

00:13:07.336 --> 00:13:10.176
I also want to show what happens

00:13:10.176 --> 00:13:11.346
when someone taps on a public

00:13:11.346 --> 00:13:12.996
link and doesn't have TestFlight

00:13:12.996 --> 00:13:13.436
installed.

00:13:14.686 --> 00:13:16.916
They'll land on a localized page

00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:19.016
that explains how to install

00:13:19.016 --> 00:13:20.876
TestFlight and get started as a

00:13:20.876 --> 00:13:21.486
beta tester.

00:13:21.966 --> 00:13:23.886
This will make it a lot easier

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:25.686
for brand-new testers to begin

00:13:25.686 --> 00:13:26.946
testing your app.

00:13:28.386 --> 00:13:30.786
I'd also like to mention that

00:13:30.786 --> 00:13:32.556
you'll soon be able to do all of

00:13:32.556 --> 00:13:34.686
this without using the App Store

00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:36.616
Connect UI at all.

00:13:38.056 --> 00:13:39.456
This will be possible using the

00:13:39.456 --> 00:13:41.046
new App Store Connect API.

00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:43.646
You'll be able to automate the

00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:46.556
creation of groups, assign

00:13:46.556 --> 00:13:49.626
builds to groups, manage public

00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:52.636
links, add and remove testers,

00:13:53.756 --> 00:13:55.336
and update test information.

00:13:56.066 --> 00:13:57.416
All of this can be automated

00:13:57.646 --> 00:13:58.956
using our new REST API.

00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:02.836

>> Thanks, Tommy.

00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:29.466
Well, TestFlight public links

00:14:29.546 --> 00:14:31.016
and the new TestFlight APIs are

00:14:31.016 --> 00:14:32.706
just two more ways for you to

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.546
streamline your beta

00:14:34.546 --> 00:14:36.146
distribution process.

00:14:38.136 --> 00:14:39.386
So now that we've gone through a

00:14:39.386 --> 00:14:40.836
successful round of beta

00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:43.796
testing, prepared our App Store

00:14:43.796 --> 00:14:45.786
metadata, gone through app

00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:48.016
review, and now our app is in

00:14:48.016 --> 00:14:49.676
the hands of our customers.

00:14:51.406 --> 00:14:53.036
Now it's time to take a look at

00:14:53.036 --> 00:14:55.146
some hard numbers to see how our

00:14:55.146 --> 00:14:56.286
customers are actually

00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:57.606
responding to our apps.

00:14:58.216 --> 00:15:00.226
So the first place we can look

00:15:00.226 --> 00:15:02.356
at this is in sales and trends.

00:15:03.996 --> 00:15:05.676
Just this week we launched an

00:15:05.676 --> 00:15:07.466
all new sales and trends

00:15:07.526 --> 00:15:08.386
overview page.

00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:11.326
This page gives you a summary of

00:15:11.326 --> 00:15:12.766
your biggest business drivers

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:14.536
like app units, in-app

00:15:14.536 --> 00:15:16.246
purchases, and sales.

00:15:17.476 --> 00:15:18.846
As you scroll down this page,

00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:21.466
you'll see your top apps and how

00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:22.876
they contribute to each of these

00:15:22.876 --> 00:15:23.506
metrics.

00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:25.916
Here, when you look at these

00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:27.596
sales numbers, these numbers

00:15:27.596 --> 00:15:30.256
include not just app sales but

00:15:30.256 --> 00:15:32.496
also in-app purchase sales from

00:15:32.496 --> 00:15:33.476
within those apps.

00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:36.776
As we scroll down towards the

00:15:36.776 --> 00:15:38.716
bottom, we'll see these same

00:15:38.716 --> 00:15:40.406
metrics broken down by territory

00:15:40.826 --> 00:15:42.506
and by device.

00:15:43.596 --> 00:15:44.556
After looking at all this

00:15:44.556 --> 00:15:47.076
information, you'll know better

00:15:47.326 --> 00:15:49.426
where to focus your efforts.

00:15:49.996 --> 00:15:54.156
Now another place we can look is

00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:56.306
in your generated reports to see

00:15:56.306 --> 00:15:57.236
how your app is doing.

00:15:58.786 --> 00:16:00.266
Today, in order to download your

00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:02.086
generated reports, you use a

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.736
reporter tool but beginning this

00:16:04.736 --> 00:16:06.336
summer you'll be able to do the

00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:08.036
same thing directly with the

00:16:08.036 --> 00:16:08.436
API.

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:10.516
And we'll be supporting the

00:16:10.516 --> 00:16:11.866
download of both financial

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:14.786
reports and sales reports.

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:16.716
This will make it easier for you

00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:19.196
to integrate reporting in to

00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:20.116
your process.

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:24.176
So we've been talking about a

00:16:24.176 --> 00:16:25.156
lot of features.

00:16:25.676 --> 00:16:26.856
And so far they've mostly been

00:16:26.856 --> 00:16:29.126
centered around your web and

00:16:29.126 --> 00:16:30.416
your desktop experience.

00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:33.186
So now we'd like to move on and

00:16:33.186 --> 00:16:35.066
talk about our all new mobile

00:16:35.066 --> 00:16:35.746
experience.

00:16:35.746 --> 00:16:36.986
And I'd like to invite Alex

00:16:36.986 --> 00:16:38.976
Miyamura up to the stage to tell

00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:39.776
you all about it.

00:16:40.516 --> 00:16:46.616
[ Applause ]

00:16:47.116 --> 00:16:47.686
>> Thanks, Daniel.

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:50.346
We know that the involvement

00:16:50.606 --> 00:16:52.196
with your apps doesn't stop the

00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:53.486
moment that you step away from

00:16:53.486 --> 00:16:53.946
your Mac.

00:16:54.866 --> 00:16:56.166
You may have a version of one of

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.156
your apps that you've been

00:16:57.446 --> 00:17:00.066
working on hard for quite a long

00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:01.316
time that you're just itching to

00:17:01.316 --> 00:17:03.766
release and it's now in app

00:17:03.766 --> 00:17:04.076
review.

00:17:04.986 --> 00:17:06.486
You may just have released a

00:17:06.486 --> 00:17:08.776
version of one of your apps, or

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:09.685
you may just want to see how

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:11.215
your apps are doing, check out

00:17:11.215 --> 00:17:12.786
their sales and trends or their

00:17:12.786 --> 00:17:13.766
ratings and reviews.

00:17:14.516 --> 00:17:16.646
And for that reason, we've

00:17:16.646 --> 00:17:18.236
created a brand-new App Store

00:17:18.236 --> 00:17:20.195
Connect experience for iOS.

00:17:21.586 --> 00:17:22.816
This experience is centered

00:17:22.816 --> 00:17:24.536
around giving you the ability to

00:17:24.536 --> 00:17:26.316
access your apps data on the go

00:17:26.856 --> 00:17:29.006
as well as empowering you to

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.256
take certain quick actions and

00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:33.256
letting you know exactly when

00:17:33.256 --> 00:17:33.886
you can take them.

00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:36.576
Now let's start with sales and

00:17:36.576 --> 00:17:36.946
trends.

00:17:38.376 --> 00:17:39.766
When you tap into your trends

00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:41.256
tab, you'll see this gorgeous

00:17:41.256 --> 00:17:42.646
graphical summary of your app's

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.346
performance over the past 7

00:17:44.346 --> 00:17:44.636
days.

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:47.556
You'll see your app's units and

00:17:47.556 --> 00:17:48.146
proceeds.

00:17:48.716 --> 00:17:50.576
Scrolling down, you'll see

00:17:50.576 --> 00:17:53.866
sales, updates, and then in-app

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:56.026
purchases and app bundles.

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:59.056
Now we know that you implement

00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:00.716
diverse modernization strategies

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:01.546
across your apps.

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:04.106
Some of you have paid apps, free

00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:05.046
apps, apps with in-app

00:18:05.046 --> 00:18:06.846
purchases, or you may leverage

00:18:06.846 --> 00:18:07.596
subscriptions.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:10.046
Now we know that and we wanted

00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:10.926
to give you the ability to

00:18:10.926 --> 00:18:12.736
select exactly which of these

00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:14.976
graphs are most relevant to you.

00:18:15.446 --> 00:18:17.576
So we've added this edit

00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:18.956
function where you can select

00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:20.276
the graphs you'd like to see.

00:18:20.836 --> 00:18:22.936
So let's say that, in my

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.786
business, I only have free apps.

00:18:25.076 --> 00:18:27.366
I'll go ahead and unselect

00:18:27.426 --> 00:18:31.136
proceeds, sales, in-app

00:18:31.136 --> 00:18:33.596
purchases, and app bundles.

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:37.126
Hit done and, voila, now I just

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:38.766
see units and updates, exactly

00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:40.446
what's relevant for my business.

00:18:41.296 --> 00:18:43.276
Next, we're going to take a look

00:18:43.306 --> 00:18:44.806
at the time selection control

00:18:45.536 --> 00:18:47.076
underneath the trends title.

00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:50.306
In iTunes Connect mobile, we

00:18:50.306 --> 00:18:52.306
allow you to see the status from

00:18:52.486 --> 00:18:55.116
7 days all the way to 26 weeks.

00:18:55.436 --> 00:18:57.676
Now this was amazing if you are

00:18:57.676 --> 00:18:58.696
interested in longer-term

00:18:58.696 --> 00:18:59.686
trends, right?

00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:01.566
But what about an app that you

00:19:01.566 --> 00:19:02.516
just released?

00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:04.686
You might not even have 7 days'

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:05.366
worth of data.

00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:07.096
And if you want to compare those

00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:08.496
7 days to the previous 7 days,

00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:09.726
well obviously you're not going

00:19:09.806 --> 00:19:10.406
to have that.

00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:12.806
So in App Store Connect, we

00:19:12.806 --> 00:19:15.006
introduce the 1 day view.

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:17.156
In this view, you can see how

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.436
your apps are during day over

00:19:18.436 --> 00:19:20.616
day even just a few days after

00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:21.046
launch.

00:19:21.846 --> 00:19:23.666
Of course, some of you are still

00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:24.806
going to be interested in

00:19:24.806 --> 00:19:26.126
longer-term trends, right?

00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:27.706
So we still offer you the

00:19:27.706 --> 00:19:29.626
ability to view your apps data

00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:35.516
over 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 13 weeks,

00:19:36.366 --> 00:19:37.956
and 26 weeks.

00:19:39.126 --> 00:19:40.446
You can also drill down into

00:19:40.486 --> 00:19:42.106
each one of these graphs in more

00:19:42.106 --> 00:19:42.596
detail.

00:19:42.886 --> 00:19:44.346
So we're going to take a look at

00:19:44.346 --> 00:19:45.116
units right now.

00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:47.576
When you tap into one of these

00:19:47.576 --> 00:19:49.076
graphs, you'll see a breakdown

00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:50.616
across your free apps, your paid

00:19:50.616 --> 00:19:52.416
apps, and in-apps for the

00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:55.406
iOS/tvOS App Stores as well as

00:19:55.406 --> 00:19:57.576
the redesigned Mac App Store.

00:19:58.346 --> 00:19:59.756
You can also take a look at a

00:19:59.756 --> 00:20:01.516
deeper dive into any one of

00:20:01.516 --> 00:20:02.876
these cells just by tapping on

00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:02.976
them.

00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:05.636
So let's go ahead and tap the

00:20:05.636 --> 00:20:07.686
free iOS/tvOS app cell.

00:20:09.036 --> 00:20:11.086
Now you can see data about each

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:12.576
one of your apps in more detail

00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:14.816
and also your apps top

00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:15.476
territories.

00:20:16.376 --> 00:20:17.906
If you're interested in seeing

00:20:17.906 --> 00:20:19.646
more territories, you can tap

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:20.446
the show more button.

00:20:20.446 --> 00:20:22.966
Now you can see the territories

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.486
that your apps are available in

00:20:24.486 --> 00:20:25.186
worldwide.

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:28.636
You can also take a look at your

00:20:28.636 --> 00:20:30.086
apps data individually as

00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:31.356
opposed to this aggregate view

00:20:31.886 --> 00:20:33.356
by taking a look at the my apps

00:20:33.476 --> 00:20:35.456
tab which we'll do next.

00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:38.176
When you tap into the my apps

00:20:38.176 --> 00:20:39.616
tab, you'll see a list of your

00:20:39.616 --> 00:20:40.346
apps, obviously.

00:20:40.736 --> 00:20:42.576
But what if you're a member of

00:20:42.576 --> 00:20:43.936
more than one development team?

00:20:43.936 --> 00:20:45.286
So do we have anyone in the

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.816
audience that is, indeed, a

00:20:46.816 --> 00:20:47.526
member of more than one

00:20:47.526 --> 00:20:48.186
development team?

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:50.306
Cool. So it's actually quite a

00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:50.746
bit of you.

00:20:50.806 --> 00:20:51.986
So that's awesome.

00:20:52.046 --> 00:20:53.596
And that's exactly why we've

00:20:53.596 --> 00:20:55.636
introduce the ability to select

00:20:55.786 --> 00:20:57.276
which development team you'd

00:20:57.276 --> 00:20:58.796
like to see within App Store

00:20:58.796 --> 00:20:59.146
Connect.

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.516
So we'll tap the little account

00:21:01.546 --> 00:21:01.876
button.

00:21:02.836 --> 00:21:03.966
That brings up settings.

00:21:04.046 --> 00:21:05.576
And you'll see the account cell.

00:21:06.386 --> 00:21:08.536
We'll tap into that, select the

00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:09.936
team that we'd like to see

00:21:09.976 --> 00:21:12.096
within App Store Connect, and

00:21:12.216 --> 00:21:13.036
dismiss this.

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:15.486
Now we see exactly the apps that

00:21:15.486 --> 00:21:16.806
we're interested in right now.

00:21:18.606 --> 00:21:20.246
Let's go ahead and take a look

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:21.766
at one of the apps within our

00:21:21.766 --> 00:21:23.606
apps list, Mountain Climber.

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:25.816
When we tap into Mountain

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:26.736
Climber, you'll see four

00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:27.316
sections.

00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:29.386
The first section that you see

00:21:29.656 --> 00:21:30.986
is the iOS app section.

00:21:31.026 --> 00:21:32.606
And here you'll see your iOS

00:21:32.606 --> 00:21:33.106
versions.

00:21:33.976 --> 00:21:35.856
If your app has a tvOS app

00:21:35.936 --> 00:21:38.326
version, you'll see the tvOS app

00:21:38.406 --> 00:21:40.096
section and, obviously, the tvOS

00:21:40.196 --> 00:21:41.496
app versions underneath.

00:21:42.116 --> 00:21:44.496
Now we also have App Store

00:21:44.496 --> 00:21:45.296
information.

00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:46.966
And remember that I noted that

00:21:46.966 --> 00:21:48.706
you can see your apps trends

00:21:48.706 --> 00:21:49.556
data individually.

00:21:49.806 --> 00:21:51.686
Well, all you have to do is tap

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:52.946
into that cell and you'll be

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:53.476
taken there.

00:21:54.206 --> 00:21:56.116
Now, finally we have

00:21:56.186 --> 00:21:57.086
notifications.

00:21:57.786 --> 00:21:59.316
And we're going to do something

00:21:59.316 --> 00:22:00.556
a bit unorthodox here.

00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:01.546
We're actually going to start

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:02.906
from all the way at the bottom

00:22:03.526 --> 00:22:04.506
with notifications.

00:22:06.216 --> 00:22:06.996
There are two types of

00:22:06.996 --> 00:22:08.176
notifications that you can

00:22:08.176 --> 00:22:10.066
receive within the App Store

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:10.666
Connect app.

00:22:11.386 --> 00:22:13.076
The first one is for app status

00:22:13.076 --> 00:22:13.536
changes.

00:22:13.896 --> 00:22:15.436
And this is something like when

00:22:15.436 --> 00:22:17.726
your app is in review and then

00:22:17.726 --> 00:22:19.906
goes to pending developer

00:22:19.906 --> 00:22:20.906
release when it's approved.

00:22:21.686 --> 00:22:23.566
The next one that you can take

00:22:23.976 --> 00:22:26.346
is for reviews with a certain

00:22:26.506 --> 00:22:27.206
star rating.

00:22:28.006 --> 00:22:29.546
And so we're going to go ahead

00:22:29.546 --> 00:22:31.676
and select the five-star review

00:22:31.846 --> 00:22:33.276
because we want to thank users

00:22:33.346 --> 00:22:35.626
that are enjoying our app as

00:22:35.626 --> 00:22:37.446
well as the one-star review

00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:38.986
because we want to engage users

00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:40.356
that, for whatever reason, are

00:22:40.356 --> 00:22:41.596
not having the best of

00:22:41.596 --> 00:22:42.416
experiences.

00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:44.696
Now that we've selected our

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.916
notifications, we're going to go

00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:46.776
back to the app view.

00:22:47.996 --> 00:22:49.486
The reason why we started with

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:51.506
notifications is because one of

00:22:51.506 --> 00:22:53.086
the key tenets of the App Store

00:22:53.086 --> 00:22:55.286
Connect experience on iOS is

00:22:55.286 --> 00:22:56.806
giving you the ability to take a

00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:58.776
quick action around your apps

00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:00.676
and letting you know when you

00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:01.356
can do so.

00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:03.976
So we know that you've taken --

00:23:04.656 --> 00:23:06.036
you've spent countless hours

00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:06.726
working on your apps.

00:23:07.546 --> 00:23:09.006
You've distributed them to beta

00:23:09.006 --> 00:23:10.446
testers via TestFlight.

00:23:11.096 --> 00:23:12.356
You've taken those testers

00:23:12.356 --> 00:23:14.186
feedback, iterated upon that

00:23:14.186 --> 00:23:16.146
with your apps, and finally you

00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:17.546
have a build that's ready for

00:23:17.546 --> 00:23:18.436
release to the world.

00:23:19.346 --> 00:23:20.716
Now one of the last things you

00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:22.216
have to do before releasing your

00:23:22.216 --> 00:23:23.236
app to the world is, of course,

00:23:23.816 --> 00:23:25.086
submitting your build to app

00:23:25.086 --> 00:23:25.376
review.

00:23:27.676 --> 00:23:28.906
One of the notifications that we

00:23:28.906 --> 00:23:30.166
just set up in the App Store

00:23:30.166 --> 00:23:31.966
Connect app was for app status

00:23:31.966 --> 00:23:32.516
changes.

00:23:33.186 --> 00:23:34.876
This means that when your app is

00:23:35.006 --> 00:23:36.696
approved by app review, you'll

00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:38.856
receive a push notification that

00:23:39.226 --> 00:23:40.526
tells you this happy news.

00:23:41.546 --> 00:23:42.946
The second that you received one

00:23:42.946 --> 00:23:44.656
of these notifications, you can

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:46.316
open App Store Connect wherever

00:23:46.316 --> 00:23:46.776
you are.

00:23:47.456 --> 00:23:48.986
And we'll go to the version

00:23:48.986 --> 00:23:49.246
view.

00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:51.546
You'll now see that our app

00:23:51.546 --> 00:23:52.846
Forest Explorer is pending

00:23:52.846 --> 00:23:53.746
developer release.

00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:56.146
We'll scroll down and you'll see

00:23:56.146 --> 00:23:56.596
two buttons.

00:23:57.216 --> 00:23:58.366
The first one that you'll see is

00:23:58.366 --> 00:23:59.176
this big red button.

00:23:59.176 --> 00:23:59.886
It's really obvious.

00:23:59.886 --> 00:24:00.746
Reject this binary.

00:24:01.026 --> 00:24:02.786
We don't want to do that, but

00:24:02.786 --> 00:24:04.296
now we see release this version

00:24:04.586 --> 00:24:05.856
and that's exactly what we want

00:24:05.856 --> 00:24:06.176
to do.

00:24:06.176 --> 00:24:06.856
We'll tap there.

00:24:07.386 --> 00:24:08.896
We'll get a confirmation dialog

00:24:08.896 --> 00:24:10.136
and we'll hit release.

00:24:10.426 --> 00:24:12.576
Now we sent that build off to

00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:12.946
the world.

00:24:13.776 --> 00:24:15.766
Sometimes you don't get the

00:24:15.766 --> 00:24:17.576
happiest push notifications and

00:24:17.576 --> 00:24:18.306
this is one of them.

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:20.266
Right. Sometimes your app may be

00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:21.636
rejected by app review.

00:24:21.636 --> 00:24:22.916
And, obviously, that's something

00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:23.986
that no one wants to see.

00:24:25.056 --> 00:24:26.236
Later in our session, my

00:24:26.236 --> 00:24:27.776
colleague Daniel is going to go

00:24:27.776 --> 00:24:29.156
over some tips and tricks from

00:24:29.156 --> 00:24:30.376
app review to make sure that

00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:31.656
this never happens to you.

00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:33.626
But what should we do now?

00:24:33.766 --> 00:24:34.896
We need to make sure that we can

00:24:34.896 --> 00:24:36.716
get this app approved and out

00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:37.316
there to the world.

00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:39.586
Now what we're going to do is

00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:40.746
open up App Store Connect.

00:24:41.196 --> 00:24:43.266
And under App Store information,

00:24:43.696 --> 00:24:45.166
you'll see this warning badge

00:24:45.486 --> 00:24:46.926
next to resolution center.

00:24:48.166 --> 00:24:49.636
Within resolution center, you'll

00:24:49.636 --> 00:24:50.896
be able to see app reviews

00:24:50.896 --> 00:24:52.346
feedback for your app.

00:24:52.896 --> 00:24:54.836
You can tap into one in more

00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:57.696
detail and, of course, reply to

00:24:57.696 --> 00:24:58.746
it on the go.

00:24:59.506 --> 00:25:01.716
Now once we send our response

00:25:01.786 --> 00:25:03.216
back to app review, they'll get

00:25:03.216 --> 00:25:04.726
a chance to review it and

00:25:04.726 --> 00:25:06.266
hopefully our app will be

00:25:06.266 --> 00:25:07.356
approved at once.

00:25:08.456 --> 00:25:09.836
Now once your app has been

00:25:09.836 --> 00:25:11.476
submitted to app review, once

00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:12.966
it's been approved, and you've

00:25:13.146 --> 00:25:14.046
used App Store Connect to

00:25:14.046 --> 00:25:15.476
release it, the next thing that

00:25:15.596 --> 00:25:17.076
you'll be receiving his customer

00:25:17.076 --> 00:25:17.586
feedback.

00:25:17.876 --> 00:25:19.936
And here's one of the

00:25:19.936 --> 00:25:20.856
notifications that you may

00:25:20.856 --> 00:25:22.356
receive, a five-star review.

00:25:22.476 --> 00:25:24.906
Now recall we set up

00:25:25.136 --> 00:25:26.896
notifications for one and

00:25:26.896 --> 00:25:28.066
five-star reviews within App

00:25:28.066 --> 00:25:28.466
Store Connect.

00:25:30.216 --> 00:25:31.616
Since we set these up, you'll

00:25:31.616 --> 00:25:33.916
know the very minute a customer

00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:35.326
submits one of these reviews.

00:25:36.706 --> 00:25:38.186
You can access all customer

00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:39.816
feedback within App Store

00:25:39.816 --> 00:25:42.316
Connect by accessing the ratings

00:25:42.316 --> 00:25:44.236
and reviews section where you'll

00:25:44.236 --> 00:25:45.386
be able to see your current

00:25:45.386 --> 00:25:47.356
rating across any one of the

00:25:47.356 --> 00:25:49.426
territories you've selected or,

00:25:49.426 --> 00:25:50.616
obviously, all territories.

00:25:51.256 --> 00:25:52.806
You can also take a look at your

00:25:52.806 --> 00:25:55.246
reviews, read them in more

00:25:55.246 --> 00:25:57.336
detail, and reply to them.

00:25:57.716 --> 00:25:59.736
Now this is a satisfied customer

00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:00.876
so we're going to thank them for

00:26:00.876 --> 00:26:01.876
the positive feedback.

00:26:03.156 --> 00:26:04.546
That covers App Store Connect

00:26:04.546 --> 00:26:06.506
notifications and the quick

00:26:06.506 --> 00:26:07.496
actions that you can take from

00:26:07.496 --> 00:26:09.466
them but there's one more thing.

00:26:10.366 --> 00:26:12.036
We've also optimized App Store

00:26:12.036 --> 00:26:14.416
Connect for iPad.

00:26:14.636 --> 00:26:15.796
So let's take a quick look.

00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:18.316
As I mentioned earlier, you can

00:26:18.316 --> 00:26:19.896
view a certain apps sales and

00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:20.496
trends data.

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:22.056
And here is sales and trends for

00:26:22.056 --> 00:26:22.856
Forest Explorer.

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:25.146
You can see units.

00:26:25.196 --> 00:26:26.766
And we'll scroll down to updates

00:26:27.576 --> 00:26:29.606
and also drill down into the

00:26:29.606 --> 00:26:30.506
territories view.

00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:33.376
Now I'm sure you want to try

00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:34.356
this out on your own.

00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:36.076
And our app is actually

00:26:36.076 --> 00:26:36.706
available now.

00:26:36.706 --> 00:26:37.996
So if you haven't downloaded it

00:26:38.106 --> 00:26:39.706
already, please go ahead and do

00:26:39.706 --> 00:26:40.016
so.

00:26:40.806 --> 00:26:41.936
We've worked hard to bring an

00:26:41.996 --> 00:26:43.676
experience -- an improved mobile

00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:44.556
experience to you.

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:46.106
And we hope you'll enjoy using

00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:47.246
it as much as we enjoyed

00:26:47.246 --> 00:26:47.796
creating it.

00:26:48.796 --> 00:26:50.266
And with that, now back to

00:26:50.266 --> 00:26:50.646
Daniel.

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:57.036
[ Applause ]

00:26:57.536 --> 00:26:58.226
>> Thanks, Alex.

00:26:58.766 --> 00:27:00.316
So that's a beautiful new app

00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:02.336
that'll give you even more power

00:27:02.646 --> 00:27:04.606
to manage your apps on the go.

00:27:06.246 --> 00:27:08.536
So next we'd like to talk about

00:27:08.686 --> 00:27:10.726
a guideline change we made just

00:27:10.726 --> 00:27:13.236
this week that will let those of

00:27:13.236 --> 00:27:15.556
you with paid apps offer

00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:18.306
time-based free trials for your

00:27:18.306 --> 00:27:18.996
customers.

00:27:19.586 --> 00:27:23.146
Now those of you who are using

00:27:23.416 --> 00:27:24.906
subscriptions today know that

00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:27.046
free trials are a great way to

00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:28.496
attract new customers to your

00:27:28.496 --> 00:27:29.226
services.

00:27:29.436 --> 00:27:30.816
But we also know that

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:33.546
subscriptions aren't the model

00:27:33.546 --> 00:27:35.246
that works for every app which

00:27:35.246 --> 00:27:37.166
is why we're happy to now have a

00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:38.396
path for paid apps.

00:27:39.596 --> 00:27:41.276
So we're going to take a look at

00:27:41.276 --> 00:27:42.976
what this setup looks like.

00:27:43.526 --> 00:27:45.726
So let's say we start with a

00:27:45.726 --> 00:27:46.286
paid app.

00:27:47.356 --> 00:27:48.906
The first thing you would do is

00:27:48.906 --> 00:27:51.586
turn your paid app into a free

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:51.876
app.

00:27:52.986 --> 00:27:55.286
Now on top of this free app,

00:27:55.476 --> 00:27:56.586
you're going to add two

00:27:56.766 --> 00:27:58.856
non-consumable in-app purchases.

00:27:59.276 --> 00:28:02.076
The first is a free tier 0

00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:04.276
priced non-consumable.

00:28:04.756 --> 00:28:05.876
And you'll present this to your

00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:07.066
customers when they launch the

00:28:07.066 --> 00:28:10.076
app so that they can opt-in to

00:28:10.206 --> 00:28:10.946
the free trial.

00:28:11.616 --> 00:28:15.026
Now the second non-consumable is

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:16.696
the in-app purchase that you use

00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:18.796
to unlock your app functionality

00:28:18.796 --> 00:28:20.626
for that customer for good.

00:28:21.676 --> 00:28:23.136
You can present this at any

00:28:23.136 --> 00:28:24.376
point; in the beginning when

00:28:24.376 --> 00:28:26.256
they launch the app or when

00:28:26.376 --> 00:28:27.956
their free trial is complete.

00:28:28.646 --> 00:28:32.186
Now in order to use this setup,

00:28:32.706 --> 00:28:34.816
there are a few guidelines to

00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:35.976
look out for and to follow.

00:28:36.386 --> 00:28:40.786
First, make sure you name your

00:28:40.936 --> 00:28:43.356
trial in-app purchase with this

00:28:43.356 --> 00:28:44.246
naming convention.

00:28:44.866 --> 00:28:47.096
And next, you'll want to make

00:28:47.096 --> 00:28:48.596
sure that it's very clear to the

00:28:48.596 --> 00:28:49.956
customer exactly what they are

00:28:49.956 --> 00:28:50.766
signing up for.

00:28:51.456 --> 00:28:53.456
So please make sure that they

00:28:53.456 --> 00:28:54.976
know how long the free trial is

00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:56.786
going to last, how much it'll

00:28:56.786 --> 00:28:58.406
cost to unlock the

00:28:58.406 --> 00:29:00.826
functionality, and what kind of

00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:02.936
features and content won't be

00:29:02.936 --> 00:29:04.336
available anymore after the

00:29:04.336 --> 00:29:06.246
trial if they decide not to

00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:06.776
continue.

00:29:10.276 --> 00:29:10.576
All right.

00:29:10.576 --> 00:29:12.136
So we talked about a number of

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:13.136
new features today.

00:29:13.136 --> 00:29:14.906
So let's take a second to recap

00:29:14.976 --> 00:29:15.156
them.

00:29:16.146 --> 00:29:17.386
First, we're launching an

00:29:17.386 --> 00:29:19.316
all-new App Store Connect API

00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:20.426
this summer.

00:29:21.116 --> 00:29:24.336
We're unifying where you go to

00:29:24.336 --> 00:29:25.336
manage your users.

00:29:25.856 --> 00:29:30.126
We've extended app Transporter

00:29:30.696 --> 00:29:32.696
to support Linux.

00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:35.706
We're launching TestFlight

00:29:35.706 --> 00:29:37.106
public links, which will make it

00:29:37.106 --> 00:29:39.116
a lot easier for you to invite

00:29:39.116 --> 00:29:40.396
large numbers of testers.

00:29:41.786 --> 00:29:43.266
We've launched a brand-new sales

00:29:43.266 --> 00:29:46.416
and trends overview page, a new

00:29:46.416 --> 00:29:48.556
App Store Connect for iOS page,

00:29:49.126 --> 00:29:50.936
and a path for you to offer

00:29:50.936 --> 00:29:53.876
trials to customers on your paid

00:29:53.876 --> 00:29:54.356
apps.

00:29:54.776 --> 00:29:56.466
Now these are features that will

00:29:56.466 --> 00:29:58.506
be launching between now and the

00:29:58.506 --> 00:29:59.146
end of the summer.

00:29:59.596 --> 00:30:01.926
But we also have two significant

00:30:01.926 --> 00:30:03.226
features we launched over the

00:30:03.226 --> 00:30:04.896
past year that we'd like to

00:30:04.896 --> 00:30:05.336
highlight.

00:30:06.066 --> 00:30:08.466
And these are intro pricing and

00:30:08.466 --> 00:30:09.166
pre-orders.

00:30:09.636 --> 00:30:13.796
So introductory pricing, for

00:30:13.796 --> 00:30:14.656
those of you who use

00:30:14.656 --> 00:30:17.246
subscriptions, is a great way to

00:30:17.246 --> 00:30:18.946
incentivize new customers to

00:30:18.946 --> 00:30:20.376
sign up for your subscriptions.

00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:23.236
Now you do this by offering your

00:30:23.236 --> 00:30:25.296
customers a discounted

00:30:25.706 --> 00:30:27.546
introductory price at the

00:30:27.546 --> 00:30:29.076
beginning of your subscription.

00:30:29.346 --> 00:30:31.246
There are three different

00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:32.456
pricing models we offer for

00:30:32.456 --> 00:30:32.846
this.

00:30:33.556 --> 00:30:35.576
First, we have free trials.

00:30:36.446 --> 00:30:38.106
Now with free trials, your

00:30:38.106 --> 00:30:40.656
customers sign up for free.

00:30:41.356 --> 00:30:43.016
They use your services for the

00:30:43.016 --> 00:30:44.056
introductory period.

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:45.816
And at the end of the period,

00:30:46.056 --> 00:30:47.806
they move on to your regular

00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:48.766
subscription price.

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:51.566
Next, we have a model that we

00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:52.706
call pay upfront.

00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.616
With this model, your customers

00:30:54.616 --> 00:30:56.416
sign up and they pay one time at

00:30:56.416 --> 00:30:57.196
the beginning of your

00:30:57.196 --> 00:30:58.096
introductory period.

00:30:58.856 --> 00:30:59.796
And, again, at the end of the

00:30:59.796 --> 00:31:01.806
period, the regular subscription

00:31:01.806 --> 00:31:03.006
price kicks in.

00:31:04.036 --> 00:31:06.886
And finally, we have pay as you

00:31:06.886 --> 00:31:07.236
go.

00:31:07.856 --> 00:31:09.006
With pay as you go, your

00:31:09.006 --> 00:31:11.246
customers pay a recurring

00:31:11.356 --> 00:31:13.416
discounted price during the

00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:14.486
introductory period.

00:31:15.066 --> 00:31:17.446
Now once the entire period has

00:31:17.446 --> 00:31:19.486
been completed then they move on

00:31:19.486 --> 00:31:20.546
to the regular subscription

00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:21.026
price.

00:31:21.586 --> 00:31:23.576
Now we have two related sessions

00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:25.386
that happened yesterday that

00:31:25.386 --> 00:31:26.656
have more information around the

00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:28.846
StoreKit side and best practices

00:31:28.846 --> 00:31:30.756
around both intro pricing and

00:31:30.756 --> 00:31:31.506
subscriptions.

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:33.336
They are Best Practices and

00:31:33.336 --> 00:31:34.776
What's New with In-App Purchases

00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:36.386
and Engineering Subscriptions.

00:31:36.386 --> 00:31:38.376
So check those out if you have a

00:31:38.376 --> 00:31:38.836
chance.

00:31:39.586 --> 00:31:42.986
So next we have pre-orders.

00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:44.876
Now pre-orders are a great way

00:31:44.876 --> 00:31:46.096
for you to drum up excitement

00:31:46.096 --> 00:31:48.056
for your app before your app is

00:31:48.056 --> 00:31:50.116
actually available for download

00:31:50.446 --> 00:31:51.246
or purchase.

00:31:51.816 --> 00:31:54.346
In order to set up a pre-order,

00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:56.726
you can take any app that has

00:31:56.726 --> 00:31:58.046
not yet been released on the App

00:31:58.046 --> 00:32:01.186
Store and you can enable it.

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:02.456
After you submit it to app

00:32:02.456 --> 00:32:03.646
review and that app has been

00:32:03.646 --> 00:32:06.196
approved, you can release that

00:32:06.196 --> 00:32:07.876
app to the App Store as a

00:32:07.876 --> 00:32:08.406
pre-order.

00:32:10.656 --> 00:32:12.006
Once that pre-order period is

00:32:12.006 --> 00:32:13.426
over and your customers have

00:32:13.536 --> 00:32:17.386
signed up for your pre-order,

00:32:17.606 --> 00:32:18.846
your app will move into ready

00:32:18.846 --> 00:32:20.206
for sale state where your

00:32:20.206 --> 00:32:22.386
customers can now download or

00:32:22.386 --> 00:32:23.866
purchase that app.

00:32:24.336 --> 00:32:26.436
It's also at this transition

00:32:26.636 --> 00:32:28.036
that customers that have signed

00:32:28.036 --> 00:32:29.416
up for your pre-order are

00:32:29.416 --> 00:32:30.966
charged for the price of your

00:32:31.146 --> 00:32:31.746
app.

00:32:32.486 --> 00:32:35.226
Now let's take a look at how you

00:32:35.226 --> 00:32:36.336
might set this up in App Store

00:32:36.336 --> 00:32:36.676
Connect.

00:32:37.546 --> 00:32:39.356
We begin here on the pricing and

00:32:39.356 --> 00:32:40.316
availability page.

00:32:41.166 --> 00:32:42.366
Again, if this app has never

00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:43.856
been released to the App Store,

00:32:44.996 --> 00:32:45.776
you'll see a section in the

00:32:45.776 --> 00:32:47.666
middle here labeled pre-orders.

00:32:47.746 --> 00:32:48.666
Here, you can enable your

00:32:48.666 --> 00:32:50.806
pre-orders and set a release

00:32:50.806 --> 00:32:51.076
date.

00:32:51.886 --> 00:32:53.926
This release date is a date on

00:32:53.926 --> 00:32:55.996
which your app goes from being

00:32:55.996 --> 00:32:57.376
available as a pre-order on the

00:32:57.376 --> 00:33:00.106
App Store to being available as

00:33:00.106 --> 00:33:01.586
a download or purchase on the

00:33:01.586 --> 00:33:02.086
App Store.

00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:03.376
In other words, this is when it

00:33:03.376 --> 00:33:04.536
goes from pre-order ready for

00:33:04.536 --> 00:33:06.126
sale to ready for sale.

00:33:06.846 --> 00:33:09.096
Now once you've gone through app

00:33:09.096 --> 00:33:10.396
review and your app is in

00:33:10.396 --> 00:33:11.766
pending developer release state,

00:33:11.936 --> 00:33:13.116
you'll see a button in the top

00:33:13.246 --> 00:33:14.026
right corner.

00:33:14.296 --> 00:33:15.966
This is the release pre-order

00:33:15.966 --> 00:33:16.326
button.

00:33:16.876 --> 00:33:18.306
You click this button to make

00:33:18.306 --> 00:33:19.406
your app available on the App

00:33:19.406 --> 00:33:20.956
Store as a pre-order.

00:33:22.456 --> 00:33:24.756
Once you do this, you'll see a

00:33:24.756 --> 00:33:26.436
banner at the top of the page

00:33:27.366 --> 00:33:28.686
telling you when your pre-order

00:33:28.686 --> 00:33:31.796
started and when it completes.

00:33:32.226 --> 00:33:33.796
This completion date is simply

00:33:33.906 --> 00:33:35.416
the release date that you set

00:33:35.706 --> 00:33:36.466
for your app.

00:33:36.836 --> 00:33:38.336
Now if you'd like to release

00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:40.136
this app before the release date

00:33:40.856 --> 00:33:42.956
or more immediately, you can

00:33:42.956 --> 00:33:45.276
click the release app now button

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:46.596
in the top right corner.

00:33:47.346 --> 00:33:49.666
And that's intro pricing and

00:33:49.666 --> 00:33:51.166
pre-orders in a nutshell.

00:33:51.806 --> 00:33:54.176
So we have to close out this

00:33:54.176 --> 00:33:56.256
session with a few best

00:33:56.256 --> 00:33:57.486
practices from app review.

00:33:57.616 --> 00:33:59.236
These are a few tips that'll

00:33:59.236 --> 00:34:00.396
help your apps to get through

00:34:00.396 --> 00:34:01.966
review a little more smoothly.

00:34:03.156 --> 00:34:06.616
First, please enter contact

00:34:06.616 --> 00:34:08.436
information and keep it current

00:34:08.436 --> 00:34:09.835
throughout the review process.

00:34:10.446 --> 00:34:12.166
Sometimes app review needs to

00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:14.616
reach out to maybe ask a few

00:34:14.616 --> 00:34:16.666
questions to clarify how your

00:34:16.666 --> 00:34:17.416
app works.

00:34:18.216 --> 00:34:19.806
This will help us to get your

00:34:19.806 --> 00:34:20.946
app through review a bit more

00:34:20.946 --> 00:34:23.556
quickly, but we can't reach out

00:34:23.556 --> 00:34:25.116
to you without contact

00:34:25.116 --> 00:34:25.646
information.

00:34:26.966 --> 00:34:30.466
Next, please submit demo account

00:34:30.466 --> 00:34:32.396
information if your app requires

00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:32.976
a log in.

00:34:34.196 --> 00:34:35.505
There's a section on the version

00:34:35.505 --> 00:34:37.516
page where you can enter this

00:34:37.636 --> 00:34:38.826
and keep it updated.

00:34:39.696 --> 00:34:41.416
Please make sure the account --

00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:42.696
this account information is

00:34:42.696 --> 00:34:44.056
current throughout the review

00:34:44.056 --> 00:34:44.716
process.

00:34:44.716 --> 00:34:46.466
And if there is a server side to

00:34:46.466 --> 00:34:47.936
the log in, which usually there

00:34:47.936 --> 00:34:50.016
is, please make sure that the

00:34:50.016 --> 00:34:51.646
server side account is also

00:34:51.646 --> 00:34:53.056
enabled throughout the process.

00:34:53.585 --> 00:34:57.556
You may be wondering does app

00:34:57.556 --> 00:34:58.776
review ever look at the notes?

00:34:59.256 --> 00:35:00.356
Well, yes they do.

00:35:00.806 --> 00:35:01.796
They look at it with every

00:35:01.796 --> 00:35:02.596
single review.

00:35:03.026 --> 00:35:04.786
So if there is any information

00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:06.776
that might make it clearer for

00:35:06.776 --> 00:35:09.556
app review or maybe tells them

00:35:09.556 --> 00:35:11.226
about any kind of non-obvious

00:35:11.226 --> 00:35:13.096
features of your app, be sure to

00:35:13.096 --> 00:35:14.996
include that information in

00:35:14.996 --> 00:35:15.776
these notes.

00:35:16.906 --> 00:35:20.056
When you submit screenshots,

00:35:20.446 --> 00:35:21.756
please make sure to include

00:35:22.366 --> 00:35:23.996
customer experience.

00:35:24.636 --> 00:35:26.476
We want to see what the customer

00:35:26.476 --> 00:35:28.266
sees in these screenshots.

00:35:28.766 --> 00:35:31.376
And finally, if you're asking

00:35:31.376 --> 00:35:33.076
your customers for permissions

00:35:33.266 --> 00:35:35.316
around things like their

00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:37.136
location or maybe access to

00:35:37.136 --> 00:35:39.786
their photo library, please

00:35:39.786 --> 00:35:41.156
include, in that permission

00:35:41.156 --> 00:35:42.766
modal, why you're requesting

00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:45.016
that information and how it's

00:35:45.016 --> 00:35:46.176
going to be used.

00:35:47.786 --> 00:35:49.466
And those are a few notes from

00:35:49.466 --> 00:35:49.876
app review.

00:35:50.536 --> 00:35:53.006
For more information about

00:35:53.006 --> 00:35:53.926

00:35:55.596 --> 00:35:57.046
A recording of this video will

00:35:57.046 --> 00:35:58.196
be posted there along with

00:35:59.326 --> 00:36:01.586

We also have a few related

00:36:06.156 --> 00:36:06.836
sessions.

00:36:07.006 --> 00:36:08.306
Tomorrow, as Tommy mentioned, we

00:36:08.306 --> 00:36:09.896
have our Automating App Store

00:36:09.896 --> 00:36:12.586
Connect session at 3:00 where

00:36:12.586 --> 00:36:13.736
we're going to take you into a

00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:15.686
deep dive of the API and show

00:36:15.686 --> 00:36:19.456
you how to use the API at a much

00:36:19.626 --> 00:36:20.216
deeper level.

00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:23.886
We also have two labs coming up,

00:36:23.886 --> 00:36:25.286
one tomorrow and one the day

00:36:25.286 --> 00:36:25.696
after.

00:36:25.696 --> 00:36:26.826
So if you'd like to come and

00:36:26.826 --> 00:36:28.716

00:36:28.716 --> 00:36:28.986

00:36:30.266 --> 00:36:31.396

00:36:31.396 --> 00:36:33.496

00:36:33.496 --> 00:36:34.576

00:36:34.576 --> 00:36:35.476

00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.786

00:36:39.776 --> 00:36:41.076

00:36:41.076 --> 00:36:42.266

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.416
