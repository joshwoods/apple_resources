00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.066
>> Good morning, everyone.

00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:28.476
Thank you so much for coming to

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:29.216
our session.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.446
My name is Sara Radi.

00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:31.636
I'm a software engineer in the

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:33.576
Localization Team at Apple and

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:34.746
today we'll be joined by my

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:36.526
colleagues, Vivian and Chris, to

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:37.996
talk about new location

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.646
workflows with Xcode 10.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:42.486
So first I would like to start

00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:44.136
with a quick overview of how the

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:45.906
localization process used to

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.486
work before Xcode 10.

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:50.856
Then I will introduce the Xcode

00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:52.486
Localization Catalog, which is

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.786
the new format for exports and

00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:56.706
imports in your localizations in

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:57.556
Xcode 10.

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:00.026
Finally, Chris will talk about

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.276
how to localize Siri Shortcuts

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:03.906
by using an Intent definition

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.936
file which is a new file format

00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:07.546
we introduced this year as well

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:08.646
in Xcode 10.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.536
So let's get started with a

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.576
quick overview.

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:17.666
So before Xcode 10, if you had a

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:19.166
project that contains

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.996
localizations that your

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:22.676
application supports, we look

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.276
for strings base localizable

00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:25.696
resources in your project.

00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:27.746
So these strings can be defined

00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:29.026
in your source code, your

00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:30.546
storyboard files, your strings

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:31.606
files, or your strings

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:32.186
dictionaries.

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:34.466
So once we identify these

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.426
resources, we extract strings

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:38.786
from them and we export them in

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:39.766
an XLIFF format.

00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:42.556
So XLIFF is an industry standard

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:44.296
and most localizers are already

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:45.056
familiar with.

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:46.536
So that's what you will be

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:48.246
sending over for translations.

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:51.546
So once you get your XLIFF files

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:54.216
back translated on imports, we

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:55.356
add them to localizable

00:01:55.356 --> 00:01:57.596
resources in your Xcode projects

00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:59.346
with the new translations that

00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:01.036
are provided in the XLIFF files.

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:02.356
So that is pretty

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.576
straightforward process.

00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:08.216
Now, the XLIFF format provides a

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:09.856
lot of benefits for you as a

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:10.536
developer.

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:12.916
First, it helps you to extract

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.726
the localization work from your

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.396
code so you don't have to make

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:18.266
any language assumptions in your

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:18.886
source code.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:21.776
XLIFF files also holds the

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:23.896
content to be localized from

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:25.736
your development language along

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:27.306
with the translations so your

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:28.696
translators can do their work

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:31.096
right in the XLIFF files that

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:32.006
you have provided.

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:35.246
In addition to that, instead of

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:37.096
handing over multiple file types

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:38.736
and keep track of them, XLIFF is

00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:40.406
a really nice tool that

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:41.926
consolidates strings from

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:43.556
different resources and

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:45.186
different file types into one

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:46.536
single document.

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:50.466
But what XLIFF does not provide

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:52.126
your localizers, it does not

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:53.846
give them that visual and

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.046
functional context.

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:57.806
It does not provide the resource

00:02:57.806 --> 00:02:59.266
data like assets in your

00:02:59.266 --> 00:02:59.786
project.

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:01.326
For example, a storyboard file

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:02.956
will be very helpful for your

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:05.416
localizers to picture how your

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:06.356
UI is laid out in your

00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:07.496
development language.

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:11.336
It also does not provide with

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:13.176
the custom metadata about the

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:14.956
generated XLIFF.

00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:16.826
And finally, the XLIFF we

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.336
generate today does not have

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:20.146
size and length restrictions

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:21.836
attributes and that might be

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:23.646
very helpful for your localizers

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:25.586
to know if a given string will

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:26.986
be showing on a Watch screen or

00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:28.636
an iPhone screen or an iPad

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:30.156
screen to make decisions about

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:31.596
the length of the translation.

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:36.136
So why is context important for

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:37.116
your localizers?

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:40.226
So if we take a look at this

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:43.026
example from a travel app that

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:44.646
we will be showing you later in

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:47.196
our demo, so if you look at the

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.746
string that says "Book" on the

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:51.366
right corner of the Navigation

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.856
bar, it's kind of clear to all

00:03:53.856 --> 00:03:55.346
of us here in the room that

00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:56.626
"book" refers to something

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:58.796
related to travels because we

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.626
have that visual context right

00:04:00.626 --> 00:04:02.106
in front of us that says start

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:04.026
day and dates, number of

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:05.666
travelers and the price.

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:08.726
But if you send your translators

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:11.136
an XLIFF files, the only thing

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:12.616
they see there is just the

00:04:12.746 --> 00:04:14.196
string "Book" and that don't

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:16.046
have that visual context that we

00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:17.526
were looking at earlier.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:20.666
So Book can refer to two

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:21.356
different things.

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:23.936
It can be a noun in the context

00:04:23.936 --> 00:04:26.726
of reading a book or it can be a

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:28.966
verb in the context of booking a

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:31.586
hotel room somewhere or a flight

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.246
ticket or travel in general.

00:04:33.846 --> 00:04:35.446
I actually asked our Russian

00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:36.936
translator if he can translate

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:38.386
the word "book" for me without

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:39.936
giving him any additional

00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:42.176
context and he came up with all

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:43.426
these different options.

00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:45.756
So without giving him that extra

00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:47.186
context, it would be very

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.756
difficult for him to decide

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:50.586
which string to show in the UI

00:04:50.586 --> 00:04:52.266
for Russian users, for example.

00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:55.266
Context can also be important

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:57.166
for your localizers to decide

00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.156
about the length of the

00:04:58.156 --> 00:04:58.976
translations they are using.

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:02.436
So if we take a look at this

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.646
example, so I have this phrase

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:06.196
that says, "Booking confirmed"

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:08.416
in English and it fits just fine

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:10.446
on a Watch screen, but in

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:12.086
French, for example, it

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:12.716
truncates.

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:15.256
So first of all, when it

00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:16.536
truncates, it doesn't look that

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:18.846
nice in the UI and sometimes the

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:20.366
truncation can change the

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:21.996
meaning of the word.

00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:23.826
It can even be offensive for

00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:24.556
your users.

00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:26.736
It can be like funny, like in

00:05:26.736 --> 00:05:28.576
this example, like the phase

00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:30.896
does not say that your booking

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:31.926
was confirmed anymore.

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:33.366
It says our booking was stupid

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.306
which is not what I really

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:34.826
wanted.

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:39.626
So we see that context is very

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:40.976
important to provide to your

00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:43.386
customers or to your localizers

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:45.016
to ship high-quality

00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:46.426
localization.

00:05:47.476 --> 00:05:49.156
So now I would like to introduce

00:05:49.456 --> 00:05:51.416
the Xcode Localization Catalog,

00:05:51.606 --> 00:05:53.506
which is the new format for

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:55.646
exporting and importing your

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:58.596
localizations in Xcode 10.

00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:01.126
So what is an Xcode Localization

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:01.606
Catalog?

00:06:02.146 --> 00:06:04.666
It is a new type of localization

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:07.046
artifact that has that .xcloc

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:07.806
extension.

00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:11.246
It is produced by the export

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:13.056
localization command in Xcode,

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:14.316
so it's the same command that

00:06:14.316 --> 00:06:16.106
used to export XLIFF files

00:06:16.386 --> 00:06:17.596
before Xcode 10.

00:06:18.126 --> 00:06:20.396
And it is consumed by the import

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:21.606
localization command.

00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:24.546
And the main thing about the

00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:27.126
Localization Catalog is that it

00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:29.826
supports all of your localizable

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:32.076
assets, which means anything

00:06:32.076 --> 00:06:34.296
that you mark as localizable in

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:36.076
Xcode projects, it will be

00:06:36.126 --> 00:06:37.686
supported by Localization

00:06:37.686 --> 00:06:39.376
Catalog and that is beyond

00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:40.496
strings files.

00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:45.976
[ Applause ]

00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:47.946
Another important thing about

00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:50.236
the Localization Catalog is that

00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:52.236
it provides that additional

00:06:52.476 --> 00:06:54.806
contextual information for your

00:06:54.806 --> 00:06:55.566
localizers.

00:06:57.256 --> 00:06:58.176
So we built the Xcode

00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:00.086
Localization Catalog on top of

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.106
the XLIFF format.

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:03.416
So if we take a look at our

00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:05.696
example earlier, so all of our

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:07.206
strings base localizable

00:07:07.206 --> 00:07:09.416
resources will be extracted in

00:07:09.416 --> 00:07:11.726
an XLIFF format and anything

00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:13.406
else that you have marked as

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:16.116
localizable in your project will

00:07:16.116 --> 00:07:17.906
be supported by the Localization

00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:21.006
Catalog and exported in an xcloc

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:23.326
along with the XLIFF files that

00:07:23.356 --> 00:07:24.336
contains the strings.

00:07:25.416 --> 00:07:27.066
So let's take a look closely at

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:29.176
what is inside a Localization

00:07:29.176 --> 00:07:29.706
Catalog.

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:33.156
So inside your xcloc, you will

00:07:33.156 --> 00:07:36.536
find a contents.json file, which

00:07:36.536 --> 00:07:38.656
contains metadata about the

00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:40.486
exported Localization Catalog.

00:07:40.906 --> 00:07:43.286
So it has information like the

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:45.106
development language of your

00:07:45.106 --> 00:07:47.806
application, the target language

00:07:47.806 --> 00:07:49.456
of the exported Localization

00:07:49.456 --> 00:07:50.006
Catalog.

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:52.046
It has information about the

00:07:52.046 --> 00:07:53.416
tool that generated that

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:54.506
Localization Catalog.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:55.846
In this case, it's Xcode, so you

00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:57.436
will find information like the

00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:58.756
version number and the build

00:07:58.756 --> 00:07:59.936
number of Xcode.

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:02.536
And finally, it has the version

00:08:02.536 --> 00:08:04.196
number of the exported

00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:05.426
Localization Catalog.

00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:09.166
Next inside the generated xcloc,

00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:11.986
you will find Localized Contents

00:08:11.986 --> 00:08:12.696
directory.

00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:14.876
And Localized Contents contains

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:16.436
all of your localizable

00:08:16.436 --> 00:08:18.886
resources in the project and

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:20.816
this is the main directory where

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:22.566
your localizers will be doing

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:23.326
their work in.

00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:26.986
So inside Localized Contents, as

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:29.736
I mentioned, you will find an

00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:32.096
XLIFF document that has all the

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:34.456
project localized strings as

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:36.606
well as non-strings localizable

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:38.826
assets like images, for example,

00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:40.265
if you want to localize those.

00:08:40.996 --> 00:08:42.246
So those assets will be

00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:44.176
organized into the same file

00:08:44.246 --> 00:08:46.276
system hierarchy as your Xcode

00:08:46.356 --> 00:08:48.096
projects inside the Localization

00:08:48.096 --> 00:08:48.616
Catalog.

00:08:49.786 --> 00:08:51.956
And your localizers can also use

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:54.306
Localized Content to override

00:08:54.486 --> 00:08:57.016
any resources specifically for

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:58.726
the language like interface

00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:00.336
builder files, for example.

00:09:00.826 --> 00:09:05.206
Next, inside the Localization

00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:07.176
Catalog, we generate a Source

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.976
Contents directory and this is

00:09:08.976 --> 00:09:11.356
mainly provided for context.

00:09:12.156 --> 00:09:14.336
So Source Contents contains

00:09:14.606 --> 00:09:16.336
assets that were used to produce

00:09:16.336 --> 00:09:18.056
the Localized Contents like

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:19.576
storyboards for example that

00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:20.656
will be helpful for your

00:09:20.656 --> 00:09:23.096
localizers to see how your UI is

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.366
laid out in your development

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:25.366
language so they can make

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:27.486
decisions about the length of

00:09:27.486 --> 00:09:28.416
the translations.

00:09:29.366 --> 00:09:30.816
So even if your localized

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:32.006
strings are coming from your

00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.166
source code, we do not generate

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:36.086
your source code inside the

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:37.086
Source Contents.

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:39.676
So those assets that are mainly

00:09:39.676 --> 00:09:41.686
provided for context will be

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:43.546
also organized into the same

00:09:43.546 --> 00:09:44.956
file system hierarchy are your

00:09:44.956 --> 00:09:46.316
Xcode project inside the

00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:48.616
Localization Catalog and, as I

00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:50.026
mentioned, this is mainly

00:09:50.026 --> 00:09:51.776
provided for context even if

00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:53.566
your localizers go and change

00:09:53.566 --> 00:09:55.956
your source context on import,

00:09:55.956 --> 00:09:58.026
Xcode will just ignore them and

00:09:58.026 --> 00:10:00.246
will not import these resources

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:01.936
back into your projects.

00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:05.726
Finally, inside your

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:07.166
Localization Catalog, you will

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:09.426
find a Notes directory and this

00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:11.646
is mainly provided for you to

00:10:11.646 --> 00:10:13.766
give any additional contextual

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:15.946
information for your localizers.

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:18.546
That can be screenshots data

00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:21.486
from your UI Attachments for

00:10:21.486 --> 00:10:22.046
example.

00:10:22.976 --> 00:10:25.176
It can be a Readme file or a

00:10:25.176 --> 00:10:28.016
movie that explains information

00:10:28.016 --> 00:10:30.276
about your app or anything

00:10:30.276 --> 00:10:31.476
really you think that will be

00:10:31.476 --> 00:10:34.026
important for your localizers.

00:10:34.576 --> 00:10:35.476
So that was the Xcode

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:37.286
Localization Catalog structure.

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:40.026
And we have been also working on

00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:42.156
updating the Xcode build command

00:10:42.156 --> 00:10:42.836
line tools.

00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:45.196
So now on exports, we generate

00:10:45.196 --> 00:10:46.966
an Xcode Localization Catalog.

00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:49.086
And on imports, the imports

00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:51.406
command is backwards compatible.

00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:53.386
So if you still have those old

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:54.626
XLIFF files, you can still

00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:55.946
important them back into your

00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:58.226
project or you can import back

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:00.436
the new Localization Catalog.

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:03.126
And with that, I would like to

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:04.736
hand it over to Vivian to give

00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:06.046
you a demonstration about the

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:07.126
Localization Catalog.

00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:07.886
Thank you so much.

00:11:08.516 --> 00:11:12.916
[ Applause ]

00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:13.976
>> Thanks, Sara.

00:11:19.036 --> 00:11:20.776
Alright, so we've been working

00:11:20.776 --> 00:11:23.226
on a travel app and what makes

00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:25.246
this special is it's the first

00:11:25.246 --> 00:11:27.506
app to let you plan vacations to

00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:28.256
other planets.

00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:30.256
So we call it Vacation Planet.

00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:31.156
Let's take a look.

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:33.966
Alright, so on the splash screen

00:11:33.966 --> 00:11:35.626
we have this lovely logo with

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:37.706
the name of our app.

00:11:37.706 --> 00:11:38.576
And I'm just going to click

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:38.996
Browse here.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.146
Alright, so we can book a

00:11:41.276 --> 00:11:43.816
flight, an expedition, a cruise,

00:11:44.046 --> 00:11:45.546
or an entire vacation package.

00:11:45.666 --> 00:11:46.806
Let's go to Mars.

00:11:49.106 --> 00:11:50.406
Okay, now I need to choose where

00:11:50.406 --> 00:11:52.536
on Mars to go and I think we

00:11:52.536 --> 00:11:53.966
should check in on the NASA

00:11:53.966 --> 00:11:55.106
Curiosity Rover.

00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:56.416
So let's go to Gale Creator.

00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:59.036
We should definitely go after

00:11:59.106 --> 00:11:59.946
the conference.

00:12:00.816 --> 00:12:03.686
And let's go for a month.

00:12:03.686 --> 00:12:05.236
It's a really fast spaceship.

00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:07.546
I'm going to take Sara and Chris

00:12:07.546 --> 00:12:08.706
with me, so three travelers.

00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:11.346
That's a really cheap trip to

00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:11.636
Mars.

00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:14.256
Alright, here's that Book button

00:12:14.256 --> 00:12:15.046
you saw earlier.

00:12:15.956 --> 00:12:17.116
And great, our booking is

00:12:17.116 --> 00:12:17.656
confirmed.

00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:20.106
Now, of course, there's people

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.806
all over Earth who would love to

00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:23.656
visit Mars and they don't all

00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:25.506
use their iOS devices in

00:12:25.506 --> 00:12:26.096
English.

00:12:26.436 --> 00:12:27.336
So we're going to need to

00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:29.166
localize the app.

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:32.756
Let's go into Xcode and do that.

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:34.626
Alright, so I just need to

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:36.866
select my project here.

00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:38.286
And under Info, under

00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:40.796
Localizations, click Plus, and

00:12:40.796 --> 00:12:41.986
we're going to add French for

00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:42.526
starters.

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:47.086
Okay. So my storyboards are

00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:48.756
localizable by default, so

00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:49.586
they're already checked.

00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:51.356
And a have a localizable

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:53.306
stringsdict that I also already

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:54.406
marked localizable.

00:12:54.586 --> 00:12:55.916
So I just need to click Finish.

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:59.656
Alright, at this point, Xcode

00:12:59.686 --> 00:13:01.696
has created the fr.lproj in my

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:04.106
project and for by storyboards

00:13:04.556 --> 00:13:06.586
has created strings files with

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:08.446
copies of my English strings.

00:13:09.796 --> 00:13:12.936
So also copy my image because I

00:13:12.936 --> 00:13:14.506
have not marked it localizable.

00:13:14.736 --> 00:13:15.336
So let's do that.

00:13:16.416 --> 00:13:17.356
Over the right, just lick

00:13:17.356 --> 00:13:17.866
Localize.

00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:19.696
There's no content shared

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:21.116
between the languages in this

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:21.516
file.

00:13:21.706 --> 00:13:23.396
So I need to put it in English

00:13:23.876 --> 00:13:24.896
because that's my development

00:13:24.896 --> 00:13:25.436
language.

00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:29.296
Click Localize and check French

00:13:29.296 --> 00:13:30.246
to make that copy.

00:13:31.316 --> 00:13:32.276
Alright, there it is.

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:35.556
Okay, now I'm ready to export

00:13:35.556 --> 00:13:36.456
for localization.

00:13:37.336 --> 00:13:39.926
I'll just select my project, go

00:13:39.926 --> 00:13:42.246
to Editor, Export for

00:13:42.246 --> 00:13:43.136
Localization.

00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:45.396
Alright, I'm going to call this

00:13:45.396 --> 00:13:46.916
vacationplanetloc, so I don't

00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:48.356
have to type out localization,

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:50.606
and double check that I'm

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:53.746
exporting for French and click

00:13:53.806 --> 00:13:54.036
Save.

00:13:55.156 --> 00:13:57.116
So now Xcode generates that

00:13:57.116 --> 00:13:58.986
Xcode Localization Catalog for

00:13:58.986 --> 00:14:01.166
me and we can go into Finder and

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:03.006
look at it.

00:14:03.236 --> 00:14:05.126
Alright, here we go.

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.556
Here is my French Xcode

00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:09.206
Localization Catalog with that

00:14:09.396 --> 00:14:10.596
.xcloc extension.

00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:13.406
And inside, as Sara said,

00:14:13.976 --> 00:14:15.886
there's the contents.json with

00:14:15.886 --> 00:14:17.106
metadata about my Xcode

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:18.196
Localization Catalog.

00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:20.496
Next, we have Localized

00:14:20.576 --> 00:14:21.106
Contents.

00:14:21.296 --> 00:14:23.866
So in here, I have an XLIFF, the

00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:25.936
same as if I had used Xcode 9.

00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:29.686
You can see here it has all of

00:14:29.686 --> 00:14:33.556
my strings and here we can see

00:14:33.556 --> 00:14:34.586
highlighted in red the

00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:36.006
untranslated copies of the

00:14:36.006 --> 00:14:36.646
English.

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:39.926
And also in Localized Contents

00:14:40.976 --> 00:14:42.436
mimicking the file hierarchy of

00:14:42.436 --> 00:14:44.466
my project, I have that logo

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:44.996
image.

00:14:45.586 --> 00:14:47.856
So next let's look at Source

00:14:47.896 --> 00:14:48.456
Contents.

00:14:49.126 --> 00:14:50.836
This likewise mimics the file

00:14:50.836 --> 00:14:52.676
hierarchy of my Xcode project.

00:14:53.346 --> 00:14:55.666
So I have my storyboards that

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:56.996
are in base and I have the

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:58.716
English for my info plist

00:14:58.886 --> 00:15:00.986
strings, my localizable.strings

00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:02.356
for the strings defined in code,

00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:05.246
my localizable stringsdict and

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:06.546
the English version of the

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:06.976
image.

00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:09.806
So the last part of Xcode

00:15:09.806 --> 00:15:11.556
Localization Catalog is the

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:12.366
Notes folder.

00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:14.486
And Xcode doesn't put anything

00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:17.906
in here, but yesterday, I ran my

00:15:17.906 --> 00:15:20.106
XCUI tests, which are a really

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:22.556
easy way to create screenshots.

00:15:23.886 --> 00:15:26.086
And all my screenshots are saved

00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:28.196
as attachments to my test.

00:15:28.576 --> 00:15:29.606
So we can go back and look at my

00:15:29.606 --> 00:15:32.236
test results, see them.

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:35.756
So for instance, I have my

00:15:35.906 --> 00:15:37.436
splash screen added as an

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:38.386
attachment here.

00:15:38.926 --> 00:15:40.866
There we go.

00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:42.976
Alright, so I'm just going to

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:45.856
pull these up in Finder and copy

00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:47.306
them into the Notes folder.

00:15:47.426 --> 00:15:48.986
So select Show in Finder.

00:15:50.146 --> 00:15:52.266
Alright, Show Package Contents,

00:15:52.526 --> 00:15:53.576
look at Attachments.

00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:55.146
There they are.

00:15:56.556 --> 00:16:00.746
Copy and Paste.

00:16:02.766 --> 00:16:04.046
And I think this Travel Details

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:05.276
one is going to be particularly

00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:06.626
helpful because it has that

00:16:06.626 --> 00:16:09.646
troublesome Book button in it.

00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:11.866
Alright, now I'm ready to send

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:14.166
my entire Xcode Localization

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:16.306
Catalog off to my localizers.

00:16:16.856 --> 00:16:19.986
Now the great thing is they're

00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:21.426
really fast and they're already

00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:21.796
done.

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:23.016
So we can go ahead and import

00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:23.896
those translations.

00:16:24.356 --> 00:16:26.466
Just going to go back to my

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:26.946
project.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.196
Make sure I have the project

00:16:29.246 --> 00:16:29.776
selected.

00:16:30.716 --> 00:16:32.136
And as before, go to Editor and

00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:34.736
this time choose Import

00:16:34.736 --> 00:16:35.536
Localizations.

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:38.476
Okay? So I'm going to pick my

00:16:38.476 --> 00:16:40.056
Return to Xcode Localization

00:16:40.056 --> 00:16:40.566
Catalog.

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:42.056
Click Open.

00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:45.256
And now I get a comparison view

00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:46.776
the same as in Xcode 9 that

00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:48.486
shows me any warnings, errors,

00:16:48.486 --> 00:16:49.766
and changes regarding my

00:16:49.886 --> 00:16:50.366
strings.

00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:52.616
So here, it's just warning me I

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:54.116
didn't get any translations for

00:16:54.116 --> 00:16:55.606
my infoplist.strings.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:56.706
But that's okay.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:57.696
I didn't ask for those

00:16:57.696 --> 00:16:59.066
translations, so I'm just going

00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.166
to ignore this warning.

00:17:00.706 --> 00:17:02.746
I can also check on what's

00:17:02.746 --> 00:17:03.156
changing.

00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:04.096
So here if we look at the

00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:05.406
storyboard, we can see I'm

00:17:05.406 --> 00:17:07.496
getting real French translations

00:17:07.915 --> 00:17:09.616
to replace those copies of the

00:17:09.616 --> 00:17:10.726
English in the strings.

00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:13.306
So I'm just going to click

00:17:13.306 --> 00:17:13.726
Import.

00:17:15.296 --> 00:17:16.786
And just like that, all of the

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.746
translations for my strings and

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.616
non-strings resources are in the

00:17:20.616 --> 00:17:21.976
right place in my project.

00:17:22.516 --> 00:17:28.726
[ Applause ]

00:17:29.226 --> 00:17:30.436
Alright, so let's double check

00:17:30.436 --> 00:17:30.836
on that.

00:17:31.616 --> 00:17:32.736
I'll just do spot check of a

00:17:32.736 --> 00:17:33.696
couple files.

00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:35.866
Okay, main.strings.

00:17:35.906 --> 00:17:37.256
That looks like French to me.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:38.356
I don't actually speak it.

00:17:39.456 --> 00:17:40.866
Let's check the image.

00:17:41.076 --> 00:17:42.776
Yes, that's also in French.

00:17:42.776 --> 00:17:44.966
Okay, so let's run through the

00:17:44.966 --> 00:17:47.216
app one more time in French and

00:17:47.216 --> 00:17:48.896
make sure everything looks good.

00:17:49.346 --> 00:17:51.496
So to do that, I'm going to

00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:53.996
select my Active Scheme, choose

00:17:53.996 --> 00:17:54.826
Edit Scheme.

00:17:56.046 --> 00:17:58.636
Set the application language to

00:17:58.636 --> 00:18:00.696
French and the application

00:18:00.696 --> 00:18:02.106
region to France.

00:18:02.756 --> 00:18:04.506
Now I'm ready to run.

00:18:05.516 --> 00:18:06.836
We're going to stop the English

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:07.646
from running.

00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:11.216
Okay? So in just a moment here,

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.796
we should get our app entirely

00:18:12.796 --> 00:18:13.456
in French.

00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:16.566
Okay, looks good so far.

00:18:16.566 --> 00:18:17.316
I'm just going to go through

00:18:17.316 --> 00:18:18.376
really fast so I can go check on

00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:19.126
that Book button.

00:18:20.156 --> 00:18:21.796
Alright, Browse, let's go to

00:18:21.796 --> 00:18:22.636
Mars again.

00:18:22.986 --> 00:18:24.166
I really like Gale Creator.

00:18:24.746 --> 00:18:25.626
Okay, great.

00:18:26.056 --> 00:18:27.426
That Book button was translated

00:18:27.426 --> 00:18:27.866
correctly.

00:18:27.866 --> 00:18:28.996
It was probably really helpful

00:18:28.996 --> 00:18:30.746
that I included screenshot of

00:18:30.746 --> 00:18:31.306
this part.

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.886
If we check on the dates here,

00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:36.396
alright, I did not have to send

00:18:36.396 --> 00:18:37.806
a list of months to my

00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:38.616
translators.

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:40.976
Instead, I used this nice date

00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:42.426
picker that in turn uses a

00:18:42.506 --> 00:18:43.986
formatter and I got these

00:18:43.986 --> 00:18:45.436
localizations for free.

00:18:46.816 --> 00:18:48.376
And likewise, by using a

00:18:48.376 --> 00:18:50.236
formatter for the price, I got

00:18:50.266 --> 00:18:51.596
the correct number formatting

00:18:51.706 --> 00:18:53.116
and the price given in Euros.

00:18:54.436 --> 00:18:56.676
Alright, so that was super easy

00:18:56.876 --> 00:18:58.886
to get my strings and non-string

00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:01.466
resources all in French as

00:19:01.466 --> 00:19:02.806
easily as I would've done with

00:19:02.806 --> 00:19:04.406
just the string resources in

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:05.246
Xcode 9.

00:19:05.576 --> 00:19:07.126
So with that, let's go back to

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:08.876
the slides and wrap up our

00:19:08.876 --> 00:19:11.366
discussion of Xcode Localization

00:19:11.366 --> 00:19:11.836
Catalog.

00:19:12.516 --> 00:19:19.266
[ Applause ]

00:19:19.766 --> 00:19:21.906
Alright, so we have introduced

00:19:21.906 --> 00:19:23.686
the Xcode Localization Catalog

00:19:23.686 --> 00:19:26.346
as Xcode's new standard for

00:19:26.346 --> 00:19:28.746
localization export and import.

00:19:29.856 --> 00:19:31.286
It provides more flexibility for

00:19:31.286 --> 00:19:33.146
your translators and allows you

00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:34.676
to conveniently provide more

00:19:34.676 --> 00:19:37.036
visual and functional context to

00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:38.326
better help them generate

00:19:38.326 --> 00:19:40.346
high-quality translations the

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:41.316
first time.

00:19:41.876 --> 00:19:44.366
It has increased file type

00:19:44.406 --> 00:19:45.926
support, so you can export and

00:19:45.926 --> 00:19:47.876
import your non-string resources

00:19:48.206 --> 00:19:49.696
as easily as you've been doing

00:19:49.696 --> 00:19:50.566
with your string based

00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:51.216
resources.

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:54.766
We've also updated Xcode build

00:19:54.886 --> 00:19:56.796
to use the Xcode Localization

00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:57.986
Catalog for continuous

00:19:57.986 --> 00:19:59.076
integration support.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.176
And if you have content out for

00:20:02.176 --> 00:20:04.256
localization right now, don't

00:20:04.256 --> 00:20:05.736
worry, you can still import

00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:07.026
those XLIFFs when they come back

00:20:07.026 --> 00:20:09.556
to you both Xcode and Xcode

00:20:09.556 --> 00:20:11.256
Build are backwards compatible.

00:20:12.496 --> 00:20:14.606
Alright, so with that, I'm going

00:20:14.606 --> 00:20:16.556
to hand it over to Chris to talk

00:20:16.556 --> 00:20:18.756
to you about localizing intent

00:20:18.756 --> 00:20:20.056
definition files for the

00:20:20.056 --> 00:20:21.616
creation of Siri Shortcuts.

00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:27.796
[ Applause ]

00:20:28.296 --> 00:20:29.186
>> Thank you, Vivian.

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:30.796
Wow, that's really awesome.

00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:32.306
I'm really looking forward to

00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:33.146
that trip to Mars.

00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:36.526
So I'm going to be showing you

00:20:36.726 --> 00:20:38.656
how to localize Siri Shortcuts

00:20:38.746 --> 00:20:40.476
by localizing your intent

00:20:40.476 --> 00:20:41.306
definitions.

00:20:41.766 --> 00:20:44.886
And your intent definitions are

00:20:44.886 --> 00:20:46.546
created in intent definition

00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:47.996
files in Xcode.

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:50.146
And these are what you use to

00:20:50.146 --> 00:20:51.876
define your custom intents for

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:52.886
Siri Shortcuts.

00:20:53.516 --> 00:20:54.916
They're just files with an

00:20:54.916 --> 00:20:57.166
intent definition extension that

00:20:57.166 --> 00:20:59.406
have a custom editor in Xcode.

00:21:00.186 --> 00:21:02.626
And we've designed them to take

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:04.796
advantage of base localization

00:21:05.386 --> 00:21:07.036
so when you go to translate your

00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.816
intents, you don't have a bunch

00:21:08.816 --> 00:21:10.256
of different intent definition

00:21:10.256 --> 00:21:13.096
files, one per language, you

00:21:13.096 --> 00:21:15.226
just use strings files to

00:21:15.226 --> 00:21:17.376
localize the strings that are in

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:18.486
your intent definitions.

00:21:19.396 --> 00:21:22.626
And, of course, we also support

00:21:22.786 --> 00:21:25.876
stringsdict files for a variety

00:21:25.876 --> 00:21:28.236
of cases like pluralization

00:21:28.236 --> 00:21:29.796
rules and variable-width

00:21:29.796 --> 00:21:30.446
strings.

00:21:31.936 --> 00:21:33.636
And if you haven't yet, I

00:21:33.746 --> 00:21:35.176
strongly encourage you to check

00:21:35.176 --> 00:21:36.776
out the Introduction to Siri

00:21:36.776 --> 00:21:38.606
Shortcuts Session that happened

00:21:38.606 --> 00:21:39.766
yesterday and that's available

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:40.336
for streaming.

00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:43.916
Now let's take a quick walk

00:21:44.226 --> 00:21:45.716
through the Intent Definition

00:21:45.816 --> 00:21:46.256
Editor.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:47.986
Here we have an intent

00:21:47.986 --> 00:21:49.396
definition for our Vacation

00:21:49.456 --> 00:21:53.286
Planet application and we have

00:21:53.286 --> 00:21:54.736
an intent for booking a

00:21:54.736 --> 00:21:55.376
vacation.

00:21:56.336 --> 00:21:57.496
Of course, one of the things

00:21:57.496 --> 00:21:58.726
that you'll want to localize in

00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:01.056
your intent is the title and the

00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:02.276
description of the intent

00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:02.886
itself.

00:22:03.206 --> 00:22:05.836
But most of what you're going to

00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:07.656
be localizing for your intent

00:22:07.656 --> 00:22:09.756
definition are the shortcut

00:22:09.856 --> 00:22:13.036
types that are composed together

00:22:13.346 --> 00:22:15.346
from the intents parameters.

00:22:15.866 --> 00:22:18.816
And of course, when an intent is

00:22:18.816 --> 00:22:20.836
invoked, it produces a response

00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:22.846
as well and these can also be

00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:25.676
customized with Response

00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:27.576
Templates and these Response

00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:29.266
Templates are localized in

00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:31.076
exactly the same way as your

00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:33.836
shortcut types.

00:22:33.936 --> 00:22:35.436
Now let's take a deeper look at

00:22:35.436 --> 00:22:37.116
the actual structure of an

00:22:37.116 --> 00:22:38.816
intent and what's localizable

00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:39.196
within it.

00:22:40.376 --> 00:22:42.426
An intent is really a collection

00:22:42.426 --> 00:22:43.776
of parameters that have a

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:45.136
variety of types.

00:22:45.696 --> 00:22:46.866
So they can have types like

00:22:47.106 --> 00:22:49.486
integer or string and you saw

00:22:49.486 --> 00:22:50.776
yesterday that they also support

00:22:50.776 --> 00:22:53.916
custom objects and they support

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:55.776
enumerations that are defined

00:22:55.776 --> 00:22:57.776
right in your intent definition.

00:22:58.256 --> 00:23:02.036
And these parameters are

00:23:02.036 --> 00:23:04.706
combined together into different

00:23:04.706 --> 00:23:07.486
shortcut types that have a nice

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:09.016
human readable title.

00:23:09.586 --> 00:23:13.816
And of course, responses are

00:23:13.816 --> 00:23:15.506
also collections of properties

00:23:15.746 --> 00:23:17.846
that have well understood types

00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:20.976
again like string or integer and

00:23:21.226 --> 00:23:23.786
can also have types from your

00:23:23.786 --> 00:23:24.636
enumerations.

00:23:25.226 --> 00:23:27.456
And when you go to localize your

00:23:27.456 --> 00:23:29.156
intent definition, the things

00:23:29.156 --> 00:23:29.806
that you're going to be

00:23:29.806 --> 00:23:31.826
localizing the most are your

00:23:31.826 --> 00:23:34.066
shortcut types and your response

00:23:34.166 --> 00:23:34.666
templates.

00:23:35.026 --> 00:23:36.516
And for the most part, what

00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:37.756
we're going to talk about today

00:23:37.886 --> 00:23:39.276
is how to localize your shortcut

00:23:39.276 --> 00:23:42.096
types because you localize your

00:23:42.096 --> 00:23:43.786
response templates in exactly

00:23:43.786 --> 00:23:44.606
the same way.

00:23:45.196 --> 00:23:48.066
So here's an example from our

00:23:48.066 --> 00:23:50.036
Vacation Planet app.

00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:52.036
This is the shortcut type for

00:23:52.036 --> 00:23:56.296
booking a trip and that type of

00:23:56.296 --> 00:23:57.946
trip there is actually a

00:23:57.986 --> 00:23:59.546
placeholder for one of our

00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:00.316
enumerations.

00:24:00.846 --> 00:24:03.096
This enumeration lets you book a

00:24:03.186 --> 00:24:04.776
flight or it lets you book a

00:24:04.816 --> 00:24:06.396
cruise, or it lets you book a

00:24:06.396 --> 00:24:07.486
vacation package.

00:24:07.816 --> 00:24:10.216
And when Xcode goes to localize

00:24:10.486 --> 00:24:12.336
your intent definition file,

00:24:12.466 --> 00:24:13.646
when you press that localize

00:24:13.646 --> 00:24:14.876
button that Vivian showed you,

00:24:15.776 --> 00:24:18.116
what's going to happen is Xcode

00:24:18.606 --> 00:24:22.046
will produce one each of its

00:24:22.046 --> 00:24:25.136
strings for the members of that

00:24:25.136 --> 00:24:25.886
enumeration.

00:24:26.356 --> 00:24:30.066
And that happens to work because

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:31.926
of the particular words we

00:24:31.926 --> 00:24:32.706
chose.

00:24:34.336 --> 00:24:36.786
Because our template says "Book

00:24:36.786 --> 00:24:38.676
a flight" and uses that

00:24:38.676 --> 00:24:41.316
indefinite article, we can or

00:24:41.686 --> 00:24:44.106
"Book a type" and uses that

00:24:44.106 --> 00:24:46.106
indefinite article, we can book

00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:47.986
a flight, book a cruise, or book

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.606
a vacation package because they

00:24:49.646 --> 00:24:51.326
all start with consonants

00:24:51.526 --> 00:24:52.676
because that's the rule in

00:24:52.676 --> 00:24:53.186
English.

00:24:53.696 --> 00:24:55.966
But what happens if I add a new

00:24:56.286 --> 00:24:57.946
value to my enumeration to

00:24:57.946 --> 00:24:59.496
represent booking an expedition,

00:24:59.496 --> 00:24:59.966
say to Mars?

00:25:02.316 --> 00:25:05.136
Well, Xcode is just going to

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:06.656
generate in its strings file

00:25:07.786 --> 00:25:10.996
"Book a expedition" which isn't

00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:12.546
really very grammatical.

00:25:13.516 --> 00:25:14.746
Fortunately, though, these

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:16.266
strings files are keyed by

00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:19.956
well-defined IDs and stable IDs

00:25:20.346 --> 00:25:21.926
so you can just go into the

00:25:21.926 --> 00:25:24.996
strings file and change it so

00:25:24.996 --> 00:25:26.466
that it's properly grammatical.

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.586
Now English isn't the only

00:25:29.586 --> 00:25:31.416
language that has this kind of

00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:32.476
grammatical agreement.

00:25:33.116 --> 00:25:34.396
Different languages, of course,

00:25:34.476 --> 00:25:35.596
have different grammatical

00:25:35.596 --> 00:25:36.036
agreement.

00:25:36.276 --> 00:25:37.686
So you'll need to do the same

00:25:37.686 --> 00:25:39.776
kind of thing say in French,

00:25:40.176 --> 00:25:41.626
where you'll need to make the

00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:44.006
gender of the article agree with

00:25:44.006 --> 00:25:45.846
the gender of the noun that it's

00:25:45.846 --> 00:25:48.046
referring to.

00:25:48.336 --> 00:25:50.486
Now let's take a quick look at a

00:25:50.486 --> 00:25:51.856
more complex example.

00:25:52.716 --> 00:25:55.816
Here we have a shortcut type for

00:25:55.816 --> 00:25:57.736
booking a vacation for some

00:25:57.736 --> 00:26:00.106
number of people and once again,

00:26:00.246 --> 00:26:01.526
when generating that strings

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:03.706
file, Xcode, well, it's going to

00:26:03.706 --> 00:26:05.546
combine together the template

00:26:06.246 --> 00:26:08.106
with the values from the

00:26:08.106 --> 00:26:08.866
enumeration.

00:26:09.326 --> 00:26:10.876
However, it's not going to

00:26:10.876 --> 00:26:13.056
generate one string for every

00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:15.016
possible integer as well.

00:26:16.256 --> 00:26:18.716
Instead, it's going to leave the

00:26:18.716 --> 00:26:20.066
strings that it generates with a

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:21.756
placeholder in them that the

00:26:21.756 --> 00:26:24.496
shortcut system will replace at

00:26:24.496 --> 00:26:24.866
runtime.

00:26:25.186 --> 00:26:29.446
And once again, this looks like

00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:30.376
it should be reasonable.

00:26:30.456 --> 00:26:32.986
Right? it says, you know, book a

00:26:32.986 --> 00:26:35.536
vacation or book a flight for

00:26:35.656 --> 00:26:36.566
some number of people.

00:26:37.066 --> 00:26:41.076
And in our strings file, we get

00:26:41.076 --> 00:26:42.716
that generated ID and that

00:26:42.716 --> 00:26:44.226
string that says, oh, book a

00:26:44.226 --> 00:26:46.376
cruise for some number of people

00:26:46.606 --> 00:26:48.666
with that placeholder still in

00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:51.526
there; however, when I go to

00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:53.796
book a cruise for just myself to

00:26:53.796 --> 00:26:57.386
celebrate a great WWDC, what's

00:26:57.386 --> 00:26:59.206
going to be shown as an actual

00:26:59.206 --> 00:27:01.666
shortcut is the string "Book a

00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:04.696
cruise for 1 people" which isn't

00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:05.796
grammatical English.

00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:08.936
However, these support

00:27:09.046 --> 00:27:11.796
stringsdict files as well so you

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:14.116
can do all of the pluralization

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:16.746
that you need and have the

00:27:16.856 --> 00:27:18.766
system take care of it for you.

00:27:20.426 --> 00:27:23.076
Here in the stringsdict file, we

00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:26.706
have the dictionary itself keyed

00:27:26.706 --> 00:27:29.156
by that string that I showed you

00:27:29.336 --> 00:27:31.196
from the strings file.

00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:33.506
You can either use that or you

00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:37.196
can use the ID as the key.

00:27:37.196 --> 00:27:40.676
And then we've produced another

00:27:40.676 --> 00:27:42.576
string that is what is actually

00:27:42.576 --> 00:27:44.236
going to be shown in the user

00:27:44.236 --> 00:27:44.906
interface.

00:27:46.376 --> 00:27:48.366
And here, we're referring to

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.656
another variable which can then

00:27:50.656 --> 00:27:52.816
be substituted for either the

00:27:52.816 --> 00:27:55.976
one or other cases based on

00:27:56.046 --> 00:27:57.956
English's pluralization rules.

00:27:58.466 --> 00:28:02.156
And to learn more about

00:28:02.156 --> 00:28:04.276
stringsdict files, you should

00:28:04.276 --> 00:28:05.826
see our session from last year

00:28:05.826 --> 00:28:08.076
Localizing with Xcode 9 that's

00:28:08.076 --> 00:28:09.876
available in the WWDC

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:10.566
application.

00:28:12.936 --> 00:28:15.096
Here, if I go to book my cruise

00:28:15.096 --> 00:28:17.536
now, this operating system will

00:28:17.536 --> 00:28:19.646
say, oh, I'm booking for one

00:28:19.646 --> 00:28:22.026
person, so let's use the case

00:28:22.496 --> 00:28:24.866
for one and I get a properly

00:28:24.866 --> 00:28:25.936
grammatical phrase.

00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:28.946
And similarly, if I want to book

00:28:28.946 --> 00:28:30.836
a cruise for all of us, you

00:28:31.186 --> 00:28:33.186
know, after all I'm not the only

00:28:33.186 --> 00:28:37.506
one up here, the system will say

00:28:37.626 --> 00:28:39.646
"Book a cruise for 3 people."

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:45.676
Now let's talk about intents

00:28:45.676 --> 00:28:47.366
that are created in code.

00:28:48.446 --> 00:28:49.826
If you're creating an intent in

00:28:49.826 --> 00:28:52.106
code to donate it to the system,

00:28:52.806 --> 00:28:55.216
that isn't necessarily the point

00:28:55.216 --> 00:28:57.116
at which a shortcut will be

00:28:57.116 --> 00:28:57.786
displayed.

00:28:58.076 --> 00:29:00.136
That can be displayed far off at

00:29:00.206 --> 00:29:01.576
some point in the future based

00:29:01.576 --> 00:29:02.776
on the user's actions.

00:29:04.246 --> 00:29:07.106
So we have a new API that

00:29:07.106 --> 00:29:09.316
creates a deferred localizable

00:29:09.316 --> 00:29:12.516
string that will be localized at

00:29:12.516 --> 00:29:13.946
the point where the string is

00:29:13.946 --> 00:29:15.306
presented to the user.

00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:19.376
And this is necessary because

00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:21.226
donating an intent to the system

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.136
is really telling the system,

00:29:23.216 --> 00:29:25.026
hey, the user performed some

00:29:25.026 --> 00:29:27.696
action in my application that

00:29:27.696 --> 00:29:29.886
you might want to offer them

00:29:29.886 --> 00:29:31.896
again at some other point.

00:29:33.026 --> 00:29:35.506
And, fortunately, this API is

00:29:35.506 --> 00:29:37.346
extremely simple to use.

00:29:37.746 --> 00:29:39.976
It's just one call added to NS

00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:42.396
String that you can use to wrap

00:29:42.436 --> 00:29:43.776
the string that you're going to

00:29:43.776 --> 00:29:45.856
assign to that intent you

00:29:45.856 --> 00:29:49.366
created in code.

00:29:50.056 --> 00:29:52.786
So let's talk quickly about what

00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:53.376
we've seen.

00:29:54.146 --> 00:29:56.216
We've seen that Xcode combines

00:29:56.216 --> 00:29:58.076
your shortcut types with the

00:29:58.246 --> 00:30:00.126
enumerations that you've defined

00:30:00.126 --> 00:30:01.556
in your intent definition when

00:30:01.556 --> 00:30:02.856
it's generating the strings

00:30:02.856 --> 00:30:02.976
files.

00:30:03.146 --> 00:30:08.106
And you can use both strings and

00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:10.356
stringsdict files to localize

00:30:10.356 --> 00:30:11.106
your shortcuts.

00:30:11.586 --> 00:30:14.796
And if you're creating an intent

00:30:14.886 --> 00:30:16.836
in code to donate it to the

00:30:16.916 --> 00:30:18.716
system, to inform the system of

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:19.986
a user action that might be

00:30:19.986 --> 00:30:23.066
repeated, you can use deferred

00:30:23.066 --> 00:30:26.616
Localized Intents String to wrap

00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:28.236
that string in such a way that

00:30:28.236 --> 00:30:29.476
it'll be localized when it's

00:30:29.476 --> 00:30:31.526
presented to the user, not at

00:30:31.526 --> 00:30:32.826
the point where it's created in

00:30:32.826 --> 00:30:33.626
your application.

00:30:33.626 --> 00:30:35.416
So if the user changes their

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.546
phone's language in between when

00:30:37.546 --> 00:30:39.196
you've donated that intent, and

00:30:39.196 --> 00:30:40.996
when a shortcut is displayed, it

00:30:41.146 --> 00:30:43.416
still follows the user's phone

00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:43.976
language.

00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:49.566
Now when you define strings in a

00:30:49.616 --> 00:30:51.566
stringsdict file, they are

00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:53.146
actually going to be preferred

00:30:53.146 --> 00:30:53.876
at runtime.

00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:56.046
That means you can do the

00:30:56.046 --> 00:30:58.266
majority of your localization in

00:30:58.266 --> 00:31:00.246
your strings files for all of

00:31:00.246 --> 00:31:01.636
the cases where you don't need

00:31:01.636 --> 00:31:04.506
things like plural agreement and

00:31:04.506 --> 00:31:06.416
then you can just provide a

00:31:06.466 --> 00:31:08.336
strings file or a stringsdict

00:31:08.336 --> 00:31:10.666
file with the same name as your

00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:12.876
intent definition as an

00:31:12.986 --> 00:31:13.656
override.

00:31:14.276 --> 00:31:16.996
And when you create that

00:31:16.996 --> 00:31:18.956
stringsdict file, you can use

00:31:19.316 --> 00:31:21.966
either the strings themselves or

00:31:21.966 --> 00:31:23.836
the strings IDs that Xcode

00:31:23.836 --> 00:31:26.296
assigns as keys in your strings

00:31:26.296 --> 00:31:29.276
file as the Localized String Key

00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:30.936
and string somewhat measure of

00:31:31.036 --> 00:31:32.456
stability in case you actually

00:31:32.456 --> 00:31:34.556
decide to change things in your

00:31:34.556 --> 00:31:35.536
intent definition.

00:31:36.056 --> 00:31:39.926
So now, I'd like to bring Vivian

00:31:39.926 --> 00:31:41.896
back up to show you exactly how

00:31:41.896 --> 00:31:43.126
to do this, how this whole

00:31:43.126 --> 00:31:44.976
process works in Xcode.

00:31:45.516 --> 00:31:50.846
[ Applause ]

00:31:51.346 --> 00:31:51.966
>> Thanks, Chris.

00:32:02.956 --> 00:32:05.656
Alright, so once you go to Mars

00:32:05.656 --> 00:32:06.936
once, you're probably going to

00:32:06.936 --> 00:32:08.656
want to go again and again and

00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:10.506
again because those trips are

00:32:10.506 --> 00:32:11.636
really cheap, as we saw.

00:32:12.716 --> 00:32:14.036
And it would be nice if our app

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:16.086
could suggest additional trips

00:32:16.206 --> 00:32:18.486
to these frequent fliers and

00:32:18.486 --> 00:32:19.736
give them a shortcut to book the

00:32:19.736 --> 00:32:20.596
next vacation.

00:32:20.846 --> 00:32:22.706
So with that in mind, I've added

00:32:22.706 --> 00:32:24.526
an intent definition to our

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:25.036
project.

00:32:25.146 --> 00:32:28.606
Let's go look at it.

00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:30.136
Okay, here's our intent

00:32:30.136 --> 00:32:30.756
definition.

00:32:31.456 --> 00:32:33.136
So we have a custom intent

00:32:33.246 --> 00:32:35.946
called "Book Item," has a title,

00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:40.026
a description, and down here is

00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:41.566
the actual suggestion.

00:32:42.106 --> 00:32:45.386
So it is book a type for

00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:46.756
travelers, people.

00:32:46.806 --> 00:32:47.736
Like Chris said, it's a

00:32:47.736 --> 00:32:49.436
combination of parameters.

00:32:50.516 --> 00:32:52.836
So we can see travelers is an

00:32:52.836 --> 00:32:57.406
integer and type is defined in

00:32:57.406 --> 00:32:59.026
this enum here, so we can see it

00:32:59.026 --> 00:33:01.376
can be a flight, a cruise, a

00:33:01.376 --> 00:33:03.146
vacation package, or an

00:33:03.146 --> 00:33:03.956
expedition.

00:33:05.136 --> 00:33:06.776
Now if our user follows through

00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:08.186
with a suggestion and books

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:09.636
another trip, we need to give

00:33:09.636 --> 00:33:10.916
them some kind of feedback.

00:33:11.446 --> 00:33:13.196
So for that we have a response

00:33:13.376 --> 00:33:15.226
and there's just a success or a

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:17.226
failure message as to whether we

00:33:17.226 --> 00:33:18.616
could book their trip.

00:33:19.196 --> 00:33:20.446
And this is likewise a

00:33:20.446 --> 00:33:22.156
combination of parameters.

00:33:22.726 --> 00:33:25.276
Now, of course, since we have

00:33:25.276 --> 00:33:27.226
user facing strings, we need to

00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:28.036
localize them.

00:33:28.316 --> 00:33:28.956
So let's do that.

00:33:29.686 --> 00:33:31.786
Just like I did for the image, I

00:33:31.786 --> 00:33:33.756
just go to the right here, click

00:33:33.756 --> 00:33:34.316
Localize.

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:36.986
Now intent definition files are

00:33:36.986 --> 00:33:38.126
going to be like interface

00:33:38.196 --> 00:33:39.796
builder files where we have one

00:33:39.796 --> 00:33:41.766
intent definition and all of our

00:33:41.766 --> 00:33:43.686
translations in strings files.

00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.456
So I want to put it in base.

00:33:46.626 --> 00:33:47.576
Click Localize.

00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:50.746
Okay. And I want to check

00:33:51.216 --> 00:33:51.676
French.

00:33:52.766 --> 00:33:54.476
Okay, so at this point, Xcode

00:33:54.476 --> 00:33:56.846
has created a strings file for

00:33:56.846 --> 00:33:58.416
the French translations to be

00:33:58.416 --> 00:33:58.916
put in.

00:34:00.106 --> 00:34:01.086
And here we go.

00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:03.496
Alright, and you can see as I

00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:06.426
scroll through, it has every

00:34:06.426 --> 00:34:08.516
possible string given the

00:34:08.516 --> 00:34:09.916
possible values for the

00:34:09.916 --> 00:34:12.156
parameters defined in enums.

00:34:13.045 --> 00:34:14.556
This is great because, again, I

00:34:14.556 --> 00:34:16.456
don't speak French but I know

00:34:16.456 --> 00:34:18.386
from the slides that flight and

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:19.416
cruise have different

00:34:19.416 --> 00:34:20.735
grammatical gender, they're

00:34:20.735 --> 00:34:22.045
going to need different forms of

00:34:22.045 --> 00:34:25.096
the word for "a."

00:34:25.356 --> 00:34:27.306
Alright, but there's still some

00:34:27.306 --> 00:34:29.686
grammar problems I can fix and

00:34:29.686 --> 00:34:30.916
those are the ones in English,

00:34:31.176 --> 00:34:34.926
the case of one person and an

00:34:35.266 --> 00:34:36.106
expedition.

00:34:36.585 --> 00:34:38.436
So to do that, I need, or at

00:34:38.436 --> 00:34:40.275
least to fix the plural case,

00:34:40.676 --> 00:34:41.946
I'm going to add a stringsdict

00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:44.146
file with the same name as my

00:34:44.146 --> 00:34:45.216
intent definition.

00:34:46.406 --> 00:34:47.656
So just go over here to my

00:34:47.656 --> 00:34:48.186
project.

00:34:48.676 --> 00:34:49.936
Create new file.

00:34:51.146 --> 00:34:52.366
And I'm going to use the

00:34:52.366 --> 00:34:53.896
stringsdict template that was

00:34:54.045 --> 00:34:55.116
added in Xcode 9.

00:34:56.696 --> 00:34:57.406
Click Next.

00:34:58.516 --> 00:34:59.536
Alright, here's the important

00:34:59.536 --> 00:34:59.746
part.

00:34:59.746 --> 00:35:00.576
I need to make sure I get the

00:35:00.576 --> 00:35:01.776
name exactly right.

00:35:03.096 --> 00:35:04.196
Intents. Okay.

00:35:06.676 --> 00:35:11.386
Create. Now I don't need to go

00:35:11.386 --> 00:35:13.116
into my French strings file to

00:35:13.186 --> 00:35:15.186
find the ID for my intent.

00:35:15.946 --> 00:35:17.876
I can actually go into the

00:35:17.876 --> 00:35:19.776
intent definition file because

00:35:19.776 --> 00:35:21.186
these are required to be unique.

00:35:21.906 --> 00:35:23.956
I can actually copy directly

00:35:24.026 --> 00:35:29.076
from here, alright, copy, and go

00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:33.966
my stringsdict, and paste.

00:35:35.286 --> 00:35:39.306
Alright, you can see here Xcode

00:35:39.306 --> 00:35:40.346
actually formatted the

00:35:40.346 --> 00:35:42.896
parameters for me when I pasted

00:35:42.896 --> 00:35:44.316
so that this is already ready

00:35:44.616 --> 00:35:45.906
for Siri Shortcuts.

00:35:46.766 --> 00:35:48.496
Okay, so at this point, I'm

00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:49.966
ready to fill in the rest of my

00:35:49.966 --> 00:35:50.906
plural dictionary.

00:35:50.906 --> 00:35:52.566
I'm only going to need one and

00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:53.956
other because I'm doing English.

00:35:53.956 --> 00:35:55.226
So I have singular and plural.

00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:57.796
But like any good cooking show,

00:35:57.796 --> 00:35:59.106
I have the finished file ready.

00:35:59.206 --> 00:36:00.386
So I'm going to swap that in.

00:36:00.886 --> 00:36:04.046
Alright, say goodbye to this

00:36:04.046 --> 00:36:04.446
guy.

00:36:04.446 --> 00:36:08.396
And let's go find the finished

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:08.726
one.

00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:18.006
There we go.

00:36:18.526 --> 00:36:21.586
Yes, Xcode, I want to make a

00:36:21.586 --> 00:36:22.096
copy.

00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:23.716
There we go.

00:36:24.316 --> 00:36:25.866
Alright, let's look at it.

00:36:28.376 --> 00:36:30.496
So we're going to look at a case

00:36:30.496 --> 00:36:31.836
where I fixed two problems at

00:36:31.836 --> 00:36:32.166
once.

00:36:33.816 --> 00:36:35.906
So if we check Book Expedition,

00:36:36.646 --> 00:36:38.266
the string here is "Book a

00:36:38.266 --> 00:36:42.016
expedition" but then in the

00:36:42.016 --> 00:36:43.006
plural dictionary, I have the

00:36:43.006 --> 00:36:46.056
case of one person or any other

00:36:46.056 --> 00:36:47.256
number of people.

00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:50.166
What I also did here was fix

00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:52.406
that a/an situation so the

00:36:52.406 --> 00:36:53.596
string is actually displayed

00:36:53.596 --> 00:36:54.556
we'll use an.

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:58.486
Okay. So I have the finished

00:36:58.486 --> 00:36:59.656
version of the app running on my

00:36:59.656 --> 00:36:59.746
phone.

00:36:59.806 --> 00:37:00.816
So let's run through it and

00:37:00.816 --> 00:37:01.686
check the shortcut that's

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:01.976
created.

00:37:06.576 --> 00:37:08.466
Alright, I'm just going to go to

00:37:08.466 --> 00:37:09.686
the same place as before.

00:37:09.686 --> 00:37:10.856
I really like Gale Creator.

00:37:11.726 --> 00:37:14.386
Okay, Browse, Mars, Gale

00:37:14.386 --> 00:37:17.186
Creator, and let's not go for a

00:37:17.186 --> 00:37:17.386
day.

00:37:17.386 --> 00:37:20.716
We'll go -- Sure, that'll work.

00:37:21.136 --> 00:37:22.286
Okay, this time I'm going to go

00:37:22.286 --> 00:37:23.466
by myself because I want to

00:37:23.466 --> 00:37:24.396
check the one case.

00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:28.216
There. When I tap Book, that

00:37:28.216 --> 00:37:30.326
actually created the shortcut

00:37:30.326 --> 00:37:30.986
and donated it.

00:37:31.406 --> 00:37:32.796
So now we can go look at it.

00:37:33.236 --> 00:37:35.756
you can find these under

00:37:35.896 --> 00:37:39.126
Settings, Siri & Search.

00:37:39.516 --> 00:37:42.066
There. Book an expedition for

00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:43.396
one person.

00:37:45.516 --> 00:37:50.986
[ Applause ]

00:37:51.486 --> 00:37:53.226
Alright, so this is great for

00:37:53.226 --> 00:37:53.636
English.

00:37:53.636 --> 00:37:54.156
I fixed it.

00:37:54.256 --> 00:37:55.236
but I'm still going to need to

00:37:55.236 --> 00:37:57.066
localize this into French.

00:37:57.176 --> 00:37:58.646
And the great thing is, it's

00:37:58.756 --> 00:38:00.296
just as easy as the first demo.

00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:02.606
So we can go back to Xcode.

00:38:03.646 --> 00:38:05.756
Alright. I'm going to make sure

00:38:05.756 --> 00:38:07.196
I localize my stringsdict

00:38:07.196 --> 00:38:08.316
because I didn't do that yet.

00:38:08.506 --> 00:38:09.476
English, yes.

00:38:10.136 --> 00:38:11.066
Check French.

00:38:11.596 --> 00:38:12.866
Otherwise, it won't be exported.

00:38:14.046 --> 00:38:15.846
Okay, so now I just select my

00:38:15.846 --> 00:38:16.726
project again.

00:38:17.716 --> 00:38:18.486
Go to Editor.

00:38:19.266 --> 00:38:20.776
Export for Localization.

00:38:21.616 --> 00:38:22.906
I'm going to call this vacation

00:38:22.906 --> 00:38:25.046
plan loc2 since it's the second

00:38:25.046 --> 00:38:26.386
round of localization.

00:38:27.506 --> 00:38:28.896
Double check, yes, I'm doing

00:38:28.896 --> 00:38:29.596
French again.

00:38:30.276 --> 00:38:30.966
Click Save.

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.566
And now Xcode creates another

00:38:33.566 --> 00:38:35.076
Xcode Localization Catalog.

00:38:35.076 --> 00:38:37.766
So if we go look at it,

00:38:42.556 --> 00:38:44.486
okay, let's check localized

00:38:44.586 --> 00:38:45.176
contents.

00:38:45.246 --> 00:38:47.776
If we look at the XLIFF, you can

00:38:47.776 --> 00:38:50.126
see here highlighted in red are

00:38:50.126 --> 00:38:51.626
all the new strings from the

00:38:51.626 --> 00:38:54.576
intent definition but we also

00:38:54.636 --> 00:38:56.066
have all the translations I

00:38:56.066 --> 00:38:57.326
imported the first time.

00:38:57.516 --> 00:38:59.116
So you can have an incremental

00:38:59.116 --> 00:39:00.566
localization process where you

00:39:00.566 --> 00:39:02.186
develop your apps sum, you get

00:39:02.186 --> 00:39:03.546
that version localized, you make

00:39:03.606 --> 00:39:05.796
some tweaks for version two, and

00:39:05.796 --> 00:39:07.136
you don't lose anything when you

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:09.386
export for another round of

00:39:09.386 --> 00:39:10.176
localization.

00:39:10.706 --> 00:39:13.466
And this works for the

00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:15.066
non-string resources as well.

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:16.926
So this will have the French

00:39:16.926 --> 00:39:18.536
version of my image.

00:39:19.896 --> 00:39:21.936
Great. So I can develop my app,

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:24.236
keep localizing, keep working

00:39:24.296 --> 00:39:26.236
and it's all just as easy as the

00:39:26.236 --> 00:39:29.056
first time and it covers both my

00:39:29.056 --> 00:39:30.426
strings and my non-string

00:39:30.426 --> 00:39:31.876
resources and my intent

00:39:31.876 --> 00:39:33.366
definitions so that I can

00:39:33.426 --> 00:39:34.786
suggest additional trips to

00:39:34.786 --> 00:39:35.176
Mars.

00:39:36.076 --> 00:39:37.736
Alright, so with that, I'm going

00:39:37.736 --> 00:39:38.806
to turn it back over to Chris

00:39:38.806 --> 00:39:40.976
for the last time to summarize.

00:39:41.516 --> 00:39:46.500
[ Applause ]

00:39:50.476 --> 00:39:52.136
>> Thank you again, Vivian.

00:39:53.146 --> 00:39:54.066
Wow, that's really great.

00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:55.716
I'm really looking forward to

00:39:55.716 --> 00:39:56.316
those trips now.

00:39:58.076 --> 00:40:00.806
So as you've seen, Xcode

00:40:00.806 --> 00:40:02.856
Localization Catalogs are our

00:40:02.856 --> 00:40:04.246
new standard in Xcode for

00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:05.126
localization.

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:08.806
And these support all of the

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:11.686
localizable resources in your

00:40:11.686 --> 00:40:13.946
project, not just the strings

00:40:13.946 --> 00:40:14.966
based resources.

00:40:15.376 --> 00:40:17.086
And they also provide

00:40:17.316 --> 00:40:20.476
flexibility to provide context

00:40:20.596 --> 00:40:22.186
to localizers, whether that's

00:40:22.246 --> 00:40:23.596
putting in screenshots from your

00:40:23.596 --> 00:40:26.036
tests or putting in readme files

00:40:26.036 --> 00:40:27.646
or movies of the use of your

00:40:27.646 --> 00:40:29.196
application, you can give your

00:40:29.196 --> 00:40:30.986
localizers the context that they

00:40:30.986 --> 00:40:33.796
need to ensure you get exactly

00:40:33.796 --> 00:40:35.466
the right translations the first

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:35.786
time.

00:40:36.926 --> 00:40:39.176
And you've also seen that Siri

00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:41.546
Shortcuts are easy to localize

00:40:41.616 --> 00:40:42.956
by localizing your intent

00:40:42.996 --> 00:40:46.126
definition files, that these use

00:40:46.126 --> 00:40:48.766
base localization with strings

00:40:48.766 --> 00:40:51.676
files and that you can use

00:40:51.676 --> 00:40:52.936
stringsdict files where

00:40:52.936 --> 00:40:54.476
appropriate to handle things

00:40:54.686 --> 00:40:56.666
like pluralization rules in a

00:40:56.666 --> 00:41:01.026
variety of languages, and that

00:41:01.026 --> 00:41:02.796
when you're creating an intent

00:41:02.906 --> 00:41:05.236
to donate in code, you can use

00:41:05.286 --> 00:41:06.926
deferred localized intent

00:41:06.926 --> 00:41:09.116
strings to ensure that a

00:41:09.116 --> 00:41:10.986
shortcut that's created from

00:41:10.986 --> 00:41:13.986
that donated intent is localized

00:41:13.986 --> 00:41:15.506
at the time that it's displayed

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:17.196
to the user, rather than at the

00:41:17.196 --> 00:41:18.966
point where you donated it.

00:41:19.496 --> 00:41:21.766
For more information, you can

00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:23.866
see our session page on the WWDC

00:41:23.936 --> 00:41:24.646
website.

00:41:26.476 --> 00:41:28.166
Thank you again so much for

00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:29.796
coming and I hope you continue

00:41:29.796 --> 00:41:31.966
to have a great WWDC.
