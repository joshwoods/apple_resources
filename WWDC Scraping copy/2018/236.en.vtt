[ Music ]

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:19.366
>> Hello. My name is Chris

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.976
Fleizach and let's talk about

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:22.846
making iOS talk using

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:23.856
AVSpeechSynthesis.

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:26.646
So our agenda for today.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.126
What and why is

00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:29.316
AVSpeechSynthesis?

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.296
Let's talk about some of the

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:31.876
basics.

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:33.416
We'll talk about choosing the

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:35.566
right voice, some properties

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.886
that are available like rate,

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.416
pitch, and volume, and finally

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:39.376
attributed strings.

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:44.126
AVSpeechSynthesis is an API for

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:45.836
generating computer synthesized

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:47.776
speech on your iOS devices.

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:49.156
It has many uses.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.446
For example, you might want to

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:52.556
post announcements within your

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:52.786
app.

00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:54.566
You might be creating an

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.266
interface that's not meant to be

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:56.826
looked at.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.886
Or you might be creating an

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:00.306
education app where having

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:02.246
synthesized speech provides a

00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:03.596
good reinforcement for learning

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.215
materials.

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.236
One example, providing audio

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:08.866
updates during a workout can be

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.596
communicated effectively using

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:11.496
synthesized speech.

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:15.996
A note about synthesis and

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:17.026
accessibility.

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.286
So speech synthesis is a

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.816
powerful tool for helping many

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:22.586
users with many disabilities.

00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:23.956
For example, cognitive users can

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:25.806
get reinforcement about the

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:27.336
output that they are

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:28.046
experiencing.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:29.776
Users who have trouble

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:31.386
vocalizing speech can use

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:33.046
synthesis to generate speech for

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:33.336
them.

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.206
Non-sighted users use speech

00:01:36.206 --> 00:01:37.566
synthesis to consume their

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.336
interfaces.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.076
However, it's important to note

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.376
that it is not a replacement for

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:43.946
VoiceOver or other screen reader

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:44.736
technologies.

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:46.656
For example, speech can overlap

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:47.796
with what VoiceOver is speaking

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:48.576
at the same time.

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:50.846
And most of the speech won't be

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.626
available to any devices that

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:53.926
are connected such as a Braille

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:54.366
device.

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:56.816
Instead, you should make your

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.026
app accessible using the

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:01.876
UIAccessibility API.

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:03.206
Okay. So let's get to the

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:03.736
basics.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.216
First step, create an

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:06.426
AVSpeechSynthesizer.

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:07.926
You can use that with this code

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:08.306
snippet.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:10.356
One thing to note is that you

00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:11.276
want to make sure that it's

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.876
retained until speech is done.

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:14.836
If the synthesizer goes out of

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:16.786
scope, any synthesis in-flight

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:17.456
will be canceled.

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:20.296
Now that we've created a

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:21.606
synthesis, the next job is to

00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:22.576
create an utterance.

00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:24.566
We can then dispatch that to the

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:25.236
synthesizer.

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:28.016
So, in this example, we create

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:28.926
an utterance with the string

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:30.816
hello and then we dispatch it

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:32.406
using the speak method.

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:36.486
A note about audio sessions.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:39.416
So when AVSpeechSynthesis is

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:41.496
activated using speak, the audio

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:43.106
session will automatically set

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:43.546
to active.

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:45.706
If you want to mix with other

00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:47.256
audio, you can use the

00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:48.966
setCategory with options on your

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:50.976
shared AVAudioSession mixed with

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:51.356
others.

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:53.266
If you wanted to duck other

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:55.816
audio so that your speech is

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:57.576
primary but then other audio

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:59.276
becomes lower in volume, you can

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.086
use the duckOthers option.

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:04.436
Another note is that the audio

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:05.706
session will not be set to

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:07.436
inactive after speech is done.

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:10.146
That's because it's a shared

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:12.026
session only so that if there is

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:13.436
any other audio playing at the

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:14.756
same time, we would not want to

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:15.336
stop that.

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:17.576
So if you want to set the audio

00:03:17.576 --> 00:03:18.826
session to inactive, you would

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:19.566
do that yourself.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.386
There are some callback methods

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:24.736
available in AVSpeechSynthesis

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:26.386
that will help inform about the

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:27.716
life cycle of an utterance.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.036
These are optional methods in

00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:31.016
the synthesizer delegate

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:31.516
protocol.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.656
For example, you can know when

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:36.116
speech starts, speech finishes,

00:03:36.606 --> 00:03:37.946
even the character ranges that

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:38.746
will be spoken.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:40.506
You can also know when speech is

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.676
paused or continued.

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:45.426
So an example of this in code

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:47.226
snippet form, you can set your

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.036
synthesizer delegate to an

00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:50.586
object and then implement these

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:51.926
methods, for example the

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:53.506
didStart in which case you'll

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:55.886
get the utterance back, the

00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:58.586
didFinish which will do the

00:03:58.586 --> 00:03:59.976
appropriate thing, and then the

00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:01.736
willSpeakRangeOfSpeechString

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.186
which will give you back an

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:04.636
NSRange which then you can

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:06.966
convert into a string range to

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.306
use that in your string.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:12.606
Now a little demo.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.046
>> Hello, my friends.

00:04:17.426 --> 00:04:18.976
I'm inside the iPhone.

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.116
>> Great. Those are the basics

00:04:24.116 --> 00:04:26.226
of AVSpeechSynthesis and, as you

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.796
can see, it's very simple to get

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:28.386
off the ground.

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:30.766
The next topic is how do you

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:31.746
choose a right voice?

00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:33.236
There are many built-in voices,

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:34.716
one for each supported language.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.516
Something to note is Siri voices

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.146
are not available through this

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:39.446
API.

00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:42.356
Users can, however, download

00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:43.766
higher-quality voices.

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:44.716
And when those are downloaded,

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:46.286
they will appear in the list of

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:46.856
voices.

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:50.846
So you can select a voice using

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.176
either an identifier or a

00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:52.706
language.

00:04:53.246 --> 00:04:54.386
If you select a voice by

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:55.486
language, it will select the

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:56.606
user's default voice.

00:04:57.776 --> 00:04:58.736
So how do we do that?

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.356
First you make your utterance

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:01.406
and then you set the voice

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:02.506
property using

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:03.886
AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:07.286
As an example of using the

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:09.296
identifier initializer, you

00:05:09.296 --> 00:05:10.896
could get all the speech voices

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:13.266
which is an array of speech

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:15.116
voice objects and then choose

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:16.546
the first one, for example, and

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:17.626
then pass in the identifier

00:05:17.626 --> 00:05:18.126
property.

00:05:19.996 --> 00:05:22.136
Here are some of the languages

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:24.166
that are supported on iOS by

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:24.476
default.

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:30.136
Now let's talk about some of the

00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:31.096
properties that you can use on

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:32.116
AVSpeechSynthesizer.

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:34.096
Speech rate can be controlled

00:05:34.526 --> 00:05:36.336
using the rate property, and it

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.406
goes from 0 to 1.

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:40.856
Now this will scale speech to go

00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:42.496
slower or faster.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.626
Speech will be scaled from about

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:47.686
0 to 1 with values from 0 to .5.

00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:50.206
So that means if you pass in .5,

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.776
you will get the default normal

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:52.396
speaking rate.

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:55.606
If you want to go faster, you

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.066
can pass in values from .5 to 1

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.806
and that will scale speech from

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.296
normal speaking rates at 1x all

00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:02.216
the way up to 4x.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.666
To do that, you can create a

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:05.926
speech utterance and then set

00:06:05.926 --> 00:06:09.056
the rate to a float value or you

00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:10.366
can use some of these constants

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:12.956
which are default rate maximum

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:13.526
or minimum.

00:06:15.546 --> 00:06:16.496
Let's talk about pitch and

00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:16.836
volume.

00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:18.316
These are also properties you

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.446
set on the speech utterance.

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:21.386
Pitch controls how high the

00:06:21.386 --> 00:06:23.076
voice is or how low.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:25.046
Volume controls the volume of

00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:25.986
the voice itself.

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:28.496
So, for example, we can set

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:30.146
pitch to a very high pitch voice

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:31.786
using a one value.

00:06:32.396 --> 00:06:33.706
We can set volume to a lower

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:35.286
volume using .25.

00:06:35.986 --> 00:06:37.116
Note that lowering the speech

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.086
volume does not affect the

00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:38.996
system volume.

00:06:42.176 --> 00:06:43.466
Finally, let's talk about

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:44.616
attributed strings.

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:46.936
Attributed strings allow us to

00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:48.716
customize how speech sounds

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:49.866
using different attributes.

00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:52.136
One available attribute that I'd

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:53.896
like to discuss is IPA notation.

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:55.636
IPA stands for International

00:06:55.636 --> 00:06:58.256
Phonetic Alphabet, and it allows

00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.796
us to customize how specialized

00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:02.606
names, nouns, and other things

00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:03.266
are pronounced.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.116
It's available in these

00:07:06.116 --> 00:07:06.766
languages.

00:07:09.516 --> 00:07:10.886
And here is an example of what

00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:11.566
it might look like.

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:13.676
To pronounce the iPhone in the

00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:15.286
way that we are used to, you

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:16.836
would use this IPA notation.

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:19.756
Now the obvious question is how

00:07:19.756 --> 00:07:20.806
do you generate this IPA

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:21.406
notation?

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:22.886
It is not easy to type with a

00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:23.346
keyboard.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.306
One way to do that is to use the

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.126
pronunciation editor in

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.306
accessibility settings.

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:30.886
So when you go to the settings

00:07:30.886 --> 00:07:33.046
app, go into accessibility and

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:33.836
speech, you will find

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:35.376
pronunciations and find a screen

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:36.056
like this.

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:37.946
You can enter in the phrase that

00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:39.536
you want to find the correct

00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:41.066
pronunciation for, tap the

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:42.666
microphone button, and then

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:43.136
speak it.

00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:45.796
After you're done, you'll be

00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:47.516
presented with options on

00:07:47.516 --> 00:07:48.686
possible variations.

00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:50.346
As you tap those, it will say

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:51.036
those out loud.

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:52.106
You can choose the one that

00:07:52.106 --> 00:07:53.656
sounds correct and then copy

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:55.876
this value that you get into

00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:56.366
your code.

00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:58.136
So let's see how that's done.

00:07:58.636 --> 00:08:00.966
First, we make an attributed

00:08:00.966 --> 00:08:03.836
string then we can add the

00:08:03.836 --> 00:08:05.026
attribute for the speech IPA

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.236
notation using the value that we

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:09.256
got from the settings.

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:12.686
Finally, we can create a speech

00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:14.656
utterance with the attributed

00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:17.116
string.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:20.116
So in summary, AVSpeechSynthesis

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:21.446
is a great way to augment your

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:23.336
app experience if you add speech

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.266
at the right time.

00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:26.476
Multiple languages and voices

00:08:26.476 --> 00:08:28.046
are available and can be

00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:29.126
dynamic.

00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:31.336
Finally, you can customize

00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:33.056
pronunciation for the way words

00:08:33.056 --> 00:08:34.696
sound using the IPA notation

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:35.106
attribute.
