00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:23.226
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:24.186 --> 00:00:25.386
I'm Lindsay Verity from

00:00:25.386 --> 00:00:27.026
Advertising Platforms and I'll

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.436
be joined by my colleague, Carol

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:29.886
Hsu, and we're here today to

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:31.756
tell you what's new in Search

00:00:31.756 --> 00:00:32.006
Ads.

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:35.846
Search Ads was first introduced

00:00:35.846 --> 00:00:37.916
to the App Store in the U.S. in

00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:40.756
October 2016 as an efficient and

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:42.306
easy way for you to promote your

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:44.056
apps directly in App Store

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:46.066
search results so customers

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.726
could discover your apps while

00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:49.866
protecting their privacy.

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:53.066
Search Ads Advanced has since

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.516
expanded to the App Stores in

00:00:56.516 --> 00:01:00.276
the U.K., Australia, New

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:01.946
Zealand, Canada, Switzerland,

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:02.846
and Mexico.

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:09.506
In December 2017, we introduced

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:11.016
Search Ads Basic to the App

00:01:11.096 --> 00:01:13.116
Store in the U.S., a minimal

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:15.406
effort cost-per-install offering

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:17.506
that's fast become a favorite of

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:19.716
developers worldwide to promote

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:20.916
their apps on the U.S. App

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:21.356
Store.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.816
And the response to Search Ads

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.026
from developers of all types has

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.256
been incredible.

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:32.916
Postsnap, a U.K.-based photocard

00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:35.636
app has used Search Ads to

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.966
expand their offering to new

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.286
markets and they told us Search

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:42.586
Ads has given us a huge increase

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.336
in high-value users in multiple

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:45.846
regions.

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:48.426
Now we're using Search Ads to

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:52.686
help us launch other apps too.

00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:54.946
And JoyTunes, creators of

00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:56.646
instrument learning apps, are

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:58.066
seeing incredible results.

00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:00.716
They say the quality of users is

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:02.716
so good that the numbers

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.736
upgrading from free to

00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:06.826
subscription is double that of

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:08.626
any other pay channel.

00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:12.406
And, for Playtika's World Series

00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:14.216
of Poker, it's the quality and

00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:16.416
engagement of users that matters

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:18.226
and they said Search Ads is an

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:20.826
extremely powerful product that

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:22.766
has brought high-quality users

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:25.416
and engagement rates 10% higher

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:26.896
than the average.

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:30.046
It's been really great and

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:31.606
wonderful hearing these stories

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.966
and so many more like them.

00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:38.286
And so, today, I'm excited to

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:39.826
announce that this summer,

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:41.986
Search Ads Advanced is coming to

00:02:42.136 --> 00:02:43.826
six more app stores.

[ Applause ]

00:02:47.136 --> 00:02:47.616
Thank you.

00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:55.016

00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:56.776

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:59.036
reach high-intent, high-quality

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:01.016
users in more of the markets

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:02.416
you've told us are most

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:03.256
important to you.

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:06.366
And, what's more, we'll be

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.566
introducing Search Ads Basic to

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:10.416
all 13 App Stores where Search

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:10.966
Ads will be available.

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:16.786
And we've worked hard to make

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:18.496
sure that Search Ads Basic

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:21.136
remains a simple, easy,

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:22.976
effortless way for you to

00:03:22.976 --> 00:03:24.536
promote your apps across

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:25.916
multiple app stores.

00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:28.536
Let me show you how easy it's

00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:30.516
going to be.

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:33.426
Imagine I'm a developer and I

00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:34.966
want to start to promote my new

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:35.646
app, NoMoss.

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:39.916
I simply select the app from the

00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:43.506
drop-down list and note that I

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.516
know see an ad example on the

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.336
right and I'm also presented

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:49.416
with a list of the app stores

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:51.016
where Search Ads is available

00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:53.246
and also where my NoMoss app is

00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:53.966
available too.

00:03:55.206 --> 00:03:56.956
I want to permit my app in as

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.776
many app stores as I can and so

00:03:58.776 --> 00:03:59.956
I'm going to leave all of those

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:00.516
selected.

00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:05.826
Next, I enter my monthly budget,

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:08.336
which is a single budget across

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:09.806
all of the app stores where my

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:10.796
app promotion will run.

00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:13.536
My monthly budget for NoMoss is

00:04:13.646 --> 00:04:14.566
$5000.

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:19.315
And, finally, I input what is

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.055
the maximum amount I'm willing

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.326
to pay for an install.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.676
Now, note Search Ads is

00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:25.996
recommending a maximum

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:28.336
cost-per-install of $1.50, which

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:29.986
is based on what it knows about

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:32.246
my app and also what similar

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:33.586
apps are willing to pay for an

00:04:33.586 --> 00:04:35.626
install, so I'm going to take

00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:36.516
that recommendation.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:41.616
I then save and I'm taken to my

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:43.336
dashboard where I'll check back

00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:43.976
later to see the results.

00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:50.906
I can now see confirmation that

00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:51.986
my new app promotion has been

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:53.586
saved and it should start

00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:54.736
running soon.

00:04:56.856 --> 00:04:59.326
From my dashboard, I can also

00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:01.856
add another app that I want to

00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:03.976
promote and I can also make

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:05.776
changes to any of my existing

00:05:05.776 --> 00:05:06.596
app promotions.

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:09.236
So, I am currently running

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:10.636
promotions in the U.S. App Store

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:11.886
for my LightRight app and I'd

00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:13.786
like to expand that to more app

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:14.176
stores.

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:16.446
To do that, I simply click on

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:18.406
the edit button at the top of

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:21.536
the apps card and my LightRight

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:23.946
app is only available in 10 of

00:05:23.946 --> 00:05:25.736
the app stores where Search Ads

00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:27.046
is offered, so I'm only

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:28.706
presented with those 10 options.

00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:31.246
Now, I can pick markets

00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:33.176
individually, Canada and France,

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:35.996
for example, or I can select

00:05:35.996 --> 00:05:36.196
all.

00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:42.696
I save. And I can now see that

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:44.976
my app is being promoted in 10

00:05:44.976 --> 00:05:50.246
of 10 available app stores.

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:51.926
Now, because I'm promoting my

00:05:51.926 --> 00:05:53.546
app across more app stores, I

00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:54.956
also want to increase my monthly

00:05:54.956 --> 00:05:56.926
budget to enable me to reach

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:58.166
more users and achieve more

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.816
installs, so I'm going to change

00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:03.016
my monthly budget from $1000 to

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:07.176
$3500.

00:06:07.526 --> 00:06:10.126
My change is saved and I'm done.

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:12.886
It's really that simple and we

00:06:12.886 --> 00:06:14.356
can't wait for more of you to

00:06:14.356 --> 00:06:14.826
try it.

00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:18.156
And that was Search Ads Basic.

00:06:18.856 --> 00:06:21.236
So, let's talk about Advanced

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:23.506
and, more specifically, new

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:24.536
creative options.

00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:29.326
Developers have told us they

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:31.116
love the ease of Search Ads

00:06:31.116 --> 00:06:32.236
Creative and how we

00:06:32.236 --> 00:06:34.016
automatically create the ads

00:06:34.046 --> 00:06:36.236
using the metadata and imagery

00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:37.876
you already provide for your App

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:38.836
Store product page.

00:06:39.116 --> 00:06:41.556
And App Store customers respond

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:43.436
really well to those ads because

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.206
of their noninvasive appearance

00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:46.946
and because they're an accurate

00:06:46.946 --> 00:06:48.246
representation of what they can

00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:49.306
expect from the app's

00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:49.966
experience.

00:06:50.616 --> 00:06:54.456
Since February, you've had the

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.606
option to add up to 10 app

00:06:56.746 --> 00:07:00.756
screenshots and 3 videos on your

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:01.776
App Store product page.

00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:05.366
And just last week, we were

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:07.526
excited to introduce our newest

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:08.706
Search Ads Advanced feature,

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:11.016
Creative Sets, giving you the

00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:12.376
ability to leverage these

00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:14.426
additional App Store assets to

00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:16.626
create more ad variations to

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:18.456
help you better align your ad

00:07:18.486 --> 00:07:20.476
group keyword themes with

00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:21.976
specific audiences.

00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:25.326
Now, let me turn it over to

00:07:25.326 --> 00:07:26.756
Carol, who's going to tell you

00:07:26.756 --> 00:07:28.586
more about how Creative Sets

00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:30.216
work and give you a demo.

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:38.156
[ Applause ]

00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:39.806
>> Thanks, Lindsay.

00:07:40.356 --> 00:07:45.426
As Lindsay just showed, you can

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:46.806
use Creative Sets to display

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:47.986
different app previews in

00:07:47.986 --> 00:07:49.486
screenshots that align to

00:07:49.626 --> 00:07:51.166
keyword themes or specific

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:51.826
audiences.

00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:54.576
Since Creative Sets uses App

00:07:54.786 --> 00:07:56.606
Store approved assets, this

00:07:56.606 --> 00:07:58.556
ensures the best user

00:07:58.556 --> 00:07:59.166
experience.

00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:01.266
I'm here to show you how it's

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:01.566
done.

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:05.476
Before we begin, imagine I'm a

00:08:05.476 --> 00:08:07.236
developer and these are all of

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.526
the assets that I've uploaded to

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:10.466
App Store Connect for my app,

00:08:10.986 --> 00:08:11.526
TripTrek.

00:08:12.606 --> 00:08:14.216
TripTrek is an app that lets

00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:16.676
users document every step of

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:17.856
their travels and treks.

00:08:20.546 --> 00:08:22.096
The first three assets will be

00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:23.586
used in my default ad.

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:26.436
The default ad matches what

00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:28.356
shows in organic search results;

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:30.956
however, there are 2 specific

00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:32.525
keyword themes that I want to

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:34.385
focus on with my Search Ads

00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:39.736
campaigns, fitness and mapping.

00:08:43.436 --> 00:08:44.726
I can use Creative Sets to

00:08:44.726 --> 00:08:46.106
choose the assets that best

00:08:46.136 --> 00:08:47.466
align to those themes.

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:49.596
Let's go through the steps of

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.306
how I do that by adding Creative

00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:53.236
Sets to my Search Ads campaigns

00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:54.186
and ad groups now.

00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:08.556
Here I am, already logged into

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:09.816
my Search Ads account.

00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:12.046
And I'm on the campaigns view.

00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:14.576
Let's go ahead and create a new

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:15.666
campaign together.

00:09:17.926 --> 00:09:20.806
I'll start by clicking Create

00:09:22.376 --> 00:09:23.356
Campaign, choosing my app,

00:09:25.056 --> 00:09:28.406
TripTrek, the storefront that I

00:09:28.406 --> 00:09:30.676
want to promote it in, and I'll

00:09:30.676 --> 00:09:31.866
give it a campaign name.

00:09:33.316 --> 00:09:35.346
Let's call this one Active

00:09:35.346 --> 00:09:35.736
Travel.

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:45.786
I'll assign a budget and for now

00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:47.466
I'll skip over the daily cap and

00:09:47.466 --> 00:09:48.796
the campaign negative keywords.

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:52.816
We'll go ahead and create the

00:09:52.816 --> 00:09:54.876
first ad group in this campaign.

00:09:55.156 --> 00:09:58.636
I'm going to call it fitness to

00:09:58.636 --> 00:10:00.466
match the keywords that I plan

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:01.036
to bid on.

00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:04.976
I want this to run on both iPad

00:10:05.056 --> 00:10:07.226
and iPhone, so I'll leave that

00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:07.906
setting as is.

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:10.786
And since, of course, I want

00:10:10.786 --> 00:10:12.846
this to run all day every day,

00:10:13.406 --> 00:10:14.586
I'll leave the ad scheduling

00:10:14.586 --> 00:10:15.296
alone for now.

00:10:16.676 --> 00:10:19.896
And I'll enter a default max CPT

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:20.526
bid.

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:24.536
I'm going to leave Search Match

00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:26.436
on so that Search Ads

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:28.586
automatically matches my ads to

00:10:28.616 --> 00:10:29.646
relevant searches.

00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:32.906
And I'm going to choose from

00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:34.556
some of the recommended keywords

00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:36.766
some of the keywords that match

00:10:36.766 --> 00:10:37.786
my fitness theme.

00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:40.276
Maybe we'll go with hiking

00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:43.996
tracker, hiking trails, activity

00:10:43.996 --> 00:10:45.216
tracker, and step counter.

00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:47.336
And then I'll add a few more of

00:10:47.336 --> 00:10:47.876
my own.

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:52.596
How about fitness tracker and

00:10:52.596 --> 00:10:54.586
fitness challenge, since that's

00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:56.626
one of the features in my app.

00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:01.786
Since I want my ads to show to

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.246
all users, I'll leave the

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.906
audience settings alone for now

00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:04.973
too.

00:11:09.476 --> 00:11:11.446
Here I can see a preview of the

00:11:11.446 --> 00:11:14.376
default text ad and the default

00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:16.886
image ad, which shows alongside

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:18.766
the ads from my Creative Sets

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:21.766
and matches the organic search

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:22.086
result.

00:11:24.606 --> 00:11:27.826
But, since I want to use assets

00:11:27.866 --> 00:11:29.516
that are more closely aligned to

00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:31.066
my fitness theme, I'm going to

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.506
create a Creative Set for that,

00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:34.006
so let's go ahead and add one

00:11:34.006 --> 00:11:37.036
now by clicking Add Creative

00:11:37.886 --> 00:11:37.976
Set.

00:11:40.536 --> 00:11:42.166
I'll name this Creative Set

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:46.576
Social Hiking and choose the

00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:47.946
localization language.

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:50.556
The set of languages depends on

00:11:50.556 --> 00:11:51.456
the storefronts that I'm

00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:53.426
promoting in and on the

00:11:53.426 --> 00:11:54.786
localized assets that I

00:11:54.786 --> 00:11:56.116
submitted to App Store Connect.

00:11:57.346 --> 00:11:58.776
I'll leave this as English for

00:11:58.776 --> 00:11:59.026
now.

00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:02.286
Next, I need to choose the right

00:12:02.316 --> 00:12:04.536
combination of assets to create

00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:05.896
an effective creative set.

00:12:07.296 --> 00:12:08.636
Here I can see all of the

00:12:08.636 --> 00:12:10.156
screenshots and app previews

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.156
from the available set of assets

00:12:12.406 --> 00:12:15.136
on my app product page organized

00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:20.596
by display size and in the order

00:12:20.596 --> 00:12:22.056
that I submitted to App Store

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:23.206
Connect.

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:26.716
I'll only see the display sizes

00:12:26.716 --> 00:12:28.236
that have enough localized

00:12:28.236 --> 00:12:30.106
assets to satisfy a Creative

00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:30.386
Set.

00:12:31.386 --> 00:12:32.966
In App Store Connect, I had

00:12:32.966 --> 00:12:34.936
elected to use the 5.5-inch

00:12:34.936 --> 00:12:37.606
display, which is why I don't

00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:39.366
see any other iPhone display

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.956
size assets here.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.306
If I'm having trouble

00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:46.636
remembering which devices are

00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:48.456
which display size, I can go to

00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:50.276
the upper right-hand corner and

00:12:50.276 --> 00:12:52.606
click on View Device Display

00:12:52.606 --> 00:12:54.706
Sizes to see that information.

00:12:56.156 --> 00:12:57.266
I'll go ahead and close this

00:12:58.866 --> 00:12:58.996
now.

00:12:59.526 --> 00:13:01.406
If I hover over an asset, an

00:13:01.436 --> 00:13:03.026
icon appears in the lower

00:13:03.026 --> 00:13:05.376
left-hand corner and I can click

00:13:05.376 --> 00:13:07.706
on that to get a closer look.

00:13:08.456 --> 00:13:10.746
I can also easily click through

00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:13.176
to see the other assets as well.

00:13:13.786 --> 00:13:18.156
Let me close this now and choose

00:13:18.156 --> 00:13:20.566
the assets for my Creative Set.

00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:25.896
For the iPhone 5.5-inch display,

00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:28.636
I have all portrait assets, so I

00:13:28.636 --> 00:13:31.486
need to select at least 3 in

00:13:31.486 --> 00:13:33.436
order to complete my Creative

00:13:33.516 --> 00:13:33.726
Set.

00:13:36.046 --> 00:13:37.636
I can see which of my assets are

00:13:37.636 --> 00:13:39.276
already being used in the

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:42.456
default ads by this label here

00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:44.046
that says default on the first

00:13:44.136 --> 00:13:44.856
few assets.

00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:47.046
I'm going to choose assets that

00:13:47.046 --> 00:13:48.316
are different from the default

00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:49.866
ones and that are aligned with

00:13:49.926 --> 00:13:52.146
my fitness theme.

00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:53.966
Here we go.

00:13:54.096 --> 00:13:54.806
These look good.

00:13:56.186 --> 00:14:00.186
And then for the iPad 12.9-inch

00:14:00.696 --> 00:14:02.516
display size, I have all

00:14:02.516 --> 00:14:04.446
landscape assets, so I need to

00:14:04.526 --> 00:14:06.726
select at least one of these in

00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:08.356
order for my ads to show on

00:14:08.496 --> 00:14:08.906
iPad.

00:14:10.176 --> 00:14:11.916
I'll go ahead and pick this one

00:14:11.916 --> 00:14:12.276
for now.

00:14:14.406 --> 00:14:16.176
Once I've chosen assets for each

00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:19.626
display size, I click save and

00:14:20.336 --> 00:14:22.596
see that my creative set has

00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:25.066
been added to my ad group and

00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:27.066
now I'm ready to start my

00:14:28.676 --> 00:14:28.866
campaign.

00:14:32.136 --> 00:14:33.966
The Active Travel campaign now

00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:36.296
appears on my campaigns view and

00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:37.526
that's how you add a Creative

00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:39.676
Set to a new campaign and ad

00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:40.136
group.

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.156
Next, let me show you how to add

00:14:44.156 --> 00:14:45.786
a Creative Set to an existing

00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:47.256
campaign and ad group.

00:14:48.806 --> 00:14:50.526
Let's go into my Navigation

00:14:50.526 --> 00:14:51.126
campaign.

00:14:51.656 --> 00:14:55.956
And from there, let's go into

00:14:56.296 --> 00:14:59.676
the City Maps ad group and I'll

00:14:59.676 --> 00:15:01.676
click on this new Creative Sets

00:15:01.756 --> 00:15:02.126
tab.

00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:06.366
This is a brand-new view in

00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:07.896
Search Ads where I'll be able to

00:15:07.996 --> 00:15:09.886
see not only how my Creative

00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:11.966
Sets are performing, but also

00:15:12.076 --> 00:15:14.036
how the default text ad and the

00:15:14.036 --> 00:15:15.886
default image ad are doing.

00:15:17.206 --> 00:15:18.476
I currently only have the

00:15:18.476 --> 00:15:20.196
default ads running and I don't

00:15:20.196 --> 00:15:21.786
have any Creative Sets yet for

00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:22.476
this ad group.

00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:25.476
So, I'll add one now by clicking

00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:27.116
Add Creative Set.

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:33.776
Let's go ahead and name this

00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:37.636
Creative Set Mapping Features to

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:40.516
align to my mapping theme.

00:15:41.046 --> 00:15:43.556
And I'll leave the localization

00:15:43.556 --> 00:15:44.956
language as English again.

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:49.656
And for the iPhone 5.5-inch

00:15:49.656 --> 00:15:51.096
display size, I have all

00:15:51.096 --> 00:15:52.686
portrait assets, so again I need

00:15:52.686 --> 00:15:55.386
to select at least 3 to populate

00:15:55.386 --> 00:15:55.906
my ad.

00:15:57.046 --> 00:15:58.336
In this case, I'm going to

00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:00.266
choose more than 3 assets,

00:16:00.356 --> 00:16:01.756
including some that are already

00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.996
used in the default ads, and let

00:16:04.076 --> 00:16:05.996
Search Ads automatically create

00:16:05.996 --> 00:16:08.676
the various combinations of ads

00:16:08.766 --> 00:16:14.386
from all of these assets.

00:16:14.696 --> 00:16:16.586
Search Ads uses machine learning

00:16:16.636 --> 00:16:18.796
to continuously optimize to show

00:16:18.796 --> 00:16:21.456
the best performing ads.

00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:24.866
Since I'm only interested in

00:16:24.866 --> 00:16:26.946
testing ad variations for iPhone

00:16:26.946 --> 00:16:29.196
at this time, I'm going to elect

00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:31.586
to use default assets for iPad,

00:16:32.146 --> 00:16:34.186
which means only the default ads

00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:35.526
will show on iPad.

00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:40.886
I click save and now I've added

00:16:40.886 --> 00:16:43.466
my first Creative Set to this ad

00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:46.496
group and I can create up to 10

00:16:46.496 --> 00:16:47.966
Creative Sets per ad group.

00:16:49.556 --> 00:16:51.326
I can return to this view at any

00:16:51.326 --> 00:16:53.086
time to check how this Creative

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:54.996
Set is performing versus the

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:55.696
default ads.

00:17:03.976 --> 00:17:05.705
So, that's how I added Creative

00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:07.746
Sets for my two keyword themes,

00:17:07.915 --> 00:17:08.866
fitness and mapping.

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:10.786
I hope you'll give this a try

00:17:10.786 --> 00:17:11.296
yourself.

00:17:12.036 --> 00:17:13.006
Now, let me hand it back to

00:17:13.006 --> 00:17:13.415
Lindsay.
