[ Applause ]

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:27.966
>> Hey, everyone.

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:29.946
Welcome to the AR design

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:30.466
session.

00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:33.636
My name is Grant Paul, from the

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:34.966
human interface team at Apple.

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.606
And, I hope you've been having a

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:38.186
great WWDC this week.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.836
So, for this session, we're

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:42.616
going to start off by, I'm going

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.196
to talk about how to design

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.626
great AR apps and games with the

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:47.916
user interfaces and

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:48.636
interactions.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:50.716
And then, Omar's going to come

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.146
up, and he's going to tell you

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:54.916
all about making 3D models that

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:56.836
look great in AR, and feel great

00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:56.956
in AR.

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:02.916
So, before we get to that, I

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.226
want to quickly talk about the

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:04.775
basics.

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:07.646
So, if you're new to it, you

00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:09.106
might be wondering exactly what

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:11.016
it is that we mean when we talk

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:11.606
about AR.

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:13.316
But, even if you're an AR

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:14.996
expert, I want to talk about

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:16.766
what we mean for this session.

00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:20.566
So, AR, of course, stands for

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.646
augmented reality.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:23.706
And, let's break down what that

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:25.316
means a little bit.

00:01:25.896 --> 00:01:27.496
And, we can start with reality,

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:28.616
because it's a little bit easier

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:29.186
to get into.

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:32.516
So, reality means is that AR

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:34.456
deals with things in the real

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:34.876
world.

00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:36.326
And, that's a little bit

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.736
different than other things we

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:39.016
might have done on our devices,

00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:41.426
that take place on the device,

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:43.216
or they take place on the

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:43.736
internet.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.516
But, with AR, things happen in

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:47.406
the real world.

00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:50.806
They happen in the room around

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:51.796
you, in the environment you're

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:54.066
in, or in your place on the map.

00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:54.946
Where you are.

00:01:55.986 --> 00:01:56.946
But, the important thing is,

00:01:56.946 --> 00:01:57.826
it's a little bit different.

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:00.026
And the other part of augmented

00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:01.506
reality, is augmented.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:03.196
And, that can mean a few

00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:03.976
different things.

00:02:04.796 --> 00:02:06.236
So, augmented can mean -- it can

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:08.036
mean augmenting what you know

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:08.696
about the world.

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:10.386
It can mean getting information

00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:11.636
that the device can understand

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:13.536
about the world, and giving that

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:14.116
to you.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:16.196
It can mean placing virtual

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:17.526
things out into the world,

00:02:17.826 --> 00:02:19.236
giving the virtual this physical

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:20.006
context.

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:21.676
And, it can mean taking

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:23.226
something that is real, like

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.466
your face, when you put an

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:25.826
animoji on as a mask.

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:27.436
Taking something that is real,

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:29.946
and enhancing it, augmenting it.

00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:32.536
So, that's what we mean when we

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:33.506
talk about AR, when we talk

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:34.976
about augmented reality.

00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:40.776
And, with that, I want to get to

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.156
the first half of this session.

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:43.676
I want to start talking about

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:45.546
how to design interfaces, and

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:47.356
design interactions for your AR

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:49.226
apps and your AR games.

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:52.126
And, the first part of that is

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:53.676
to talk about how to get people

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:54.466
into AR.

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:56.556
How to help guide people into

00:02:56.556 --> 00:02:56.876
AR.

00:02:57.596 --> 00:02:59.366
So, I'll show you how iOS 12's

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.576
built-in AR experiences help

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:02.716
guide people into AR.

00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:04.606
And then, how you can take those

00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:06.446
principles, and apply them in

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:07.466
your own apps.

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:10.206
Next, we'll talk about the

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:11.546
different ways you can present

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:12.596
content in AR.

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:14.836
The different possibilities that

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:17.106
ARKit opens up, and also some

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:19.046
tips and tricks that are great

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:20.306
no matter what kind of AR app

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:20.896
you're making.

00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:23.866
And finally, we'll talk about

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.286
interactions in the world.

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:26.976
It's a little bit different when

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:28.616
you're building an AR app than

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:29.636
when you're building a 2D app,

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:31.386
for what kind of interactions

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:32.806
make sense, and what kind of

00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:33.746
interactions you're going to

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:34.456
want to use.

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:36.056
So, we'll figure out what still

00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:37.786
works great in AR, and then,

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:38.896
where we might need some new

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:40.036
kinds of interactions.

00:03:41.436 --> 00:03:43.566
But first, I want to get started

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:44.946
with talking about how to get

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:45.706
into AR.

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:47.546
And, what I'm talking about here

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:49.476
is after somebody's downloaded

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:51.396
your app, after they've found

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:52.576
the AR experience in the app,

00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:54.316
they've opened it up, what I'm

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:57.376
talking about here is when ARKit

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:58.936
needs to understand the world.

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:01.936
Because for every AR app, ARKit

00:04:01.936 --> 00:04:03.076
needs some level of

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.286
understanding of the world in

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:06.876
order to start the AR

00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:07.506
experience.

00:04:07.506 --> 00:04:08.486
In order to get it going.

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:11.486
Because every AR app needs to --

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:13.376
needs that understanding in

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:14.666
order to place its objects into

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:16.446
the world, or show the user that

00:04:16.446 --> 00:04:17.196
information.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:20.266
And, the way ARKit builds that

00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:22.065
understanding of the world, is

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:23.116
by getting you to move your

00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:24.816
device, by having you move

00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:25.186
around.

00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:27.076
And, that's a little bit

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:29.346
different from other places that

00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:30.846
you might have looked through a

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:32.456
device, seen a camera preview,

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:33.596
in the past.

00:04:34.386 --> 00:04:35.386
Like, for example, when you're

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:37.096
taking a photo, you just need to

00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:38.836
point the device where you want

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:39.636
to frame the shot.

00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:42.066
But, in AR, you really do need

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:43.576
to start moving, looking at the

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:44.916
same place from different

00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:46.466
positions, and looking at it

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:47.446
from some different angles.

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:51.056
So, the trick here is to let

00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:52.746
people know what they need to

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:52.916
do.

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:54.476
Let them know how to move, that

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:55.426
they need to move their device.

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:57.416
And, the way to do that is to

00:04:57.416 --> 00:04:58.826
give them a fixed reference.

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:00.266
Give them something to base that

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.296
understanding off of.

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:03.416
And, let's talk about that.

00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:04.606
Let's take a look at an example.

00:05:05.676 --> 00:05:07.236
So, this is the game Euclidean

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:07.756
Lands.

00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:09.546
And, what it's showing here, is

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:11.356
the device moving around inside

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:11.986
of a room.

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:13.936
And, that's really great,

00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:15.376
because you can see here,

00:05:15.376 --> 00:05:18.026
without any text exactly what it

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.866
is you need to do, that you need

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.366
to move the device within that

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:24.596
room, and just turning the

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:25.666
device to look at a different

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.496
angle isn't going to be enough.

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:29.406
So, without any text, it's

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:31.156
really clear from that fixed

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:32.976
reference of the room, exactly

00:05:32.976 --> 00:05:35.346
what you need to do.

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:37.426
And, usually, most of the time,

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:38.606
that is all you're going to

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:38.976
need.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:41.396
ARKit is even faster to build

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:42.746
that understanding of the world

00:05:43.106 --> 00:05:44.096
in iOS 12.

00:05:44.696 --> 00:05:47.136
So, in even more cases that is

00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:48.316
all you're going to need.

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:49.956
You just need to start moving,

00:05:49.956 --> 00:05:51.036
and you're ready to go.

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:54.056
But, of course, there are some

00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:55.646
situations that aren't quite as

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:56.636
well suited to AR.

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.836
Maybe you're in a dark room, or

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:00.696
it's really reflective, and it's

00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:04.026
not as easy to -- for ARKit to

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:04.796
start building that

00:06:04.796 --> 00:06:05.606
understanding.

00:06:05.806 --> 00:06:07.606
So, it can take ARKit a little

00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:09.306
bit of time to get ready.

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:11.346
It might not happen immediately.

00:06:12.616 --> 00:06:14.126
And, in those situations, if

00:06:14.126 --> 00:06:15.236
you're still being told to move

00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:16.526
your device, you're still

00:06:16.526 --> 00:06:17.506
looking at something that says

00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:19.336
to you, move your device around,

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:20.966
people might start to wonder,

00:06:21.416 --> 00:06:23.936
why is the app not working?

00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:25.356
Does the app not understand the

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:26.436
movement that they're making?

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:27.666
And, it might get -- start to

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:28.566
get confusing.

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:30.926
So, what you need is some kind

00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:32.796
of feedback that lets people

00:06:32.796 --> 00:06:34.156
know that they're not doing

00:06:34.156 --> 00:06:35.046
anything wrong.

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:36.366
They're doing exactly what they

00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:38.316
should be doing to get into AR.

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:39.916
And, they should just keep doing

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:40.066
it.

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:41.556
So, let's take a look at an

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:41.976
example.

00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:48.146
So, this is how iOS 12's

00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:50.426
built-in AR apps help guide

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:51.446
people into AR.

00:06:52.176 --> 00:06:53.486
You can see the device moving

00:06:53.486 --> 00:06:55.586
over the fixed reference of that

00:06:55.586 --> 00:06:57.346
surface, by showing you that you

00:06:57.346 --> 00:06:58.206
need to move it.

00:06:58.356 --> 00:06:59.456
You can't just keep it in one

00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:00.576
place, or rotate it.

00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:04.036
And then, once you've started

00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:06.056
moving the device, the surface

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:07.616
transitions into a cube.

00:07:07.866 --> 00:07:10.806
And, that cube spins with the

00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:12.206
movement of the device, giving

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:13.666
you real, connected, direct

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.196
feedback that you're on the

00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:16.916
right path, and you're doing the

00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:17.506
right thing.

00:07:18.696 --> 00:07:20.276
And then, once ARKit has built

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:21.406
that understanding, it's all

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:23.946
ready, the cube spins away, and

00:07:23.946 --> 00:07:25.516
you're ready to go in your AR

00:07:25.516 --> 00:07:25.966
experience.

00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:30.896
So, that's how the built-in apps

00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:33.256
in iOS 12 help guide people into

00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:33.526
AR.

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:35.276
And, your apps should follow

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:36.446
those same principles.

00:07:36.876 --> 00:07:38.636
They should help people know

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:39.476
that they need to move their

00:07:39.476 --> 00:07:41.016
device, and give them that

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:42.126
feedback that they're doing the

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:42.806
right thing.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.586
But, your apps don't need to

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:45.786
follow that same style.

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:46.666
They don't need to look like

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.066
line drawings.

00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:48.886
AR should feel like an

00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:50.306
integrated part of your app.

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:52.406
It should feel native to your

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:53.206
app's style.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.466
And, it shouldn't feel like

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:56.256
something that's attached on, or

00:07:56.256 --> 00:07:58.026
this flow is something that's

00:07:58.026 --> 00:07:59.106
added on after the fact.

00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:01.186
So, the important part is to

00:08:01.186 --> 00:08:02.556
help people down the right path,

00:08:03.076 --> 00:08:04.136
but it should feel like part of

00:08:04.136 --> 00:08:05.386
your app while you're doing

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:05.626
that.

00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:09.026
And, the last thing I want to

00:08:09.026 --> 00:08:10.446
talk about for helping get

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:12.156
people into AR, is that it's

00:08:12.156 --> 00:08:14.676
important to balance your

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:16.176
instructions, your guidance, how

00:08:16.176 --> 00:08:17.306
you're helping people get into

00:08:17.306 --> 00:08:19.216
AR with being really efficient

00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:20.646
when people already do know what

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:21.906
to do.

00:08:22.016 --> 00:08:24.006
So, if somebody already knows

00:08:24.006 --> 00:08:25.156
what to do, they're just going

00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:26.216
to start moving their device

00:08:26.216 --> 00:08:26.846
right away.

00:08:27.246 --> 00:08:28.296
They don't need any kind of

00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:29.236
instructions.

00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:30.876
They don't need anything to tell

00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:31.576
them to do that.

00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:33.385
So, don't make them sit through

00:08:33.385 --> 00:08:34.506
any kind of guidance.

00:08:34.796 --> 00:08:36.496
Since ARKit is so much faster,

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.186
in a lot of cases, they'll start

00:08:38.186 --> 00:08:40.035
moving, ARKit will understand

00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:41.426
the world, and they'll be ready

00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:41.936
to go right away.

00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:48.326
Alright. So, that's getting into

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:48.606
AR.

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:50.226
That's how you help guide people

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:51.966
into your AR experiences.

00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:54.626
Now, let's talk about how to

00:08:54.626 --> 00:08:56.376
present your content in AR.

00:08:56.746 --> 00:08:57.666
The different ways that you can

00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.676
show things in AR, and tips and

00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:02.126
tricks for all kinds of AR apps

00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:02.886
and AR games.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.356
And, I want to start with some

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:06.196
of the more radical

00:09:06.196 --> 00:09:08.076
possibilities of things you can

00:09:08.076 --> 00:09:08.906
build in ARKit.

00:09:09.446 --> 00:09:11.266
Because not every AR experience

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:13.006
has to look like looking through

00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:14.306
your device, seeing a camera

00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:15.886
preview of the world, and then

00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:17.566
placing objects out into space.

00:09:17.946 --> 00:09:19.296
There are other options as well.

00:09:21.256 --> 00:09:23.306
So, one of those options is to

00:09:23.306 --> 00:09:25.836
build an AR experience entirely

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:26.886
in two dimensions.

00:09:27.456 --> 00:09:28.566
You don't need to show a camera

00:09:28.566 --> 00:09:29.246
preview.

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:30.696
You don't need any kind of 3D

00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:31.376
graphics.

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:33.276
You're using that information

00:09:33.516 --> 00:09:35.186
that ARKit gets about the world

00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:38.546
to present a great AR

00:09:38.546 --> 00:09:40.646
experiences entirely in 2D.

00:09:41.986 --> 00:09:42.676
So, let's take a look at an

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:43.726
example of that.

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:46.166
This is the game "Rainbrow."

00:09:47.026 --> 00:09:49.266
And, in Rainbrow, the way you

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:50.396
control you character is by

00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:51.756
moving your eyebrows up and

00:09:51.756 --> 00:09:51.956
down.

00:09:52.516 --> 00:10:11.500
[ Game Music ]

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:19.876
[ Applause ]

00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:22.466
So, there's no need of any kind

00:10:22.466 --> 00:10:23.546
of camera preview here.

00:10:23.776 --> 00:10:25.686
There's no need for any 3D

00:10:25.686 --> 00:10:26.216
graphics.

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:28.396
It's a lot more fun entirely in

00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.736
2D, but it's still a great AR

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:31.396
experience.

00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:34.976
So, that was AR in 2D.

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:36.936
But, another way, another thing

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.036
you can do with ARKit is you can

00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:40.066
build things that I would

00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:41.596
consider to be full virtual

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:42.946
reality experiences.

00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:45.146
And, what I mean by that, is

00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:46.476
that the experiences take you to

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:47.466
a different place.

00:10:47.836 --> 00:10:49.106
They really make you feel like

00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:50.166
you're somewhere else.

00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:51.846
You can walk around the

00:10:51.846 --> 00:10:52.556
environment.

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.016
You can move around within it.

00:10:54.016 --> 00:10:55.616
You can look in all directions.

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:57.566
And, to me that makes something

00:10:58.066 --> 00:10:59.706
really into a virtual reality

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:01.266
experience, even if it is

00:11:01.266 --> 00:11:02.046
through a device.

00:11:02.456 --> 00:11:04.676
And, there's some benefits to

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:04.946
that.

00:11:05.406 --> 00:11:06.466
You don't need any extra

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:06.896
equipment.

00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:07.786
It works everywhere.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:09.246
You don't need to wear a headset

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:09.936
on your head.

00:11:10.256 --> 00:11:11.706
It works everywhere you are with

00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:12.856
the device you already have.

00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:13.946
You don't need any kind of

00:11:13.986 --> 00:11:15.446
trackers or anything else.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.826
And, there's some benefits to

00:11:18.226 --> 00:11:19.626
looking through a device rather

00:11:19.626 --> 00:11:21.336
than being fully immersed.

00:11:21.656 --> 00:11:22.336
Like, you're never going to

00:11:22.336 --> 00:11:23.796
accidentally walk into a wall

00:11:23.796 --> 00:11:25.116
because you always have your

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:25.986
peripheral vision.

00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:28.496
So, ARKit can be a great way to

00:11:28.726 --> 00:11:30.066
make virtual reality

00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:30.826
experiences.

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:32.026
We'll take a look at one.

00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:35.236
So, this is the virtual reality

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.706
experience called "Enter the

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:37.116
Room."

00:11:37.116 --> 00:11:38.256
And, it was developed by the

00:11:38.256 --> 00:11:39.636
International Committee of the

00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:40.296
Red Cross.

00:11:40.696 --> 00:11:44.056
And, in this experience, once

00:11:44.056 --> 00:11:45.146
you walk into the room, you can

00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:47.436
look around in all directions.

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:49.326
You can move closer to things.

00:11:49.326 --> 00:11:50.316
You can inspect them.

00:11:50.596 --> 00:11:51.496
You can move farther away.

00:11:51.496 --> 00:11:54.086
And, the sound comes in, and it

00:11:54.086 --> 00:11:55.536
feels like it's coming in from

00:11:55.536 --> 00:11:56.796
outside the room, from all

00:11:56.796 --> 00:11:57.306
around you.

00:11:57.306 --> 00:11:59.446
And, that makes it into a really

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:00.716
powerful experience.

00:12:00.716 --> 00:12:03.496
And, that's what you can do with

00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:05.326
virtual reality using ARKit.

00:12:05.836 --> 00:12:08.356
So, those are some of the more

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:10.186
radical options of things that

00:12:10.186 --> 00:12:11.396
you can build with ARKit.

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:13.986
We can also look at some tips

00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:15.206
and tricks that make sense no

00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:17.266
matter what kind of app it is

00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:17.936
that you're building.

00:12:18.356 --> 00:12:19.686
Whether it's a game, or a

00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:21.736
productivity app, these can work

00:12:21.736 --> 00:12:22.346
for everything.

00:12:22.926 --> 00:12:25.286
So, the first thing I want to

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.256
talk about here is showing text

00:12:28.256 --> 00:12:28.656
in AR.

00:12:29.296 --> 00:12:30.546
Because text is really

00:12:30.586 --> 00:12:32.056
important.

00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:34.816
All kinds of AR apps have

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.776
different reasons to show text.

00:12:37.136 --> 00:12:38.316
If it's a game, maybe you want

00:12:38.316 --> 00:12:40.046
to show the title of a level, or

00:12:40.046 --> 00:12:41.066
some instructions.

00:12:41.586 --> 00:12:42.956
Or, maybe for other kinds of

00:12:42.956 --> 00:12:44.046
apps, you want to label

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:45.896
something in the world, label a

00:12:45.896 --> 00:12:46.866
virtual object.

00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:48.696
Maybe show some annotations.

00:12:49.616 --> 00:12:51.136
But, the important part, no

00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:52.406
matter what reason it is that

00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:54.116
you're showing this text, is to

00:12:54.116 --> 00:12:55.546
keep that text readable.

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.836
Make it really easy to read.

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:01.706
So, the simplest way to show

00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:03.826
text in AR, is to put it out

00:13:03.826 --> 00:13:04.966
into the world, to put it in

00:13:04.966 --> 00:13:05.616
perspective.

00:13:06.556 --> 00:13:07.546
And, you know, that can look

00:13:07.546 --> 00:13:08.286
really cool.

00:13:08.926 --> 00:13:10.656
But, it also has some drawbacks.

00:13:11.386 --> 00:13:12.916
And, one of those drawbacks is

00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:14.096
what happens when you look at it

00:13:14.536 --> 00:13:15.286
from an angle.

00:13:15.886 --> 00:13:17.066
The letters can, sort of, squish

00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:17.656
together.

00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:18.896
It can be a little hard to read.

00:13:19.996 --> 00:13:21.576
And, another issue is what

00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:23.126
happens when you take a step

00:13:23.126 --> 00:13:24.096
back, when you're looking from

00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:24.866
further away.

00:13:25.386 --> 00:13:26.826
The text can get really small.

00:13:26.826 --> 00:13:27.726
It's like trying to read a piece

00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:29.616
of paper from all the way across

00:13:29.646 --> 00:13:30.116
the room.

00:13:30.746 --> 00:13:32.636
So, if you're showing titles, or

00:13:32.906 --> 00:13:34.126
other kinds of things that maybe

00:13:34.126 --> 00:13:35.246
people already know, or could

00:13:35.246 --> 00:13:36.886
get in another way, it can be

00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:37.946
really cool to show that in

00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:38.596
perspective.

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:40.306
But, if you're showing something

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:41.636
that people really need to read,

00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:43.736
need to get information from,

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:44.966
you might want to try a

00:13:44.966 --> 00:13:45.706
different option.

00:13:45.846 --> 00:13:48.986
So, a different option that you

00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:51.036
can use, is to show your text in

00:13:51.036 --> 00:13:51.866
screen space.

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:53.966
And, what I mean by screen

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:55.496
space, is that the text is

00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:57.116
always the same size.

00:13:57.576 --> 00:13:58.956
It's always facing you.

00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:00.086
It's always head-on.

00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:01.896
And, that makes it really easy

00:14:01.896 --> 00:14:02.186
to read.

00:14:02.186 --> 00:14:03.596
It doesn't have those problems

00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:05.236
of what angle you're looking at,

00:14:05.576 --> 00:14:06.946
or how far away from it you are.

00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:09.546
But, the important part of

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:11.806
showing text in screen space, is

00:14:11.806 --> 00:14:13.626
that it's still attached to a

00:14:13.626 --> 00:14:14.706
position in the world.

00:14:15.126 --> 00:14:16.976
It's still fixed to the place in

00:14:16.976 --> 00:14:18.166
the world that you attach it to

00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:20.476
an object, or attach it to some

00:14:20.476 --> 00:14:21.366
physical feature.

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:24.166
And, that makes it really feel

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:25.866
like part of the AR scene.

00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:28.796
So, screen space text is a great

00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:30.096
way to label things, put some

00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:32.646
annotations into AR, but still

00:14:32.646 --> 00:14:33.946
make them really readable.

00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:37.166
So, here's an example of screen

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:37.626
space text.

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:39.906
And, this is from Measure, which

00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:41.126
is part of iOS 12.

00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:43.046
When Measure shows the

00:14:43.046 --> 00:14:44.616
measurements, it shows them in

00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:45.626
screen space.

00:14:45.796 --> 00:14:47.046
So, no matter what angle you're

00:14:47.046 --> 00:14:48.016
looking at those measurements

00:14:48.016 --> 00:14:49.866
from, or how far away you are,

00:14:50.546 --> 00:14:51.756
they're always incredibly

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:51.976
readable.

00:14:56.576 --> 00:14:59.126
So, screen space text is great

00:14:59.126 --> 00:14:59.956
for readability.

00:15:00.726 --> 00:15:01.766
But, you should still try and

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:03.376
keep how much text it is that

00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:04.946
you're actually showing in AR to

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.606
as little as possible.

00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:08.756
And, the reasons for that is

00:15:08.756 --> 00:15:10.126
when text is placed in the

00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:12.226
world, you always have to keep

00:15:12.226 --> 00:15:13.866
pointing your device at it in

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:14.546
order to read it.

00:15:15.156 --> 00:15:16.346
If you turn your device to a

00:15:16.346 --> 00:15:17.776
more natural reading position,

00:15:18.266 --> 00:15:19.536
the text is going to go away.

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.916
So, if you have more detailed

00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:24.376
text, if you're showing details

00:15:24.806 --> 00:15:26.126
about some kind of object, or

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:27.756
something in the world, you

00:15:27.756 --> 00:15:29.446
should show those details on the

00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:30.126
display.

00:15:30.206 --> 00:15:31.746
And then, people can use all

00:15:31.746 --> 00:15:33.456
that experience that they built

00:15:33.456 --> 00:15:35.996
up using iOS and reading things

00:15:35.996 --> 00:15:38.636
on their devices, to read those

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:40.546
details directly on the display.

00:15:41.926 --> 00:15:43.166
And, when you're showing those

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:44.276
details, when you're coming out

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.146
of AR, it's important to have a

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:46.896
transition.

00:15:47.596 --> 00:15:48.916
Because those transitions can

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:51.016
make it really clear what it is

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:51.706
you're looking at.

00:15:52.246 --> 00:15:55.066
What text, what object it is

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.786
that those details are

00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:57.456
referencing.

00:15:57.786 --> 00:15:58.886
What it is that you're getting

00:15:58.886 --> 00:15:59.706
details about.

00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:02.526
So, let's look at an example

00:16:02.526 --> 00:16:02.866
there.

00:16:02.986 --> 00:16:04.476
And, this is also from Measure.

00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:07.666
In Measure, when you tap on a

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.796
measurement, it comes out of AR

00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:11.076
to show the details about that

00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:13.256
measurement flat on the screen.

00:16:13.256 --> 00:16:15.396
And that's great because it's

00:16:15.396 --> 00:16:16.076
really easy to read.

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:17.626
You don't have to point your

00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:19.126
device or your phone at the

00:16:19.126 --> 00:16:20.616
measurement in order to read it.

00:16:21.026 --> 00:16:22.396
But, it's also really clear,

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:23.826
because of the transitions.

00:16:24.446 --> 00:16:27.746
The transitions show you what

00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:29.966
measurement it is that you're

00:16:29.966 --> 00:16:31.246
looking at details for.

00:16:31.706 --> 00:16:32.786
And, they comes out of the

00:16:32.786 --> 00:16:34.136
measurement, so you're never

00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:35.186
going to be confused.

00:16:37.046 --> 00:16:38.366
So, transitions.

00:16:38.466 --> 00:16:40.036
They're really great when you're

00:16:40.036 --> 00:16:42.006
coming out of AR, and going back

00:16:42.006 --> 00:16:44.086
into AR, for showing details on

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:44.756
the display.

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:46.616
But, they're also really

00:16:46.616 --> 00:16:47.916
important when you're just

00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:49.206
showing objects in AR.

00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:51.236
And, that's because it makes it

00:16:51.236 --> 00:16:53.356
feel like there's one version of

00:16:53.356 --> 00:16:53.996
the object.

00:16:54.516 --> 00:16:55.946
It makes it feel like that

00:16:55.946 --> 00:16:57.706
object has its own identity.

00:16:57.826 --> 00:17:00.186
And, that's important, because

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.996
things in AR are so physical.

00:17:02.346 --> 00:17:04.165
They have that physical sense.

00:17:04.506 --> 00:17:05.925
When you see them in AR, they

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:06.516
look real.

00:17:07.306 --> 00:17:08.546
And, things in reality, you

00:17:08.546 --> 00:17:09.455
can't just copy them.

00:17:09.455 --> 00:17:10.516
You can't just make multiple

00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:11.036
copies.

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:13.086
So, it's important to keep that

00:17:13.086 --> 00:17:14.606
same principle when you're

00:17:14.606 --> 00:17:16.056
showing objects in AR.

00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:18.816
So, this is what happens when

00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:20.366
you Quicklook at objects in AR.

00:17:21.276 --> 00:17:22.856
And, it shows a great example of

00:17:22.925 --> 00:17:23.915
keeping that identity.

00:17:24.496 --> 00:17:25.566
When you switch from the object

00:17:25.566 --> 00:17:28.096
tab to the AR tab, the object

00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:29.006
stays in place.

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:30.366
It always stays visible.

00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:31.856
It doesn't disappear and then

00:17:31.856 --> 00:17:32.846
come from somewhere else.

00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:35.086
And, even when you're deciding

00:17:35.086 --> 00:17:36.586
where to place the object here,

00:17:37.546 --> 00:17:39.576
it always stays visible on the

00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:40.186
display.

00:17:40.616 --> 00:17:42.446
So, it's really easy to see that

00:17:42.446 --> 00:17:43.546
there's one version of this

00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:43.996
object.

00:17:44.916 --> 00:17:46.446
And, even when you go back into

00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:47.726
the app that you were

00:17:47.726 --> 00:17:50.166
Quicklooking the object from, it

00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:51.906
still shows the object

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.076
transitioning back to where it

00:17:53.076 --> 00:17:53.666
came from.

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:55.136
So, it feels like there's one

00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:57.156
object moving between different

00:17:57.156 --> 00:17:58.156
parts of your app.

00:17:58.486 --> 00:17:59.636
And then, into the world, and

00:17:59.636 --> 00:18:00.516
back out of the world.

00:18:00.866 --> 00:18:01.906
It doesn't feel like there's

00:18:01.906 --> 00:18:02.726
multiple copies.

00:18:03.126 --> 00:18:06.506
Alright. So, that was a bunch of

00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:09.086
information in a row about the

00:18:09.086 --> 00:18:10.006
different ways that you can

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.476
present your content in AR.

00:18:12.546 --> 00:18:13.766
So, let's do a quick recap of

00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:14.066
that.

00:18:15.046 --> 00:18:16.586
So, first, we looked at the

00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:17.996
different ways you can make AR

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:19.806
experiences, and we talked about

00:18:20.096 --> 00:18:21.986
using AR to create entirely 2D

00:18:21.986 --> 00:18:23.766
experiences, with no camera

00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:25.296
preview, and no 3D graphics.

00:18:26.536 --> 00:18:28.546
We talked about how VR can be a

00:18:28.546 --> 00:18:30.136
great way to build experiences

00:18:30.136 --> 00:18:31.876
with ARKit, and make you feel

00:18:31.876 --> 00:18:33.486
like you're somewhere else, that

00:18:33.816 --> 00:18:35.196
can be really powerful and

00:18:35.196 --> 00:18:35.926
really immersive.

00:18:37.186 --> 00:18:38.446
We talked about using screen

00:18:38.446 --> 00:18:41.406
space to show text in AR, to

00:18:41.406 --> 00:18:43.586
make it really readable from any

00:18:43.586 --> 00:18:45.416
angle, and readable from any

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:45.876
distance.

00:18:47.186 --> 00:18:48.226
We talked about showing your

00:18:48.226 --> 00:18:50.576
details on the screen, so that

00:18:50.576 --> 00:18:51.516
they're easy to read without

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:53.406
pointing your device at some

00:18:53.406 --> 00:18:55.036
specific place in the world.

00:18:55.116 --> 00:18:57.396
And that you can use all of that

00:18:57.396 --> 00:18:58.546
same knowledge that you've built

00:18:58.546 --> 00:19:00.336
up reading things on iOS.

00:19:01.046 --> 00:19:03.566
And finally, we talked about

00:19:03.566 --> 00:19:05.766
transitioning into AR, and out

00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:08.436
of AR, for showing details flat

00:19:08.436 --> 00:19:09.266
on the display.

00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:11.066
But, also to give objects that

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:12.676
sense of identity, that sense of

00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:14.826
physicality that's so important

00:19:14.826 --> 00:19:14.976
in AR.

00:19:19.516 --> 00:19:21.246
Alright. So, that's presenting

00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:22.026
content in AR.

00:19:22.026 --> 00:19:23.196
So, different ways that you can

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:23.916
present it.

00:19:23.916 --> 00:19:25.726
And some tips for different

00:19:26.136 --> 00:19:27.246
types of content that you're

00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:28.586
going to want to show in your AR

00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:28.936
apps.

00:19:30.226 --> 00:19:31.906
Now, let's talk about how we can

00:19:31.906 --> 00:19:33.636
interact with that content.

00:19:33.636 --> 00:19:35.006
Let's talk about interactions

00:19:35.366 --> 00:19:36.736
that make sense in the world.

00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:39.666
And, let's start with touch,

00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:41.786
because touch has been really

00:19:41.786 --> 00:19:43.646
important all the way back to

00:19:43.646 --> 00:19:44.876
the beginning of iOS.

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:46.636
Multi-touch was there right from

00:19:46.636 --> 00:19:48.286
the start, and it's been the

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:49.836
most important way to interact

00:19:49.836 --> 00:19:50.586
with our devices.

00:19:51.706 --> 00:19:53.026
And the reason touch is so

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.386
important, the reason touch is

00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:56.506
so great, is that it enables

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:57.606
direct manipulation.

00:19:58.106 --> 00:20:00.586
And, direct manipulation is when

00:20:00.586 --> 00:20:02.116
you interact directly with

00:20:02.116 --> 00:20:03.606
things on the screen, like

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:04.956
they're physical objects.

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:07.396
You're not using controls to

00:20:07.646 --> 00:20:09.386
scroll or to pinch to zoom.

00:20:09.696 --> 00:20:11.036
You're interacting directly with

00:20:11.036 --> 00:20:11.696
the content.

00:20:12.136 --> 00:20:13.126
It's like there's a physical

00:20:13.126 --> 00:20:14.826
thing that you're manipulating.

00:20:15.346 --> 00:20:17.646
And, that's even more important

00:20:17.646 --> 00:20:18.286
in AR.

00:20:18.696 --> 00:20:20.486
Because in AR, as I said before,

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:21.876
things are really physical.

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:23.306
Objects feel like they're real.

00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:25.506
They feel like part of the real

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:25.966
world.

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:28.286
So, it's really important to use

00:20:28.286 --> 00:20:29.866
direct manipulation to make it

00:20:29.866 --> 00:20:30.926
feel like you're interacting

00:20:30.926 --> 00:20:32.726
directly with those objects.

00:20:34.336 --> 00:20:36.226
And, direct manipulation is also

00:20:36.226 --> 00:20:38.496
great because it uses gestures

00:20:38.556 --> 00:20:40.166
that you already know, that you

00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:41.716
have experience with from iOS.

00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:44.226
Because those gestures will be

00:20:44.226 --> 00:20:46.116
the same as any other content on

00:20:46.116 --> 00:20:46.326
iOS.

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:48.456
They're things that you've been

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.396
using for probably a long time.

00:20:50.876 --> 00:20:53.836
So, the first one there is how

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:56.036
you can move objects in AR with

00:20:56.036 --> 00:20:57.056
direct manipulation.

00:20:57.566 --> 00:20:59.246
If you want to move objects, you

00:20:59.246 --> 00:21:00.256
just put your finger down and

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:01.516
drag them to a new place.

00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:02.756
And, it feels like you're

00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:04.526
picking up the object, because

00:21:04.526 --> 00:21:05.716
it stays under your finger.

00:21:05.716 --> 00:21:07.346
You get this physical connection

00:21:07.346 --> 00:21:08.796
to the thing that you're moving.

00:21:11.216 --> 00:21:13.606
Another gesture you can do, is

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:14.796
scaling objects.

00:21:15.346 --> 00:21:17.226
So, in AR, things start out at

00:21:17.226 --> 00:21:18.466
their physical size, at their

00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:19.506
natural size.

00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:21.146
But, if you want to change that,

00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:22.736
you can pinch the object to make

00:21:22.736 --> 00:21:23.216
it bigger.

00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:24.766
And, you can pinch out on the

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:25.836
object if you want to make it

00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:26.376
smaller.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.246
The important things to think

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:29.206
about when you're scaling

00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:31.176
objects in AR, is to give some

00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:32.436
feedback when you're doing it.

00:21:32.836 --> 00:21:34.016
Because the change is really,

00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:35.406
really big when you take an

00:21:35.406 --> 00:21:36.796
object and scale it up to 4

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.666
times the size.

00:21:38.496 --> 00:21:40.036
So, it's important to give

00:21:40.036 --> 00:21:41.466
people feedback, so they

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.726
absolutely know what happened.

00:21:43.626 --> 00:21:44.996
And, the second thing is to make

00:21:44.996 --> 00:21:47.056
it really easy to go -- to take

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:48.636
the object back to its natural

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:49.146
size.

00:21:49.526 --> 00:21:50.536
Back to the size that it would

00:21:50.536 --> 00:21:51.846
be in the physical world.

00:21:52.236 --> 00:21:54.496
So, you can snap back to 100%,

00:21:54.886 --> 00:21:56.186
maybe with a haptic, to make

00:21:56.186 --> 00:21:56.966
that really easy.

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:01.316
Another thing you can do is

00:22:01.396 --> 00:22:03.366
rotate objects, by putting two

00:22:03.366 --> 00:22:04.946
fingers on the display, and

00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:06.036
twisting to rotate.

00:22:07.036 --> 00:22:08.296
And, that can be really great,

00:22:08.296 --> 00:22:09.606
but with all of these two finger

00:22:09.606 --> 00:22:11.286
gestures, another thing you

00:22:11.286 --> 00:22:12.986
should think about is your tap

00:22:12.986 --> 00:22:13.546
targets.

00:22:14.186 --> 00:22:15.866
Because things in AR are always

00:22:15.866 --> 00:22:16.786
moving as you're moving the

00:22:16.786 --> 00:22:18.586
device, and they can get really

00:22:18.586 --> 00:22:20.086
small if you get further away,

00:22:20.086 --> 00:22:21.206
or if you scale them down.

00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:22.546
You should make sure to use

00:22:22.706 --> 00:22:24.406
really generous tap targets.

00:22:24.826 --> 00:22:26.096
So, it's easy to land two

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:27.396
fingers on the object.

00:22:28.076 --> 00:22:29.556
And, be sure to use the center

00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:31.656
of those two finger touch

00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:33.406
positions to figure out which

00:22:33.406 --> 00:22:34.526
object to interact with.

00:22:34.876 --> 00:22:35.826
Because you might not be able to

00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:38.156
land two whole fingers, even on

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:39.766
a generous tap target in AR.

00:22:40.266 --> 00:22:43.676
Alright, so direct manipulation

00:22:43.676 --> 00:22:45.126
is really great in AR.

00:22:45.126 --> 00:22:46.806
It's really important because AR

00:22:46.806 --> 00:22:47.536
is so physical.

00:22:48.436 --> 00:22:50.686
But, it's also not quite enough

00:22:50.686 --> 00:22:51.696
for most AR apps.

00:22:51.696 --> 00:22:53.346
Because if you have a lot of

00:22:53.346 --> 00:22:54.406
objects, it can make it hard to

00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:55.376
touch the right one.

00:22:55.716 --> 00:22:56.936
As I said before, the objects

00:22:56.936 --> 00:22:59.366
are always moving on the display

00:22:59.366 --> 00:23:00.296
as you're looking at different

00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:01.166
places in the world.

00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:02.456
And, they're staying fixed to

00:23:02.456 --> 00:23:03.446
that place in the world.

00:23:03.446 --> 00:23:05.256
So, it can be a little hard to

00:23:05.316 --> 00:23:07.096
aim for those objects on the

00:23:07.096 --> 00:23:07.666
screen.

00:23:08.426 --> 00:23:10.786
But, the fundamental reason, the

00:23:10.786 --> 00:23:12.226
number one reason, the real

00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:15.206
reason that touch is not enough

00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:17.266
for AR apps, is that it's

00:23:17.266 --> 00:23:18.826
fundamentally two-dimensional.

00:23:19.536 --> 00:23:20.846
The surface of the display is

00:23:20.846 --> 00:23:22.006
two-dimensional, and you're

00:23:22.006 --> 00:23:23.236
touching on that surface.

00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:25.126
That is what made it so great,

00:23:25.126 --> 00:23:27.566
multi-touch so great for flat,

00:23:27.566 --> 00:23:28.936
2D apps in iOS.

00:23:29.596 --> 00:23:31.376
But, AR content, it's placed

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:32.026
into the world.

00:23:32.026 --> 00:23:33.226
It's part of the world.

00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:35.856
So, that means we need some way

00:23:35.856 --> 00:23:37.266
to interact with that content

00:23:37.636 --> 00:23:38.846
also in three dimensions.

00:23:38.966 --> 00:23:40.196
Because the world is

00:23:40.196 --> 00:23:40.866
three-dimensional.

00:23:42.576 --> 00:23:44.566
The answer there is moving your

00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:45.186
device.

00:23:45.646 --> 00:23:47.026
Because moving your device, it's

00:23:47.026 --> 00:23:48.436
natively three-dimensional.

00:23:48.796 --> 00:23:49.686
It's three-dimensional

00:23:49.686 --> 00:23:50.286
inherently.

00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:51.966
You can move up and down.

00:23:52.176 --> 00:23:53.126
You can move left and right.

00:23:53.126 --> 00:23:54.826
You can move forward and back.

00:23:55.136 --> 00:23:56.506
You can turn in all directions.

00:23:56.506 --> 00:23:58.446
You can stand up and move across

00:23:58.486 --> 00:23:59.826
the room if you want to go a

00:23:59.826 --> 00:24:00.666
little bit further.

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:03.746
But, the important part is that

00:24:03.746 --> 00:24:05.446
moving your device is fully

00:24:05.446 --> 00:24:06.236
three-dimensional, and that

00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.676
really makes it the number one,

00:24:07.676 --> 00:24:09.756
the primary interaction in AR.

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:12.506
In fact, I would say that moving

00:24:12.506 --> 00:24:14.166
your device is more important

00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:17.096
than touch for AR apps.

00:24:17.146 --> 00:24:18.766
In fact, it's so natural, it's

00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:21.356
built in to every AR app by

00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:21.886
default.

00:24:22.376 --> 00:24:23.156
The way that you look at

00:24:23.156 --> 00:24:24.726
different things in AR is by

00:24:24.726 --> 00:24:26.676
moving your device to look at it

00:24:26.676 --> 00:24:27.886
from different angles, and

00:24:27.886 --> 00:24:28.726
different positions.

00:24:29.326 --> 00:24:31.206
So, it's really natural, and

00:24:31.206 --> 00:24:32.506
it's also really powerful.

00:24:34.176 --> 00:24:35.506
And, moving your device, it

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:37.066
accomplishes many of the things

00:24:37.436 --> 00:24:38.766
that you would have done in a 2D

00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:40.746
app by using multi-touch.

00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:42.846
So, in a 2D app, if you want to

00:24:42.846 --> 00:24:44.756
see more content, the way you do

00:24:44.756 --> 00:24:45.996
that is by scrolling on the

00:24:45.996 --> 00:24:46.646
display.

00:24:46.966 --> 00:24:48.446
You scroll down to see something

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:48.726
new.

00:24:49.696 --> 00:24:51.206
And, that's great in a 2D app,

00:24:51.956 --> 00:24:54.656
but in AR, you do that in 3D.

00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:56.456
You see different content, by

00:24:56.456 --> 00:24:59.006
moving your device to look at

00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:00.326
the content from different

00:25:00.326 --> 00:25:01.806
positions, and from different

00:25:01.806 --> 00:25:02.266
angles.

00:25:02.836 --> 00:25:04.586
So, it solves that same problem

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.196
of wanting to see more, but it

00:25:06.196 --> 00:25:07.376
solves it fully in three

00:25:07.376 --> 00:25:07.996
dimensions.

00:25:09.396 --> 00:25:11.096
Similarly, in a traditional 2D

00:25:11.096 --> 00:25:11.956
app, if you want to see

00:25:11.956 --> 00:25:13.786
something bigger, you pinch in

00:25:13.786 --> 00:25:14.696
on it to make it bigger.

00:25:14.696 --> 00:25:15.676
You pinch to zoom.

00:25:16.026 --> 00:25:17.806
If you want to see it smaller,

00:25:18.136 --> 00:25:19.216
you pinch out.

00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:21.126
You pinch to zoom out.

00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:24.096
But, in AR, if you want to see

00:25:24.096 --> 00:25:25.546
something bigger, you can just

00:25:25.546 --> 00:25:26.666
get closer to the thing you're

00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:27.106
looking at.

00:25:27.106 --> 00:25:28.346
You can just move closer in.

00:25:28.346 --> 00:25:30.116
And, if you want to see more

00:25:30.116 --> 00:25:31.716
things at once, you want to see

00:25:31.716 --> 00:25:34.046
things from a wider angle, you

00:25:34.046 --> 00:25:35.976
can just take a step back, and

00:25:35.976 --> 00:25:37.156
look at all of the content at

00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:37.516
once.

00:25:38.646 --> 00:25:41.426
So, moving your device, it also

00:25:41.426 --> 00:25:42.906
replaces what you might have

00:25:42.906 --> 00:25:44.546
done by pinch to zoom to see

00:25:44.546 --> 00:25:47.816
more content in a 2D

00:25:47.816 --> 00:25:48.536
application.

00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:52.116
So, movement is really great.

00:25:52.116 --> 00:25:53.756
It can replace some of those

00:25:53.756 --> 00:25:54.596
things you might have used

00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:55.506
multi-touch for.

00:25:56.056 --> 00:25:57.846
You can also use it to build

00:25:57.846 --> 00:26:00.396
totally custom interactions for

00:26:00.396 --> 00:26:01.026
your AR apps.

00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:02.786
And, those can be really

00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:03.326
natural.

00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:05.456
Just like using your device to

00:26:05.456 --> 00:26:06.736
look around at different things,

00:26:06.736 --> 00:26:07.766
or to get closer and further

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:08.186
away.

00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:09.856
So, let's take a look at an

00:26:09.856 --> 00:26:10.726
example of that.

00:26:11.426 --> 00:26:12.886
This is Swiftshot, the

00:26:12.886 --> 00:26:14.576
multiplayer AR sample game that

00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:15.506
you might have seen in the

00:26:15.506 --> 00:26:16.306
Keynote, or you might have

00:26:16.306 --> 00:26:16.996
actually tried it.

00:26:17.806 --> 00:26:19.556
In order to fire a slingshot in

00:26:19.556 --> 00:26:21.246
Swiftshot, the way you do it is

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:22.586
you move close to that

00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:23.136
slingshot.

00:26:23.546 --> 00:26:24.266
You don't have to pick which

00:26:24.266 --> 00:26:25.296
slingshot you're going to fire

00:26:25.296 --> 00:26:25.976
from a list.

00:26:26.346 --> 00:26:27.296
You don't have to reach out and

00:26:27.296 --> 00:26:28.256
try and aim for it on the

00:26:28.256 --> 00:26:28.726
screen.

00:26:29.036 --> 00:26:30.906
You just move close to it, and

00:26:30.906 --> 00:26:31.716
when you want to fire the

00:26:31.716 --> 00:26:33.516
slingshot, you just pull back

00:26:33.516 --> 00:26:34.016
and release.

00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:37.046
So, it's incredibly precise,

00:26:37.046 --> 00:26:38.516
because you can fire in three

00:26:38.836 --> 00:26:39.386
dimensions.

00:26:39.386 --> 00:26:40.366
You have three dimensions of

00:26:40.366 --> 00:26:41.976
precision while you're moving

00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:42.886
that slingshot, while you're

00:26:42.886 --> 00:26:43.546
pulling it back.

00:26:44.256 --> 00:26:45.406
And, that's more than you could

00:26:45.406 --> 00:26:47.156
ever do using touch.

00:26:47.686 --> 00:26:49.196
So, moving your device, it's not

00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:50.786
only really natural, but it's

00:26:50.786 --> 00:26:52.866
also more precise than you could

00:26:52.866 --> 00:26:57.836
ever do using touch in AR apps.

00:26:58.046 --> 00:26:59.756
So, moving your device is great,

00:27:00.076 --> 00:27:01.906
but sometimes we need to combine

00:27:02.016 --> 00:27:04.026
the best of touch and the best

00:27:04.026 --> 00:27:05.926
of device movement to create the

00:27:05.926 --> 00:27:07.336
absolute best interactions.

00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:09.956
So, let's look at some examples

00:27:09.956 --> 00:27:10.326
of that.

00:27:10.326 --> 00:27:12.226
And, let's start with combining

00:27:12.226 --> 00:27:14.626
direct manipulation with moving

00:27:15.306 --> 00:27:16.546
your device.

00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:19.086
So, Quicklook in AR also offers

00:27:19.086 --> 00:27:20.936
a great example of combining

00:27:20.936 --> 00:27:23.166
device movement and direct

00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:25.216
manipulation in AR.

00:27:26.126 --> 00:27:27.386
If you want to move an object,

00:27:27.386 --> 00:27:29.056
of course, you can just drag it

00:27:29.056 --> 00:27:30.736
to the new position, the same as

00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:31.596
you saw before.

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:33.116
Touch on the screen and move it

00:27:33.116 --> 00:27:33.906
to a new place.

00:27:34.436 --> 00:27:35.886
But, you could also touch down

00:27:35.886 --> 00:27:37.706
to pick up the object and then

00:27:37.706 --> 00:27:39.586
turn the device and release in a

00:27:39.586 --> 00:27:40.156
new place.

00:27:40.286 --> 00:27:42.336
And, that's great, because it

00:27:42.336 --> 00:27:43.076
gives you the full

00:27:43.076 --> 00:27:44.736
three-dimensional control of

00:27:44.736 --> 00:27:46.016
moving your device to pick where

00:27:46.016 --> 00:27:46.806
you're going to place it.

00:27:46.806 --> 00:27:49.226
And, it lets you move objects to

00:27:49.226 --> 00:27:50.586
places that you can't see on the

00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:52.316
screen, by picking them up and

00:27:52.316 --> 00:27:52.716
turning.

00:27:52.716 --> 00:27:54.896
But, it still keeps that sense

00:27:54.896 --> 00:27:56.126
of physical interaction.

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:57.266
That sense of direct

00:27:57.266 --> 00:27:59.666
manipulation that you had from

00:27:59.666 --> 00:28:01.166
picking up the object directly.

00:28:01.696 --> 00:28:04.006
So, if you support any kind of

00:28:04.006 --> 00:28:06.086
moving objects in AR in your

00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:07.916
apps, you should definitely

00:28:07.916 --> 00:28:09.786
support picking up an object

00:28:09.946 --> 00:28:11.526
with direct manipulation, and

00:28:11.526 --> 00:28:13.586
moving the device to find a new

00:28:13.586 --> 00:28:17.726
place to put it.

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:20.686
Alright. So, moving your device

00:28:20.686 --> 00:28:22.016
and direct manipulation is one

00:28:22.016 --> 00:28:23.356
way to combine touch.

00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:25.766
But another way to combine touch

00:28:25.766 --> 00:28:27.386
with moving your device is

00:28:27.386 --> 00:28:28.826
through indirect controls.

00:28:29.006 --> 00:28:30.746
And, what I mean by indirect

00:28:30.746 --> 00:28:31.736
controls, are controls that are

00:28:31.736 --> 00:28:33.176
flat on the display.

00:28:33.856 --> 00:28:35.246
They're not placed in the world.

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:36.006
They're not attached to

00:28:36.006 --> 00:28:36.526
anything.

00:28:36.866 --> 00:28:38.466
They're in a consistent position

00:28:38.466 --> 00:28:40.176
on the display, and you can

00:28:40.176 --> 00:28:41.176
learn that position.

00:28:41.496 --> 00:28:42.566
And, that's really great,

00:28:42.566 --> 00:28:43.576
because that means they get out

00:28:43.576 --> 00:28:44.156
of the way.

00:28:44.496 --> 00:28:45.256
Once you've learned that

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.936
position of that control on the

00:28:46.936 --> 00:28:49.336
display, it stays in one place.

00:28:49.336 --> 00:28:50.586
You can rest your finger above

00:28:50.586 --> 00:28:51.986
it while you're speeding your

00:28:51.986 --> 00:28:54.036
time focusing on the rest of the

00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:54.326
app.

00:28:54.326 --> 00:28:56.846
So, let's look at an example of

00:28:56.846 --> 00:28:57.336
that.

00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.416
Here's Zombie Gunship AR.

00:28:59.936 --> 00:29:01.996
You're flying in a gunship above

00:29:01.996 --> 00:29:03.616
a horde of zombies, and you

00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:04.496
really need to aim at them.

00:29:04.496 --> 00:29:05.706
You want to focus on aiming.

00:29:05.706 --> 00:29:07.156
You don't want to focus on

00:29:07.416 --> 00:29:08.516
moving your finger, trying to

00:29:08.516 --> 00:29:09.486
figure out where you need to aim

00:29:09.486 --> 00:29:11.126
your finger on the display in

00:29:11.126 --> 00:29:12.476
order to fire.

00:29:13.056 --> 00:29:14.866
Instead, you can just rest your

00:29:14.866 --> 00:29:16.376
finger above the fire button,

00:29:16.806 --> 00:29:18.586
and spend all of your time using

00:29:18.586 --> 00:29:20.256
that full 3D precision of moving

00:29:20.256 --> 00:29:22.116
your device in order to aim

00:29:22.116 --> 00:29:23.326
where it is you're firing, to

00:29:23.326 --> 00:29:24.356
aim at those zombies.

00:29:26.316 --> 00:29:28.686
So, indirect controls are really

00:29:28.686 --> 00:29:31.426
great combined with moving your

00:29:31.426 --> 00:29:31.836
device.

00:29:32.446 --> 00:29:33.716
But, they're also really great

00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:35.286
because they let apps work

00:29:35.286 --> 00:29:36.036
one-handed.

00:29:36.986 --> 00:29:39.256
In AR, no matter what, you

00:29:39.256 --> 00:29:42.106
always have to use one hand to

00:29:42.106 --> 00:29:43.056
control where it is that you're

00:29:43.056 --> 00:29:44.366
looking, at least one hand.

00:29:44.986 --> 00:29:45.806
So, if you want to build a

00:29:45.806 --> 00:29:47.916
one-handed AR experience, you're

00:29:47.916 --> 00:29:48.786
going to need to use really

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:50.356
reachable controls that are

00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:52.026
really easy to access.

00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:55.536
So, an example of that is

00:29:55.536 --> 00:29:55.936
Measure.

00:29:56.646 --> 00:29:57.786
Measure uses an indirect

00:29:57.786 --> 00:29:59.366
control, the plus button, the

00:29:59.406 --> 00:30:00.346
add button at the bottom of the

00:30:00.346 --> 00:30:01.976
screen to add points.

00:30:02.756 --> 00:30:04.696
And, that control is in a really

00:30:04.696 --> 00:30:05.566
reachable spot.

00:30:05.946 --> 00:30:07.086
So, even while you're using one

00:30:07.086 --> 00:30:09.026
hand to focus the reticle on the

00:30:09.026 --> 00:30:10.946
center of the screen, to

00:30:10.946 --> 00:30:11.906
precisely place your

00:30:11.906 --> 00:30:13.546
measurements, you can keep a

00:30:13.546 --> 00:30:15.046
finger placed above that plus

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.716
button to easily add your

00:30:16.716 --> 00:30:17.846
measurements, to easily place

00:30:17.846 --> 00:30:18.436
those points.

00:30:19.576 --> 00:30:22.096
So, using indirect controls can

00:30:22.096 --> 00:30:24.026
be a great way to make it not

00:30:24.026 --> 00:30:25.846
only easy to use AR experiences,

00:30:25.946 --> 00:30:31.286
but one-handed ones as well.

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.196
Alright. So, that's how to pick

00:30:33.196 --> 00:30:34.476
interactions for AR.

00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:36.566
You can use direct manipulation

00:30:36.866 --> 00:30:37.486
to give that sense of

00:30:37.486 --> 00:30:39.236
physicality, and physical

00:30:39.236 --> 00:30:40.006
interaction.

00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:41.716
You can move the device, the

00:30:41.856 --> 00:30:43.486
primary interaction in AR.

00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:45.056
And, you can use really

00:30:45.056 --> 00:30:47.086
reachable indirect controls to

00:30:47.086 --> 00:30:48.896
focus on the content, rather

00:30:48.896 --> 00:30:51.036
than on controls or buttons

00:30:51.036 --> 00:30:51.846
interacting with it.

00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:54.086
And, that's what I wanted to

00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:55.066
talk to you about today.

00:30:55.646 --> 00:30:57.626
Getting into AR, guiding people

00:30:57.626 --> 00:30:59.006
down the right path, and giving

00:30:59.006 --> 00:31:00.786
them that direct feedback that

00:31:00.786 --> 00:31:01.896
they're doing the right thing.

00:31:02.696 --> 00:31:03.706
The ways you can present your

00:31:03.706 --> 00:31:06.866
content in 2D and VR, and how

00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:08.826
you can show content to make it

00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:10.316
easy to read, and give objects

00:31:10.316 --> 00:31:11.436
that physical identity

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:13.006
transitioning in and out of AR.

00:31:13.846 --> 00:31:15.666
And, the interactions that you

00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:18.286
can use in the world, especially

00:31:18.506 --> 00:31:20.016
and primarily moving your

00:31:20.016 --> 00:31:20.646
device.

00:31:20.936 --> 00:31:23.276
So, now I want to bring up Omar,

00:31:23.276 --> 00:31:24.256
who's going to talk about making

00:31:24.256 --> 00:31:26.126
your models, your 3D models look

00:31:26.206 --> 00:31:27.376
really great in AR.

00:31:27.646 --> 00:31:27.976
Thank you.

00:31:28.516 --> 00:31:35.500
[ Applause ]

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:40.936
>> Thanks, Grant.

00:31:44.816 --> 00:31:45.726
Hey, everyone.

00:31:46.346 --> 00:31:47.916
I'm really excited to be up here

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:48.956
to talk about some best

00:31:48.956 --> 00:31:51.056
practices that you need to keep

00:31:51.056 --> 00:31:52.036
in mind while you're developing

00:31:52.036 --> 00:31:54.396
your content for your AR

00:31:54.396 --> 00:31:55.136
experiences.

00:31:55.386 --> 00:31:57.756
So, we have a lot of different

00:31:57.756 --> 00:31:58.786
pieces of information to cover

00:31:58.786 --> 00:31:59.156
today.

00:31:59.156 --> 00:32:00.896
And, whether you're an engineer,

00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:03.736
designer, manager, or an artist,

00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:05.816
we wanted to provide you with a

00:32:05.816 --> 00:32:08.046
utility belt of tactics and

00:32:08.046 --> 00:32:09.716
definitions, so that you are

00:32:10.296 --> 00:32:12.056
best equipped to craft your own

00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:13.696
exceptional AR contents to

00:32:13.696 --> 00:32:14.626
delight people with.

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.766
So, to begin with, let's start

00:32:17.766 --> 00:32:19.336
with some essential concepts to

00:32:19.336 --> 00:32:20.376
keep in mind while you're

00:32:20.376 --> 00:32:22.206
developing your AR experience.

00:32:22.756 --> 00:32:25.036
AR is incredible.

00:32:25.716 --> 00:32:27.176
Having the ability to take

00:32:27.176 --> 00:32:28.626
anything you can imagine, and

00:32:28.626 --> 00:32:29.966
place it into the real world is

00:32:30.056 --> 00:32:31.016
absolutely magical.

00:32:31.556 --> 00:32:32.826
And, because of this, people

00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.766
tend to expect a lot out of

00:32:34.766 --> 00:32:35.876
their AR experiences.

00:32:37.296 --> 00:32:39.326
They expect your 3D content to

00:32:39.406 --> 00:32:40.756
render at a smooth and

00:32:40.756 --> 00:32:41.586
consistent rate.

00:32:42.316 --> 00:32:43.756
It's incredibly distracting when

00:32:43.926 --> 00:32:44.946
you're really engaged with the

00:32:44.946 --> 00:32:46.776
content, and you start to move a

00:32:46.776 --> 00:32:49.086
bit closer to it, and then, you

00:32:49.086 --> 00:32:50.456
want to appreciate those fine

00:32:50.456 --> 00:32:51.956
details, and all of a sudden,

00:32:52.256 --> 00:32:52.626
wham!

00:32:53.456 --> 00:32:54.946
Poor optimization has caused

00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:56.616
performance to tank, and now

00:32:56.616 --> 00:32:57.446
it's as if you're watching a

00:32:57.446 --> 00:32:58.126
slideshow.

00:32:59.576 --> 00:33:01.936
So, to ensure your -- the most

00:33:01.936 --> 00:33:03.216
smoothest performance at all

00:33:03.216 --> 00:33:04.846
times, and to keep people fully

00:33:04.846 --> 00:33:07.456
engaged with your AR scene, your

00:33:07.456 --> 00:33:08.366
app needs to render at a

00:33:08.366 --> 00:33:10.066
recommended target of 60 frames

00:33:10.066 --> 00:33:10.576
per second.

00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:13.326
Now, it's really important to

00:33:13.326 --> 00:33:15.286
maintain this target throughout

00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:16.416
the entire experience.

00:33:16.416 --> 00:33:18.746
Really stress test your content.

00:33:19.086 --> 00:33:20.276
View it from every possible

00:33:20.276 --> 00:33:20.636
angle.

00:33:21.116 --> 00:33:22.636
You know, move in close, move

00:33:22.636 --> 00:33:24.006
back from it, and just make sure

00:33:24.006 --> 00:33:25.236
that the performance does not

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:25.876
ever degrade.

00:33:27.716 --> 00:33:29.566
You know, maybe someday in the

00:33:29.566 --> 00:33:31.046
future, batteries will run for

00:33:31.046 --> 00:33:31.326
days.

00:33:32.056 --> 00:33:33.336
But, today, make sure that your

00:33:33.336 --> 00:33:35.716
experience is able to have as

00:33:35.716 --> 00:33:37.146
minimal of an impact to battery

00:33:37.146 --> 00:33:38.326
life as possible.

00:33:39.086 --> 00:33:40.536
Don't give people the chance to

00:33:40.536 --> 00:33:41.976
blame your app for draining

00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:42.466
their battery.

00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:44.566
The more power you save, the

00:33:44.566 --> 00:33:45.666
more you want people to come

00:33:45.666 --> 00:33:46.906
back to your experience and try

00:33:46.906 --> 00:33:47.296
it again.

00:33:47.906 --> 00:33:50.476
I mean, I don't know about you,

00:33:50.476 --> 00:33:51.696
but whenever I see a battery

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:52.906
indicator in this stake, I

00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.136
seriously feel like I'm going to

00:33:54.136 --> 00:33:55.046
have a panic attack.

00:33:55.376 --> 00:33:56.516
And, we definitely don't want to

00:33:56.516 --> 00:33:57.896
have our AR experiences cause

00:33:58.006 --> 00:33:59.466
widespread battery chaos

00:33:59.686 --> 00:34:00.536
throughout the lands.

00:34:01.166 --> 00:34:03.876
Remember, only you can prevent

00:34:04.026 --> 00:34:05.166
excessive battery drain.

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:08.876
I like to look at AR as having

00:34:08.876 --> 00:34:10.216
the power to take anything you

00:34:10.216 --> 00:34:12.085
can imagine and to transport

00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:12.826
into the real world.

00:34:13.585 --> 00:34:14.866
People want to explore your

00:34:14.866 --> 00:34:16.826
content, so you definitely want

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:17.606
to bring your A game.

00:34:18.326 --> 00:34:19.755
Take the time to craft those

00:34:19.755 --> 00:34:21.286
nuanced details into your 3D

00:34:21.286 --> 00:34:21.786
content.

00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:23.786
Build a cohesive story and

00:34:23.786 --> 00:34:24.315
style.

00:34:24.356 --> 00:34:25.866
And, remember that every little

00:34:25.866 --> 00:34:27.456
detail, every little touch is an

00:34:27.456 --> 00:34:29.315
opportunity to surprise people.

00:34:30.896 --> 00:34:32.606
So, let's say we wanted to make

00:34:32.606 --> 00:34:34.485
an AR experience to be about an

00:34:34.485 --> 00:34:34.996
aquarium.

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:37.536
Even in its most abstract form,

00:34:37.536 --> 00:34:38.606
I think I would be really

00:34:38.606 --> 00:34:39.755
hard-pressed to find anybody who

00:34:39.755 --> 00:34:40.806
would believe that this

00:34:40.886 --> 00:34:42.176
marshmallow blob represents a

00:34:42.176 --> 00:34:42.585
fish.

00:34:43.585 --> 00:34:45.306
On a positive note, though, our

00:34:45.306 --> 00:34:46.406
app will pretty much rock the

00:34:46.406 --> 00:34:47.815
performance numbers if this

00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:49.056
little guy's flopping around.

00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:51.505
So, let's try that again.

00:34:52.806 --> 00:34:54.636
Ah, now this is much better.

00:34:55.356 --> 00:34:56.496
That is one properly

00:34:56.496 --> 00:34:57.386
dead-looking fish.

00:34:58.166 --> 00:34:59.856
See how it exhibits some nice

00:34:59.856 --> 00:35:01.416
details, that once it's running

00:35:01.416 --> 00:35:03.766
in AR will really want to entice

00:35:03.766 --> 00:35:05.036
people to move closer to it to

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:07.126
see all those nuanced details

00:35:07.126 --> 00:35:08.726
and explore its features.

00:35:09.376 --> 00:35:10.906
We should strive to maintain

00:35:10.906 --> 00:35:12.386
this level of quality with all

00:35:12.386 --> 00:35:13.446
the fishes swimming in our

00:35:13.446 --> 00:35:15.426
aquarium, or just floating in

00:35:15.426 --> 00:35:17.046
the top in this case.

00:35:17.836 --> 00:35:19.276
Finally, it's important to

00:35:19.276 --> 00:35:20.516
remember that people really want

00:35:20.516 --> 00:35:21.646
to use your app in a wide

00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:22.596
variety of environments.

00:35:23.006 --> 00:35:24.406
You want to avoid having your

00:35:24.406 --> 00:35:27.136
content stand out in real world

00:35:27.136 --> 00:35:29.136
locations where potentially the

00:35:29.136 --> 00:35:30.516
lighting ambient conditions

00:35:30.516 --> 00:35:31.816
could conflict with the story

00:35:31.816 --> 00:35:32.626
that you're trying to tell.

00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:34.856
So, when working with your

00:35:34.856 --> 00:35:36.416
assets, try to avoid using

00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:38.146
colors that are either too

00:35:38.146 --> 00:35:39.266
bright or too dark.

00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:40.846
And, make sure that you light

00:35:40.846 --> 00:35:42.206
your AR scene in a way that it

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.026
casts even lighting on all the

00:35:44.026 --> 00:35:45.416
objects that you're planning to

00:35:45.836 --> 00:35:46.966
render, and at no matter what

00:35:46.966 --> 00:35:48.046
angle you view them from.

00:35:49.066 --> 00:35:50.546
You want your AR content to work

00:35:50.546 --> 00:35:51.926
whether it's day or night.

00:35:52.486 --> 00:35:54.116
Now, spoiler alert, we're going

00:35:54.116 --> 00:35:55.406
to go over some really nice

00:35:55.406 --> 00:35:57.256
features in ARKit that will

00:35:57.256 --> 00:35:58.916
enable you to really delight

00:35:58.986 --> 00:36:00.476
people when they see your AR

00:36:00.476 --> 00:36:02.426
content blend and react

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.956
seamlessly to the real world

00:36:03.956 --> 00:36:04.426
environment.

00:36:06.196 --> 00:36:08.126
So, as you're building your AR

00:36:08.126 --> 00:36:10.196
content, one great tool to help

00:36:10.196 --> 00:36:11.486
evaluate your progress is by

00:36:11.486 --> 00:36:12.976
using one of our recent

00:36:12.976 --> 00:36:15.046
announced iOS 12 features, AR

00:36:15.046 --> 00:36:15.496
Quicklook.

00:36:15.496 --> 00:36:17.876
Throw some of your assets up on

00:36:17.876 --> 00:36:19.706
iCloud drive, view them using

00:36:19.706 --> 00:36:21.926
the Files app on iOS, and

00:36:21.926 --> 00:36:23.096
quickly have the ability to

00:36:23.096 --> 00:36:24.346
project it into AR.

00:36:24.986 --> 00:36:28.826
Heck, you can even show off your

00:36:28.826 --> 00:36:30.586
masterpiece by throwing it onto

00:36:30.586 --> 00:36:32.036
a website so that your friends

00:36:32.036 --> 00:36:33.396
can look it up, and you can view

00:36:33.396 --> 00:36:34.946
it anywhere, right from Safari.

00:36:35.746 --> 00:36:37.056
It's pretty awesome.

00:36:37.536 --> 00:36:38.796
Definitely go back and check out

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.296
the session with Dave and David,

00:36:40.366 --> 00:36:42.786
who go over details of best

00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:43.986
practices of how you use AR

00:36:43.986 --> 00:36:46.286
Quicklook, and I'm guarantee

00:36:46.286 --> 00:36:47.346
you, it'll probably change your

00:36:47.346 --> 00:36:48.236
life with how you develop your

00:36:48.236 --> 00:36:48.756
assets.

00:36:50.236 --> 00:36:52.316
So, now you've taken some time

00:36:52.316 --> 00:36:54.126
to consider what people expect

00:36:54.126 --> 00:36:55.896
from our AR experience, let's

00:36:55.936 --> 00:36:57.246
quickly plan out what type of

00:36:57.246 --> 00:36:58.516
app we're going to build today.

00:36:59.366 --> 00:37:00.196
You know, it's always a good

00:37:00.196 --> 00:37:02.046
idea to start thinking this

00:37:02.046 --> 00:37:03.836
through before you begin

00:37:03.936 --> 00:37:05.146
creating your 3D content.

00:37:05.846 --> 00:37:07.196
As knowing what you want to make

00:37:07.196 --> 00:37:08.926
will help narrow down how best

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:11.006
to optimize your content and

00:37:11.006 --> 00:37:12.666
your assets for AR.

00:37:13.316 --> 00:37:15.436
So, you're sitting at your desk,

00:37:15.436 --> 00:37:17.006
and suddenly you're struck by

00:37:17.006 --> 00:37:17.596
inspiration.

00:37:17.706 --> 00:37:19.146
You just came up with the most

00:37:19.146 --> 00:37:21.116
absolute brilliant AR experience

00:37:21.276 --> 00:37:21.506
ever.

00:37:22.336 --> 00:37:23.996
Alright? So, let's step back and

00:37:23.996 --> 00:37:25.326
ask ourselves a couple questions

00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:25.806
first.

00:37:26.516 --> 00:37:28.376
Does this experience really need

00:37:28.376 --> 00:37:29.556
to render hundreds of AR

00:37:29.556 --> 00:37:32.166
objects, or will we focus on a

00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:33.326
single hero asset?

00:37:34.636 --> 00:37:36.016
How much detail do we actually

00:37:36.016 --> 00:37:36.346
want?

00:37:36.346 --> 00:37:38.246
And, what graphical style best

00:37:38.246 --> 00:37:39.426
represents what we're trying to

00:37:39.426 --> 00:37:39.866
convey?

00:37:41.376 --> 00:37:42.546
Have we really paid attention to

00:37:42.546 --> 00:37:43.956
Grant earlier and are thinking

00:37:43.956 --> 00:37:45.536
about the level of interaction

00:37:45.536 --> 00:37:46.506
we want people to have with our

00:37:46.506 --> 00:37:47.116
experience?

00:37:47.806 --> 00:37:49.376
Having a clear answer to

00:37:49.376 --> 00:37:50.726
questions like these will help

00:37:50.776 --> 00:37:53.026
determine where best to put your

00:37:53.026 --> 00:37:54.256
rendering budget when you're

00:37:54.256 --> 00:37:55.726
developing your app.

00:37:56.856 --> 00:37:58.876
For example, imagine you're

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:00.036
building an AR experience

00:38:00.036 --> 00:38:01.676
similar to the IKEA Place app,

00:38:02.026 --> 00:38:02.996
where people can preview

00:38:02.996 --> 00:38:04.466
different pieces of furniture by

00:38:04.466 --> 00:38:06.366
being able to place them in

00:38:06.366 --> 00:38:08.056
their home, or in our case,

00:38:08.056 --> 00:38:09.056
outside on their patio.

00:38:09.776 --> 00:38:11.256
Now, the stars of the show are

00:38:11.256 --> 00:38:13.106
actually the different furniture

00:38:13.106 --> 00:38:14.776
pieces, so you need to present

00:38:14.776 --> 00:38:16.746
highly detailed objects that

00:38:16.806 --> 00:38:18.306
closely mirror the real world

00:38:18.646 --> 00:38:19.346
counterparts.

00:38:20.646 --> 00:38:22.346
In this case, it is a good idea

00:38:22.346 --> 00:38:23.976
to make sure that you spend a

00:38:23.976 --> 00:38:26.046
little extra time in your

00:38:26.046 --> 00:38:27.506
rendering budget on these single

00:38:27.506 --> 00:38:29.696
hero assets, because their level

00:38:29.696 --> 00:38:31.136
of quality can essentially make

00:38:31.136 --> 00:38:31.896
or break a sale.

00:38:32.556 --> 00:38:35.866
On the other hand, you decide

00:38:35.866 --> 00:38:36.776
that you've had enough of

00:38:36.776 --> 00:38:37.836
accidentally stepping on those

00:38:37.836 --> 00:38:40.766
little, tiny, plastic bricks of

00:38:40.766 --> 00:38:42.056
agonizing pain that your kids

00:38:42.056 --> 00:38:43.106
start laying around the house.

00:38:43.106 --> 00:38:44.716
So, in order to preserve your

00:38:44.716 --> 00:38:45.766
sanity, you build an AR

00:38:45.766 --> 00:38:46.796
experience so they can play

00:38:46.796 --> 00:38:47.726
around with as many of these

00:38:47.776 --> 00:38:48.936
blocks as they can possibly

00:38:48.936 --> 00:38:50.876
imagine, similar to Playgrounds

00:38:50.876 --> 00:38:51.116
AR.

00:38:51.636 --> 00:38:52.766
And, save yourself from ever

00:38:52.766 --> 00:38:54.116
having to experience brick pain

00:38:54.116 --> 00:38:54.406
again.

00:38:54.976 --> 00:38:56.596
In an app like this, where you

00:38:56.596 --> 00:38:57.466
potentially have a lot of

00:38:57.466 --> 00:38:58.446
objects being rendered and

00:38:58.446 --> 00:39:00.806
interacted with, you want to

00:39:00.806 --> 00:39:02.566
basically create very simple,

00:39:02.896 --> 00:39:04.886
low-poly models with a flat

00:39:04.886 --> 00:39:06.316
colorful material, so that you

00:39:06.316 --> 00:39:07.666
can have a ton of them onscreen,

00:39:07.666 --> 00:39:09.106
and still have really good

00:39:09.106 --> 00:39:09.696
performance.

00:39:10.246 --> 00:39:12.786
So, now that we've asked

00:39:12.786 --> 00:39:13.696
ourselves these important

00:39:13.696 --> 00:39:15.446
questions, it's time to set up

00:39:15.446 --> 00:39:16.366
our AR canvas.

00:39:16.766 --> 00:39:17.846
Just like painters like to set

00:39:17.846 --> 00:39:19.366
up their canvas in space before

00:39:19.366 --> 00:39:20.926
they begin work, we would like

00:39:20.926 --> 00:39:22.636
to have a couple suggestions of

00:39:22.636 --> 00:39:24.746
how to set up your project up

00:39:24.746 --> 00:39:25.856
front, in order to position

00:39:25.856 --> 00:39:27.566
yourself for optimal success.

00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:31.146
We are big fans of creating a

00:39:31.146 --> 00:39:32.366
focus square to determine where

00:39:32.366 --> 00:39:33.226
to start placing your AR

00:39:33.226 --> 00:39:33.686
content.

00:39:34.236 --> 00:39:35.676
And, if you're using SceneKit,

00:39:36.016 --> 00:39:36.876
right there on the bottom of the

00:39:36.876 --> 00:39:37.886
screen, you have the option to

00:39:37.886 --> 00:39:39.266
actually activate the statistics

00:39:39.266 --> 00:39:39.566
panel.

00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:41.446
This will allow you to see your

00:39:41.446 --> 00:39:42.616
current frames per second, as

00:39:42.616 --> 00:39:44.176
well as how many polygons there

00:39:44.176 --> 00:39:45.516
are visible on the screen at any

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:46.746
given time.

00:39:46.746 --> 00:39:47.656
Which should be very helpful as

00:39:47.656 --> 00:39:48.796
you start to build out your app

00:39:48.796 --> 00:39:49.866
and put all the different

00:39:49.866 --> 00:39:50.566
elements into it.

00:39:50.566 --> 00:39:53.576
So, now that we have a starter

00:39:53.576 --> 00:39:54.976
scene up and running, I was

00:39:54.976 --> 00:39:56.396
thinking, what will be a good

00:39:56.396 --> 00:39:58.686
example AR app to help get over

00:39:58.686 --> 00:39:59.566
these best practices?

00:40:00.426 --> 00:40:01.876
So, I'm not really an outdoorsy

00:40:01.876 --> 00:40:03.876
guy, but coming to California, I

00:40:03.876 --> 00:40:05.336
find that here a lot of people

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:05.506
are.

00:40:05.506 --> 00:40:07.086
So, I've been trying to connect

00:40:07.086 --> 00:40:07.646
with nature.

00:40:08.146 --> 00:40:09.776
You know, go camping, maybe make

00:40:09.776 --> 00:40:12.036
a campfire for once, and yet it

00:40:12.036 --> 00:40:13.196
really didn't happen.

00:40:13.196 --> 00:40:14.156
So, instead I thought, let's

00:40:14.156 --> 00:40:15.196
just throw it into an app, and

00:40:15.196 --> 00:40:15.806
see how it goes.

00:40:16.436 --> 00:40:18.386
And we're going to call it

00:40:18.386 --> 00:40:19.016
CampfiAR.

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:22.086
I know, it's perfect, right?

00:40:23.696 --> 00:40:24.956
Now, we can work on building out

00:40:25.046 --> 00:40:26.816
a detailed, single object, and

00:40:26.816 --> 00:40:28.126
bring all the joys of being

00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:29.456
outdoors without the fear of any

00:40:29.456 --> 00:40:31.376
of those bugs or fresh air.

00:40:34.096 --> 00:40:35.616
We decided to render with a

00:40:35.616 --> 00:40:37.396
stylized, semi-realistic, and

00:40:37.466 --> 00:40:38.506
playful graphical style.

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:41.126
And, apply unique details to the

00:40:41.126 --> 00:40:42.726
use of careful application of

00:40:42.726 --> 00:40:44.336
some key, physically-based

00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:45.346
material properties.

00:40:45.966 --> 00:40:47.796
These choices mean that we could

00:40:47.796 --> 00:40:48.946
potentially use a lot of

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.426
polygons to render the content

00:40:50.426 --> 00:40:52.526
on the screen, but why deprive

00:40:52.596 --> 00:40:53.986
people of the ability to spend

00:40:53.986 --> 00:40:55.296
multiple hours staring at our

00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:56.226
beautiful campfire?

00:40:56.876 --> 00:40:57.916
Let's avoid going down that

00:40:57.916 --> 00:40:58.896
route, and work towards

00:40:58.896 --> 00:41:00.486
optimizing our scene by using a

00:41:00.486 --> 00:41:01.896
few tricks of the trade.

00:41:03.256 --> 00:41:05.636
So, we'll begin by focusing on

00:41:05.636 --> 00:41:07.156
the foundational structure of 3D

00:41:07.156 --> 00:41:08.556
objects, the mesh.

00:41:09.086 --> 00:41:10.736
And describe the typical

00:41:10.736 --> 00:41:12.186
development flow that will allow

00:41:12.186 --> 00:41:13.736
you to create highly detailed

00:41:13.736 --> 00:41:15.636
models, but still maintain a low

00:41:15.636 --> 00:41:17.706
poly count for all the models in

00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:18.156
your scene.

00:41:18.946 --> 00:41:19.826
And, for those of you who might

00:41:19.826 --> 00:41:21.126
not know, poly count is

00:41:21.126 --> 00:41:22.336
essentially the number of

00:41:22.336 --> 00:41:24.086
polygons, typically triangles,

00:41:24.296 --> 00:41:25.496
that a mesh is composed of.

00:41:26.916 --> 00:41:28.046
So, one of the first things we

00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.806
like to do, is lay out the basic

00:41:29.806 --> 00:41:31.086
structure of an AR scene by

00:41:31.086 --> 00:41:32.636
using these simple meshes.

00:41:33.236 --> 00:41:34.676
We find using this type of

00:41:34.676 --> 00:41:35.876
white-boxing technique to be

00:41:35.876 --> 00:41:37.456
really helpful for testing out

00:41:37.456 --> 00:41:38.936
some basic interactions, as well

00:41:38.936 --> 00:41:41.056
as seeing how well the objects

00:41:41.156 --> 00:41:42.326
fit into the real world, what

00:41:42.326 --> 00:41:43.406
kind of scale are they at?

00:41:44.666 --> 00:41:45.796
You know, actually, I think this

00:41:45.796 --> 00:41:47.186
campfire looks really great.

00:41:47.186 --> 00:41:48.066
I think we're going to call it a

00:41:48.066 --> 00:41:48.716
day here.

00:41:49.046 --> 00:41:50.066
Let's just call this done and

00:41:50.066 --> 00:41:50.456
ship it.

00:41:50.646 --> 00:41:51.316
Thanks everyone.

00:41:51.316 --> 00:41:53.106
I'm off to the afterparty, and

00:41:53.586 --> 00:41:54.256
-- wait.

00:41:54.256 --> 00:41:55.826
So, that didn't look like a

00:41:55.826 --> 00:41:56.566
campfire to you guys?

00:41:57.476 --> 00:41:58.486
Oh, alright.

00:41:58.486 --> 00:41:59.226
Sorry. Really?

00:42:00.076 --> 00:42:02.276
My bad. Let's jump back to

00:42:02.276 --> 00:42:03.876
actually building out this

00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:04.626
campfire mesh.

00:42:05.246 --> 00:42:07.136
I want to give a quick high/low

00:42:07.136 --> 00:42:08.796
review of what a mesh is, and

00:42:08.796 --> 00:42:10.216
the basic data structures that

00:42:10.216 --> 00:42:10.786
comprise it.

00:42:11.536 --> 00:42:12.596
So, now you can think of a mesh

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.226
as being a collection of

00:42:14.516 --> 00:42:15.886
triangles that are arranged in

00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:17.536
3D space that will form a

00:42:17.536 --> 00:42:19.156
surface for you to apply

00:42:19.426 --> 00:42:20.116
materials on.

00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:22.486
And, the corners of these

00:42:22.486 --> 00:42:24.306
triangles are actually made up

00:42:24.306 --> 00:42:25.686
of points called vertices, which

00:42:25.686 --> 00:42:26.846
hold different pieces of

00:42:26.846 --> 00:42:28.736
information, such as its

00:42:28.736 --> 00:42:30.106
position in space, UV

00:42:30.106 --> 00:42:31.506
coordinates for texture

00:42:31.506 --> 00:42:33.116
application, as well as a very

00:42:33.116 --> 00:42:34.166
important property that we'll go

00:42:34.166 --> 00:42:35.956
over later called the normals.

00:42:35.956 --> 00:42:38.836
Well, since I got busted for

00:42:38.836 --> 00:42:40.356
trying to ship early, I wanted

00:42:40.356 --> 00:42:41.726
to redeem myself by building out

00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:43.356
one of the most gorgeous

00:42:43.636 --> 00:42:45.016
campfires in the world.

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:46.706
Take a look at the details of

00:42:46.706 --> 00:42:47.216
this camp.

00:42:47.536 --> 00:42:48.616
Look at that fish and those

00:42:48.706 --> 00:42:49.096
branches.

00:42:49.856 --> 00:42:51.126
You can see all the intricate

00:42:51.126 --> 00:42:52.996
details of the scales, as well

00:42:52.996 --> 00:42:53.976
as the etchings found on the

00:42:53.976 --> 00:42:54.266
bark.

00:42:55.296 --> 00:42:57.266
But, man, my performance has

00:42:57.266 --> 00:42:57.546
tanked.

00:42:58.116 --> 00:42:59.716
And, that poly count has gone up

00:42:59.716 --> 00:43:01.016
to almost about a million

00:43:01.016 --> 00:43:02.086
polygons for this screen.

00:43:02.906 --> 00:43:04.736
So, I'm already in hot water,

00:43:04.866 --> 00:43:06.466
and I don't want to get in any

00:43:06.466 --> 00:43:07.536
more trouble, so we better go

00:43:07.536 --> 00:43:08.406
back and fix this.

00:43:08.716 --> 00:43:09.706
As I'm concerned about the

00:43:09.706 --> 00:43:11.126
impact that this will have on

00:43:11.126 --> 00:43:12.846
battery life, as well as how

00:43:12.846 --> 00:43:14.226
people are able to perceive and

00:43:14.226 --> 00:43:15.616
interact with this AR scene.

00:43:16.116 --> 00:43:17.196
So, let's see what we can do to,

00:43:17.196 --> 00:43:18.466
kind of, help reduce the number

00:43:18.466 --> 00:43:19.246
of polygons here.

00:43:21.326 --> 00:43:22.656
Most 3D authoring tools have

00:43:22.656 --> 00:43:24.146
specific functions that make it

00:43:24.146 --> 00:43:25.796
easy for you to reduce the

00:43:25.796 --> 00:43:26.966
actual complexity of your

00:43:26.966 --> 00:43:27.466
models.

00:43:27.906 --> 00:43:29.336
Here, we've reduced the number

00:43:29.336 --> 00:43:31.266
of polygons associated with the

00:43:31.266 --> 00:43:32.996
high-density model of the fish.

00:43:33.956 --> 00:43:35.846
But, notice that, as we zoom in,

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:36.846
many of the details have been

00:43:36.846 --> 00:43:37.326
lost.

00:43:37.736 --> 00:43:38.616
But, don't fret.

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:40.246
We can use certain material

00:43:40.246 --> 00:43:41.406
properties later on that will

00:43:41.406 --> 00:43:42.286
bring back a lot of those

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.166
missing details.

00:43:43.866 --> 00:43:46.336
The key here is to build a solid

00:43:46.336 --> 00:43:48.116
foundational mesh that uses a

00:43:48.116 --> 00:43:49.766
minimal amount of polygons.

00:43:49.766 --> 00:43:51.086
So, let's put aside the

00:43:51.086 --> 00:43:52.166
high-density mesh for now.

00:43:52.166 --> 00:43:53.376
And, let's focus on building up

00:43:53.376 --> 00:43:54.686
this low-density mesh as we move

00:43:54.686 --> 00:43:55.056
forward.

00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:58.106
Alright, so I'll admit that this

00:43:58.226 --> 00:43:59.736
isn't looking quite as good as

00:43:59.736 --> 00:44:01.316
before, but man, you can take a

00:44:01.316 --> 00:44:02.206
look at that performance.

00:44:02.676 --> 00:44:03.876
Not only have you saved a crazy

00:44:03.876 --> 00:44:05.616
amount of overhead by reducing

00:44:05.616 --> 00:44:06.816
the number of polygons found on

00:44:06.816 --> 00:44:08.316
the screen, but we're able to

00:44:08.316 --> 00:44:10.416
add a bunch of 3D objects to

00:44:10.416 --> 00:44:12.276
this scene to make it even more

00:44:12.276 --> 00:44:12.916
robust.

00:44:13.716 --> 00:44:14.826
And, if you recall, in our

00:44:14.826 --> 00:44:16.346
previous high-density mesh, we

00:44:16.346 --> 00:44:17.866
were running at about 30 frames

00:44:17.866 --> 00:44:18.266
per second.

00:44:18.266 --> 00:44:19.536
But, now we're back to 60

00:44:19.536 --> 00:44:19.936
frames.

00:44:20.586 --> 00:44:22.666
And, we were close to about, I

00:44:22.666 --> 00:44:24.086
think about a million polygons,

00:44:24.086 --> 00:44:26.216
and now it's down to 9,000.

00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:27.406
This is incredible.

00:44:27.636 --> 00:44:29.416
Because of this, we are well on

00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:30.896
our way to having those

00:44:30.896 --> 00:44:31.906
performance specification that

00:44:31.906 --> 00:44:32.426
we desire.

00:44:32.426 --> 00:44:34.776
A really solid frame rate with

00:44:35.026 --> 00:44:36.546
minimal impact to the battery

00:44:36.546 --> 00:44:36.886
life.

00:44:37.396 --> 00:44:39.646
So, now that we have this

00:44:39.646 --> 00:44:41.506
optimized model in our campfire

00:44:41.506 --> 00:44:42.396
scene, let's see how we can

00:44:42.396 --> 00:44:44.026
bring back some of those details

00:44:44.026 --> 00:44:45.696
that we lost by working on what

00:44:45.696 --> 00:44:47.096
some of these different material

00:44:47.096 --> 00:44:49.086
properties and techniques that

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:50.586
will ensure that our model looks

00:44:50.866 --> 00:44:52.306
as good as possible while still

00:44:52.306 --> 00:44:53.666
maintaining that great level of

00:44:53.666 --> 00:44:54.156
performance.

00:44:54.156 --> 00:44:56.766
So, you may have heard this time

00:44:56.766 --> 00:44:57.786
before, physically-based

00:44:57.786 --> 00:44:59.256
rendering thrown about regarding

00:44:59.256 --> 00:45:00.246
modern 3D rendering.

00:45:00.496 --> 00:45:02.716
It's a pretty complex topic that

00:45:02.876 --> 00:45:03.916
will take a lot more time than

00:45:03.916 --> 00:45:05.486
we actually have in this session

00:45:05.486 --> 00:45:06.156
to go over.

00:45:06.576 --> 00:45:08.266
But, the basic concept describes

00:45:08.376 --> 00:45:09.856
the ability to take the

00:45:09.856 --> 00:45:11.356
application of your different

00:45:11.356 --> 00:45:12.796
material properties onto your

00:45:12.796 --> 00:45:14.766
mesh, in order to have it react

00:45:14.956 --> 00:45:16.666
realistically to the simulated

00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:18.866
lights found in your AR scene.

00:45:19.456 --> 00:45:20.546
And, moving forward, all the

00:45:20.546 --> 00:45:21.206
materials that we'll be

00:45:21.206 --> 00:45:22.696
discussing will conform to this

00:45:22.696 --> 00:45:23.436
shading technique.

00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:25.296
If you want further details

00:45:25.296 --> 00:45:26.376
about this concept, there's a

00:45:26.376 --> 00:45:29.596
great WWDC 2016 talk that goes

00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:30.896
over details about

00:45:30.896 --> 00:45:32.036
physically-based rendering as it

00:45:32.036 --> 00:45:33.186
applies to SceneKit, called

00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:34.736
Advances in SceneKit Rendering.

00:45:34.736 --> 00:45:37.276
Now, with that said, let's start

00:45:37.356 --> 00:45:38.466
talking about our first material

00:45:38.466 --> 00:45:40.056
property, albedo, or what is

00:45:40.056 --> 00:45:41.296
sometimes lovingly referred to

00:45:41.296 --> 00:45:42.836
as the base or diffuse color

00:45:42.836 --> 00:45:43.316
property.

00:45:44.616 --> 00:45:45.516
So, let's jump back into

00:45:45.516 --> 00:45:46.076
CampfiAR.

00:45:47.016 --> 00:45:48.006
Previously our base measure's

00:45:48.006 --> 00:45:48.886
looking a little bit boring,

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.066
with the gray material

00:45:50.066 --> 00:45:51.626
associated with it, but after

00:45:51.676 --> 00:45:52.956
you apply albedo, you start to

00:45:52.956 --> 00:45:54.356
see that it looks a lot better.

00:45:54.766 --> 00:45:55.756
But, the campfire is still

00:45:55.756 --> 00:45:56.996
missing a lot of those small,

00:45:57.076 --> 00:45:58.436
finite details that were

00:45:58.436 --> 00:45:59.456
originally found in that

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.406
high-density mesh.

00:46:01.076 --> 00:46:02.096
As you move closer to the

00:46:02.096 --> 00:46:04.046
campfire, you'll notice that all

00:46:04.046 --> 00:46:05.016
the surfaces are relatively

00:46:05.016 --> 00:46:05.366
flat.

00:46:05.936 --> 00:46:06.846
And, this is something that

00:46:06.846 --> 00:46:07.906
we'll definitely correct later,

00:46:07.906 --> 00:46:09.146
but first let's dive into the

00:46:09.146 --> 00:46:10.186
albedo property a little bit

00:46:10.186 --> 00:46:10.446
more.

00:46:12.016 --> 00:46:13.966
Think of the albedo as basically

00:46:13.966 --> 00:46:15.266
being the base mesh of the

00:46:15.266 --> 00:46:16.326
various objects in your AR

00:46:16.326 --> 00:46:16.656
scene.

00:46:17.526 --> 00:46:18.496
This is the material property

00:46:18.496 --> 00:46:20.246
that you typically use to apply

00:46:20.476 --> 00:46:22.076
textures to the surface of your

00:46:22.076 --> 00:46:22.376
model.

00:46:23.376 --> 00:46:24.676
If you recall, your mesh

00:46:24.676 --> 00:46:25.846
contained different vertices,

00:46:25.846 --> 00:46:26.946
that held different pieces of

00:46:26.946 --> 00:46:27.586
information.

00:46:28.856 --> 00:46:29.916
The ones you see here are

00:46:29.916 --> 00:46:31.286
actually called UV coordinates,

00:46:31.336 --> 00:46:33.166
which help map out how pixels

00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:34.236
from various texture maps are

00:46:34.236 --> 00:46:35.576
actually applied to the model.

00:46:36.606 --> 00:46:37.996
And, after we've worked with

00:46:37.996 --> 00:46:39.746
these textures, we've applied

00:46:39.746 --> 00:46:41.356
the abel material to this

00:46:41.356 --> 00:46:42.576
property on the fish.

00:46:43.996 --> 00:46:45.286
So, now we've essentially

00:46:45.286 --> 00:46:46.886
applied a texture to our fish, I

00:46:46.886 --> 00:46:47.856
want to remind you about the

00:46:47.856 --> 00:46:49.656
fact that you never know where

00:46:49.656 --> 00:46:50.206
people are never going to

00:46:50.206 --> 00:46:51.126
experience your app.

00:46:51.776 --> 00:46:52.896
You want to be able to have your

00:46:52.986 --> 00:46:54.506
content fit in as many different

00:46:54.506 --> 00:46:55.626
scenarios as possible.

00:46:55.706 --> 00:46:57.606
So, you want to take care in

00:46:57.606 --> 00:46:59.206
selecting the right albedo value

00:46:59.726 --> 00:47:01.056
that are neither too bright or

00:47:01.056 --> 00:47:01.416
dark.

00:47:01.956 --> 00:47:03.776
As, you want this to work in a

00:47:03.816 --> 00:47:04.746
wide variety of different

00:47:04.746 --> 00:47:05.456
situations.

00:47:06.146 --> 00:47:07.856
So, our fish has got a skin, but

00:47:07.856 --> 00:47:08.886
we're still missing a lot of

00:47:08.886 --> 00:47:10.286
details from this, and the other

00:47:10.286 --> 00:47:11.746
objects found in the scene.

00:47:12.136 --> 00:47:13.626
So let's go back into how we can

00:47:13.626 --> 00:47:14.636
start bringing back a lot of

00:47:14.636 --> 00:47:16.866
those details through the use of

00:47:16.866 --> 00:47:18.236
the normal material property.

00:47:18.296 --> 00:47:20.656
So, as we jump back into

00:47:20.656 --> 00:47:22.466
CampfiAR, let's see how we can

00:47:22.466 --> 00:47:23.916
bring back some of those details

00:47:23.916 --> 00:47:25.436
that we moved from optimization.

00:47:26.166 --> 00:47:27.476
This can be done through the use

00:47:27.476 --> 00:47:28.676
of a special texture called a

00:47:28.676 --> 00:47:30.706
normal map, which you can see

00:47:30.706 --> 00:47:32.056
here as the blue tinted maps

00:47:32.056 --> 00:47:33.476
that are now applied to our AR

00:47:33.476 --> 00:47:33.786
scene.

00:47:34.576 --> 00:47:36.016
These maps allow you to add

00:47:36.046 --> 00:47:38.276
those fine surface details back

00:47:38.276 --> 00:47:39.526
into your models, without the

00:47:39.526 --> 00:47:40.876
need to add any additional

00:47:40.876 --> 00:47:41.336
geometry.

00:47:42.036 --> 00:47:43.276
Now, after applying the normal

00:47:43.276 --> 00:47:45.046
maps, you can see how the fish

00:47:45.046 --> 00:47:46.676
exhibits some scales, as well as

00:47:46.676 --> 00:47:48.306
making the branches show just a

00:47:48.306 --> 00:47:49.256
tiny bit more detail.

00:47:49.966 --> 00:47:51.276
Also if you take a look at the

00:47:51.276 --> 00:47:52.296
statistics panel, you'll notice

00:47:52.296 --> 00:47:53.456
that there was absolutely no

00:47:53.456 --> 00:47:55.256
change in the number of polygons

00:47:55.376 --> 00:47:56.176
related to this model.

00:47:56.336 --> 00:47:58.946
It's magical, isn't it?

00:47:59.206 --> 00:48:01.236
So, how do we make this normal

00:48:01.236 --> 00:48:01.446
map?

00:48:02.146 --> 00:48:03.196
Let's see a closer look at one

00:48:03.196 --> 00:48:05.156
of the branches, and see what we

00:48:05.156 --> 00:48:06.216
can do to make this work.

00:48:06.626 --> 00:48:07.936
In most modern 3D modeling

00:48:07.936 --> 00:48:09.346
applications, artists have the

00:48:09.346 --> 00:48:10.406
ability to generate these normal

00:48:10.406 --> 00:48:12.496
maps by projecting details from

00:48:12.496 --> 00:48:14.236
a high-density mesh over to a

00:48:14.236 --> 00:48:14.986
low-density one.

00:48:15.546 --> 00:48:16.556
So, here you can see what the

00:48:16.556 --> 00:48:17.936
normal map looks like on the

00:48:17.936 --> 00:48:19.176
branches after they've been

00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:20.636
generated from this high-density

00:48:20.636 --> 00:48:21.046
mesh.

00:48:21.756 --> 00:48:23.296
And, after applying the normal

00:48:23.296 --> 00:48:24.786
map, you start to notice all

00:48:24.786 --> 00:48:25.826
those nice details that were

00:48:25.826 --> 00:48:27.276
originally lost come back into

00:48:27.276 --> 00:48:27.756
this model.

00:48:27.756 --> 00:48:28.876
But we still are able to

00:48:28.876 --> 00:48:30.446
maintain that high performance,

00:48:30.496 --> 00:48:31.656
of the low-poly mesh.

00:48:31.656 --> 00:48:34.386
So, you may be wondering why the

00:48:34.416 --> 00:48:35.456
normal map looks kind of

00:48:35.456 --> 00:48:37.356
strange, well the colors of the

00:48:37.356 --> 00:48:38.836
normal map actually represent

00:48:38.996 --> 00:48:40.626
visual representations of the

00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:41.236
vector data.

00:48:41.236 --> 00:48:43.816
And, determine how the normals

00:48:43.816 --> 00:48:45.446
on the surface model will be

00:48:45.446 --> 00:48:47.866
offset in order to change the

00:48:47.866 --> 00:48:48.566
way that light is being

00:48:48.566 --> 00:48:50.526
reflected, and our key to making

00:48:50.526 --> 00:48:51.196
this effect work.

00:48:51.706 --> 00:48:53.766
That was a bit of a mouthful, so

00:48:53.766 --> 00:48:54.936
let's dive a little bit more

00:48:54.936 --> 00:48:57.006
into this property, because

00:48:57.276 --> 00:48:58.636
normals we feel are a really

00:48:58.636 --> 00:48:59.326
important topic.

00:48:59.946 --> 00:49:00.946
And, we want to spend a couple

00:49:00.946 --> 00:49:02.846
more minutes just going into how

00:49:02.846 --> 00:49:04.786
truly spectacular these can be.

00:49:06.156 --> 00:49:07.206
The art of manipulating normal

00:49:07.206 --> 00:49:08.626
vectors are one of the key tools

00:49:08.626 --> 00:49:10.396
that AR creators have in order

00:49:10.396 --> 00:49:12.906
to add a lot of the significant

00:49:12.906 --> 00:49:14.416
details back into their model.

00:49:15.076 --> 00:49:16.706
So, what the heck is a normal

00:49:16.706 --> 00:49:18.206
vector, and are there strange

00:49:18.206 --> 00:49:19.016
vectors as well?

00:49:19.696 --> 00:49:20.916
Well, no there's no strange

00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:21.926
vectors unless you forgot your

00:49:21.926 --> 00:49:24.046
high school trig, but normal

00:49:24.046 --> 00:49:25.566
vectors lie perpendicular to the

00:49:25.566 --> 00:49:26.906
surface of the mesh, and are

00:49:26.906 --> 00:49:28.146
associated with each mesh

00:49:28.146 --> 00:49:28.766
vertex.

00:49:29.436 --> 00:49:30.266
So, why do we need these

00:49:30.266 --> 00:49:30.746
normals?

00:49:31.246 --> 00:49:33.406
Well, in order to see our

00:49:33.406 --> 00:49:34.666
object, you need to place

00:49:34.716 --> 00:49:36.416
simulated lights into your 3D

00:49:36.416 --> 00:49:36.936
engine.

00:49:37.796 --> 00:49:39.446
Normal vectors allow 3D engines

00:49:39.446 --> 00:49:40.826
to calculate how these lights

00:49:40.826 --> 00:49:41.906
are actually reflected off the

00:49:41.906 --> 00:49:43.126
surface of these materials.

00:49:43.616 --> 00:49:45.026
Similar to how light behaves in

00:49:45.026 --> 00:49:46.156
the real world, and are

00:49:46.156 --> 00:49:47.376
essential to making sure that

00:49:47.376 --> 00:49:49.286
your AR scenes mimic reality.

00:49:49.846 --> 00:49:52.016
What's interesting is that by

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:53.786
modifying these normals, you can

00:49:53.786 --> 00:49:54.906
trick the engine to thinking

00:49:54.906 --> 00:49:56.156
that your surface is actually

00:49:56.156 --> 00:49:57.756
more detailed than it really is,

00:49:58.136 --> 00:49:59.276
without need to add any

00:49:59.276 --> 00:49:59.946
additional geometry.

00:50:00.046 --> 00:50:01.896
If you take a look at this

00:50:01.896 --> 00:50:03.246
example, you can see a simple

00:50:03.246 --> 00:50:04.866
sphere, being rendered with flat

00:50:04.866 --> 00:50:05.236
shading.

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:06.836
What this means, that the

00:50:06.836 --> 00:50:08.196
normals associated with each

00:50:08.196 --> 00:50:09.776
face of the mesh are pointing in

00:50:09.776 --> 00:50:11.556
the exact same direction, as

00:50:11.556 --> 00:50:12.686
seen by the 2D diagram.

00:50:13.586 --> 00:50:15.376
Now, when you -- when light

00:50:15.376 --> 00:50:16.676
reacts to this surface, you'll

00:50:16.676 --> 00:50:18.366
be actually able to notice all

00:50:18.366 --> 00:50:19.936
the different polygons

00:50:19.936 --> 00:50:21.246
comprising this mesh due to

00:50:21.246 --> 00:50:22.856
being evenly lit across each

00:50:22.856 --> 00:50:23.286
face.

00:50:23.776 --> 00:50:25.866
Here, though, we're using the

00:50:25.866 --> 00:50:27.496
exact same model, but leveraging

00:50:27.496 --> 00:50:28.866
a technique called smooth or

00:50:28.866 --> 00:50:29.716
phong shading.

00:50:30.346 --> 00:50:31.756
Notice that the normals are

00:50:31.756 --> 00:50:33.186
actually gradually changing as

00:50:33.186 --> 00:50:34.356
you move across the surface of

00:50:34.356 --> 00:50:34.996
the polygon.

00:50:35.786 --> 00:50:37.736
With the engine calculates the

00:50:37.766 --> 00:50:40.076
reflection off of this model,

00:50:40.076 --> 00:50:41.096
it'll give the impression of a

00:50:41.096 --> 00:50:43.016
smooth, curved surface due to

00:50:43.016 --> 00:50:44.636
the gradual interpolation of

00:50:44.636 --> 00:50:45.296
these normals.

00:50:46.726 --> 00:50:48.206
What's really awesome is that

00:50:48.206 --> 00:50:49.486
these two models have the exact

00:50:49.486 --> 00:50:50.366
same number of polygons

00:50:50.366 --> 00:50:51.146
associated with them.

00:50:51.336 --> 00:50:52.186
But, through this normal

00:50:52.186 --> 00:50:54.016
manipulation, the object will

00:50:54.016 --> 00:50:54.946
seem to have a much more

00:50:54.946 --> 00:50:56.626
smoother and detailed surface,

00:50:56.976 --> 00:50:58.466
without the need to, again, add

00:50:58.466 --> 00:50:59.756
or change any of the geometry

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.036
associated with this mesh.

00:51:02.396 --> 00:51:03.966
Whew. Alright, so we've gone

00:51:03.966 --> 00:51:05.356
through enough about normals.

00:51:05.356 --> 00:51:06.776
Let's, kind of, go over what it

00:51:06.776 --> 00:51:07.846
takes to add a little bit more

00:51:07.846 --> 00:51:09.426
shiny to your scene.

00:51:10.216 --> 00:51:12.066
CampfiAR is definitely starting

00:51:12.066 --> 00:51:12.526
to look better.

00:51:13.076 --> 00:51:14.756
But, some of these normal maps

00:51:14.756 --> 00:51:15.706
[inaudible] but some of these

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:16.886
parts seem a bit dull,

00:51:17.406 --> 00:51:18.416
especially the objects that you

00:51:18.416 --> 00:51:19.786
expect to be shiny or

00:51:19.786 --> 00:51:20.806
reflective, kind of like the

00:51:20.806 --> 00:51:21.916
kettle or the fish in this

00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:22.136
scene.

00:51:23.286 --> 00:51:24.576
What we see here is the results

00:51:24.576 --> 00:51:26.356
of applying a metal map to our

00:51:26.426 --> 00:51:26.886
AR scene.

00:51:27.496 --> 00:51:29.766
A metal map is used to determine

00:51:29.766 --> 00:51:31.146
which object surfaces should

00:51:31.146 --> 00:51:33.016
exhibit reflective properties.

00:51:33.896 --> 00:51:34.966
Once the material property's

00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:36.756
activated, notice how shiny and

00:51:36.756 --> 00:51:38.326
reflective the area's we've

00:51:38.326 --> 00:51:39.306
designated as being metallic

00:51:39.306 --> 00:51:39.626
are.

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:41.256
And, on the kettle as well as

00:51:41.406 --> 00:51:42.476
the scales of the fish.

00:51:42.476 --> 00:51:45.956
So, let's focus specifically on

00:51:45.956 --> 00:51:46.276
the kettle.

00:51:47.166 --> 00:51:48.056
We'll begin by taking the

00:51:48.086 --> 00:51:49.796
original albedo map, and then

00:51:49.796 --> 00:51:51.166
apply a metal map to the

00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:52.446
metalness property of this

00:51:52.446 --> 00:51:52.836
material.

00:51:53.756 --> 00:51:55.106
After the application of the

00:51:55.106 --> 00:51:56.706
metal map, the 3D render will

00:51:56.706 --> 00:51:58.006
actually designate the surface

00:51:58.006 --> 00:52:00.466
to be reflective in the areas on

00:52:00.466 --> 00:52:01.446
the map that were actually

00:52:01.446 --> 00:52:01.626
white.

00:52:02.296 --> 00:52:03.316
And, despite begin called

00:52:03.316 --> 00:52:04.326
metalness, it doesn't

00:52:04.326 --> 00:52:05.336
necessarily mean that your

00:52:05.336 --> 00:52:06.886
object needs to contain metal.

00:52:07.556 --> 00:52:08.336
Rather, we're just letting the

00:52:08.336 --> 00:52:10.296
3D engine know that this object

00:52:10.296 --> 00:52:11.416
should exhibit, kind of, a

00:52:11.416 --> 00:52:12.906
reflective surface.

00:52:13.416 --> 00:52:16.016
Now, it's best to use the

00:52:16.016 --> 00:52:17.176
metalness map on your model,

00:52:17.526 --> 00:52:19.336
like our kettle here, when it

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:21.266
has both a mixture of metallic

00:52:21.266 --> 00:52:22.466
and non-metallic surfaces.

00:52:23.066 --> 00:52:24.276
It's a simple grayscale map,

00:52:24.726 --> 00:52:25.676
where the level of metalness

00:52:25.676 --> 00:52:27.646
ranges from being black, for

00:52:27.646 --> 00:52:29.006
non-metal surfaces, to white,

00:52:29.006 --> 00:52:30.166
for metallic surfaces.

00:52:31.016 --> 00:52:32.256
And, it allows for a single

00:52:32.256 --> 00:52:34.836
material to be used to represent

00:52:34.836 --> 00:52:35.906
both reflective and

00:52:35.906 --> 00:52:37.466
non-reflective surfaces on your

00:52:37.466 --> 00:52:38.126
single object.

00:52:38.926 --> 00:52:41.216
However, this kettle's a bit

00:52:41.276 --> 00:52:42.066
crazy reflective.

00:52:42.336 --> 00:52:43.966
And, doesn't really quite

00:52:44.016 --> 00:52:44.966
provide the look that we're

00:52:44.966 --> 00:52:45.466
hoping for.

00:52:45.846 --> 00:52:47.636
So, in this case, we want to

00:52:47.636 --> 00:52:49.146
potentially vary the amount of

00:52:49.146 --> 00:52:50.456
reflectivity, as well as

00:52:50.456 --> 00:52:51.906
simulate the fact that all

00:52:51.906 --> 00:52:53.576
surfaces are not perfectly

00:52:53.576 --> 00:52:54.006
smooth.

00:52:54.296 --> 00:52:55.526
And, they actually might exhibit

00:52:55.816 --> 00:52:58.056
slight small, microabrasions to

00:52:58.056 --> 00:52:58.696
their surface.

00:52:59.206 --> 00:53:01.466
And, this is where the roughness

00:53:01.466 --> 00:53:02.446
material property comes into

00:53:02.446 --> 00:53:02.736
play.

00:53:04.066 --> 00:53:05.516
So, returning back to CampfiAR,

00:53:06.066 --> 00:53:07.246
you can see how the reflective

00:53:07.246 --> 00:53:08.776
surfaces are a bit too smooth.

00:53:09.266 --> 00:53:10.986
As we layer on the roughness

00:53:10.986 --> 00:53:12.316
maps, you can see that we are

00:53:12.316 --> 00:53:13.746
going to modify both the kettle

00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:15.226
and the fish to adjust the way

00:53:15.226 --> 00:53:16.026
that they're reflecting.

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:17.816
And then, after we apply the

00:53:17.816 --> 00:53:19.316
roughness material property to

00:53:19.316 --> 00:53:21.116
both of these objects, you can

00:53:21.146 --> 00:53:22.306
clearly see the reduction of the

00:53:22.306 --> 00:53:22.926
reflectivity.

00:53:23.876 --> 00:53:25.066
This combination of roughness

00:53:25.066 --> 00:53:26.516
and metalness properties are

00:53:26.516 --> 00:53:28.486
another important concept to

00:53:28.486 --> 00:53:28.996
focus on.

00:53:29.256 --> 00:53:30.356
So, let's dive a little bit

00:53:30.356 --> 00:53:31.396
deeper into the roughness

00:53:31.436 --> 00:53:34.086
material property.

00:53:34.186 --> 00:53:36.076
Use roughness to simulate micro

00:53:36.076 --> 00:53:38.216
surface details, which in turn

00:53:38.216 --> 00:53:39.686
will affect the way light is

00:53:39.736 --> 00:53:41.216
being bounced off that surface.

00:53:41.846 --> 00:53:43.086
If the roughness property is set

00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:45.236
to completely smooth, then light

00:53:45.236 --> 00:53:46.796
will bounce off of your surface

00:53:46.796 --> 00:53:47.266
like a mirror.

00:53:48.066 --> 00:53:49.196
As you increase the roughness of

00:53:49.196 --> 00:53:50.666
the material, light reflects

00:53:50.666 --> 00:53:52.006
over a wider range of angles.

00:53:52.336 --> 00:53:54.016
Here, we're slowly scaling a

00:53:54.016 --> 00:53:55.816
constant roughness value between

00:53:56.086 --> 00:53:57.956
no roughness to max roughness on

00:53:57.956 --> 00:53:58.786
the kettle itself.

00:53:59.386 --> 00:54:02.326
And, this is a good way of being

00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:04.486
able to simulate the concept of

00:54:04.486 --> 00:54:06.456
having microsurfaces, and

00:54:06.456 --> 00:54:07.606
blurring reflection to the point

00:54:07.606 --> 00:54:09.396
where you might not see any

00:54:09.396 --> 00:54:10.706
reflectivity depending on which

00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:13.106
range you put your value to.

00:54:13.576 --> 00:54:16.536
So, for the kettle, we've taken

00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:17.746
the original metal surface, and

00:54:17.746 --> 00:54:19.416
instead of just applying a

00:54:19.416 --> 00:54:21.476
constant roughness value to it,

00:54:21.876 --> 00:54:23.006
we actually applied a roughness

00:54:23.006 --> 00:54:23.176
map.

00:54:24.086 --> 00:54:25.436
And, this will help designate

00:54:25.706 --> 00:54:27.146
the surfaces where we will be

00:54:27.146 --> 00:54:29.656
scattering the light more often,

00:54:29.656 --> 00:54:30.786
and more than others.

00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:32.956
Once we've applied the roughness

00:54:32.956 --> 00:54:34.926
map, we get to see the real

00:54:34.926 --> 00:54:36.346
final look of the reflectiveness

00:54:36.346 --> 00:54:37.346
of this kettle, which is a lot

00:54:37.346 --> 00:54:38.906
less shiny as before.

00:54:40.106 --> 00:54:42.406
Now, a combination of this

00:54:42.486 --> 00:54:43.826
metalness property and this

00:54:43.826 --> 00:54:45.586
roughness property really make

00:54:45.586 --> 00:54:46.976
your reflective AR models look

00:54:46.976 --> 00:54:47.566
phenomenal.

00:54:48.486 --> 00:54:49.656
Roughness can be used to tweak

00:54:49.656 --> 00:54:50.926
how much of your objects will

00:54:50.926 --> 00:54:51.756
reflect the environment.

00:54:52.046 --> 00:54:53.586
And, can really be used to add a

00:54:53.586 --> 00:54:54.636
lot more realism to your

00:54:54.636 --> 00:54:55.626
metallic surfaces.

00:54:56.296 --> 00:54:57.706
You can use this roughness map

00:54:57.826 --> 00:55:00.076
to add additional minor details

00:55:00.076 --> 00:55:01.436
as we've done here, to make our

00:55:01.436 --> 00:55:02.366
kettle look a little more

00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:02.946
scuffed up.

00:55:04.066 --> 00:55:05.726
Now, to close out materials, we

00:55:05.726 --> 00:55:06.316
have two more material

00:55:06.316 --> 00:55:07.356
properties that I want to

00:55:07.356 --> 00:55:09.256
discuss to further refine your

00:55:09.256 --> 00:55:11.546
models, and have a good balance

00:55:11.546 --> 00:55:12.646
between performance and

00:55:12.646 --> 00:55:13.276
aesthetics.

00:55:14.796 --> 00:55:16.416
Ambient occlusion is a material

00:55:16.416 --> 00:55:17.686
property that is used to provide

00:55:17.686 --> 00:55:20.216
your model with self-shadowing,

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:21.476
which in turn can lead to adding

00:55:21.476 --> 00:55:23.016
additional depth and details to

00:55:23.016 --> 00:55:23.856
your AR models.

00:55:24.416 --> 00:55:27.026
Now, while normal maps are great

00:55:27.286 --> 00:55:28.296
for applying significant amount

00:55:28.296 --> 00:55:30.486
of details back into your AR

00:55:30.636 --> 00:55:32.296
model, you can use ambient

00:55:32.296 --> 00:55:33.946
occlusion to really hammer in

00:55:34.096 --> 00:55:34.796
those details.

00:55:35.336 --> 00:55:36.386
Here, we're visualizing the

00:55:36.386 --> 00:55:37.496
ambient occlusion maps for

00:55:37.646 --> 00:55:39.786
CampfiAR, and it's a bit of a

00:55:39.786 --> 00:55:41.036
difficult effect to demonstrate,

00:55:41.036 --> 00:55:42.246
as it's meant to be relatively

00:55:42.246 --> 00:55:42.616
subtle.

00:55:42.616 --> 00:55:44.226
But, see if you can notice the

00:55:44.226 --> 00:55:45.806
additional shadows on the logs,

00:55:45.896 --> 00:55:47.086
as well as certain areas near

00:55:47.086 --> 00:55:48.006
the bottom of the kettle.

00:55:48.826 --> 00:55:50.336
In our case here, it's kind of

00:55:50.336 --> 00:55:51.456
like playing Where's Waldo?

00:55:51.456 --> 00:55:53.356
with shadows, so let's focus in

00:55:53.356 --> 00:55:56.876
on the logs in the scene.

00:55:57.086 --> 00:55:58.726
So, here we're showing you the

00:55:58.726 --> 00:56:00.686
normal maped logs before.

00:56:00.836 --> 00:56:02.436
Now, there's some great details

00:56:02.436 --> 00:56:03.756
found in the ridges, but we can

00:56:03.756 --> 00:56:04.746
definitely improve some of these

00:56:04.746 --> 00:56:05.256
areas.

00:56:06.366 --> 00:56:07.436
Now, as we look at the ambient

00:56:07.436 --> 00:56:08.626
occlusion map, you can see how

00:56:08.626 --> 00:56:10.366
we've added some regions of

00:56:10.696 --> 00:56:11.386
self-shadowing.

00:56:11.386 --> 00:56:12.956
So, lower portions of the log,

00:56:12.956 --> 00:56:14.176
as well as around the small

00:56:14.176 --> 00:56:15.026
embedded stumps.

00:56:15.346 --> 00:56:17.746
And, after we apply the map to

00:56:17.746 --> 00:56:19.196
our ambient occlusion property,

00:56:19.446 --> 00:56:20.746
I hope you can see the benefits

00:56:20.746 --> 00:56:22.286
of adding those baked detail

00:56:22.286 --> 00:56:24.036
shadows without the need of

00:56:24.036 --> 00:56:25.516
using expensive dynamic lights

00:56:25.516 --> 00:56:26.066
in your scene.

00:56:26.586 --> 00:56:30.266
When working in AR, we recommend

00:56:30.266 --> 00:56:31.426
that you actually bake your

00:56:31.426 --> 00:56:32.766
ambient occlusion into a map.

00:56:33.316 --> 00:56:34.086
Which is what we've done for

00:56:34.086 --> 00:56:34.456
CampfiAR.

00:56:34.456 --> 00:56:36.426
Rather than use the alternative,

00:56:37.086 --> 00:56:39.056
such as screen space ambient

00:56:39.326 --> 00:56:40.306
occlusions, which is a

00:56:40.306 --> 00:56:41.886
camera-based post-process

00:56:41.886 --> 00:56:43.286
effect, and can potentially lead

00:56:43.286 --> 00:56:45.256
to poor rendering performance in

00:56:45.706 --> 00:56:47.076
your scene.

00:56:47.176 --> 00:56:48.336
And, last but certainly not

00:56:48.336 --> 00:56:50.686
least, be frugal with the use of

00:56:50.686 --> 00:56:51.526
your transparency in your

00:56:51.526 --> 00:56:52.346
materials materials.

00:56:52.346 --> 00:56:53.926
If you must use transparencies,

00:56:54.126 --> 00:56:54.956
we recommend that you use

00:56:54.956 --> 00:56:56.336
separate materials for objects

00:56:56.336 --> 00:56:57.506
where you see a combination of

00:56:57.716 --> 00:56:59.066
transparent and non-transparent

00:56:59.066 --> 00:56:59.696
surfaces.

00:57:00.956 --> 00:57:02.356
In general, when working with AR

00:57:02.356 --> 00:57:04.256
content, the use of a lot of

00:57:04.256 --> 00:57:05.216
transparent surfaces can

00:57:05.216 --> 00:57:07.376
potentially have a huge impact

00:57:07.376 --> 00:57:09.106
on performance, especially if

00:57:09.106 --> 00:57:10.206
you are having transparent

00:57:10.206 --> 00:57:11.036
surfaces that are, kind of,

00:57:11.036 --> 00:57:12.526
stacked in front of each other

00:57:12.606 --> 00:57:13.286
when you're viewing them.

00:57:13.716 --> 00:57:14.726
This is known as overdraw, and

00:57:14.726 --> 00:57:15.196
it's something that you

00:57:15.196 --> 00:57:16.526
definitely want to avoid when

00:57:16.526 --> 00:57:17.306
you're working in AR.

00:57:18.716 --> 00:57:19.256
Whew. Alright.

00:57:19.476 --> 00:57:20.826
I hope everybody's still with

00:57:20.826 --> 00:57:21.996
me, as that was quite a lot to

00:57:21.996 --> 00:57:22.486
go through.

00:57:23.036 --> 00:57:24.646
So far, we've focused mostly on

00:57:25.126 --> 00:57:27.156
how the AR content will react to

00:57:27.266 --> 00:57:28.786
the simulated spotlights found

00:57:28.786 --> 00:57:29.826
in our 3D engines.

00:57:30.156 --> 00:57:31.276
But now, it's time to focus on

00:57:31.276 --> 00:57:32.576
some ways to make our content

00:57:32.576 --> 00:57:33.966
seem like it's actually part of

00:57:33.966 --> 00:57:34.506
the real world.

00:57:35.046 --> 00:57:37.696
A fantastic option to use to

00:57:37.696 --> 00:57:38.846
compensate for varied lighting

00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:40.226
conditions is to leverage one of

00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:44.636
ARKit's well known features, and

00:57:44.636 --> 00:57:45.326
light estimation.

00:57:45.996 --> 00:57:47.116
Let's begin by activating this

00:57:47.116 --> 00:57:48.126
functionality and see how it

00:57:48.126 --> 00:57:48.736
affects our kettle.

00:57:49.156 --> 00:57:50.286
Notice that how when the ambient

00:57:50.286 --> 00:57:51.406
light changes in intensity in

00:57:51.406 --> 00:57:52.906
the real world, a similar

00:57:52.906 --> 00:57:53.766
adjustment is made to the

00:57:53.766 --> 00:57:55.316
ambient light in our AR scene.

00:57:56.436 --> 00:57:57.676
The way this works is that ARKit

00:57:57.676 --> 00:57:59.256
analyzes each frame of the

00:57:59.256 --> 00:58:01.286
video, and uses them to estimate

00:58:01.286 --> 00:58:02.306
the lighting condition of the

00:58:02.306 --> 00:58:02.936
real world.

00:58:02.936 --> 00:58:05.076
It is an absolutely magical

00:58:05.076 --> 00:58:06.756
feature that helps assure that

00:58:06.756 --> 00:58:08.136
the amount to light applied to

00:58:08.136 --> 00:58:09.776
your AR content matches what you

00:58:09.776 --> 00:58:10.546
see in the real world.

00:58:10.546 --> 00:58:13.536
Now, that we have magical light

00:58:13.536 --> 00:58:15.026
wizards living in our AR scene,

00:58:15.096 --> 00:58:16.086
let's discuss shadows.

00:58:16.796 --> 00:58:18.756
Shadows in AR are really, really

00:58:18.756 --> 00:58:19.416
hard to get right.

00:58:20.246 --> 00:58:21.176
Your shadow needs to be able to

00:58:21.176 --> 00:58:22.506
work in a wide variety of

00:58:22.506 --> 00:58:23.206
situations.

00:58:23.386 --> 00:58:25.096
Remember that people can be

00:58:25.096 --> 00:58:26.206
potentially using your app

00:58:26.356 --> 00:58:26.776
anywhere.

00:58:27.046 --> 00:58:28.516
And, if your AR shadows differ

00:58:28.916 --> 00:58:29.766
from the ones that are seen in

00:58:29.766 --> 00:58:30.796
the real world environment, it

00:58:30.796 --> 00:58:31.976
can be relatively jarring for

00:58:31.976 --> 00:58:32.676
your experience.

00:58:34.016 --> 00:58:35.136
Here, we have tried to

00:58:35.226 --> 00:58:36.936
incorrectly cast a dynamic

00:58:36.936 --> 00:58:39.396
shadow by using a directional

00:58:39.396 --> 00:58:40.996
light as a sharp angle in our 3D

00:58:40.996 --> 00:58:41.286
engine.

00:58:42.226 --> 00:58:43.686
Shadows are a great way to make

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:44.866
objects actually feel grounded

00:58:44.866 --> 00:58:45.716
in the real world, but in this

00:58:45.716 --> 00:58:47.066
case, it doesn't really match

00:58:47.066 --> 00:58:48.256
the shadows being seen in the

00:58:48.256 --> 00:58:49.156
surrounding environment.

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:50.716
It's like we're purposely trying

00:58:50.716 --> 00:58:52.046
to defy the laws of physics

00:58:53.816 --> 00:58:53.926
here.

00:58:54.136 --> 00:58:55.316
Instead, we suggest that you

00:58:55.316 --> 00:58:56.326
place your directional light

00:58:56.326 --> 00:58:58.076
directly overhead, and play a

00:58:58.076 --> 00:58:58.846
little bit around with the

00:58:58.846 --> 00:59:00.526
intensity of that effect to make

00:59:00.526 --> 00:59:02.536
sure that it actually feels a

00:59:02.536 --> 00:59:03.476
little bit more subtle.

00:59:04.236 --> 00:59:05.136
This will allow your shadows to

00:59:05.136 --> 00:59:06.216
work in a lot more different

00:59:06.216 --> 00:59:08.016
situations, and a lot more

00:59:08.016 --> 00:59:08.786
different scenarios.

00:59:09.606 --> 00:59:10.926
An alternative to this is

00:59:10.926 --> 00:59:12.076
actually using a method where

00:59:12.076 --> 00:59:13.186
you can create your own drop

00:59:13.186 --> 00:59:14.356
shadow, rather than using

00:59:14.356 --> 00:59:15.576
dynamic lights in your scene,

00:59:16.016 --> 00:59:17.556
which can get expensive, and can

00:59:17.556 --> 00:59:19.446
severely affect performance if

00:59:19.446 --> 00:59:20.516
you're rendering a lot of 3D

00:59:20.516 --> 00:59:20.966
content.

00:59:21.736 --> 00:59:23.956
Take the time to craft those

00:59:24.296 --> 00:59:25.256
really good shadows.

00:59:25.256 --> 00:59:26.746
And ensure that they will fit in

00:59:26.746 --> 00:59:28.736
as many real world situations as

00:59:28.796 --> 00:59:29.166
possible.

00:59:29.746 --> 00:59:32.306
Ah, environment maps.

00:59:33.086 --> 00:59:34.486
If you really want to astound

00:59:34.486 --> 00:59:35.866
people, you definitely want to

00:59:35.866 --> 00:59:37.326
use these maps, especially on

00:59:37.326 --> 00:59:39.166
those AR objects that exhibit

00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:39.886
reflectivity.

00:59:40.796 --> 00:59:41.946
It'll make it seem like your AR

00:59:41.946 --> 00:59:43.746
content exists right here, in

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:44.366
the real world.

00:59:44.836 --> 00:59:46.336
And, to make it super easy to

00:59:46.336 --> 00:59:48.086
leverage their powers we want to

00:59:48.086 --> 00:59:49.606
show you how one of the new

00:59:49.606 --> 00:59:52.176
features in iOS 12 and ARKit

00:59:52.176 --> 00:59:54.006
2.0, automatic environmental

00:59:54.006 --> 00:59:55.586
mapping, can help you achieve

00:59:55.586 --> 00:59:56.026
this effect.

00:59:57.576 --> 00:59:58.826
If you take a close look at the

00:59:58.826 --> 01:00:00.306
kettle, originally we're using a

01:00:00.306 --> 01:00:01.726
baked environment map that has a

01:00:01.816 --> 01:00:02.976
kind of blush tinge to it.

01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:05.246
Once we've activated the

01:00:05.246 --> 01:00:06.836
automatic environmental mapping,

01:00:07.076 --> 01:00:07.996
notice how the kettle now

01:00:07.996 --> 01:00:09.216
reflects a lot of the ground,

01:00:09.286 --> 01:00:10.706
and the surrounding color of the

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:11.786
current environment that we're

01:00:11.786 --> 01:00:11.986
in.

01:00:12.616 --> 01:00:13.856
You can even see a little bit of

01:00:13.856 --> 01:00:15.656
the green from the grass that

01:00:15.656 --> 01:00:16.496
this kettle's sitting in.

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:18.896
This is a fantastic feature

01:00:19.176 --> 01:00:20.486
that'll really help ground your

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:22.266
objects into the real world, and

01:00:22.266 --> 01:00:23.616
with careful use of roughness,

01:00:24.156 --> 01:00:25.126
can really enhance the

01:00:25.126 --> 01:00:26.736
believability of your scene.

01:00:28.536 --> 01:00:30.346
So, now why is automatic

01:00:30.346 --> 01:00:31.846
environmental mapping so

01:00:31.846 --> 01:00:32.976
actually incredible?

01:00:33.436 --> 01:00:35.516
Typically, these maps are used

01:00:35.516 --> 01:00:37.036
to simulate the ability of

01:00:37.076 --> 01:00:39.116
metallic surfaces to mirror the

01:00:39.116 --> 01:00:40.056
environment around them.

01:00:41.106 --> 01:00:43.156
You can see example of a cube

01:00:43.156 --> 01:00:44.006
environment map here.

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:46.426
Now, before ARKit added

01:00:46.426 --> 01:00:47.846
automatic environmental mapping,

01:00:47.946 --> 01:00:48.886
you had to provide your own

01:00:48.886 --> 01:00:50.086
image, and hope that it was

01:00:50.086 --> 01:00:51.146
generic enough to work in a

01:00:51.146 --> 01:00:52.936
large variety of situations that

01:00:52.936 --> 01:00:54.046
your app may be used in.

01:00:54.586 --> 01:00:56.986
But now, with ARKit 2.0, you can

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.006
kiss those sleepless night,

01:00:58.006 --> 01:00:59.176
fretting about whether your

01:00:59.176 --> 01:01:00.356
environment map is actually

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:01.516
ruining your AR experience.

01:01:02.786 --> 01:01:04.116
For more information about

01:01:04.116 --> 01:01:05.316
environmental mapping, and other

01:01:05.316 --> 01:01:07.236
new features found in ARKit 2.0,

01:01:07.556 --> 01:01:08.426
please check out the talk by

01:01:08.426 --> 01:01:09.616
Arsalan and Reinhard called

01:01:09.716 --> 01:01:10.886
What's New in ARKit 2.

01:01:11.446 --> 01:01:13.986
And now, to close out CampfiAR,

01:01:14.286 --> 01:01:15.956
let's put all this together, and

01:01:15.956 --> 01:01:17.526
add the final touches to the

01:01:17.526 --> 01:01:18.056
campfire.

01:01:19.466 --> 01:01:21.006
With a little bit of animations

01:01:21.006 --> 01:01:21.996
and [inaudible] effects, along

01:01:21.996 --> 01:01:23.336
with the applications of all the

01:01:23.336 --> 01:01:24.636
techniques discussed today,

01:01:25.066 --> 01:01:26.966
CampfiAR is ready for primetime.

01:01:27.676 --> 01:01:29.076
Now, if I ever get the crazy

01:01:29.076 --> 01:01:30.576
urge to go outside, I can

01:01:30.576 --> 01:01:32.526
suppress those urges, and stay

01:01:32.526 --> 01:01:34.556
safely at my desk, enjoying the

01:01:34.596 --> 01:01:36.636
joys of simulated outdoors with

01:01:36.636 --> 01:01:37.276
CAmpfiAR.

01:01:38.046 --> 01:01:39.086
Who needs EpiPens?

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.946
Not this guy.

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:43.566
We went through lot of different

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:44.306
topics today.

01:01:44.306 --> 01:01:45.896
So, I quickly want to reiterate

01:01:45.896 --> 01:01:46.786
some of the important things to

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.156
keep in mind while you're

01:01:48.156 --> 01:01:48.866
developing your app.

01:01:49.786 --> 01:01:51.796
Remember that your app can be

01:01:51.796 --> 01:01:52.926
used in a wide variety of real

01:01:52.926 --> 01:01:54.426
world conditions, so always make

01:01:54.426 --> 01:01:55.766
sure aesthetic choices allow

01:01:55.766 --> 01:01:57.196
your content to blend almost

01:01:57.196 --> 01:01:57.616
anywhere.

01:01:58.656 --> 01:02:00.066
Once you've decided what kind of

01:02:00.066 --> 01:02:01.676
AR experience you wish to build,

01:02:01.946 --> 01:02:04.166
adhere to what you think your

01:02:04.206 --> 01:02:05.626
rendering budget is, and work as

01:02:05.626 --> 01:02:07.116
many optimizations as you can to

01:02:07.116 --> 01:02:08.586
get that smooth performance and

01:02:08.586 --> 01:02:09.596
efficiently use your power.

01:02:10.476 --> 01:02:12.076
And, finally leverage the use of

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:13.626
various material properties, as

01:02:13.626 --> 01:02:15.046
well as the built-in features of

01:02:15.046 --> 01:02:17.016
ARKit to get your AR content

01:02:17.016 --> 01:02:18.626
looking great, in order to

01:02:18.626 --> 01:02:20.446
delight people who use your app.

01:02:21.206 --> 01:02:22.836
And, for your reference, here's

01:02:22.836 --> 01:02:23.866
a table of all the material

01:02:23.866 --> 01:02:25.486
properties we worked with today

01:02:25.486 --> 01:02:26.596
to build out CampfiAR.

01:02:26.596 --> 01:02:28.616
You can get additional

01:02:28.616 --> 01:02:29.656
information at the link

01:02:29.656 --> 01:02:30.036
provided.

01:02:30.036 --> 01:02:30.896
Thank you.
