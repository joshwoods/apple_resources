[ Applause ]

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.356
>> Good morning, everybody.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.076
My name is Pavel and Marin and I

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:38.186
will be talking to you about

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:38.926
ClassKit today.

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:42.626
Our talk is split in three

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:42.996
parts.

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:45.486
In first part, we will give you

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:47.026
a general overview of ClassKit.

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.356
We will show you how data flows

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:50.116
through the system.

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:52.196
In the second part of the talk,

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:53.606
we will list all the classes we

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.066
have in our system and we'll

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.436
mention a few interesting things

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:57.466
about each one class.

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.796
And in the end, Marin is going

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:01.986
to show us how to adopt ClassKit

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:02.836
in an existing cap.

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:05.726
So, let's get started with the

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:06.500
Overview.

00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:11.526
ClassKit is an education-based

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:13.186
framework which means that it is

00:01:13.186 --> 00:01:14.436
designed to work with in a

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:15.316
school environment.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.766
It allows you to define

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:21.756
assignable content from your

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:23.476
app, so that teachers can assign

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:25.186
it to students as homework.

00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:28.936
Then it allows you to report

00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:30.276
progress on those pieces of

00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:32.256
content that were assigned by

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:32.666
teachers.

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:36.016
And this is done with privacy in

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:36.346
mind.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.276
What I mean by that is that you

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:40.936
can report progress on any

00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:42.436
assignable piece of content

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.666
within your app, but teachers

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.266
will only see progress on the

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:47.716
things that they have explicitly

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:48.616
assigned to students.

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.346
So, why would you adopt

00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:53.806
ClassKit?

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:55.716
Well, for one, this will get a

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.036
better student experience.

00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:00.606
Teacher workflow, because they

00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:01.946
will be able to know exactly

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:02.916
what's assignable within your

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:04.596
app and assign it to students.

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.976
It gives teachers insights

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:11.156
within how students are doing in

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:12.216
your app.

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:14.706
And this enables personalized

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:15.006
learning.

00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:17.386
If a teacher knows how students

00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:18.456
are doing within your app

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:19.836
exactly, they'll be able to

00:02:19.836 --> 00:02:22.566
better cater future homework

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:23.026
assignments.

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:25.736
Lastly, well, it also gives you

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:27.006
a competitive advantage.

00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:28.686
This is because with teachers

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:31.496
while the type of information is

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:33.226
surfaced back to them, chances

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:35.486
are that they will be advocating

00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:37.436
for your framework to -- for

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:39.456
your app to be used within the

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:39.736
school.

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:42.686
Speaking of schools, there's a

00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:44.806
related technology called Apple

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:48.026
School Manager, and school

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:51.416
admins and IT use this to create

00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:53.506
managed Apple IDs for everybody

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:55.366
within their organization.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.676
So, every teacher will get a

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.456
managed Apple ID and all

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:00.926
students will get managed Apple

00:03:00.926 --> 00:03:01.146
IDs.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:03.746
Admins also use it to create

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:05.246
classes within a school, so for

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:08.116
example, in mathematics class we

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:11.206
will have a teacher with --

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.556
which is a person with a certain

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:14.236
managed Apple ID and students,

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.086
which are people with other

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:16.926
managed Apple IDs.

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.086
This is also where schools

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:21.646
manage all of their content and

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:22.176
devices.

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:24.986
And as we mentioned for

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:27.036
competitive advantage, this is

00:03:28.516 --> 00:03:30.236
where schools will be able to

00:03:30.656 --> 00:03:32.976
enable student progress reports

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:35.516
in feature of ClassKit.

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.196
Also, this is where schools are

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:40.836
able to purchase apps in bulk.

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:44.826
And any app that has enabled

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:46.736
ClassKit support, we'll have

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:48.496
works with Schoolwork checkmark

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:51.436
next to its name.

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:53.196
So, Schoolwork is the new

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:55.186
education app that is coming out

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:55.496
soon.

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:58.566
Students use this app to view

00:03:58.686 --> 00:03:59.936
handouts that were assigned to

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:01.256
them.

00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:03.866
And teachers use it to create

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:05.276
homework assignments.

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:06.556
And homework assignments, we

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:08.206
call handouts within our system.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.056
Handouts is just a collection of

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:11.306
tasks.

00:04:11.306 --> 00:04:13.666
For example, a piece of content

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:15.506
might be a task within a

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:16.000
handout.

00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:20.656
So, this is also the place where

00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:23.296
teachers will view progress

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.606
reports of how students are

00:04:24.606 --> 00:04:26.676
doing within your app for a

00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:27.366
given handout.

00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:30.116
So, let's actually take a walk,

00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:31.926
what the life cycle of a handout

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:32.096
is.

00:04:33.596 --> 00:04:36.666
But before we can create the

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:39.086
handout, your app actually needs

00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:41.496
to be able to declare what

00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:42.766
pieces of content are

00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:43.276
assignable.

00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:47.326
Within our framework, this is

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:49.166
done using a cross code CLS

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:49.816
Context.

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:53.066
And what a CLS Context is, is

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.626
that it allows you to represent

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:55.866
your content as a tree

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:56.316
structure.

00:04:57.286 --> 00:04:59.616
So, there is one main app

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:04.686
context redefined for your app.

00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:07.066
And this acts as the root

00:05:07.136 --> 00:05:08.736
context of the content tree --

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:09.866
or the context tree.

00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:12.516
Also, all of your content is

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:14.356
just a descendant of the main

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.106
app context.

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:20.546
So, we ask that you define your

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:23.236
content as accurately as

00:05:23.296 --> 00:05:24.926
possible because the sooner you

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:26.336
define your content, the sooner

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.016
it will be available to teachers

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:31.776
in Schoolwork to assign to

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:32.926
students.

00:05:32.996 --> 00:05:34.096
Assuming that you've created

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:36.076
your context tree, a teacher

00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:37.186
will be able to go to

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:39.386
Schoolwork, they will be able to

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.976
tap the Create New Handout

00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:43.526
button, which will create a new

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:44.436
instance of a handout.

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:47.646
Then they will point the handout

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:49.096
to a specific piece of content

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:50.946
within your app, and once

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:51.776
they've done that, they will

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:54.606
assign the handout to a student.

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:56.816
Once a student receives that

00:05:56.896 --> 00:05:59.246
handout, they will then tap on

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:00.716
the handout which will open your

00:06:00.716 --> 00:06:00.856
app.

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:03.116
At that point, your app should

00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:05.406
create the necessary contexts.

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:09.186
And for a better student

00:06:09.186 --> 00:06:10.766
experience, we ask that you

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:13.396
navigate the student to the same

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:15.756
piece of content.

00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:17.216
Marin is going to show us later

00:06:17.216 --> 00:06:18.316
how this is done in code.

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:21.706
So, assuming that now the

00:06:21.706 --> 00:06:23.126
student started working on the

00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:25.136
homework assignment, your app

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:26.756
starts reporting progress back

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:28.846
to students and all of this

00:06:28.896 --> 00:06:30.086
progress will be sent to the

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:31.696
teacher's device and bundled in

00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:33.446
what we call a progress record

00:06:33.876 --> 00:06:35.366
-- a report, or activity report.

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:39.106
So, teachers, once this is done,

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:40.646
will have access to that report

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:41.956
from within the assigned

00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:42.346
handout.

00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:48.346
So, this entire flow involves

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:50.846
you having a teacher managed ID,

00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:54.016
a student managed ID, and maybe

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:55.856
a couple of devices or even one

00:06:55.856 --> 00:06:57.066
device from which you'll be

00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:59.096
logging in and out, so you can

00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:00.496
test.

00:07:01.786 --> 00:07:02.866
But with all that, we can

00:07:02.866 --> 00:07:04.826
actually make this a little

00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:07.486
better and we created something

00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:08.816
that we call Developer Mode.

00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:12.266
What Developer Mode does is that

00:07:12.326 --> 00:07:14.746
it allows you to act as a

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:18.656
teacher, so that you can create

00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:20.216
handout assignments, assign them

00:07:20.216 --> 00:07:22.146
to students, and view progress

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:24.066
reports for your students, and

00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:25.966
it also allows you to act as a

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:27.126
student, so you can consume

00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:29.226
those handouts and your app can

00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:30.396
report progress back to

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:30.796
teachers.

00:07:33.226 --> 00:07:34.786
There's also a way to reset the

00:07:34.786 --> 00:07:36.756
development data and I

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.066
personally had to use this

00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:40.316
button quite a bit, to be

00:07:40.316 --> 00:07:40.676
honest.

00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:43.726
With that, let's take a look at

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:44.786
the classes we have in our

00:07:44.786 --> 00:07:45.236
framework.

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:48.206
At the very top, we have a Data

00:07:48.206 --> 00:07:48.526
Store.

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:52.286
It is used to maintain the

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:54.946
Context Tree, within our app.

00:07:57.356 --> 00:07:59.236
This is also where the main app

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:00.526
context is exposed as a

00:08:00.586 --> 00:08:01.146
property.

00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:04.286
And the Data Store also gives

00:08:04.366 --> 00:08:06.246
tracks of all modified objects

00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:06.876
within the system.

00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:09.356
So, if you'd like to save those

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:12.866
object, you can call CLS Data

00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:15.466
Store, Save with Completion.

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:19.856
I'd like to mention also that

00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:21.876
there is one shared instance of

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.296
the Data Store that you use to

00:08:23.296 --> 00:08:24.076
interact with.

00:08:25.356 --> 00:08:29.826
So, next, let's talk about

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:30.926
contexts.

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:34.346
We saw that contexts are a three

00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:37.126
hierarchy, and Marin is actually

00:08:37.126 --> 00:08:38.456
going to go in detail later

00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:40.076
about contexts, how to use them

00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:41.946
and mention some interesting

00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:44.135
properties about them, but I'd

00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:46.196
like to concentrate on Context

00:08:46.196 --> 00:08:46.816
Identity.

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:51.326
So, identity of a context in

00:08:51.326 --> 00:08:52.576
ClassKit is two things.

00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:54.856
The first one is the Identifier

00:08:54.856 --> 00:08:57.946
Property, and the Identifier

00:08:57.946 --> 00:08:59.656
Property allows you to uniquely

00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:02.336
identify contexts across

00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:02.846
siblings.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.916
What I mean by this is that it's

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:07.286
okay for you to have a context

00:09:07.286 --> 00:09:08.346
with the same identifier,

00:09:08.666 --> 00:09:10.046
multiple contexts with the same

00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:11.736
identifier, as long as they

00:09:11.736 --> 00:09:12.816
don't have the same parent,

00:09:13.496 --> 00:09:14.416
which will be fine.

00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:17.506
So, that [inaudible] is

00:09:17.566 --> 00:09:18.856
something we call Context

00:09:18.856 --> 00:09:20.406
Identifier Path.

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:22.696
Context Identifier Paths are

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:24.206
what we actually use to uniquely

00:09:24.206 --> 00:09:26.086
identify context within the

00:09:26.156 --> 00:09:29.026
tree, within the context tree.

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:30.716
And what Context Identifier

00:09:30.716 --> 00:09:32.186
Paths are, well, it's just an

00:09:32.186 --> 00:09:33.476
area of Context Identifiers.

00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:35.986
The way we use them is that we

00:09:36.436 --> 00:09:38.156
traverse the Context [inaudible]

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:40.436
following the path, until we

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:42.756
reach a note there -- the last

00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:45.356
note within the path.

00:09:45.546 --> 00:09:46.726
Let's actually take a walk how

00:09:46.726 --> 00:09:48.966
this looks in action.

00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:51.556
In this example, we have a

00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:53.176
context card that's pointing to

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.976
Section 1 Context within some

00:09:55.016 --> 00:09:56.006
chapter, within some book.

00:09:56.786 --> 00:09:58.536
And we also have our Context

00:09:58.536 --> 00:09:58.666
Tree.

00:09:59.276 --> 00:10:00.746
To find Section 1, we will first

00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:02.216
visit the App Context.

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.216
Then we'll visit the Book

00:10:04.216 --> 00:10:04.806
Context.

00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:05.986
We will find the [inaudible] of

00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:07.536
the Book Context with Identifier

00:10:07.596 --> 00:10:08.116
Chapter 2.

00:10:08.116 --> 00:10:10.266
We will visit that one, and we

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:11.586
will do the same for Section 1.

00:10:12.586 --> 00:10:14.196
Since Section 1 is the last

00:10:14.266 --> 00:10:15.946
thing on our path, then this is

00:10:15.946 --> 00:10:18.236
what the path is referring to.

00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:22.416
So, we have a few ways to look

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:23.916
up contexts with our system.

00:10:24.806 --> 00:10:26.396
One is using absolute context

00:10:26.446 --> 00:10:27.786
paths, and to do that, you would

00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:30.226
call the CLS Data Store Context

00:10:30.266 --> 00:10:32.546
Matching Identifier Path Method.

00:10:34.096 --> 00:10:36.036
The completion block of this

00:10:36.116 --> 00:10:38.676
method will return all contexts

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:39.396
among the paths.

00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:42.026
So, for example, it will be an

00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:43.796
array of the Up Context, Book

00:10:43.836 --> 00:10:45.736
Context, Chapter 2 Context, and

00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:46.686
Section 1 Context.

00:10:48.016 --> 00:10:49.546
If for some reason, Chapter 2 in

00:10:49.546 --> 00:10:52.296
Section 1 was missing, then that

00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:53.736
array in the completion block

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.956
will just continue to Up Context

00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:56.776
and the Book Context.

00:10:57.966 --> 00:10:59.376
And that gives you a chance to

00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:01.566
create the missing context as

00:11:01.566 --> 00:11:02.586
something else.

00:11:03.216 --> 00:11:04.466
There's also a way to look up

00:11:04.466 --> 00:11:07.016
contexts using relative paths.

00:11:07.116 --> 00:11:08.406
This is useful if you already

00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:09.606
have a reference to a context,

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:10.526
but you would like to find a

00:11:10.526 --> 00:11:11.786
descendent of it.

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:13.756
And the method for that is

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.006
called CLS Context Descendent

00:11:15.006 --> 00:11:15.976
Matching Identifier Path.

00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:18.806
The difference is that here you

00:11:18.806 --> 00:11:20.436
will either get the context

00:11:20.436 --> 00:11:22.566
[inaudible] if it doesn't match

00:11:23.156 --> 00:11:24.386
the path.

00:11:24.576 --> 00:11:26.746
There's also a genetic way to

00:11:26.746 --> 00:11:27.896
[inaudible] contexts and this is

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.276
done using CLS Data Store

00:11:31.726 --> 00:11:32.906
Context Matching Predicate.

00:11:33.296 --> 00:11:34.706
On the example from the slide,

00:11:34.776 --> 00:11:35.886
we're showing you how to find

00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:38.106
all children of a given context.

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:42.106
So, there's also a Data Store

00:11:42.106 --> 00:11:42.726
delegate.

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:45.366
This is used in conjunction with

00:11:45.446 --> 00:11:48.226
the path quitting methods that

00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:52.146
we just saw.

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:54.356
The definition of the decoration

00:11:54.356 --> 00:11:55.636
of the delegation is on the

00:11:55.856 --> 00:11:56.000
screen.

00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:00.966
It's usually useful to use this

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:02.346
when your contexts are

00:12:02.846 --> 00:12:04.586
downloaded on demand to -- when

00:12:04.846 --> 00:12:05.946
all of your context is not

00:12:05.946 --> 00:12:07.656
available, so you want to create

00:12:07.656 --> 00:12:08.356
things on demand.

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:10.926
The way it works is that as we

00:12:11.036 --> 00:12:13.176
start querying for a path, for

00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:14.716
our contexts among the path, if

00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:17.696
you don't find a context on that

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:20.426
path, we will call the Create

00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:22.116
Context for Identifier Method

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.396
under Delegate that you've

00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:25.186
defined, giving you a chance to

00:12:25.186 --> 00:12:26.396
create the missing context.

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:28.706
And if you do create a context,

00:12:29.106 --> 00:12:30.626
we will take the context and go

00:12:30.846 --> 00:12:31.986
add it to the correct place on

00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:33.286
the tree for you.

00:12:35.376 --> 00:12:37.806
So, as I mentioned, it's useful

00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:38.996
for app for -- with dynamic

00:12:38.996 --> 00:12:39.386
content.

00:12:40.056 --> 00:12:40.956
Let's actually take a look at

00:12:40.956 --> 00:12:42.236
how this work in action.

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:44.386
Again, we have the same

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:46.386
identifier path, but in this

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:47.996
case, our tree is incomplete.

00:12:48.636 --> 00:12:51.246
And we also have a delegate.

00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:53.406
So again, we will visit the App

00:12:53.616 --> 00:12:54.256
Context.

00:12:55.336 --> 00:12:56.416
Then we'll visit the Book

00:12:56.416 --> 00:12:56.826
Context.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.676
Then we are going to try to

00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:02.586
visit the Chapter 2 Context, but

00:13:02.586 --> 00:13:03.326
it doesn't exist.

00:13:03.726 --> 00:13:04.846
So, we are going to ask a

00:13:04.846 --> 00:13:05.906
delegate to create it.

00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:08.086
If a delegate creates it, we

00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:09.556
will then attach it to the

00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:11.446
correct place on the tree, and

00:13:11.446 --> 00:13:12.506
we'll visit that context.

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.176
Then we're going to build the

00:13:14.176 --> 00:13:17.206
same thing for our Section 1.

00:13:18.326 --> 00:13:19.576
Again, since section 1 is the

00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:21.136
last thing on the path, that

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:22.536
means that this is what a path

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:25.936
is referring to.

00:13:26.176 --> 00:13:28.256
Next, let's talk about Activity

00:13:28.256 --> 00:13:28.706
Objects.

00:13:29.486 --> 00:13:31.806
So, Activity Objects are

00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:32.886
actually the objects which you

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:34.966
will use to report progress back

00:13:35.056 --> 00:13:35.616
to teachers.

00:13:36.276 --> 00:13:38.306
And they actually translate to

00:13:38.306 --> 00:13:39.296
Activity Reports.

00:13:39.726 --> 00:13:43.626
Activity Objects are always

00:13:43.626 --> 00:13:46.116
associated with contexts.

00:13:46.546 --> 00:13:48.156
You can officially allocate one

00:13:48.156 --> 00:13:48.646
on your own.

00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:50.966
And the way you would create a

00:13:50.966 --> 00:13:54.256
new one is by calling CLS

00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:55.746
Context Creating New Activity,

00:13:56.286 --> 00:13:57.776
which will return a new activity

00:13:57.776 --> 00:13:59.506
object associated with the

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:00.416
receiver of the method.

00:14:02.136 --> 00:14:03.836
If you would like to see if

00:14:03.836 --> 00:14:05.006
there's currently an activity

00:14:05.006 --> 00:14:07.986
associated with your context,

00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:09.706
you can do so by querying for

00:14:09.706 --> 00:14:11.426
the current activity property on

00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:12.236
the CLS Context.

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:15.996
I'd like to mention that every

00:14:15.996 --> 00:14:16.996
time you co-create a new

00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:19.186
activity, this is the same thing

00:14:19.256 --> 00:14:20.786
as starting a new attempt at

00:14:20.786 --> 00:14:23.356
that activity, meaning that a

00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:24.806
teacher would receive a new

00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:26.246
progress report.

00:14:26.886 --> 00:14:31.216
Let's take a look at how would

00:14:31.216 --> 00:14:32.586
you add progress to an activity.

00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:34.406
One way is to directly set the

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:35.396
progress property.

00:14:36.396 --> 00:14:38.296
And that one is to add a

00:14:38.946 --> 00:14:40.666
progress range, from a start to

00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:40.956
an end.

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:43.646
Also, know that setting the

00:14:43.646 --> 00:14:45.416
progress property directly is

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.326
the same thing as adding a

00:14:47.496 --> 00:14:48.776
progress range for the start of

00:14:48.776 --> 00:14:49.016
zero.

00:14:49.276 --> 00:14:52.816
I'd like to also mention that

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:54.006
it's perfectly fine for you to

00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:56.426
add overlapping progresses

00:14:56.426 --> 00:14:57.906
arranges or even the same

00:14:57.906 --> 00:14:58.976
progress arranged multiple

00:14:59.006 --> 00:14:59.256
times.

00:15:00.106 --> 00:15:01.556
Underneath, we take care of the

00:15:01.556 --> 00:15:04.166
details to make sure that the

00:15:04.216 --> 00:15:05.826
correct progress is reported to

00:15:05.826 --> 00:15:08.366
teachers in the end.

00:15:08.576 --> 00:15:11.156
So, there's one more object that

00:15:11.156 --> 00:15:12.606
we should talk about and that's

00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:13.786
Activity Items.

00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:18.336
What an Activity Item is, is a

00:15:18.596 --> 00:15:20.606
quantity that you would

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:21.586
[inaudible] to represent to

00:15:21.586 --> 00:15:23.506
teachers as part of your report.

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:26.826
Each activity can have one

00:15:26.986 --> 00:15:29.106
primary activity item, and this

00:15:29.106 --> 00:15:30.296
would be the main piece of

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:31.836
information you would

00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:34.336
[inaudible] to teachers that's

00:15:34.336 --> 00:15:35.306
apart from progress.

00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:38.126
For example, this is useful for

00:15:38.126 --> 00:15:41.076
a final score of a quiz.

00:15:41.306 --> 00:15:42.636
You can also have multiple

00:15:42.636 --> 00:15:45.426
additional activity items, which

00:15:45.426 --> 00:15:47.956
you would use to add and show

00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:49.246
extra information to teachers.

00:15:49.246 --> 00:15:51.376
Like for example, how many hints

00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:53.016
were given to a student, answer

00:15:53.016 --> 00:15:55.896
to individual questions, and

00:15:56.296 --> 00:15:56.660
etcetera.

00:15:57.546 --> 00:15:59.416
So, Activity Itemization and

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.066
Abstract Class, and in our

00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:03.366
system, we have defined at the

00:16:03.366 --> 00:16:04.626
moment, three subclasses.

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:07.396
One of them is CLS Quantity

00:16:07.396 --> 00:16:07.776
Item.

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:09.606
This is useful for simple scalar

00:16:09.606 --> 00:16:10.886
quantities like hints,

00:16:11.476 --> 00:16:13.056
experience points, and things

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:13.876
like that.

00:16:14.456 --> 00:16:16.176
We also have a score item which

00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:18.046
is useful to represent X out of

00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:18.896
Y quantities.

00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:21.996
For example, final score of a

00:16:21.996 --> 00:16:23.946
quiz might be useful for this.

00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:26.886
And we also have a Binary Item.

00:16:28.006 --> 00:16:30.696
And this one is used to answer

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:32.456
Yes or No questions, type of

00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:32.856
questions.

00:16:33.366 --> 00:16:35.996
Let's take a look at how would

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.666
you add a primary activity item

00:16:37.776 --> 00:16:38.726
to an activity.

00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:40.156
Well, you will do that by first

00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:41.346
creating an activity item.

00:16:41.986 --> 00:16:42.896
In the [inaudible], we're

00:16:42.896 --> 00:16:44.546
showing you how to create a

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.186
Score Item with a title of Total

00:16:46.186 --> 00:16:46.576
Score.

00:16:47.376 --> 00:16:49.286
And then to associate it as a

00:16:49.286 --> 00:16:50.676
primary activity item

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.416
[inaudible] activity, you will

00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:52.946
set it -- you will set the

00:16:53.016 --> 00:16:54.806
primary activity item property

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:55.566
of an activity.

00:16:56.026 --> 00:16:59.856
To add an additional activity

00:16:59.856 --> 00:17:01.176
item, you will again create a

00:17:01.176 --> 00:17:02.126
new Activity Item.

00:17:02.736 --> 00:17:03.816
In the [inaudible] size, we're

00:17:03.816 --> 00:17:05.246
showing how to create a quantity

00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:07.766
item with a type of hints, and

00:17:07.766 --> 00:17:09.195
then some quantity.

00:17:09.766 --> 00:17:11.346
To associate it with an

00:17:11.346 --> 00:17:13.806
activity, you would call CLS

00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:15.506
Activity Add Additional Activity

00:17:15.506 --> 00:17:18.465
Item after passing the item you

00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:19.096
just created.

00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.465
At that point, this activity

00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:22.435
item will be associated with

00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:22.886
activity.

00:17:24.066 --> 00:17:26.435
So, there's some best practices

00:17:26.435 --> 00:17:27.746
when dealing with activity

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:28.086
items.

00:17:29.276 --> 00:17:32.056
One of them is to always save

00:17:32.116 --> 00:17:33.676
the subclass for a primary

00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:34.326
activity item.

00:17:35.636 --> 00:17:36.686
What I mean by that is that

00:17:37.086 --> 00:17:38.956
imagine a teacher assigns the

00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:40.566
same context to two students.

00:17:41.516 --> 00:17:44.106
You know, Student A device, you

00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:46.346
set the primary activity item as

00:17:46.346 --> 00:17:46.926
a score item.

00:17:47.976 --> 00:17:49.756
On Student B device, you set the

00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:51.586
primary activity item as a

00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:52.336
binary item.

00:17:53.016 --> 00:17:54.266
Well, if you do that, we can't

00:17:54.266 --> 00:17:56.126
actually generate an aggregated

00:17:56.126 --> 00:17:58.096
report back to teacher because

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.046
there's no clear heuristic of

00:18:01.126 --> 00:18:02.586
how to convert from a score item

00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:04.016
to a binary, or vice versa.

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:05.936
Because of that, it is best to

00:18:05.936 --> 00:18:08.426
always have the same subclass of

00:18:08.426 --> 00:18:10.086
an activity item as the primary

00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:10.606
activity item.

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:13.496
Also, please provide clear,

00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:15.766
concise, but descriptive titles

00:18:15.766 --> 00:18:16.766
to your activity items.

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:18.936
This is because the titles that

00:18:18.936 --> 00:18:20.246
you set on your activity items

00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:21.846
will be visible to teachers in

00:18:21.846 --> 00:18:22.366
their report.

00:18:22.896 --> 00:18:26.546
And please make use of

00:18:26.546 --> 00:18:27.636
additional activity items.

00:18:27.636 --> 00:18:29.136
They're a great way to provide

00:18:30.036 --> 00:18:31.476
the extra information that

00:18:31.526 --> 00:18:32.886
teachers will actually need to

00:18:32.966 --> 00:18:34.506
truly understand how students

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:37.786
are doing within your app.

00:18:37.786 --> 00:18:38.916
With that, I'd like to invite

00:18:39.006 --> 00:18:40.316
Marin to the stage who is going

00:18:40.316 --> 00:18:41.746
to show us how all of this works

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:42.156
in action.

00:18:43.516 --> 00:18:50.796
[ Applause ]

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.576
>> Hello, everyone.

00:18:53.226 --> 00:18:54.896
My name is Marin, and I'm an

00:18:54.996 --> 00:18:56.576
engineer on the ClassKit Team.

00:18:57.226 --> 00:18:59.686
And I would like to show you how

00:18:59.686 --> 00:19:01.526
to adopt ClassKit into a

00:19:01.526 --> 00:19:02.506
preexisting app.

00:19:03.316 --> 00:19:05.366
So, to do this, Pavel and I went

00:19:05.446 --> 00:19:07.956
ahead and built a sample app.

00:19:07.956 --> 00:19:09.146
The sample app is called

00:19:09.146 --> 00:19:09.626
Quizler.

00:19:10.206 --> 00:19:12.576
It's a simple, math, quiz-taking

00:19:13.106 --> 00:19:13.173
app.

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:15.256
The very first screen that you

00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:17.476
get asks you to select what type

00:19:17.476 --> 00:19:18.706
of math you'd like to be quizzed

00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:18.946
on.

00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:20.816
So, let's go ahead and select

00:19:20.856 --> 00:19:21.576
the addition quiz.

00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:24.146
Once we do that, we'll get

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:26.216
presented with another view that

00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:27.956
asks us if we'd like to view the

00:19:27.956 --> 00:19:29.716
scoreboard of all the users'

00:19:29.716 --> 00:19:32.466
high scores, or if we just want

00:19:32.466 --> 00:19:33.446
to start the quiz.

00:19:34.046 --> 00:19:36.326
So, let's go ahead and tap Start

00:19:36.896 --> 00:19:37.036
Quiz.

00:19:37.216 --> 00:19:39.196
Then, we get presented with each

00:19:39.246 --> 00:19:40.256
one of our questions.

00:19:41.006 --> 00:19:42.086
We're just going to answer them,

00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:44.386
and we get a total score at the

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:44.626
end.

00:19:45.746 --> 00:19:47.456
So now that we understand what

00:19:47.456 --> 00:19:49.566
this sample app does, let's talk

00:19:49.566 --> 00:19:50.906
about the steps that we'll take

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.196
to adopt ClassKit.

00:19:53.636 --> 00:19:55.396
So first we will talk about what

00:19:55.396 --> 00:19:57.666
type of activity -- context data

00:19:58.076 --> 00:20:01.136
makes sense for our sample app.

00:20:01.136 --> 00:20:03.286
After we do that, we'll discuss

00:20:03.406 --> 00:20:05.396
what type of student generated

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:07.276
activity data, might also make

00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:07.596
sense.

00:20:08.906 --> 00:20:10.206
We'll make sure that we support

00:20:10.236 --> 00:20:10.966
deep-linking.

00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:12.726
Now, there's two ways to do

00:20:12.726 --> 00:20:12.956
this.

00:20:13.696 --> 00:20:15.106
The first way is to use

00:20:15.106 --> 00:20:15.946
universal links.

00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:18.556
So, if you already adopted

00:20:18.556 --> 00:20:19.996
universal links within your

00:20:19.996 --> 00:20:21.806
applications, you can simply

00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:23.576
just set the universal link

00:20:23.616 --> 00:20:25.326
property that lives on CLS

00:20:25.496 --> 00:20:25.926
Context.

00:20:27.556 --> 00:20:29.746
Now, our sample app does not

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:31.486
support universal links, so I'm

00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:32.486
going to show you the second

00:20:32.486 --> 00:20:34.476
approach, which is to use NS

00:20:34.656 --> 00:20:36.186
User Activities Continue

00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:37.146
Restoration Handler.

00:20:38.586 --> 00:20:40.156
Then we'll make sure that we

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.386
test our implementation using

00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:44.426
Developer Mode and the

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:46.206
Schoolwork app.

00:20:46.546 --> 00:20:47.896
So, now let's talk about what

00:20:48.006 --> 00:20:49.826
type of context structure might

00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:51.836
make sense for this app.

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:53.486
As a first approach, we might

00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:56.546
decide to do a one-to-one map of

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:58.526
RUI to a Context Tree.

00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:00.906
And if we did that, we would end

00:21:00.906 --> 00:21:02.226
up with a structure that looks

00:21:02.226 --> 00:21:02.936
something like this.

00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:06.006
At the top level, we have our

00:21:06.006 --> 00:21:07.636
main app context, which is our

00:21:07.636 --> 00:21:08.796
Quizzler app.

00:21:09.246 --> 00:21:11.256
Beneath that, we have our

00:21:11.256 --> 00:21:12.776
Addition Context and a

00:21:12.776 --> 00:21:13.986
Multiplication Context.

00:21:14.656 --> 00:21:15.966
And then beneath each one of

00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:17.886
those, we have the Scoreboard

00:21:17.886 --> 00:21:20.316
Context and then the actual Quiz

00:21:20.316 --> 00:21:20.866
Context.

00:21:21.866 --> 00:21:24.846
Now, Pavel told us that a

00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:26.836
context is a part of our

00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:29.156
application that a teacher will

00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:30.376
assign to their students.

00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:32.406
So, if we keep that in mind,

00:21:32.716 --> 00:21:33.986
let's first talk about the

00:21:33.986 --> 00:21:34.926
Scoreboard Context.

00:21:36.146 --> 00:21:39.376
Well, what is the Scoreboard

00:21:39.376 --> 00:21:39.876
Context?

00:21:40.476 --> 00:21:42.016
It's all the users' high scores.

00:21:42.916 --> 00:21:44.726
Now, does that really make sense

00:21:45.076 --> 00:21:46.846
for a teacher to assign to their

00:21:46.846 --> 00:21:47.426
students?

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:49.766
Not really.

00:21:50.066 --> 00:21:51.416
So, we're going to go ahead and

00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:52.566
remove that.

00:21:53.056 --> 00:21:54.296
Now, we're left with a structure

00:21:54.436 --> 00:21:55.416
that looks something like this.

00:21:56.646 --> 00:21:58.636
So, next let's focus on the

00:21:58.636 --> 00:21:59.566
Addition Context.

00:22:00.356 --> 00:22:01.886
What is the Addition Context

00:22:01.886 --> 00:22:03.376
within our application?

00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:05.706
Isn't it really just the

00:22:05.706 --> 00:22:06.566
addition quiz?

00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:08.706
It's really just one thing.

00:22:09.016 --> 00:22:09.626
It's not two.

00:22:09.626 --> 00:22:11.406
So, those really should be

00:22:11.406 --> 00:22:12.486
combined into one.

00:22:13.026 --> 00:22:14.246
So, let's go ahead and do that

00:22:14.386 --> 00:22:16.166
and then the same goes for the

00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:17.466
multiplication context.

00:22:18.246 --> 00:22:20.026
Now, we're left with a structure

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:22.056
that looks something like this.

00:22:22.316 --> 00:22:23.996
Now, Pavel and I talked about

00:22:24.586 --> 00:22:26.856
it, and we decided that we may

00:22:27.316 --> 00:22:29.776
add a subtraction quiz and a

00:22:29.776 --> 00:22:31.146
division quiz in the future.

00:22:31.146 --> 00:22:32.986
And if we did that, we could

00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:35.356
easily add those as siblings.

00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:37.586
Now, when you all are thinking

00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:39.056
about which structure makes

00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:40.706
sense for your applications,

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.146
don't just think about your

00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:44.056
current feature set, but also

00:22:44.056 --> 00:22:45.396
consider what you might be doing

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:46.946
in the future, and make sure

00:22:46.946 --> 00:22:48.456
that your structure will easily

00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:49.776
grow with you.

00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:52.106
So now, let's talk about the

00:22:52.106 --> 00:22:53.106
context themselves.

00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:55.326
We want to make sure that we

00:22:55.326 --> 00:22:57.546
have clear titles, and that's

00:22:57.596 --> 00:22:59.846
because the title is the one

00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.636
piece of information that both

00:23:01.706 --> 00:23:03.456
students and teachers will have

00:23:03.936 --> 00:23:05.406
to know what this context

00:23:05.726 --> 00:23:06.416
represents.

00:23:07.736 --> 00:23:09.136
We also want to define our

00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:11.366
context as early as possible.

00:23:12.166 --> 00:23:13.806
For our sample app, we have

00:23:13.946 --> 00:23:14.696
static content.

00:23:15.296 --> 00:23:16.966
And so, we'll know what context

00:23:16.966 --> 00:23:18.486
to write as soon as the app

00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:19.176
launches.

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:20.836
So, that's when we'll define

00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:21.706
ours.

00:23:22.666 --> 00:23:24.926
Now, we might also want to

00:23:24.926 --> 00:23:26.586
always display our context in a

00:23:26.586 --> 00:23:28.286
particular order for teachers

00:23:28.286 --> 00:23:29.416
that makes sense.

00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:31.886
So, for our sample app, that

00:23:31.886 --> 00:23:33.876
might mean our addition context

00:23:34.016 --> 00:23:35.046
should probably also be

00:23:35.296 --> 00:23:37.096
displayed above the

00:23:37.096 --> 00:23:38.486
multiplication context.

00:23:39.036 --> 00:23:40.446
So, to do that, we'll take

00:23:40.446 --> 00:23:42.236
advantage of the Display Order

00:23:42.236 --> 00:23:44.036
Property that lives on CLS

00:23:44.206 --> 00:23:44.636
Context.

00:23:45.256 --> 00:23:47.656
Now that we've determined what

00:23:47.656 --> 00:23:49.386
type of context data we're going

00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:50.416
to write, let's talk about the

00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:52.016
student generated activity.

00:23:52.546 --> 00:23:55.326
Here, I have a screenshot of the

00:23:55.326 --> 00:23:57.246
Schoolwork App, and this is a

00:23:57.366 --> 00:23:59.656
sample of what some activity

00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:00.786
data might look like.

00:24:01.996 --> 00:24:03.486
For our quiz, I think it

00:24:03.486 --> 00:24:05.176
definitely makes sense to track

00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:06.916
the total amount of time that a

00:24:06.916 --> 00:24:08.776
student spends taking this quiz.

00:24:09.596 --> 00:24:11.556
So, to do this, we can go ahead

00:24:11.556 --> 00:24:13.656
and call the Start and Stop

00:24:13.656 --> 00:24:15.236
Methods that live on CLS

00:24:15.346 --> 00:24:15.906
Activity.

00:24:17.246 --> 00:24:19.316
Now, it might also be nice to

00:24:19.316 --> 00:24:20.986
show what the total score was

00:24:20.986 --> 00:24:22.086
that the student received.

00:24:23.116 --> 00:24:24.846
And if we think about it, the

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:27.746
total score is probably the most

00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:29.646
important piece of information

00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:30.996
about this whole quiz.

00:24:31.566 --> 00:24:32.616
So, we probably want to

00:24:32.616 --> 00:24:33.526
highlight it within the

00:24:33.526 --> 00:24:35.446
Schoolwork UI like we have here.

00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:37.916
Well, to do this, we can go

00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:40.176
ahead and create a CLS Score

00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:42.256
Item, and then we'll set it as

00:24:42.256 --> 00:24:44.086
the primary activity item.

00:24:44.086 --> 00:24:45.286
That way, it will get

00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:47.906
highlighted within the

00:24:48.436 --> 00:24:48.776
Schoolwork UI.

00:24:48.776 --> 00:24:51.066
Now, it might also be nice to

00:24:51.066 --> 00:24:52.586
indicate whether an individual

00:24:52.586 --> 00:24:54.506
question was correct or not.

00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:57.646
So, to do this, we can go ahead

00:24:57.936 --> 00:25:00.576
and create CLS Binary Items and

00:25:01.706 --> 00:25:03.436
we'll add each one of those as

00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:05.686
an additional activity item on

00:25:05.686 --> 00:25:06.316
our activity.

00:25:07.156 --> 00:25:08.876
So, now that we've determined

00:25:08.876 --> 00:25:10.266
what type of ClassKit close

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:12.096
we're going to write, let's go

00:25:12.566 --> 00:25:14.486
ahead and see what that actually

00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:19.746
looks like in action.

00:25:20.466 --> 00:25:21.686
So here, I'm mirroring my

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:23.696
display for you and have Xcode

00:25:23.696 --> 00:25:24.266
on screen.

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:26.236
The first thing that I'm going

00:25:26.236 --> 00:25:28.706
to do is select my project's

00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:29.046
target.

00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:31.306
Once I do that, I'm going to

00:25:31.306 --> 00:25:33.196
select the Capabilities Pane,

00:25:33.586 --> 00:25:34.766
and we're going to find the

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:36.386
ClassKit APIs right here.

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:38.846
Then, all we need to do is make

00:25:38.846 --> 00:25:40.806
sure that we toggle that on, and

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.326
we're all set to start writing

00:25:42.326 --> 00:25:43.396
some ClassKit code.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:46.176
So, first we're going to write

00:25:46.176 --> 00:25:48.006
our context and we said that we

00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:49.596
could do that as soon as the app

00:25:49.596 --> 00:25:50.136
launches.

00:25:50.736 --> 00:25:52.326
So, let's go ahead and open up

00:25:52.376 --> 00:25:53.266
the App Delegate.

00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:56.206
And in here, let's go ahead and

00:25:56.276 --> 00:25:57.786
create a function that will

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.186
publish our context for us.

00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:03.436
Here we have our published

00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:05.606
context function, and what we're

00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:06.676
going to do is we're going to

00:26:06.676 --> 00:26:08.836
instantiate an instance if CLS

00:26:08.906 --> 00:26:11.416
Context, passing in the type of

00:26:11.466 --> 00:26:14.786
context that this is, giving it

00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:17.166
a unique identifier, and then a

00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:19.166
nice, clear, and concise title.

00:26:20.136 --> 00:26:21.306
Then we make sure to set our

00:26:21.306 --> 00:26:23.116
display order because we want

00:26:23.116 --> 00:26:25.276
our addition quiz to display

00:26:25.276 --> 00:26:26.836
above our multiplication quiz.

00:26:27.846 --> 00:26:29.016
Then, we're going to do the same

00:26:29.016 --> 00:26:30.946
for our multiplication quiz and

00:26:30.996 --> 00:26:32.556
[inaudible] a context and make

00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:33.926
sure to set the display order.

00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:36.486
Once we do that, we're going to

00:26:36.486 --> 00:26:38.096
create a dictionary of our

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:39.796
context that we will need to

00:26:39.796 --> 00:26:40.276
create.

00:26:40.456 --> 00:26:43.046
Then, we're going to grab the

00:26:43.176 --> 00:26:44.896
parent context that we want to

00:26:44.896 --> 00:26:45.646
add these to.

00:26:46.236 --> 00:26:48.376
Since our structure is flat, we

00:26:48.376 --> 00:26:50.216
know that our parent context is

00:26:50.216 --> 00:26:51.856
always going to be our main app

00:26:52.156 --> 00:26:52.606
context.

00:26:53.786 --> 00:26:55.596
Now, let's issue a query to see

00:26:55.596 --> 00:26:57.506
if any of these contexts already

00:26:57.506 --> 00:26:57.786
exist.

00:26:58.526 --> 00:26:59.976
So, we're going to create a

00:27:00.626 --> 00:27:01.786
predicate, looking for all the

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.666
context where the parent is the

00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:04.836
parent we just defined.

00:27:05.826 --> 00:27:06.946
Then, we're going to issue that

00:27:06.976 --> 00:27:08.956
query to the CLS data store's

00:27:09.176 --> 00:27:10.106
shared instance.

00:27:11.216 --> 00:27:14.116
For all the context that match,

00:27:14.916 --> 00:27:16.536
this predicate we just defined.

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.416
This will return an array of

00:27:19.476 --> 00:27:20.066
context.

00:27:21.276 --> 00:27:22.696
We're just going to iterate over

00:27:22.796 --> 00:27:24.546
all of the context that we know

00:27:24.546 --> 00:27:25.366
already exist.

00:27:26.676 --> 00:27:28.066
Then, for each one of those

00:27:28.066 --> 00:27:29.426
contexts that's already there,

00:27:30.046 --> 00:27:31.126
we're going to remove it from

00:27:31.126 --> 00:27:32.726
our dictionary of context that

00:27:32.726 --> 00:27:33.646
we need to create.

00:27:34.136 --> 00:27:36.736
Then, we're going to iterate

00:27:36.736 --> 00:27:38.646
over the remaining contexts that

00:27:38.646 --> 00:27:40.906
do not exist, and for each of

00:27:40.906 --> 00:27:43.046
one those contexts, we're just

00:27:43.046 --> 00:27:44.576
going to add it as a child

00:27:44.606 --> 00:27:46.736
context to our parents.

00:27:48.076 --> 00:27:49.396
Then we call Save to Save our

00:27:49.396 --> 00:27:49.886
changes.

00:27:51.006 --> 00:27:52.646
Now, what we need to do is call

00:27:52.646 --> 00:27:54.156
this function when our app

00:27:54.156 --> 00:27:54.646
launches.

00:27:55.186 --> 00:27:59.296
So, let's go ahead and run this

00:27:59.296 --> 00:28:01.016
code to test that our contexts

00:28:01.076 --> 00:28:01.986
were actually created.

00:28:01.986 --> 00:28:04.646
Here, I have a device and I'm

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:05.986
mirroring my display for you.

00:28:06.976 --> 00:28:07.716
So, awesome.

00:28:07.716 --> 00:28:09.336
Our Quizzler app launched.

00:28:10.136 --> 00:28:12.086
But everything looks the same.

00:28:12.846 --> 00:28:14.386
So, how do we know that these

00:28:14.386 --> 00:28:16.286
contexts were actually created?

00:28:16.836 --> 00:28:17.926
Well, this is where we use

00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:19.546
Developer Mode and Schoolwork.

00:28:19.546 --> 00:28:20.956
So, I'm going to hit the Home

00:28:20.956 --> 00:28:23.256
button, and open up the settings

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:24.503
up.

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:25.766
Now, I'm going to scroll down

00:28:25.766 --> 00:28:26.646
and I'm going to look for the

00:28:26.646 --> 00:28:27.416
Developer Settings.

00:28:27.416 --> 00:28:29.716
When I select the Developer

00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:31.906
Settings, I'm going to see some

00:28:31.906 --> 00:28:33.036
ClassKit APIs.

00:28:33.866 --> 00:28:35.536
If I select the ClassKit APIs,

00:28:35.836 --> 00:28:37.576
we can see that we can switch

00:28:37.656 --> 00:28:38.796
and act as the role of the

00:28:38.796 --> 00:28:39.246
teacher.

00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:41.186
So, I just make sure I select

00:28:41.336 --> 00:28:41.706
that.

00:28:42.356 --> 00:28:43.656
And now, we can hit the Home

00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:45.346
button and open up the

00:28:45.346 --> 00:28:46.666
Schoolwork app.

00:28:48.096 --> 00:28:49.706
Now, when the Schoolwork app

00:28:49.706 --> 00:28:51.436
launches, I first get a Welcome

00:28:51.436 --> 00:28:51.896
screen.

00:28:52.226 --> 00:28:53.336
I'll go ahead and dismiss that.

00:28:53.916 --> 00:28:55.166
And then if we look in the top

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.626
right-hand corner, I can see

00:28:56.626 --> 00:28:57.786
that I have a plus button.

00:28:58.416 --> 00:28:59.526
That's how I know that I'm

00:28:59.526 --> 00:29:00.516
logged in as a teacher.

00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:02.596
If I tap on that plus button,

00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:04.506
I'll get the Create a New

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.316
Handout view.

00:29:05.946 --> 00:29:07.476
And I can add an activity.

00:29:08.516 --> 00:29:10.586
Then I can select Apps, and we

00:29:10.586 --> 00:29:11.716
can see our Quizler app is

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:12.206
showing up.

00:29:12.826 --> 00:29:15.306
If I select that, awesome, our

00:29:15.596 --> 00:29:16.566
contexts are there.

00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:17.796
So now, we've been able to

00:29:17.796 --> 00:29:19.146
validate that our contexts

00:29:19.256 --> 00:29:20.416
actually got created.

00:29:20.936 --> 00:29:22.516
I'd also like to point out that

00:29:22.546 --> 00:29:24.296
the addition quiz is displaying

00:29:24.326 --> 00:29:25.866
above the multiplication quiz.

00:29:26.516 --> 00:29:27.516
We've also now been able to

00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:29.366
validate that our display order

00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:30.266
was set correctly.

00:29:30.756 --> 00:29:32.096
So, let's go ahead and select

00:29:32.136 --> 00:29:32.946
the addition quiz.

00:29:33.386 --> 00:29:35.166
That's going to add that context

00:29:35.286 --> 00:29:36.176
to this handout.

00:29:36.586 --> 00:29:37.836
And now, let's just go ahead and

00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:39.306
send this handout to our class.

00:29:39.306 --> 00:29:41.666
I'm going to tap on the To

00:29:41.666 --> 00:29:42.006
field.

00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:44.836
Select my class.

00:29:45.126 --> 00:29:46.676
And let's just give a title to

00:29:46.676 --> 00:29:47.356
this handout.

00:29:47.926 --> 00:29:50.486
Now, I'm going to go ahead and

00:29:50.486 --> 00:29:51.046
hit Post.

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:53.216
What this does is it sense this

00:29:53.216 --> 00:29:55.136
handout to my class, and it

00:29:55.266 --> 00:29:57.336
authorizes the context that's on

00:29:57.336 --> 00:29:58.036
this handout.

00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:00.216
So now, that context can start

00:30:00.216 --> 00:30:01.446
recording progress data.

00:30:02.646 --> 00:30:03.876
We can see that my handout

00:30:03.926 --> 00:30:05.616
posted successfully, and I can

00:30:05.616 --> 00:30:06.086
tap on it.

00:30:06.966 --> 00:30:08.276
Here we see the context that

00:30:08.276 --> 00:30:10.026
I've added, and I see my nice,

00:30:10.026 --> 00:30:12.386
app icon is right there next to

00:30:12.386 --> 00:30:13.306
the context name.

00:30:14.006 --> 00:30:15.906
If I tap on the icon, it should

00:30:15.906 --> 00:30:17.636
navigate me straight into the

00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:18.646
addition math quiz.

00:30:19.046 --> 00:30:19.876
So, let's go ahead and tap on

00:30:19.876 --> 00:30:19.976
that.

00:30:21.456 --> 00:30:24.196
Uh-oh. Schoolwork launched our

00:30:24.336 --> 00:30:25.276
app, but this is not the

00:30:25.276 --> 00:30:26.316
addition math quiz.

00:30:27.126 --> 00:30:28.026
Oh, yes. That's right.

00:30:28.146 --> 00:30:28.986
We forgot to add in

00:30:28.986 --> 00:30:29.686
deep-linking.

00:30:29.896 --> 00:30:31.276
So, let's go back to XCode and

00:30:31.276 --> 00:30:31.926
add that in.

00:30:32.536 --> 00:30:33.866
So, I'm going to go back to the

00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:35.616
App Delegate, and let's add in

00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:37.306
that Continue Restoration

00:30:37.306 --> 00:30:37.986
Handler.

00:30:38.226 --> 00:30:41.376
So here, the Continue

00:30:41.376 --> 00:30:43.226
Restoration Handler will process

00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:44.416
some user activity.

00:30:45.336 --> 00:30:46.396
We're just going to grab that

00:30:46.396 --> 00:30:48.166
User Activity and get the

00:30:48.166 --> 00:30:49.556
Context Identifier Path.

00:30:51.156 --> 00:30:52.816
Once we have the Context Path,

00:30:53.436 --> 00:30:54.796
we're going to instantiate our

00:30:54.846 --> 00:30:56.906
own internal quiz model that's

00:30:56.906 --> 00:30:58.736
associated with this context.

00:30:59.936 --> 00:31:01.266
Then, we're going to make sure

00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:02.766
that we call our same published

00:31:02.766 --> 00:31:05.346
context function, and that so,

00:31:05.346 --> 00:31:06.816
if the context has not been

00:31:06.816 --> 00:31:08.196
created, we'll make sure to

00:31:08.196 --> 00:31:09.066
create them.

00:31:09.756 --> 00:31:11.246
This will return an optional

00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:12.676
error, and we'll make sure to

00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:14.266
handle any errors.

00:31:14.816 --> 00:31:16.416
Then, we're just going to sync

00:31:16.486 --> 00:31:17.746
back up with our main thread and

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:20.806
instantiate our storyboard and

00:31:20.806 --> 00:31:22.596
also instantiate the correct

00:31:22.596 --> 00:31:24.216
view controllers for this quiz.

00:31:25.296 --> 00:31:26.766
Then we're going to set our quiz

00:31:26.766 --> 00:31:28.926
on our view controller, and push

00:31:28.926 --> 00:31:30.036
on the appropriate views.

00:31:30.916 --> 00:31:33.166
So, now let's go ahead and run

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.906
this code and test that our

00:31:34.906 --> 00:31:36.146
deep-linking is working.

00:31:36.706 --> 00:31:38.116
So, I'm going to switch back to

00:31:38.116 --> 00:31:40.046
my device, and then we're going

00:31:40.046 --> 00:31:41.336
to navigate back to the

00:31:41.336 --> 00:31:42.606
Schoolwork app.

00:31:43.936 --> 00:31:46.296
Here, let's tap on the icon one

00:31:46.296 --> 00:31:46.866
more time.

00:31:48.186 --> 00:31:50.286
Awesome. It launched us straight

00:31:50.286 --> 00:31:51.946
into the addition math quiz.

00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:53.636
So, now we're ready to start

00:31:53.636 --> 00:31:55.466
writing our user generated

00:31:55.466 --> 00:31:56.076
activity data.

00:31:56.746 --> 00:31:58.356
So, let's go back to XCode, and

00:31:58.356 --> 00:31:59.766
let's navigate to the part of

00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:01.576
our code that gets called when a

00:32:01.616 --> 00:32:03.366
quiz first starts.

00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:06.616
So, here, we said that we wanted

00:32:06.766 --> 00:32:11.526
to start the timer for our quiz.

00:32:12.176 --> 00:32:14.816
So, what we're going to do is

00:32:14.816 --> 00:32:16.186
we're going to issue a query to

00:32:16.446 --> 00:32:18.566
our CLS Data Source Shared

00:32:18.566 --> 00:32:18.896
Instance.

00:32:18.896 --> 00:32:21.176
And then we're going to query in

00:32:21.286 --> 00:32:23.826
our main app context for all of

00:32:23.826 --> 00:32:26.046
the descendants, that match the

00:32:26.046 --> 00:32:28.116
identifier path that's

00:32:28.116 --> 00:32:29.466
associated with this quiz.

00:32:30.586 --> 00:32:32.166
This will return an optional

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:32.656
context.

00:32:33.786 --> 00:32:34.536
We're going to grab that

00:32:34.616 --> 00:32:36.646
context, make sure that we

00:32:36.646 --> 00:32:38.006
called the Become Active, and

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:40.436
then we're going to instantiate

00:32:40.436 --> 00:32:42.726
a new instance of CLS activity.

00:32:43.176 --> 00:32:44.896
And that's because when this

00:32:45.376 --> 00:32:47.716
part of our code gets run, we

00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:49.066
know that the student is taking

00:32:49.066 --> 00:32:50.306
a new attempt at the quiz.

00:32:51.226 --> 00:32:52.686
Then we're just going to cash

00:32:52.726 --> 00:32:54.326
that activity and a property

00:32:54.326 --> 00:32:55.866
that we have defined.

00:32:56.676 --> 00:32:58.866
Then, we call Start on Activity

00:32:59.056 --> 00:32:59.936
to start our timer.

00:33:01.016 --> 00:33:02.536
We also said that we wanted to

00:33:02.536 --> 00:33:03.916
report the answer for an

00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:05.116
individual or question.

00:33:05.786 --> 00:33:06.876
So, I'm going to navigate to the

00:33:06.876 --> 00:33:08.496
part of my code that gets called

00:33:08.666 --> 00:33:09.866
when a student taps on an

00:33:09.866 --> 00:33:10.236
answer.

00:33:10.846 --> 00:33:14.376
So here, what we're going to do,

00:33:14.816 --> 00:33:16.336
is we're going to get that same

00:33:16.396 --> 00:33:17.786
currently running activity that

00:33:17.786 --> 00:33:18.686
we just created.

00:33:19.336 --> 00:33:20.906
Once we have that, we'll

00:33:20.906 --> 00:33:23.886
instantiate a CLS binary item,

00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:26.286
giving it a unique identifier,

00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:29.496
and then a nice, clear title.

00:33:30.376 --> 00:33:31.536
Then we'll make sure to pass in

00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:33.266
the type of binary item that

00:33:33.266 --> 00:33:34.576
this is.

00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:37.326
Now, we're going to set the

00:33:37.326 --> 00:33:39.426
value of whether the student got

00:33:39.426 --> 00:33:41.776
this question correct or not.

00:33:42.936 --> 00:33:43.886
Then we're going to add this

00:33:44.016 --> 00:33:46.356
binary item as an additional

00:33:47.106 --> 00:33:49.266
activity item on our currently

00:33:49.266 --> 00:33:50.096
running activity.

00:33:51.186 --> 00:33:52.406
The last thing that we said we

00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:54.576
wanted to do, was stop the timer

00:33:54.576 --> 00:33:55.856
and set the total score.

00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:57.636
So, we're going to navigate to

00:33:57.636 --> 00:33:59.106
the part of our code that gets

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.366
called when a student ends an

00:34:01.366 --> 00:34:01.676
attempt.

00:34:03.106 --> 00:34:04.516
Here, we're going to get that

00:34:04.636 --> 00:34:06.676
same currently running activity.

00:34:07.446 --> 00:34:09.085
Once we have that, we're going

00:34:09.085 --> 00:34:11.216
to create a CLS score item,

00:34:11.846 --> 00:34:13.496
passing a unique identifier,

00:34:14.216 --> 00:34:16.456
title, and then we're going to

00:34:16.606 --> 00:34:18.315
pass in the score the student

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:20.626
received out of the total

00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:21.996
maximum possible score.

00:34:23.056 --> 00:34:24.076
Then, we're just going to add

00:34:24.076 --> 00:34:26.266
that score item as the primary

00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:28.376
activity item on our activity.

00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:30.426
Notice, every time I'm doing

00:34:30.426 --> 00:34:31.826
this, I'm always setting the

00:34:31.826 --> 00:34:34.806
same subclass of CLS activity

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:35.176
item.

00:34:35.525 --> 00:34:37.996
It's always a score item.

00:34:39.206 --> 00:34:40.315
Then, we're just going to call

00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:43.516
Stop to stop our timer and save

00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:44.886
to save all of our changes.

00:34:45.936 --> 00:34:47.466
So, now let's go ahead and run

00:34:47.466 --> 00:34:49.146
this code to test that our

00:34:49.146 --> 00:34:51.106
student generated activity data

00:34:51.366 --> 00:34:51.775
gets set.

00:34:51.775 --> 00:34:54.326
So, I switch back to my device,

00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:56.116
and now we have to switch and

00:34:56.116 --> 00:34:57.816
act as the role of a student.

00:34:58.346 --> 00:34:59.896
So, I'm going to go ahead and go

00:34:59.896 --> 00:35:01.556
back to my Developer's Settings.

00:35:01.556 --> 00:35:03.466
And the settings are all up

00:35:03.466 --> 00:35:03.816
here.

00:35:04.066 --> 00:35:05.666
We can tap on student and now

00:35:05.666 --> 00:35:07.456
I'm switched to act at the role

00:35:07.456 --> 00:35:07.936
of a student.

00:35:08.776 --> 00:35:10.346
Now, we can go back and open up

00:35:10.386 --> 00:35:12.006
the Schoolwork app.

00:35:12.446 --> 00:35:13.886
Here, if you look in the top

00:35:13.886 --> 00:35:15.326
right-hand corner, there no

00:35:15.326 --> 00:35:16.696
longer is a plus button, and

00:35:16.956 --> 00:35:18.276
that's how I know I'm logged in

00:35:18.276 --> 00:35:18.876
as a student.

00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:20.906
And we can see that I have the

00:35:20.996 --> 00:35:22.246
handout the teacher assigned to

00:35:22.246 --> 00:35:22.446
me.

00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:24.996
If I tap on that, we can see the

00:35:24.996 --> 00:35:27.126
context that I need to complete,

00:35:27.346 --> 00:35:29.476
and I can tap on the icon and it

00:35:29.476 --> 00:35:30.746
navigates me straight into the

00:35:30.746 --> 00:35:31.086
quiz.

00:35:32.106 --> 00:35:33.396
Now, I can an alert saying that

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:34.836
progress data is going to be

00:35:34.836 --> 00:35:36.616
recorded on my behalf and sent

00:35:36.616 --> 00:35:37.326
to my teacher.

00:35:37.916 --> 00:35:38.896
So, I'll dismiss this.

00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:42.056
Then we just go through, answer

00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:45.716
all of our questions, and we get

00:35:45.716 --> 00:35:46.876
our total score at the end.

00:35:47.396 --> 00:35:48.896
So, we can see we got 100%.

00:35:49.376 --> 00:35:50.386
So now, let's go back to the

00:35:50.386 --> 00:35:51.526
Schoolwork app.

00:35:52.036 --> 00:35:53.606
Here we can see our activity

00:35:53.606 --> 00:35:54.366
data showing up.

00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:56.126
We can see the time and the

00:35:56.126 --> 00:35:56.836
total score.

00:35:57.566 --> 00:35:58.636
Notice the total score is

00:35:58.636 --> 00:35:59.726
highlighted right there in the

00:35:59.726 --> 00:36:00.736
main part of the [inaudible].

00:36:01.026 --> 00:36:02.426
Now, we've been able to validate

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.936
that our activity item was set

00:36:03.936 --> 00:36:04.426
correctly.

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:07.156
I can also tap on the cell, and

00:36:07.156 --> 00:36:08.736
I get a popover of all the

00:36:08.736 --> 00:36:10.076
activity data I've written.

00:36:10.076 --> 00:36:12.616
I can see the total score and in

00:36:12.616 --> 00:36:14.186
light gray, I see the title of

00:36:14.236 --> 00:36:15.386
Total Score that I set.

00:36:16.236 --> 00:36:17.806
And then at the bottom, we can

00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.776
see the time, and then each

00:36:19.776 --> 00:36:20.746
individual question.

00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:22.606
And then also in light gray, we

00:36:22.606 --> 00:36:24.476
can see the title that I set for

00:36:24.476 --> 00:36:25.746
each one of those individuals

00:36:25.746 --> 00:36:26.216
questions.

00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:28.086
So now, we've been able to

00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:30.516
validate that our activity data

00:36:30.896 --> 00:36:31.766
was getting written.

00:36:32.646 --> 00:36:34.376
So, with that, I would like to

00:36:34.376 --> 00:36:36.486
reintroduce Pavel back on stage

00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.826
to go ahead and summarize

00:36:37.826 --> 00:36:38.976
everything that we've seen.

00:36:39.516 --> 00:36:47.916
[ Applause ]

00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:49.386
>> Thank you, Marin.

00:36:50.446 --> 00:36:52.506
So, I'd like to mention some

00:36:52.506 --> 00:36:53.966
best practices about ClassKit.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:57.356
For one, declare your contexts

00:36:57.446 --> 00:36:59.146
as early as possibly so that

00:36:59.146 --> 00:37:00.456
they're available to teachers to

00:37:00.456 --> 00:37:00.906
assign.

00:37:01.546 --> 00:37:03.336
And also, Marin showed us that

00:37:03.466 --> 00:37:04.406
not everything [inaudible] needs

00:37:04.406 --> 00:37:06.026
to be a context [inaudible].

00:37:06.796 --> 00:37:08.836
If it makes sense, take

00:37:08.836 --> 00:37:10.536
advantage of CLS Data Store

00:37:10.536 --> 00:37:11.066
Delegate.

00:37:11.956 --> 00:37:13.636
And also, please take advantage

00:37:13.636 --> 00:37:15.476
of additional activity items.

00:37:16.116 --> 00:37:17.886
They really are a great way to

00:37:18.266 --> 00:37:19.766
provide extra information that

00:37:19.826 --> 00:37:21.116
teachers might need to

00:37:21.186 --> 00:37:22.486
understand what the student is

00:37:22.486 --> 00:37:24.896
doing within your app.

00:37:25.316 --> 00:37:26.676
There's also some general best

00:37:26.676 --> 00:37:28.316
practices about education apps.

00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:30.606
One of them is to StoreKit

00:37:30.606 --> 00:37:31.136
dependence.

00:37:32.106 --> 00:37:33.376
And this is because in-app

00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:34.666
purchases don't really work

00:37:34.666 --> 00:37:35.716
within a school environment.

00:37:36.146 --> 00:37:38.496
That one is to support purgeable

00:37:39.776 --> 00:37:40.086
storage.

00:37:40.306 --> 00:37:41.726
This is a good idea in general,

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.516
but it's real important in

00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:45.796
school environments where shared

00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:48.316
iPods are common, and space is a

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:49.386
premium on those.

00:37:50.126 --> 00:37:52.036
Lastly, implement setting access

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:53.626
via Managed App Config.

00:37:54.346 --> 00:37:56.976
Doing that, makes school admin's

00:37:57.036 --> 00:37:58.696
jobs a lot easier to configure

00:37:58.696 --> 00:37:59.166
devices.

00:38:00.206 --> 00:38:02.286
You can find links about all of

00:38:02.286 --> 00:38:04.796
this and the going details at

00:38:04.796 --> 00:38:07.896
developer.apple.com/education.

00:38:09.296 --> 00:38:11.736
Now, with that, have a wonderful

00:38:11.736 --> 00:38:12.556
rest of WWDC.

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:13.956
Thank you for coming.
