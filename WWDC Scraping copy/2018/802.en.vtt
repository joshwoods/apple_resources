00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:36.436
>> So hello everyone.

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:38.086
My name is Doug LeMoine.

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:40.596
My background is in interaction

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:41.246
design.

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:43.266
And here at Apple I'm on a team

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.046
of people who works with

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.206
developers like you.

00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:49.146
As a designer I focus on user

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:51.296
interfaces and the ideas to

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:54.636
deliver great user experiences

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:56.226
to the people who use your apps.

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:58.976
Today I'm here to talk about

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:00.256
intent.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.386
I think there's a thread running

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.476
through great apps and really

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:06.566
great products.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.586
And it has to do with a

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:11.556
conscious focus on people, on

00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:14.476
humans, and what they want and

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.266
what they really need.

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:19.356
So I'm going to talk about

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:21.096
focusing on the person you want

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:21.616
to serve.

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:24.726
And I'm going to focus on being

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:25.586
intentional.

00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:27.716
The intent that I'm interested

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:29.236
in talking about today is less

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:32.326
about a specific design vision

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:36.376
or a specific outcome and more

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:37.756
on a mindset.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.286
How to keep a sharp focus on

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:41.896
those people that you're trying

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:44.976
to reach and create apps that

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:45.756
feel simple.

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:48.176
And when an app feels simple

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:52.566
users perceive it as natural, an

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.126
extension of what they know.

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:55.896
It feels like it arises from

00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:58.486
their experience and it flows

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:00.316
naturally from what they expect.

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:04.196
So I know simple and natural are

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.546
sort of designer cliches, we say

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:07.796
this stuff all the time.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.256
Like, what do we mean?

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.306
I think these terms are

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:13.846
shorthand for discussing

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:15.516
qualities of apps that create

00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:17.836
feelings of comfort and

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:18.706
confidence.

00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:21.586
When people feel comfortable and

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:23.626
confident, when we understand

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:25.276
how a thing works, we can move

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.176
through it seamlessly without

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:29.706
needed to learn or figure it

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:30.946
out.

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.716
So intent is the kind of thing

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.786
is hard to define but you know

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:35.496
it when you see it.

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:37.356
So I'm going to show you some

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.746
examples of apps that I found in

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:41.876
the last year that really

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:44.026
deliver real value to people and

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:45.166
really connect with them.

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:48.236
And I'm going to talk about five

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:50.296
elements of intentional design

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:51.246
that we can learn from these

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.736
apps and that you can apply to

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:53.146
your work.

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.766
So let's dive in.

00:02:57.926 --> 00:02:59.876
So before mobile devices came

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.516
around when you traveled abroad

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:02.706
you'd carry a paper map.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.566
And the advantage of the paper

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:06.836
map is that when you would

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:08.736
approach a local they would

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:10.916
instantly recognize what kind of

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:11.826
help you needed.

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:15.306
So mobile maps have made people

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:16.826
more independent, right?

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.816
We probably approach fewer

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:20.466
locals when we're traveling

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:20.936
abroad.

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.136
But in the same way that a paper

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:26.646
map invites an interaction,

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:28.586
there's an app called iTranslate

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.336
Converse that makes it easy to

00:03:30.336 --> 00:03:32.036
approach a local with your

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:33.766
iPhone in your hand to ask a

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.596
question or get directions.

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:37.486
Some of you may have seen this

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:39.126
on Monday night at the Apple

00:03:39.126 --> 00:03:40.126
Design Awards.

00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:42.666
I'm going to go through a demo

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.216
to really bring out what I think

00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:46.056
is really intentional about this

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:46.316
app.

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:48.786
So first of all there's very

00:03:48.786 --> 00:03:49.386
little UI.

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:51.736
The screen is essentially one

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:51.976
big button.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:55.046
I tap and hold and start

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:55.536
talking.

00:03:55.656 --> 00:03:56.416
So I'll show you that in a

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:56.896
second.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:00.506
And to be clear the goal of

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:02.336
iTranslate Converse is to make

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:03.516
conversation easy.

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:05.596
The developers have intended

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:07.966
this app to be used together.

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:09.586
So two people together, one of

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:11.926
whom most likely has never used

00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.686
this app before, probably never

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.676
even seen it.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.736
So I launched this app really

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:20.696
for real in in the Naples train

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:23.106
station when I was trying to get

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:25.276
on an express train to Rome and

00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:26.216
the platforms were really

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:26.996
confusing.

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:29.226
So I pulled out my phone, I

00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:30.546
launched the app, and I walked

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:31.926
up to a conductor.

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:34.816
So I said is this the express

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:35.776
train to Rome?

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.926
[Computerized Speaking Italian]

00:04:40.426 --> 00:04:42.076
>> The app translated it into

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:44.996
Italian and the conductor heard.

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:47.956
Then I could flip the phone

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:50.786
around and again, what I find

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:53.136
interesting in this situation

00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:55.236
that other person has probably

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:56.586
never seen this app before.

00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.856
And they speak in a language

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:02.376
that I didn't speak but the app

00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:04.056
is smart enough to know that

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:05.466
it's ether going to English or

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:07.396
Italian to listen for.

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:10.336
So the conductor spoke into the

00:05:10.336 --> 00:05:11.036
microphone.

00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:13.666
>> Platform Nine.

00:05:13.736 --> 00:05:16.226
>> And the app translates it for

00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:16.356
me.

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:20.346
So in reality he spoke English.

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:26.856
[ Applause ]

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:29.166
But he did want to see how the

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:31.206
app worked and I showed him and

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:31.916
he was impressed.

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:35.876
I think the real beauty of this

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:37.496
is that you can make a

00:05:37.496 --> 00:05:39.566
connection with a person, right?

00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.816
You can get on the right train

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.076
like I did, but you also make a

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.996
human connection in the process.

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:50.006
So the developer's intent here

00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:51.666
is to enable communication

00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:53.506
between two people in real time.

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:55.586
Just touch the screen and talk.

00:05:56.116 --> 00:05:57.456
So the first element of

00:05:57.456 --> 00:05:59.796
intentional design is what I'm

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:00.986
going to call radical

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:02.016
simplification.

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:04.646
So how did they do this?

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:07.366
Well, I think they considered

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.286
the context really well, the

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:11.226
context that this will be used

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:11.546
in.

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:14.086
They took into account where and

00:06:14.086 --> 00:06:15.696
when people would pull out their

00:06:15.696 --> 00:06:18.326
phone and launch their app.

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:19.826
You're probably in a foreign

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:23.976
country, like this guy you're

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:27.936
jetlagged, lost, tired, your

00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:31.256
hair is uncombed, your jacket is

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:31.856
rumpled.

00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:35.106
I'm not even sure if that's a

00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:37.156
map that he's carrying at this

00:06:37.156 --> 00:06:38.466
moment, it kind of looks like a

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:38.876
book.

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:41.766
So they remove the UI and allow

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:42.996
people to focus on what they

00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:44.416
need, which is to find

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:47.336
something, to ask a question, to

00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:48.056
get their bearings.

00:06:48.946 --> 00:06:52.936
And it's amazing how much an

00:06:52.936 --> 00:06:54.866
experience can change when

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:56.756
actions are removed from the UI.

00:06:56.756 --> 00:06:58.986
So I want to show you another

00:06:58.986 --> 00:06:59.656
example.

00:07:00.416 --> 00:07:02.056
This is an app called Vanido.

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:03.876
It helps you learn how to sing.

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:06.626
So if you're the kind of person

00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:08.366
who wants to learn how to sing

00:07:08.956 --> 00:07:11.426
with literally no one hearing

00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:13.696
your or judging you, this app is

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:14.246
amazing.

00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:16.336
This is the UI.

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:18.396
It's so simple.

00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:20.576
The app tracks the pitch of my

00:07:20.576 --> 00:07:22.836
voice while I'm singing and it's

00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:24.596
continually giving me feedback.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.606
Am I hitting my notes or not?

00:07:27.876 --> 00:07:28.906
So let me show you.

[ Laughter ]

00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:14.076
So what I love about Vanido is

00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:16.376
that it has stripped away what

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:18.606
music education looks like,

00:08:18.606 --> 00:08:18.846

There's no charts or notes.

00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.666
It's colorful, it's animated,

00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:23.496
and it's fun.

00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:25.766
And you should have heard me

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:27.866
sing before I started using this

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:28.086
app.

00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:29.356
It really works.

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.806
And there's only one interactive

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:33.046
element on the screen when

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:34.256
you're singing and it's way up

00:08:34.256 --> 00:08:35.826
at the top left.

00:08:36.676 --> 00:08:38.506
So you can hold your phone like

00:08:38.506 --> 00:08:40.336
a microphone and really belt it

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.666
out without worrying about

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:44.096
accidentally exiting your

00:08:44.096 --> 00:08:44.576
lesson.

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:47.756
So this is radical

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:49.656
simplification and that's what I

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:50.516
mean, that's the first

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.736
manifestation of intent and

00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:54.116
intentional design.

00:08:55.656 --> 00:08:57.396
Being radical means taking

00:08:57.396 --> 00:08:58.906
risks, right?

00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:00.266
Removing a bunch of stuff from

00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:02.116
the UI could be jarring if you

00:09:02.116 --> 00:09:02.906
don't do it right.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.286
But I think there's a way to

00:09:04.286 --> 00:09:05.276
reduce your risk.

00:09:05.486 --> 00:09:07.356
So next I want to talk about

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:09.786
people and about orienting your

00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:12.306
design around what people really

00:09:12.306 --> 00:09:12.716
want.

00:09:13.206 --> 00:09:14.426
So what do they want?

00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:16.466
I think this is worth exploring

00:09:16.816 --> 00:09:17.756
because it's almost never

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:18.426
obvious.

00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:22.536
The first needs that you see

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:24.156
when you start kind of looking

00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:27.206
at people and the users that you

00:09:27.206 --> 00:09:28.806
might want to serve are

00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:30.476
superficial and you need to dig

00:09:30.476 --> 00:09:31.436
past those.

00:09:31.986 --> 00:09:33.206
They might be the first ones

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:34.616
that you think about addressing

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:35.776
or they might be the ones that

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.406
pulled you into the problem in

00:09:37.406 --> 00:09:39.876
the first place, but you need to

00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:42.516
keep digging because those

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:45.096
superficial needs often mask

00:09:45.556 --> 00:09:46.946
deeper needs, right, you could

00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:48.646
solve them but not really solve

00:09:48.646 --> 00:09:50.396
the persons' problem.

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:52.556
So you have to keep digging.

00:09:53.146 --> 00:09:54.516
The second element of

00:09:54.516 --> 00:09:55.786
intentional design that I want

00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:57.546
to get into here is called deep

00:09:57.546 --> 00:09:58.506
understanding.

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.046
So knowing the person that you

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.706
want to reach and the actually

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:02.796
problem that they have.

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:05.726
The deeper you dig the more

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:07.386
likely you are to see where the

00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:09.616
real opportunity to meet their

00:10:09.616 --> 00:10:10.406
needs is.

00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:12.196
And the app that really shows

00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:14.066
this off, in my opinion, is

00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:15.296
called Streaks Workout.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:17.916
So it's a workout app but I want

00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:19.076
to go behind the scenes a little

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:19.306
bit.

00:10:20.016 --> 00:10:22.176
On the surface it looks like

00:10:22.176 --> 00:10:23.266
many workout apps.

00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:24.536
It guides your workouts.

00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:26.456
This is the primary screen and

00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:27.426
it looks pretty simple.

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:29.536
You pick a workout duration and

00:10:29.536 --> 00:10:29.976
you go.

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:34.716
But personally, I'll confess

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:36.466
that I don't love working out

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:40.826
and I've tried many workout apps

00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:43.566
that I just don't stick with and

00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:46.506
I want to thank any developers

00:10:46.506 --> 00:10:47.776
that are here who have developed

00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:49.456
workout apps that I've tried

00:10:49.646 --> 00:10:51.356
because I respect your effort

00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:55.376
and I'm really trying to get fit

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:56.476
so thank you for that.

00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:58.106
But what I struggle with is

00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:00.046
staying motivated.

00:11:00.046 --> 00:11:02.066
It's easy to get bored or burnt

00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:04.146
out and this isn't an unknown

00:11:04.146 --> 00:11:05.806
problem, right?

00:11:05.806 --> 00:11:07.206
Many people feel this sense of

00:11:07.206 --> 00:11:09.436
inertia when facing something

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:10.856
challenging like a workout.

00:11:11.746 --> 00:11:14.136
So inertia, just to be clear, is

00:11:14.136 --> 00:11:16.146
a disinclination to move.

00:11:16.496 --> 00:11:18.156
And that's what I feel.

00:11:18.156 --> 00:11:21.186
I feel a sense of disinclination

00:11:21.186 --> 00:11:23.316
when I think about working out.

00:11:24.626 --> 00:11:25.806
So I want to walk you through

00:11:25.806 --> 00:11:28.126
how Streaks Workout helps users

00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:28.996
handle this.

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:31.286
So when you first launch the app

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.336
you select movements that you

00:11:33.336 --> 00:11:34.666
want to do, these exercise

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:37.006
movements on a screen like this.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:38.576
And there's dozens of these

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:38.876
things.

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:40.216
You can scroll down and pick as

00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:41.056
many as you want.

00:11:42.196 --> 00:11:43.656
After that when you want to

00:11:43.656 --> 00:11:45.186
start a workout there's just one

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:46.706
tap.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.346
You just pick a duration and you

00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:48.676
go.

00:11:49.286 --> 00:11:50.856
And the app does the rest.

00:11:51.126 --> 00:11:52.586
It auto selects from your

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:53.946
movements and it picks a

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:56.106
sequence and then you're in the

00:11:56.106 --> 00:11:56.656
workout.

[ Heartbeats ]

00:12:00.746 --> 00:12:02.226
You guys psyched up?

00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:06.516
So let's fast forward a bit.

00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:07.946
Now I'm doing ten seconds of

00:12:07.946 --> 00:12:08.716
crunches.

00:12:09.386 --> 00:12:10.656
>> Crunches ten seconds.

00:12:11.736 --> 00:12:13.756
>> I'm actually not going to do

00:12:13.756 --> 00:12:14.346
the crunches.

00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:17.296
But as you can see I can't see

00:12:17.296 --> 00:12:18.446
what's next, right?

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.246
The question mark means it's

00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:20.896
random.

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:21.766
It's a surprise.

00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:24.376
>> Burpees ten seconds.

00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:25.366
>> Yeah, I'm not going to do

00:12:25.366 --> 00:12:26.006
those either.

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.346
Specifically, what I think works

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:32.236
well is that the app confronts

00:12:32.296 --> 00:12:33.766
the inertia that people might

00:12:33.766 --> 00:12:35.416
feel by introducing a sense of

00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:37.876
randomness and removing work.

00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:40.886
So the developers recognize that

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:42.906
each step in the process of

00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:44.826
doing a workout requires a

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.126
choice, requires someone to

00:12:47.126 --> 00:12:49.336
think about what they want and

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.646
these decisions are not things

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.906
that everyone wants to make.

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.316
So you only choose movements

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:55.906
once.

00:12:56.006 --> 00:12:57.636
After that the app does it for

00:12:57.636 --> 00:12:57.856
you.

00:12:58.536 --> 00:13:00.326
And you never choose the

00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:02.886
sequence or the reps so half of

00:13:02.926 --> 00:13:05.116
the work, half of the potential

00:13:05.116 --> 00:13:06.866
inertia is gone.

00:13:07.646 --> 00:13:08.996
You could say that Streaks

Really bad.

They've taken half of the work

00:13:24.106 --> 00:13:24.746
out anyway.

00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:28.336
So this launch sequence reveals

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:30.326
the movements that you'll do and

00:13:30.326 --> 00:13:32.256
it helps each workout feel new.

00:13:32.966 --> 00:13:35.196
Of course there are probably

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:36.566
many of you in the audience that

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.366
perceive that this app actually

00:13:38.366 --> 00:13:40.146
lacks essential features.

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:42.336
Choosing reps is amazing.

00:13:42.586 --> 00:13:44.496
Picking a sequence isn't work.

00:13:45.636 --> 00:13:47.526
If this is you I have great

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:47.956
news.

00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:49.116
There are lots of apps that

00:13:49.116 --> 00:13:50.646
allow you to do those things.

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:52.236
But I'm curious about what

00:13:52.236 --> 00:13:53.416
inspired this.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.886
Whenever I see something unique

00:13:55.886 --> 00:13:57.816
like this I wonder what's behind

00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:00.536
it because it's unique and it's

00:14:00.536 --> 00:14:01.716
implemented really well.

00:14:01.996 --> 00:14:03.786
So I asked the developers of

00:14:03.786 --> 00:14:04.686
Streaks Workout.

00:14:06.256 --> 00:14:09.436
And it's such a common story to

00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:12.496
hear about how an app originated

00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:14.066
with an idea that came out of

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:14.686
prison.

00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:19.406
So specifically, their idea

00:14:19.406 --> 00:14:21.196
originated with how inmates in

00:14:21.196 --> 00:14:22.946
prison keep workouts new and

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:23.596
interesting.

00:14:24.106 --> 00:14:25.526
So I want to walk you through

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.436
how that works.

00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:30.616
So in prison you take a normal

00:14:30.616 --> 00:14:31.786
deck of cards and at the

00:14:31.786 --> 00:14:33.656
beginning of each workout you

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.136
would assign a movement to each

00:14:35.136 --> 00:14:35.626
suit.

00:14:35.996 --> 00:14:38.106
So today diamonds are crunches.

00:14:39.006 --> 00:14:40.346
The numbers on the cards

00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:42.356
represent the number of reps per

00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:42.856
movement.

00:14:43.146 --> 00:14:44.416
So at the beginning of the

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:46.456
workout you'd put the deck face

00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:49.106
down and you'd start drawing and

00:14:49.106 --> 00:14:50.206
each card would deliver a

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:51.566
movement and a rep count.

00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:53.606
OK, everyone eight crunches.

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:58.096
So the original app concept was

00:14:58.096 --> 00:15:00.056
a literal recreation of this.

00:15:00.376 --> 00:15:02.086
This is an early comp and they

00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:04.106
also prototyped shuffling and

00:15:04.106 --> 00:15:08.276
flipping cards to try to kind of

00:15:08.276 --> 00:15:11.706
replicate the origin of this

00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:12.556
prison workout.

00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:14.466
But they quickly moved past the

00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:15.566
literal approach.

00:15:16.256 --> 00:15:17.876
They didn't stick to the literal

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.416
deck of cards because it carried

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:20.666
too many constraints.

00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:22.606
Four suits would limit the

00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:23.686
number of movements that you

00:15:23.686 --> 00:15:25.026
could do in each workout and

00:15:25.026 --> 00:15:26.266
people would somehow need to

00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:28.086
remember that diamonds

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:29.546
represented crunches in that

00:15:29.546 --> 00:15:31.386
particular workout and that's

00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:32.136
work, right?

00:15:33.496 --> 00:15:35.056
So instead they focused on the

00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:36.626
value that they wanted to bring.

00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:39.586
They wanted to help people make

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:41.066
a habit of working out.

00:15:42.446 --> 00:15:44.616
So they acknowledged that people

00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:46.516
felt inertia when they were

00:15:46.516 --> 00:15:47.846
going to launch a workout app

00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:49.846
and they removed as much as

00:15:49.846 --> 00:15:51.466
possible that might trigger that

00:15:52.146 --> 00:15:53.446
and they stayed true to the

00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:55.366
original intent of the prison

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:57.226
workout, which is that spirit of

00:15:57.226 --> 00:15:58.816
randomness and surprise.

00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:01.656
And that's what I mean by deep

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.376
understanding.

00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:03.806
Knowing the person that you want

00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:05.476
to reach and the actual problem

00:16:05.476 --> 00:16:06.436
that they might have.

00:16:06.906 --> 00:16:08.476
So the superficial approach to

00:16:08.476 --> 00:16:10.076
this workout would have been

00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:11.286
just a typical workout app,

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:11.646
right?

00:16:11.936 --> 00:16:13.036
Of course people want to get

00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:13.516
healthy.

00:16:14.046 --> 00:16:15.756
But what people really want, or

00:16:15.756 --> 00:16:17.326
what I really want anyway is to

00:16:17.326 --> 00:16:19.286
get past the boredom and that

00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:20.626
inertia and they've addressed

00:16:20.656 --> 00:16:21.306
that for me.

00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:27.306
So knowing users is nothing new.

00:16:27.546 --> 00:16:30.386
I'm guessing a lot of you here

00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:32.726
have personas and market

00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:35.106
segments and you do surveys and

00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:36.796
other kinds of user research

00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:38.336
focus groups.

00:16:38.616 --> 00:16:40.326
Maybe you create experience maps

00:16:40.326 --> 00:16:41.846
and customer journeys and user

00:16:41.846 --> 00:16:42.536
stories.

00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:45.086
All of those can be useful

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:45.616
models.

00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:48.266
But they have to feel authentic,

00:16:48.436 --> 00:16:48.776
right?

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:50.716
They actually have to feel like

00:16:50.866 --> 00:16:51.366
people.

00:16:52.776 --> 00:16:54.776
That can make focus easier and

00:16:54.776 --> 00:16:56.316
it can help teams kind of come

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:57.966
together around a vision.

00:16:57.966 --> 00:16:59.676
As long as you share a common

00:16:59.676 --> 00:17:01.856
understanding and you feel a

00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:04.356
real empathy for the person that

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:05.576
you're designing for.

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:06.705
Those can work.

00:17:07.945 --> 00:17:10.935
But too often those artifacts of

00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:12.836
needs and goals and skills, they

00:17:12.836 --> 00:17:14.165
just feel artificial.

00:17:14.906 --> 00:17:16.685
They may not connect with

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:17.286
everyone.

00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:19.816
They feel complicated or distant

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:20.576
or corny.

00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:24.036
So for a moment I want to talk

00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:26.586
about how much easier it is to

00:17:26.586 --> 00:17:28.376
make some something when you

00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:30.226
really care about the person

00:17:30.226 --> 00:17:31.266
you're making it for.

00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:34.286
So I first heard about this

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.316
story that I'm going to tell you

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:35.836
in a book.

00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:38.146
It's by a guy named Alan Cooper,

00:17:38.486 --> 00:17:40.296
he's a software developer from

00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:42.816
the early days, and his claim to

00:17:42.816 --> 00:17:44.686
fame is that he created a

00:17:44.686 --> 00:17:47.276
prototype that became Visual

00:17:47.276 --> 00:17:47.786
Basic.

00:17:48.246 --> 00:17:50.776
And this is an actual pixel

00:17:50.976 --> 00:17:53.646
resolution of Visual Basic 1.0

00:17:54.576 --> 00:17:55.816
on a 4K display.

00:17:56.056 --> 00:17:57.676
It's pretty amazing.

00:17:59.456 --> 00:18:01.696
So Alan built this with a small

00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:03.986
team and as he did it he began

00:18:03.986 --> 00:18:05.876
to recognize a problem in

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.716
maintaining a focus on what

00:18:07.716 --> 00:18:08.716
people really want.

00:18:08.896 --> 00:18:10.596
And he tells this great story in

00:18:11.016 --> 00:18:13.866
a book about another invention

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:16.286
and that story is a parable of

00:18:16.436 --> 00:18:20.026
how powerful knowing people can

00:18:20.026 --> 00:18:21.666
be, knowing the person that

00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:22.696
you're designing for.

00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:25.506
So apologies if I got your hopes

00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:26.596
up about Visual Basic.

00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:27.676
I'm actually not going to talk

00:18:27.676 --> 00:18:28.246
about that.

00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:30.986
I want to focus on this story

00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:32.366
and kind of extend it a little

00:18:32.366 --> 00:18:32.686
bit.

00:18:33.566 --> 00:18:35.226
So the invention that he talks

00:18:35.226 --> 00:18:37.496
about is the Rollaboard

00:18:37.496 --> 00:18:38.346
Suitcase.

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:40.596
So this is the patent form for

00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:41.356
the Rollaboard.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.746
So nowadays the suitcase might

00:18:44.746 --> 00:18:46.186
seem pretty unremarkable.

00:18:47.236 --> 00:18:49.106
For most of us this is just a

00:18:49.106 --> 00:18:51.016
suitcase, big deal.

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:53.386
But it actually hasn't been

00:18:53.446 --> 00:18:54.296
around for that long.

00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:56.676
The patent was filed in 1989.

00:18:57.026 --> 00:18:58.086
People have been traveling

00:18:58.276 --> 00:18:59.086
forever though.

00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:01.706
So why did it take so long to

00:19:01.706 --> 00:19:03.806
design something so obvious?

00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:06.556
The inventor was a guy named

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:07.276
Robert Plath.

00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:09.496
I'm guessing not a household

00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.486
name, but more on that in a

00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:11.746
minute.

00:19:13.136 --> 00:19:15.126
So what was innovative about

00:19:15.126 --> 00:19:15.536
this?

00:19:15.966 --> 00:19:17.556
Well, I think the innovations

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:18.176
are subtle.

00:19:18.396 --> 00:19:19.666
It wasn't the wheels.

00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:22.476
Many patents had been filed for

00:19:22.546 --> 00:19:24.146
wheeled suitcases before.

00:19:24.186 --> 00:19:25.396
This is from the '70s.

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:28.416
So the wheels are underneath and

00:19:28.416 --> 00:19:29.966
it's also got some kind of leash

00:19:29.966 --> 00:19:30.406
thing.

00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:35.166
Suitcase manufactures had been

00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:36.826
trying to put wheels on

00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:38.586
suitcases as far back as the

00:19:38.586 --> 00:19:41.006
'40s and this actually has some

00:19:41.006 --> 00:19:43.476
kind of other leash thing, some

00:19:43.476 --> 00:19:45.706
grabber thing that you can see

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:46.356
right there.

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:49.716
So clearly people have been

00:19:49.716 --> 00:19:51.306
trying to figure out a way to

00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:53.466
not carry heavy things.

00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:56.176
So if you worked in the luggage

00:19:56.176 --> 00:19:59.176
industry in 1989, you probably

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.976
thought you'd already innovated.

00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:02.876
You weren't worried about this

00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:04.186
new patent I'm guessing.

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.446
But we all know what happened,

00:20:06.446 --> 00:20:06.736
right?

00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:08.456
The new design became the de

00:20:08.456 --> 00:20:10.416
facto design of suitcases.

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:11.526
And the improvements in

00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:13.846
retrospect are totally obvious.

00:20:14.176 --> 00:20:15.656
There's a handle at the top so

00:20:15.656 --> 00:20:17.336
the whole suitcase it oriented

00:20:17.336 --> 00:20:18.126
to be upright.

00:20:18.566 --> 00:20:20.326
It's easy to grab and pull and

00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:20.686
pivot.

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:23.036
That is the evolution of the

00:20:23.036 --> 00:20:23.566
leash.

00:20:25.236 --> 00:20:27.046
Second the wheels, right?

00:20:27.046 --> 00:20:28.546
The wheels are placed on the

00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:29.946
edge so they're only fully

00:20:29.946 --> 00:20:31.596
engaged when the suitcase is

00:20:31.596 --> 00:20:32.086
tilted.

00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:35.686
And finally the size, it's small

00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:38.006
enough to lift and place in an

00:20:38.006 --> 00:20:40.426
overhead bin.

00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:42.216
So nothing particularly

00:20:42.216 --> 00:20:44.196
revolutionary but the inventor

00:20:44.546 --> 00:20:47.166
Robert Plath made each decision

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:48.986
to serve a really specific

00:20:48.986 --> 00:20:51.716
person, a person who traveled

00:20:51.716 --> 00:20:52.386
for a living.

00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:54.626
Robert Plath was a pilot for

00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:55.716
Northwest Airlines.

00:20:55.716 --> 00:20:57.956
He intimately knew the pain of

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:59.306
lugging and lifting heavy

00:20:59.306 --> 00:20:59.796
things.

00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:00.916
He did it every day.

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:03.516
And he deeply understood what

00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:06.026
people like him wanted, to move

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:07.356
with ease while looking

00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:08.796
professional, and he made

00:21:08.826 --> 00:21:10.826
something perfectly suited for

00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:11.116
that.

00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:13.446
So what I find really

00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:14.356
interesting is that at the

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:17.456
times, 1989, there were only

00:21:17.456 --> 00:21:18.986
about 100,000 travel

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.066
professionals as the Census Data

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:22.556
called them, but pilots, flight

00:21:22.556 --> 00:21:23.856
attendants, people in the travel

00:21:23.856 --> 00:21:24.426
industry.

00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:26.776
That 100,000 might seem like a

00:21:26.776 --> 00:21:28.666
lot, but when you compare that

00:21:28.666 --> 00:21:30.986
number to the overall market of

00:21:30.986 --> 00:21:32.676
people who traveled a couple

00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:35.326
times a year, just like more

00:21:35.326 --> 00:21:36.696
than 100 million at the time,

00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:38.736
and that's just Census Data from

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:42.996
the U.S., his target user,

00:21:43.226 --> 00:21:45.376
quote-unquote, was a really

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:47.146
specific person that represented

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:50.176
only 0.1% of 1% of the market.

00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:52.506
So what I'm saying is that

00:21:52.506 --> 00:21:54.456
typical methods of market

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:56.046
identification probably would

00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:59.756
not have led Robert Plath to

00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:00.936
focus so narrowly.

00:22:02.026 --> 00:22:04.156
He focused on an extreme use

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:06.516
case, a person who traveled all

00:22:07.596 --> 00:22:08.596
the time.

00:22:08.796 --> 00:22:10.096
So I'm using extreme

00:22:10.256 --> 00:22:13.176
intentionally to emphasize that

00:22:13.176 --> 00:22:14.686
he focused on what we might call

00:22:14.686 --> 00:22:15.656
an edge case.

00:22:16.296 --> 00:22:18.256
The market size was really small

00:22:18.576 --> 00:22:21.296
and his solution was kind of

00:22:21.296 --> 00:22:21.896
whacky.

00:22:22.126 --> 00:22:23.706
It looked really different.

00:22:24.156 --> 00:22:26.536
It implied a new kind of default

00:22:26.536 --> 00:22:28.806
way of interacting with your

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:29.376
luggage.

00:22:31.376 --> 00:22:33.956
So he focused on the needs of

00:22:33.956 --> 00:22:35.936
people he intimately knew and

00:22:35.936 --> 00:22:38.146
that extreme focus allowed the

00:22:38.146 --> 00:22:40.246
real needs of a lot of people to

00:22:40.246 --> 00:22:41.326
come to the surface.

00:22:41.586 --> 00:22:43.036
So his focus gave him the

00:22:43.036 --> 00:22:45.926
freedom to arrive at an extreme

00:22:45.926 --> 00:22:46.556
solution.

00:22:47.516 --> 00:22:49.336
So the third element of intent

00:22:49.816 --> 00:22:51.306
is extreme focus.

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:52.936
So what might seem like an edge

00:22:52.936 --> 00:22:56.676
case could be what frees you to

00:22:56.676 --> 00:22:59.176
reorient or refocus your design.

00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:00.886
Make it more coherent.

00:23:00.886 --> 00:23:01.786
Make it simpler.

00:23:02.216 --> 00:23:03.616
And therefore actually reach

00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:04.506
more people.

00:23:06.696 --> 00:23:09.796
So let's relate extreme to our

00:23:10.186 --> 00:23:10.406
work.

00:23:10.406 --> 00:23:12.226
Is there a way to relate extreme

00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:13.266
to the work that we do?

00:23:13.966 --> 00:23:15.646
I think there is and I think

00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.196
being extreme can be really

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:19.576
worthwhile but you have to nail

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:19.706
it.

00:23:20.586 --> 00:23:22.846
So you might not immediately

00:23:22.846 --> 00:23:25.696
associate the words extreme and

00:23:26.086 --> 00:23:26.856
weather app.

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:29.766
But Carrot Weather is a really

00:23:29.766 --> 00:23:32.686
compelling illustration of being

00:23:32.766 --> 00:23:33.456
extreme.

00:23:34.476 --> 00:23:36.396
So on the surface it's a weather

00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:36.646
app.

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:37.926
So let's check the weather

00:23:37.926 --> 00:23:38.646
forecast.

00:23:40.046 --> 00:23:42.116
>> I wonder how many licks it

00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.626
takes to get to the center of a

00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:44.446
human skull.

00:23:46.456 --> 00:23:48.476
>> So right, they're not typical

00:23:48.476 --> 00:23:49.326
forecasts.

00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:51.086
The voice of Carrot, which is

00:23:51.086 --> 00:23:52.476
the robotic voice that you

00:23:52.476 --> 00:23:54.676
heard, has personality and

00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:57.136
attitude and a little bit of an

00:23:58.116 --> 00:23:58.196
edge.

00:23:58.726 --> 00:24:00.606
You probably think this sunshine

00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.416
means that things are starting

00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:03.326
to look up for you.

00:24:03.906 --> 00:24:04.456
They're not.

00:24:05.836 --> 00:24:08.256
So you might ask is that even a

00:24:08.256 --> 00:24:08.926
forecast [laughing]?

00:24:08.976 --> 00:24:14.456
So sometimes when I read these

00:24:14.456 --> 00:24:15.996
things I just feel like it's

00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.046
being mean to me.

00:24:17.266 --> 00:24:20.066
It's definitely got an attitude

00:24:20.346 --> 00:24:22.096
but the key information is super

00:24:22.096 --> 00:24:23.596
readable and the screen is

00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:25.036
really nicely organized.

00:24:26.476 --> 00:24:28.216
The color scheme changes

00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:29.826
according to the time of day and

00:24:29.826 --> 00:24:30.906
it's really playful.

00:24:31.226 --> 00:24:32.616
And it's got those illustrations

00:24:32.616 --> 00:24:33.766
along the bottom that are

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:37.726
sometimes bizarre and often

00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:38.366
really funny.

00:24:39.176 --> 00:24:41.386
So the forecast is only one of

00:24:41.426 --> 00:24:43.286
quite a few unique elements in

00:24:43.286 --> 00:24:43.706
the app.

00:24:44.286 --> 00:24:46.066
So I ask the developer whose

00:24:46.066 --> 00:24:47.796
name is Brian Mueller, to help

00:24:47.796 --> 00:24:49.756
me understand where this came

00:24:49.756 --> 00:24:52.316
from and he told me something

00:24:52.316 --> 00:24:52.966
interesting.

00:24:53.356 --> 00:24:54.916
He said that when we writes in

00:24:54.916 --> 00:24:57.186
the voice of Carrot, he's

00:24:57.216 --> 00:24:59.866
channeling the personalities of

00:24:59.866 --> 00:25:01.456
people really close to him --

00:25:01.736 --> 00:25:03.696
his wife, his sister, and his

00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:04.136
mom.

00:25:04.496 --> 00:25:08.126
And these forecasts are a form

00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:11.706
of conversation with them.

00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:14.306
So the lesson is that the people

00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:15.756
that Brian is trying to reach,

00:25:16.466 --> 00:25:17.976
the people that he's speaking to

00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:19.486
with these forecasts are

00:25:19.486 --> 00:25:20.756
actually really specific.

00:25:20.756 --> 00:25:23.196
And I think that's what makes

00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:24.366
his apps stand out.

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:26.246
The edginess helps him connect

00:25:26.246 --> 00:25:26.856
with people.

00:25:27.136 --> 00:25:28.566
And it's not surprising to me

00:25:28.566 --> 00:25:30.246
that he's had so much success in

00:25:30.246 --> 00:25:30.976
the app store.

00:25:32.096 --> 00:25:33.486
The personal touch is what

00:25:33.486 --> 00:25:35.666
allows his app to deeply connect

00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:38.926
with the rest of us.

00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:42.706
Obviously personality isn't the

00:25:42.706 --> 00:25:45.056
sole province of weather apps.

00:25:45.346 --> 00:25:47.596
All apps can deliver something

00:25:47.596 --> 00:25:48.096
like this.

00:25:48.096 --> 00:25:50.326
All apps can feel handcrafted

00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:51.096
and special.

00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:53.096
And that's the fourth element of

00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:54.256
intent that I want to talk

00:25:54.256 --> 00:25:54.476
about.

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:56.776
Intentionally designed apps feel

00:25:57.066 --> 00:25:57.636
personal.

00:25:58.096 --> 00:25:59.316
They create a personal

00:25:59.316 --> 00:25:59.866
connection.

00:26:01.156 --> 00:26:03.386
So the point isn't to spice up

00:26:03.386 --> 00:26:04.806
your copy, right?

00:26:05.236 --> 00:26:07.516
The point is that spicy copy in

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:08.966
the right context feels

00:26:08.966 --> 00:26:09.666
memorable.

00:26:12.356 --> 00:26:14.826
And it must be said that the

00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:16.196
personality of Carrot is

00:26:16.196 --> 00:26:17.666
probably not for everyone.

00:26:18.416 --> 00:26:20.496
And I talked with Brian he

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.636
commented on this.

00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:24.336
So you can probably imagine the

00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:26.316
email and Tweets that he gets

00:26:26.316 --> 00:26:29.786
from people who are surprised or

00:26:29.786 --> 00:26:31.846
upset or offended by the

00:26:31.846 --> 00:26:33.366
forecast after they download the

00:26:33.366 --> 00:26:33.636
app.

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:37.026
Like, you know, how dare he

00:26:37.026 --> 00:26:39.526
insult meteorologists like this?

00:26:40.986 --> 00:26:42.976
So he offers an olive branch --

00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:45.546
[ Laughter ]

00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:48.166
To these disgruntled souls.

00:26:48.766 --> 00:26:50.636
They can adjust the personality

00:26:50.636 --> 00:26:52.096
from the default, which as you

00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:53.496
saw was Homicidal.

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:56.196
You could go the left for less

00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:58.116
edge and to the right for more.

00:26:58.716 --> 00:27:02.896
But the bottom line just to be

00:27:02.896 --> 00:27:05.646
clear is that edgy text would be

00:27:05.796 --> 00:27:08.056
less funny or perhaps not funny

00:27:08.056 --> 00:27:10.106
at all if the app didn't work,

00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:10.766
right?

00:27:10.986 --> 00:27:12.546
It's a good weather app with

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:14.436
simple navigation and a playful

00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:14.726
UI.

00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:17.866
The extreme personality though

00:27:18.286 --> 00:27:20.436
is what gives life and sprit to

00:27:20.436 --> 00:27:20.556
it.

00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:21.506
So when I get a Carrot

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:24.246
notification it's similar to the

00:27:24.246 --> 00:27:26.506
feeling that I have when I go

00:27:26.506 --> 00:27:28.816
out to a local restaurant or bar

00:27:29.626 --> 00:27:31.266
where everyone knows my name,

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:31.706
right?

00:27:31.706 --> 00:27:33.996
It's enjoyable, it's personal,

00:27:34.106 --> 00:27:35.036
and it's comfortable.

00:27:36.976 --> 00:27:39.296
So we've got four things that

00:27:39.296 --> 00:27:41.076
characterize intent and the

00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:42.576
behavior of intentionally

00:27:42.576 --> 00:27:43.416
designed apps.

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:45.466
And I want to flip things around

00:27:45.466 --> 00:27:47.596
for a moment and talk about what

00:27:47.596 --> 00:27:48.676
happens when you're not

00:27:48.716 --> 00:27:49.446
intentional.

00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:52.046
In other words, where does bad

00:27:52.046 --> 00:27:53.046
UI come from?

00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:55.926
So I think the best friends and

00:27:55.926 --> 00:27:57.946
the worst enemies to designing

00:27:57.946 --> 00:28:00.126
intentionally are all of the

00:28:00.126 --> 00:28:02.336
systems and patterns that we've

00:28:02.336 --> 00:28:04.096
internalized as we've gained

00:28:04.096 --> 00:28:05.346
experience in the work that we

00:28:05.346 --> 00:28:05.656
do.

00:28:06.696 --> 00:28:08.426
This experience allows us to

00:28:08.426 --> 00:28:10.026
make decisions quickly and to be

00:28:10.026 --> 00:28:11.786
really efficient in that work.

00:28:13.236 --> 00:28:15.876
But these familiar patterns get

00:28:15.876 --> 00:28:17.756
in the way of our ability to

00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:19.566
reckon with new problems.

00:28:19.706 --> 00:28:20.726
Sometimes we won't even

00:28:20.726 --> 00:28:22.226
recognize that the problems are

00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:24.626
new and this is true of anyone

00:28:24.686 --> 00:28:26.636
who has tried to make anything

00:28:26.636 --> 00:28:28.886
new ever, right?

00:28:29.156 --> 00:28:31.146
Suitcases once had a form.

00:28:31.586 --> 00:28:33.266
They were rectangular and the

00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:34.726
long side was down.

00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:37.966
That form was adjusted but the

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:39.546
fundamental elements were always

00:28:39.546 --> 00:28:40.536
taken as a given.

00:28:40.976 --> 00:28:43.426
The wheels were tacked on but

00:28:43.426 --> 00:28:45.476
the overall form stayed the

00:28:45.476 --> 00:28:45.966
same.

00:28:46.716 --> 00:28:49.826
For decades smart people

00:28:50.246 --> 00:28:52.306
considered this form and stopped

00:28:52.306 --> 00:28:52.696
there.

00:28:53.186 --> 00:28:55.246
It took someone with a very

00:28:55.246 --> 00:28:57.646
sharp focus on an extreme

00:28:57.646 --> 00:29:00.006
audience to break out of this

00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:03.446
pattern, right, and turn the

00:29:03.446 --> 00:29:04.726
form on it's head [laughing].

00:29:06.636 --> 00:29:06.976
Thank you.

00:29:07.516 --> 00:29:09.546
[ Applause ]

00:29:10.046 --> 00:29:12.136
So we apply patterns

00:29:12.136 --> 00:29:12.906
automatically.

00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:15.486
Our brains make connections

00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:17.306
quickly and that has benefits,

00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:17.506
right?

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:18.996
It helps us work efficiently.

00:29:19.606 --> 00:29:21.956
It helps us be consistent, but

00:29:21.956 --> 00:29:23.206
it also prevents us from

00:29:23.206 --> 00:29:25.506
noticing the obvious and

00:29:25.506 --> 00:29:27.766
challenging it, asking

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.106
fundamental questions, why does

00:29:29.146 --> 00:29:31.026
this thing need to be this way?

00:29:31.426 --> 00:29:33.786
So as a UI designer it's really

00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:36.356
tempting always to draw on

00:29:36.426 --> 00:29:38.336
familiar UI elements to solve

00:29:38.336 --> 00:29:39.216
new problems.

00:29:39.826 --> 00:29:41.786
I'm sure you're familiar with

00:29:41.786 --> 00:29:42.906
the house icon.

00:29:43.306 --> 00:29:44.926
It made sense in a desktop

00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:45.476
browser.

00:29:45.916 --> 00:29:48.766
A browser is a frame for the

00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:50.026
Internet universe.

00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:52.956
A browser home button will lift

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:55.456
you out of whatever corner of

00:29:55.456 --> 00:29:57.776
the dark web that you found

00:29:57.776 --> 00:30:00.036
yourself in and allows you to

00:30:00.036 --> 00:30:00.976
get out of there.

00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:02.896
So that notion of home was

00:30:02.896 --> 00:30:04.336
extended to iPhone and the

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:05.756
behavior is similar.

00:30:06.886 --> 00:30:08.776
It's a shortcut, it's an easy

00:30:08.776 --> 00:30:10.406
button, home is a starting

00:30:10.406 --> 00:30:13.556
place, and unlike in real life,

00:30:13.556 --> 00:30:14.926
home is a place that you can

00:30:14.926 --> 00:30:17.056
always return to with a simple

00:30:17.056 --> 00:30:17.636
gesture.

00:30:18.436 --> 00:30:20.646
You can go home whenever you

00:30:20.646 --> 00:30:21.016
want.

00:30:22.636 --> 00:30:24.326
So home is also a familiar

00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:25.416
notion in the finder.

00:30:25.416 --> 00:30:27.206
Here the spirit is more like --

00:30:28.306 --> 00:30:30.556
you followed the river to it's

00:30:30.556 --> 00:30:31.396
headwaters.

00:30:32.346 --> 00:30:33.756
On the Mac, home represents a

00:30:33.756 --> 00:30:34.526
container.

00:30:34.846 --> 00:30:36.046
Everything is in here.

00:30:36.486 --> 00:30:37.686
You don't need to look anywhere

00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:37.986
else.

00:30:38.446 --> 00:30:40.866
you have reached the source.

00:30:42.736 --> 00:30:45.406
Home in these contexts offers

00:30:45.496 --> 00:30:48.236
reliability, safety, an ability

00:30:48.236 --> 00:30:50.066
to return as you navigate

00:30:50.066 --> 00:30:50.616
outward.

00:30:51.076 --> 00:30:54.256
And it's clear obvious utility

00:30:54.466 --> 00:30:56.926
elsewhere on the platform might

00:30:56.926 --> 00:30:58.716
seem like a reasonable choice as

00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.466
a tab bar icon, right?

00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:04.866
Except there's a crucial

00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:06.456
difference in using the notion

00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:07.726
of home in a tab bar.

00:31:08.976 --> 00:31:12.226
To be blunt, an app isn't a

00:31:12.226 --> 00:31:14.656
frame containing god knows what.

00:31:15.686 --> 00:31:18.216
A typical app offers specific

00:31:18.216 --> 00:31:20.026
things, specific contents,

00:31:20.026 --> 00:31:21.746
specific tools, specific

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:22.426
actions.

00:31:22.746 --> 00:31:24.826
And a tab bar is a quick

00:31:24.826 --> 00:31:26.726
expression of the overall

00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:28.246
utility of your app.

00:31:28.246 --> 00:31:30.066
It's a high-level map of your

00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:31.433
app.

00:31:31.696 --> 00:31:33.676
So let's use an example that's

00:31:33.676 --> 00:31:36.016
close to home -- the tab bar of

00:31:36.016 --> 00:31:37.866
WWDC app.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:41.486
So we all can get a quick

00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:43.946
understanding of the scope of

00:31:43.946 --> 00:31:45.596
information that's available in

00:31:45.596 --> 00:31:47.226
the app simply by scanning the

00:31:47.226 --> 00:31:47.786
tab bar.

00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:50.196
We can guess at what content

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:52.716
might be in each tab.

00:31:52.716 --> 00:31:54.756
So tab bar icons and tab bar

00:31:54.756 --> 00:31:56.556
labels should be as direct as

00:31:56.556 --> 00:31:57.246
possible.

00:31:57.976 --> 00:32:00.086
And this directness will then

00:32:00.086 --> 00:32:02.896
limit what each tab can contain

00:32:02.896 --> 00:32:03.766
and that's great.

00:32:04.976 --> 00:32:06.296
Directness creates

00:32:06.296 --> 00:32:07.246
predictability.

00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:09.166
So the app may not do

00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:12.836
everything, right, no app does

00:32:12.836 --> 00:32:13.346
everything.

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:15.166
But people won't have to hunt

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:16.466
around to figure out what it

00:32:16.466 --> 00:32:17.656
does and doesn't do.

00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:20.726
So when I talk about home I'm

00:32:20.726 --> 00:32:21.816
talking about a metaphor,

00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:24.816
homeland, a home base.

00:32:27.056 --> 00:32:29.186
So let's just dig in to why home

00:32:29.256 --> 00:32:29.946
doesn't work.

00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:32.506
First it's overly broad and it

00:32:32.506 --> 00:32:33.516
feels generic.

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.126
And I think it's a copout.

00:32:36.556 --> 00:32:37.996
You're avoiding a decision by

00:32:37.996 --> 00:32:39.246
naming a tab Home.

00:32:39.896 --> 00:32:41.876
The perceived comforts of home

00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:44.236
as an icon in a label are

00:32:44.236 --> 00:32:45.406
getting in the way of being

00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:47.596
direct, of clearly and directly

00:32:47.596 --> 00:32:48.976
communicating the scope of

00:32:48.976 --> 00:32:50.616
what's in your app.

00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:53.236
If your app is a meditation app

00:32:53.776 --> 00:32:55.796
and offers content related to

00:32:55.856 --> 00:32:57.046
meditating and building a

00:32:57.046 --> 00:33:01.036
meditation practice, imagine the

00:33:01.036 --> 00:33:02.666
impression that it would leave

00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:04.686
on people if not only the tab

00:33:04.686 --> 00:33:06.456
bar was more direct, but the

00:33:06.456 --> 00:33:07.976
directness of the tab bar

00:33:08.276 --> 00:33:10.256
enforced a simplicity and an

00:33:10.326 --> 00:33:12.296
order on the content that you

00:33:12.296 --> 00:33:12.926
display.

00:33:13.006 --> 00:33:15.576
And that content was predictable

00:33:15.746 --> 00:33:17.356
and directly organized.

00:33:18.586 --> 00:33:20.236
So indirect labels feel

00:33:20.236 --> 00:33:22.246
conventional and they feel safe

00:33:22.356 --> 00:33:23.726
but they mask utility.

00:33:24.406 --> 00:33:25.786
Like a storage locker you're

00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:27.066
putting your valuable stuff

00:33:27.196 --> 00:33:29.066
behind a door that's anonymous

00:33:29.096 --> 00:33:29.946
and inscrutable.

00:33:30.246 --> 00:33:32.176
And this is what I mean by

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:33.396
unintentional design.

00:33:34.666 --> 00:33:36.436
No one intends to be indirect.

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.516
Being intentional will lead to

00:33:40.556 --> 00:33:41.886
cleaner and clearer

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:42.706
communication.

00:33:42.706 --> 00:33:44.846
And this brings me to my final

00:33:44.846 --> 00:33:45.936
element of intent.

00:33:46.466 --> 00:33:47.976
Direct communication.

00:33:48.216 --> 00:33:49.806
Intentionally design things.

00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:51.366
Clearly communicate to the

00:33:51.366 --> 00:33:52.466
people who use them.

00:33:52.836 --> 00:33:55.766
And the way to achieve this is

00:33:55.766 --> 00:33:57.486
to draw on what people learn on

00:33:57.486 --> 00:33:59.606
the platform and in the world.

00:34:00.156 --> 00:34:01.456
So I want to show you a couple

00:34:01.496 --> 00:34:04.266
of last quick examples of apps

00:34:04.356 --> 00:34:06.616
that rely on a familiar form to

00:34:06.616 --> 00:34:08.356
make interactions feel useful.

00:34:09.976 --> 00:34:12.065
So the core concept of an app

00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:13.666
called Tinycards is to bring

00:34:13.666 --> 00:34:15.045
flashcards on to a mobile

00:34:15.045 --> 00:34:15.636
advice.

00:34:15.856 --> 00:34:17.416
You can use them to memorize

00:34:17.525 --> 00:34:18.315
pretty much anything --

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:20.916
languages, flowers, leaves,

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:22.306
almost anything.

00:34:22.835 --> 00:34:25.255
So the interaction within the

00:34:25.255 --> 00:34:26.516
app is super direct.

00:34:26.676 --> 00:34:28.226
People expect cards to have

00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:29.916
dimension, so that periodic

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:31.686
pulse is inviting you to

00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:32.866
interact with the card.

00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:35.156
You flip the card over by

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:35.735
tapping it.

00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:37.716
So these cards have two sides.

00:34:38.856 --> 00:34:40.286
They've respected the metaphor

00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:41.005
of the card.

00:34:42.116 --> 00:34:43.416
People appreciate that.

00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:47.525
So the entire experience of

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:49.516
Tinycards is based on quickly

00:34:49.516 --> 00:34:51.076
flicking through these cards as

00:34:51.076 --> 00:34:52.386
you commit things to memory.

00:34:52.795 --> 00:34:54.775
Like for instance the flags of

00:34:54.775 --> 00:34:55.906
Canadian provinces.

00:34:55.906 --> 00:34:56.926
Does anyone know this one?

00:35:00.116 --> 00:35:01.886
Ontario. Let's try it.

00:35:04.556 --> 00:35:05.236
Oh my gosh.

00:35:06.196 --> 00:35:07.796
You've done that quiz before,

00:35:08.466 --> 00:35:08.566
right?

00:35:09.856 --> 00:35:12.086
So the UI of Tinycards is so

00:35:12.086 --> 00:35:13.876
clear you don't even think about

00:35:13.876 --> 00:35:14.016
it.

00:35:14.186 --> 00:35:15.666
Working with cards feels

00:35:15.666 --> 00:35:17.056
completely natural and you can

00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:18.386
just focus on your goal, which

00:35:18.386 --> 00:35:19.266
is learning stuff.

00:35:20.616 --> 00:35:22.466
So what Tinycards demonstrates

00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:24.336
to me is that if you implement a

00:35:24.336 --> 00:35:26.056
metaphor well, people will

00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:27.266
instantly become immersed.

00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:28.386
They'll forget that they're even

00:35:28.386 --> 00:35:29.566
interacting with a UI.

00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:33.026
And once they're immersed, you

00:35:33.026 --> 00:35:34.876
even have the opportunity to

00:35:34.876 --> 00:35:36.926
extend the metaphor, to really

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:38.776
surprise and even delight

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:39.246
people.

00:35:40.066 --> 00:35:41.686
So I want to show you a game.

00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:43.856
It's called Gorogoa and it

00:35:43.856 --> 00:35:45.796
extends the metaphor of the card

00:35:45.976 --> 00:35:47.536
in a way that I feel like

00:35:47.576 --> 00:35:49.216
creates a truly unique

00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:50.076
experience.

00:35:50.856 --> 00:35:52.806
So Gorogoa is a puzzle game.

00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:55.616
You move cards around a grid and

00:35:55.616 --> 00:35:57.516
you advance in the game and in

00:35:57.516 --> 00:35:58.986
the story by getting them into

00:35:58.986 --> 00:36:00.086
the right positions.

00:36:00.736 --> 00:36:01.866
But you could see that these

00:36:01.866 --> 00:36:03.976
cards do things that no actual

00:36:03.976 --> 00:36:05.026
cards can do.

00:36:05.386 --> 00:36:07.886
They can be torn off and as

00:36:07.886 --> 00:36:09.026
you'll see in a moment they can

00:36:09.026 --> 00:36:10.366
actually stitch themselves

00:36:10.366 --> 00:36:12.756
together into a scene.

00:36:18.116 --> 00:36:19.246
Yeah, this is an incredible

00:36:19.246 --> 00:36:19.616
game.

00:36:20.236 --> 00:36:22.236
[ Applause ]

00:36:22.456 --> 00:36:24.176
And it's a great example of how

00:36:24.176 --> 00:36:25.596
you can extend the metaphor

00:36:25.696 --> 00:36:27.386
farther than you might think and

00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:29.206
create something truly amazing.

00:36:29.686 --> 00:36:31.566
This moment right here where

00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:32.976
you've got this card metaphor

00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:34.396
that suddenly kind of

00:36:34.396 --> 00:36:35.966
disappears, that's purely

00:36:35.966 --> 00:36:37.906
delightful and it's really I

00:36:37.976 --> 00:36:39.966
think a great testament to how

00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:42.266
well he's implemented the

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.286
metaphor of cards.

00:36:45.456 --> 00:36:47.476
Bending and extending metaphors

00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:49.626
doesn't work if the result

00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:51.666
doesn't extend the utility, or

00:36:51.666 --> 00:36:53.556
value, or delight of your app.

00:36:53.616 --> 00:36:55.806
That's why the home tab on the

00:36:56.106 --> 00:36:57.556
tab bar doesn't work, right?

00:36:57.556 --> 00:36:59.506
It doesn't extend the utility of

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:01.676
the app or create any additional

00:37:01.676 --> 00:37:02.206
value.

00:37:03.316 --> 00:37:05.046
So the last app I want to show

00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:08.226
you is an example that combines

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:09.906
metaphors from the real and

00:37:09.906 --> 00:37:11.466
digital world in a really simple

00:37:11.466 --> 00:37:11.966
way.

00:37:11.966 --> 00:37:13.426
It's called Rosarium.

00:37:13.966 --> 00:37:14.056
Yeah.

00:37:15.516 --> 00:37:19.546
[ Applause ]

00:37:20.046 --> 00:37:22.486
I think the developers are here.

00:37:22.486 --> 00:37:23.746
It's a rosary that you wear on

00:37:23.746 --> 00:37:25.526
your wrist and I believe that is

00:37:25.526 --> 00:37:29.526
Latin and the font is really

00:37:29.526 --> 00:37:30.816
communicating to me that it's

00:37:30.816 --> 00:37:32.046
Latin anyway.

00:37:32.226 --> 00:37:34.236
So the beads are represented by

00:37:34.236 --> 00:37:34.876
circles.

00:37:34.966 --> 00:37:36.416
Each time you turn the digital

00:37:36.416 --> 00:37:38.516
crown you get a slight haptic

00:37:38.576 --> 00:37:38.836
tab.

00:37:39.406 --> 00:37:40.676
So when I met the developers

00:37:40.676 --> 00:37:42.156
they told me that they were

00:37:42.156 --> 00:37:44.086
inspired by the similarity

00:37:44.086 --> 00:37:46.276
between the feel of rotating the

00:37:46.276 --> 00:37:48.276
digital crown and the feel of an

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:49.566
actual rosary bead.

00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:52.736
So the app has translated this

00:37:52.736 --> 00:37:54.866
real world object, just a strand

00:37:54.866 --> 00:37:56.616
of beads, into the virtual world

00:37:56.616 --> 00:37:58.866
in a way that feels really

00:37:58.866 --> 00:37:59.476
natural.

00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:01.966
So I'm no suggesting that it's a

00:38:01.966 --> 00:38:04.116
replacement for rosary beads or

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:05.546
any prayer beads because the

00:38:05.546 --> 00:38:07.496
physical beads can have deep,

00:38:07.716 --> 00:38:09.056
you know, personal meaning.

00:38:09.576 --> 00:38:11.066
But I love how they've

00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:13.066
thoughtfully carried that real

00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.786
world experience into a digital

00:38:14.786 --> 00:38:16.626
form in a way that's so

00:38:16.626 --> 00:38:18.476
radically simple and clear.

00:38:19.486 --> 00:38:20.666
And I think it really

00:38:21.556 --> 00:38:23.516
illustrates each of the points

00:38:23.516 --> 00:38:24.646
that I made earlier -- the

00:38:24.646 --> 00:38:26.326
simplicity and the understanding

00:38:26.326 --> 00:38:28.946
of people, the extreme kind of

00:38:28.946 --> 00:38:31.256
focus on a problem and the

00:38:31.256 --> 00:38:32.906
direct communication of a

00:38:32.906 --> 00:38:33.626
solution.

00:38:34.086 --> 00:38:36.736
And this is intent in action.

00:38:36.736 --> 00:38:38.226
This is being intentional in

00:38:38.226 --> 00:38:38.756
design.

00:38:38.756 --> 00:38:41.036
It's a matter of turning off the

00:38:41.036 --> 00:38:43.956
automatic part of your brain, of

00:38:43.956 --> 00:38:46.176
slowing down, and challenging

00:38:46.176 --> 00:38:46.956
the obvious.

00:38:48.506 --> 00:38:51.216
It requires a level of intention

00:38:51.386 --> 00:38:53.326
that will enable your decisions

00:38:53.326 --> 00:38:55.266
to become more conscious and for

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.186
you to become aware of the

00:38:57.186 --> 00:38:58.876
patterns and the familiar things

00:38:58.876 --> 00:39:00.016
that might get in the way and

00:39:00.016 --> 00:39:02.996
block you and focus on people,

00:39:03.356 --> 00:39:03.566
right?

00:39:03.566 --> 00:39:04.486
The people that you want to

00:39:04.536 --> 00:39:06.706
serve, the person who inspires

00:39:06.706 --> 00:39:08.446
you, the family member who

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.696
allows you to be the best

00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:12.506
version of yourself, the

00:39:12.506 --> 00:39:14.796
coworkers with whom you share a

00:39:14.796 --> 00:39:16.686
real need for something better,

00:39:16.816 --> 00:39:19.386
and you can take that

00:39:19.736 --> 00:39:21.936
inspiration and use it to

00:39:21.936 --> 00:39:24.016
discover newer and better ways

00:39:24.256 --> 00:39:26.626
to connect with people and to

00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:28.746
create something really great.

00:39:31.076 --> 00:39:33.096
So you can check out more about

00:39:33.096 --> 00:39:34.056
my session here.

00:39:34.056 --> 00:39:35.116
Thank you very much.

00:39:35.196 --> 00:39:40.036
And please, please stick around

00:39:40.036 --> 00:39:43.796
for the next talk.

00:39:43.796 --> 00:39:45.736
The next talk is designing fluid

00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:46.726
interfaces.

00:39:47.266 --> 00:39:48.886
It's a great talk.

00:39:49.026 --> 00:39:50.986
Easily one of the top seven

00:39:50.986 --> 00:39:52.486
design talks at this year's

00:39:52.526 --> 00:39:53.236
WWDC.

00:39:53.356 --> 00:39:54.396
So thank you.
