[ Music ]

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:41.836
>> Well, hello.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:45.196
It is great to be back here with

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.556
the Design Awards on the main

00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:47.146
stage.

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:50.016
And this evening we've got a

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:50.896
great evening for you.

00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:52.646
So, thank you for coming out and

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:55.036
joining us in this afternoon and

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:56.896
celebration of the winners that

00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:57.766
we're going to announce, soon.

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:00.266
We're here to honor developers

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.706
who have done excellent work and

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:05.296
with technology adoption, with

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.066
innovation, making their apps

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:07.496
unique.

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:11.116
And in my role at Apple and in

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:12.426
my team's role at Apple we've

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:14.046
worked with so many of you over

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:15.866
the years, helping you to create

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.716
great apps.

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:20.826
Apps that are engaging and apps

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.866
that are compelling.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.056
Apps that are high performance

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:26.266
and apps that are, honestly,

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.116
really great.

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:29.266
And so, it's an honor for me to

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.756
be here and to be able to lead

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.126
this award ceremony and honor

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.706
these developers, tonight.

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.726
The work that is done by you, as

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:41.076
the developer committee, speaks

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:42.026
to the heart of Apple.

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.756
And that heart is, as we all

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:46.376
know, creativity.

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:49.746
In all of its forms, we believe

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:52.836
that creativity has always been

00:01:52.836 --> 00:01:54.266
humanity's greatest super power.

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:56.476
And when it combines with

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:59.886
technology great things come to

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:00.326
life.

00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:02.016
Incredible things come to life.

00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:04.596
And that's why we feel deeply

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.506
that you, as developers, are

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:07.776
amazingly creative.

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:11.586
Like a paintbrush to an artist,

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:15.006
chords to a composer, words to

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:17.926
an author, code is an even more

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:19.216
advanced creative tool.

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:21.866
Because it can really do and

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.136
create so much.

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:26.926
As developers, you're developing

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.736
on the canvas of the entire

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.816
world causing great new

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:35.086
groundbreaking apps and ideas to

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:36.026
take shape.

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:39.006
And each year new and

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:40.366
transformative apps are

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.326
introduced bases on those ideas.

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:45.426
And each time this happens you

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.116
take creativity to new levels.

00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:51.436
For example, take a look at the

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:53.326
last three years of Apple Design

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:54.706
Award winners.

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:57.216
There are incredible games here.

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:02.296
Powerful design tools.

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:04.296
New workflow solution, new video

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:05.486
workflow solutions.

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:08.206
Innovative photography tools.

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:11.056
Apps that empower health and

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:11.636
fitness.

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:15.176
Music creation and DJing tools.

00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:18.166
And apps to better understand

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:18.916
human anatomy.

00:03:20.236 --> 00:03:22.366
As well as everyday tools that

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:24.636
help you to get things done and

00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:26.666
make a, truly make a difference

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:27.256
in this world.

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.936
The developers of these apps and

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:32.706
so many more over the years have

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.406
amazed us with their excellent

00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:35.126
work.

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:38.536
Now, we all understand the

00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:40.546
incredible hard work that goes

00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:42.296
into the design and development

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:43.836
of great apps like these and

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:44.226
others.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:47.766
We're all too familiar with the

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:50.056
long nights, long hours,

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:52.496
technical hurdles, design

00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:55.356
challenges, and honestly, often,

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:56.606
a really hard to find bugs.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.916
But that's why we're here

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:00.296
tonight.

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:04.506
To honor and celebrate that hard

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:05.286
work.

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:07.676
Today's winners set a new

00:04:07.676 --> 00:04:09.976
benchmark in creativity and they

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:11.356
demonstrate the mark of

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:13.416
brilliance that makes something

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:14.036
truly great.

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:18.315
Okay. We've got something to do

00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:19.466
here, tonight, which is to give

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:20.646
out a bunch of awards.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:22.406
And we're going to do that in a

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:23.536
very large room.

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:25.686
So, if you hear your name

00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:27.766
called, if you hear your app's

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:29.946
name called, you need to make it

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:30.746
up here fast.

00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:32.746
Because we want to move this

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:34.746
along and it's a big room.

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:36.676
There are two sets of stairs

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:37.806
here on either side of me.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:40.086
So, just head towards me, you'll

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:41.186
find a set of stairs, you'll

00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:42.236
make it onto the stage, and

00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:44.886
we'll move on from there.

00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:48.496
So, let's get started.

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:50.206
Identifying the audience for

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.916
your app and developing

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.426
something that's perfectly

00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:56.566
suited for them and their needs

00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.116
is really important.

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:00.736
The developer of our first

00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:02.516
winner today built an app that's

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:05.296
perfectly tuned for children and

00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:07.936
the way that they learn.

00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:09.736
Join me in congratulating

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:12.286
Bandimal by Yatatoy.

00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:35.500
[ Music ]

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:37.106
All right.

00:05:38.386 --> 00:05:39.856
So, Bandimal is a fun and

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:41.936
intuitive music composer app.

00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:44.876
It lets kids explore music and

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.546
be the maestro of their own

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:47.936
animal band.

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:50.896
And the key to this app is its

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:52.366
focus on creativity.

00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:55.876
There are no rules, no notes, no

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:57.796
chords, no scores.

00:05:58.896 --> 00:05:59.866
Let's take a look.

00:06:00.086 --> 00:06:00.476
Andrea.

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:02.316
>> Thanks, John.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:03.656
Let's dive right in.

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:05.366
I'll tap on the plus here to

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:06.456
start a new composition.

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:08.656
And the music gets started right

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:09.216
away,

00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:11.660
which we should hear, soon.

00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:13.666
There we go.

00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:15.616
But we're going to need to add

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:16.286
some notes.

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:19.086
The app has this adorable cast

00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:20.816
of animal characters.

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:21.986
Each one makes a different

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:22.466
sound.

00:06:22.676 --> 00:06:24.246
I'm going to swipe through them

00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:25.196
till I find one that I like,

00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:26.306
which I guess, I'm going to go

00:06:26.306 --> 00:06:27.286
with this buffalo, here.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.056
I'll tap down here with my

00:06:29.146 --> 00:06:31.586
finger to add some notes.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.546
And you can see each note comes

00:06:33.546 --> 00:06:36.126
with its own special dance move.

00:06:36.126 --> 00:06:37.216
Now, I'm going to speed up the

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:38.716
tempo by turning this dial.

00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:41.896
And, maybe, after I do that I

00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:43.596
decide I want to give my buffalo

00:06:43.956 --> 00:06:47.566
a nice rest every other beat.

00:06:47.786 --> 00:06:49.106
There we go.

00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:52.596
Now, I need a nice lead singer

00:06:52.596 --> 00:06:54.056
to complement my buffalo bass,

00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:55.756
so I'm going to tap here, swipe

00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:57.000
through my options.

00:06:59.416 --> 00:06:59.976
There we go.

00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:01.226
This chicken looks like she'll

00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:01.836
be a star.

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:03.330
Tap down here.

00:07:07.296 --> 00:07:08.466
And I'm going to speed up her

00:07:08.466 --> 00:07:09.716
tempo to match my buffalo bass.

00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:13.176
And, maybe, I'll do a call and

00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:16.106
response type thing so they can

00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:17.676
interact with each other.

00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:19.196
Now, I need one more animal to

00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:19.646
spice things up.

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:20.876
So, I'm going to tap here.

00:07:20.876 --> 00:07:22.656
I happen to know there's a

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.666
particularly funky jellyfish

00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:24.806
here.

00:07:24.996 --> 00:07:28.826
So, let's give this one a go.

00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:30.806
Now, let's listen.

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:35.830
[ Music ]

00:07:36.376 --> 00:07:36.816
Sounds good.

00:07:36.816 --> 00:07:39.516
So, as kids create these

00:07:39.516 --> 00:07:40.686
compositions they're building

00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:41.746
their sense of rhythm and

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:43.606
musicality, very playfully and

00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:45.086
naturally, without need for any

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:46.096
prior musical knowledge.

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:48.766
And the beauty of the app is any

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.026
combination of notes is going to

00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:51.096
sound good, because it's all

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:52.876
playing in pentatonic scale.

00:07:52.876 --> 00:07:54.416
So, there's always a feeling of

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:55.096
success.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:56.796
Let's check out this percussion

00:07:56.796 --> 00:07:57.546
section, up here.

00:07:57.546 --> 00:07:59.396
So, I'm going to add some high

00:07:59.396 --> 00:07:59.826
hat there.

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:02.216
Layer in some snare drum and

00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:03.326
some more percussion, here.

00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:07.326
And lastly, my bass drum.

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:09.206
All of these sounds, percussion

00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:11.456
and animals, were recorded in

00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:12.596
the studio using real

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:13.856
instruments to get the music and

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:15.336
natural sounds.

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:18.266
I can even add a sound effect by

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:20.176
tapping on these mountains.

00:08:20.286 --> 00:08:21.486
That's going to give my chicken

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:22.106
an echo.

00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:23.786
So, let's check out this

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:24.936
reverberating chicken.

00:08:25.516 --> 00:08:29.500
[ Music ]

00:08:30.046 --> 00:08:31.826
So, you can see there's all

00:08:31.826 --> 00:08:32.866
sorts of fun to be had with

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:33.726
sound in this app.

00:08:33.986 --> 00:08:35.265
And it's a great way for kids to

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.806
get creative with music and feel

00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:38.976
their ear and their intuition

00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:40.456
for the rhythms and sounds that

00:08:40.626 --> 00:08:41.736
they like to hear together.

00:08:41.996 --> 00:08:43.816
The Yatatoy team of three spent

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.126
two years developing this app

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:46.546
using Swift, Sprite Kit, and

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:47.306
Core Audio.

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:48.836
They were working remotely

00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:50.066
between Helsinki and Vienna.

00:08:50.656 --> 00:08:51.706
And they were doing this in the

00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:53.336
afterhours from their day jobs.

00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:54.646
It's all culminated in an app

00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:55.786
that's really magical.

00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.816
So, congratulations.

00:09:08.596 --> 00:09:09.156
That's Bandimal.

00:09:09.156 --> 00:09:10.866
All right.

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:12.766
Next up in an app developed by a

00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:14.576
team of two biologists; a

00:09:14.646 --> 00:09:16.026
physicist, and a chemist.

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:18.946
Both are long time Indie Mac

00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:21.126

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:23.186
actually, a four-time Apple

00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:24.026

00:09:24.566 --> 00:09:27.476
These guys teamed up to develop

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:32.256
our next app, which is Agenda by

00:09:34.516 --> 00:10:08.500
[ Music ]

00:10:09.486 --> 00:10:11.016
So, Agenda takes a clever new

00:10:11.016 --> 00:10:12.656
approach to note taking on the

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:14.886
Mac and now, on iOS, as well.

00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:17.216
By combining notes, calendars,

00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:19.656
and tasks in unique ways and

00:10:19.656 --> 00:10:20.556
with really powerful

00:10:20.556 --> 00:10:21.326
relationships.

00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:23.606
And as well, it's got a great

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:24.616
clean design.

00:10:24.906 --> 00:10:26.236
And we'd like to show it to you,

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:26.466
now.

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:27.586
So, I'm going to hand it over to

00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:27.846

00:10:29.156 --> 00:10:31.026
>> Agenda is a simple and fresh

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:32.346
way to keep yourself organized.

00:10:32.786 --> 00:10:34.456
It combines a To-Do list and a

00:10:34.456 --> 00:10:35.826
note taking app with a

00:10:35.826 --> 00:10:37.776
delightful calendar integration.

00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:38.706
Let me show you what I mean.

00:10:39.336 --> 00:10:40.676
We start out with On the Agenda.

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:41.996
This is a task manager like

00:10:41.996 --> 00:10:42.506
experience.

00:10:42.916 --> 00:10:44.206
I can quickly see my highest

00:10:44.246 --> 00:10:45.846
priority items and what I need

00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:47.596
to do with all my prior notes

00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:47.966
attached.

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:49.326
I can mark things off as I

00:10:49.326 --> 00:10:49.836
complete them.

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:50.746
So, now that we're done with

00:10:50.826 --> 00:10:52.036
Keynote, let's get that off.

00:10:52.036 --> 00:10:53.096
And State of the Union.

00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:54.506
Actually, in the midst of a

00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:55.666
house renovation, so I need to

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:56.996
remember to call the contractor.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:10:58.756
It's super convenient to see all

00:10:58.756 --> 00:11:00.516
my prior notes attached before I

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:01.636
make that phone call.

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:03.726
What makes this app really great

00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:04.656
is its integration with

00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:05.176
Calendar.

00:11:05.746 --> 00:11:06.796
So, on the right-hand side here,

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:08.526
you can see all my Calendar

00:11:08.526 --> 00:11:08.776
events.

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:11.106
There's a HealthKit lab tomorrow

00:11:11.106 --> 00:11:12.566
and I need to remember to note

00:11:12.566 --> 00:11:13.466
down a couple of questions.

00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:14.386
So, we'll do that together.

00:11:15.506 --> 00:11:16.816
So, I bring in this note.

00:11:17.606 --> 00:11:18.686
You can see it brings in all the

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:19.776
details from Calendar.

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:21.766
So, the event details, the

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:23.826
location, the attendees.

00:11:23.826 --> 00:11:25.186
So, I can focus on creating the

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:25.326
note.

00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:28.326
So, as I create this note, you

00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:29.946
can see the app supports

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:30.546
markdown.

00:11:31.756 --> 00:11:33.636
It also supports tagging, which

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:34.066
is really nice.

00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:34.806
So, I'm going to tag this as a

00:11:34.806 --> 00:11:35.736
HealthKit related note.

00:11:36.546 --> 00:11:37.646
As I'm making this note, I

00:11:37.646 --> 00:11:39.616
realize a colleague and I had a

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:40.686
meeting a couple weeks back,

00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:41.566
where we brainstormed some

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:42.596
HealthKit related questions.

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:43.806
So, I'm going to swing over to

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.286
Calendar and find that meeting.

00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:50.046
This meeting with John.

00:11:50.246 --> 00:11:53.006
Agenda provides this link in the

00:11:53.006 --> 00:11:54.756
Calendar in my, so as I click on

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.056
this it clicks me right back

00:11:56.096 --> 00:11:57.966
into this meeting with John.

00:11:58.666 --> 00:11:59.666
And here are the questions that

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:00.586
I wanted.

00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:03.296
So, you can imagine after using

00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:05.656
this for a couple weeks, you end

00:12:05.656 --> 00:12:06.546
up with this really great

00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:08.226
integration with Calendar and

00:12:08.226 --> 00:12:08.596
Agenda.

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:09.926
And it keeps you super

00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:10.366
organized.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:15.036
Lastly, because I know I'm going

00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:16.816
to be doing a lot of HealthKit

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:18.506
talking this week, I'm going to

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:19.636
search for all my HealthKit

00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:20.516
related events.

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.146
And I can save this as an

00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:23.676
overview.

00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:24.876
And what this does, it creates

00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:25.976
this nice little pocket here,

00:12:25.976 --> 00:12:26.896
where everything HealthKit

00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:27.976
related is in one spot.

00:12:28.436 --> 00:12:29.226
Super convenient.

00:12:30.596 --> 00:12:31.826
The entire app is created in

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:33.566
Swift and it leverages iCloud,

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:35.236
so it syncs across all of my

00:12:35.236 --> 00:12:35.726
devices.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:37.566
Agenda is not simply a place to

00:12:37.566 --> 00:12:38.036
store text.

00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:39.636
Rather, a tool that gently

00:12:39.636 --> 00:12:41.316
reinforces great note taking

00:12:41.316 --> 00:12:41.626

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.796
Agenda is, also, available on

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.566

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:46.746

love with, just like we did with

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:04.266
its predecessor.

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:07.266
Snowman and Team Alto have done

00:14:07.266 --> 00:14:09.006
an incredible job of taking what

people love from Alto's

colleagues, Adrienne and Jordan,

00:14:17.796 --> 00:14:18.976
to show it to us, now.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:25.956

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.446
Alto's Odyssey is an endless

00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:31.326
sandboarding game, where you

00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:33.656
ride through sunswept dunes,

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:36.046
perform midair stunts, all while

00:14:36.046 --> 00:14:37.966
completing fun challenges and

00:14:37.966 --> 00:14:39.246
unlocking new characters.

00:14:39.856 --> 00:14:40.966
So, my colleague Adrienne will

00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:41.946
be joining us for the demo,

00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:42.316
today.

00:14:42.386 --> 00:14:43.416
So, let's get started.

00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:46.806
The first thing that we loved

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:48.646
about Alto's Odyssey was that it

00:14:48.696 --> 00:14:49.756
provides the user with

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:52.436
contextual clues and elegantly

00:14:52.596 --> 00:14:54.516
pauses the game, so the player

00:14:54.616 --> 00:14:56.436
learns by playing.

00:14:56.436 --> 00:14:57.576
So, here she's getting taught

00:14:57.686 --> 00:14:58.976
how to perform a wall ride,

00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.016
which is a new feature in the

00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:00.106
game.

00:15:01.336 --> 00:15:02.716
There are no carousels that

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:03.966
she's swiping through.

00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.996
It's just her and the game.

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:08.536
We, also, love that it maintains

00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:10.406
that same simple control scheme

00:15:10.406 --> 00:15:12.316
for Alto's Adventure but ramps

00:15:12.316 --> 00:15:13.666
up the difficulty with new

00:15:13.756 --> 00:15:14.216
challenges.

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:16.816
Control-wise, all Adrienne is

00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:18.776
doing is tapping to jump, and

00:15:18.776 --> 00:15:20.046
then tapping and holding to

00:15:20.096 --> 00:15:22.116
perform some epic flips.

00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:25.416
Now, Alto's Odyssey is a real

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:26.956
feast for the senses.

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:29.476
Visually, there's so much to

00:15:29.516 --> 00:15:30.476
look at in this game.

00:15:31.156 --> 00:15:32.116
There is elements in the

00:15:32.236 --> 00:15:33.256
foreground, in the background

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.676
like hot air balloons, sand

00:15:35.676 --> 00:15:36.546
coming off the back of the

00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:36.976
board.

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:39.706
But each level has such a

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:41.336
striking color palette to it

00:15:41.336 --> 00:15:42.866
that we fell in love with.

00:15:43.536 --> 00:15:45.236
That same attention to detail,

00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.086
also, carries over into the

00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:09.316
We, also, fell in love with how

00:16:09.316 --> 00:16:11.166
it uses the haptic engine on our

00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.356
devices.

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.076
So, Adrienne is getting a slight

vibration on the iPhone when

00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:17.696
she's, when she's landing a

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:20.316
jump, performing a wall ride, or

00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:21.826
even, bouncing off of hot air

00:16:21.826 --> 00:16:23.356

00:16:23.756 --> 00:16:25.696

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:18.076
localizing your app so that it's

00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:19.356

choice is really important.

00:18:22.246 --> 00:18:24.076
What sets this app apart is its

00:18:24.076 --> 00:18:27.336
support for 38 languages and its

00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:30.266
simple UI that enables everyday

only on iOS and was completely

00:18:43.686 --> 00:18:44.886
developed using Swift.

00:18:50.856 --> 00:18:51.246
to use.

00:18:51.636 --> 00:18:53.176
All you need to do is swipe up

00:18:53.176 --> 00:18:55.706
and then, pick two out of the 38

00:18:55.706 --> 00:18:56.686

Chinese Mandarin.

00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:17.196
Now, as you can see, the whole

00:19:17.196 --> 00:19:18.406
screen of the app turns into a

00:19:18.406 --> 00:19:19.296
tappable area.

00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:21.986
But the developer went one step

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:24.586
further by implementing 3D touch

00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:25.836
and haptic feedback.

00:19:26.096 --> 00:19:27.656

00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:28.446
Playdead's crafted this

00:24:28.536 --> 00:24:30.086
distinctly surreal environment

00:24:30.446 --> 00:24:31.846
and console quality graphics.

00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:34.256
They actually fully support HDR

00:24:34.256 --> 00:24:35.826
on both the iPhone 10 and the

00:24:35.826 --> 00:24:36.766
iPad.

00:24:37.546 --> 00:24:38.776
So, that makes dark scenes like

00:24:38.836 --> 00:24:40.386
this seem really crisp and

00:24:40.386 --> 00:24:40.766
clear.

00:24:41.076 --> 00:24:43.656
Now, light plays an important

00:24:43.656 --> 00:24:45.406
role on INSIDE, and roving

00:24:45.406 --> 00:24:46.316
spotlights are, often, your

00:24:46.316 --> 00:24:46.696
enemies.

00:24:47.426 --> 00:24:49.066
But, in this case, Adrienne has

00:24:49.186 --> 00:24:50.516
to, actually, turn the lights on

00:24:50.566 --> 00:24:52.356
in order to power that elevator

00:24:52.356 --> 00:24:53.000
at the end of the hallway.

00:24:57.066 --> 00:24:58.616
The shadows cast by the

00:24:58.616 --> 00:25:00.366
spotlights provide some respite,

00:25:00.506 --> 00:25:04.766
but you're never safe for long.

00:25:05.526 --> 00:25:06.686
iCloud, actually, allows you to

00:25:06.746 --> 00:25:07.766
save your progress across

00:25:07.836 --> 00:25:09.506

00:25:09.546 --> 00:25:10.396
where you left off, whether

00:25:10.396 --> 00:25:11.516
you're playing on the iPad,

00:25:13.876 --> 00:25:14.766
Now, I don't want to spoil too

00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:15.856
much of the game for you, but

00:25:15.856 --> 00:25:16.956
there's one more scene I want to

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:17.226
show.

00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:19.286
And fair warning; it's a little

00:25:19.286 --> 00:25:19.536

and brilliant adventure game and

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:09.866
a worthy winner of an Apple

00:26:36.186 --> 00:26:36.796
that.

So, Florence is a beautiful

00:27:11.686 --> 00:27:14.116
cinematic story in which you get

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:15.606
to experience the impact of

00:27:15.696 --> 00:27:18.136

00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:29.746
I really enjoy playing Florence,

00:27:30.306 --> 00:27:32.436
because it is just so compelling

00:27:32.696 --> 00:27:33.326
and approachable.

00:27:33.876 --> 00:27:35.046
And it's really personal,

00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:37.056
because you hold the story of

00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:38.886
Florence in your hand and use

00:27:38.976 --> 00:27:40.306
really familiar controls to

00:27:40.306 --> 00:27:40.636

Through beautiful illustrations,

00:27:47.216 --> 00:27:49.466
In this scene it's all about

00:27:49.466 --> 00:27:50.026
adult life.

00:27:50.266 --> 00:27:52.406
And this game helps you realize

00:27:52.526 --> 00:27:54.136
that we're all just trying to

00:27:54.136 --> 00:27:55.446
get through our day, to get back

00:27:55.546 --> 00:27:56.666
to the things that we really

care about.

well; getting calls from Mom.

00:28:03.226 --> 00:28:04.576
And this part of the game was

00:28:04.576 --> 00:28:05.766
just too real for me.

00:28:05.766 --> 00:28:07.556
It's like, ''Hi, Mom.

00:28:08.046 --> 00:28:09.376

00:28:15.656 --> 00:28:17.646
doing a great job demoing today,

00:28:17.966 --> 00:28:19.036
we're going to take a look at

00:28:21.716 --> 00:28:24.026
Florence has a custom composed

00:28:24.366 --> 00:28:26.986
soundtrack and it's incredible.

00:28:27.546 --> 00:28:29.636
Music plays a huge part

00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:30.436
throughout the entire

00:28:30.436 --> 00:28:31.686
experience.

00:28:31.686 --> 00:28:34.466
And this is when you hear music

00:28:34.466 --> 00:28:35.996
and you decide to tap the notes

00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:37.246
to follow it.

00:28:37.476 --> 00:28:39.656
And you know how music can make

00:28:39.726 --> 00:28:42.176
you feel, how it can just lift

00:28:42.176 --> 00:28:42.846
you up.

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:45.396
Well, it also can lead to a

00:28:45.516 --> 00:28:46.526
really great story.

00:28:47.036 --> 00:28:48.796

00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:55.616
And the camera holds on moments

00:28:55.616 --> 00:28:57.196
that mean just a little bit

00:28:57.336 --> 00:28:57.506
more.

00:28:57.766 --> 00:28:59.966
And this well-designed subtlety,

00:29:00.696 --> 00:29:02.406
well, it makes you want to be

00:29:02.406 --> 00:29:03.756
more present in your own life

00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:06.056
and in your own relationships.

00:29:09.136 --> 00:29:10.446
this other character?

00:29:10.446 --> 00:29:11.716
Well, you're just going to have

00:29:12.156 --> 00:29:13.526
to play the game to find out.

00:29:14.956 --> 00:29:16.846
There's a reason why people have

00:29:16.846 --> 00:29:17.716
a first love story.

00:29:18.336 --> 00:29:19.716

emotional, and it has an impact.

00:29:22.056 --> 00:29:23.836
And if you haven't experienced

00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:25.906
it yet, well, this game is a

And if that single hand happens

00:31:33.836 --> 00:31:34.946
to be your left hand the

00:31:34.946 --> 00:31:36.426

00:31:47.346 --> 00:31:48.536
Calzy, also, of course, supports

00:31:48.536 --> 00:31:50.326
the scientific layout, no

00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:51.356

00:31:51.356 --> 00:31:53.306
Now, I'm not really a math

00:31:53.366 --> 00:31:54.746
person, so these are all just

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:55.596
kind of Greek to me.

00:31:56.366 --> 00:31:58.326
But speaking of science, I was

00:31:58.326 --> 00:31:59.416
recently reading an article.

00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:01.306
At least, John smiled at that.

00:32:01.416 --> 00:32:02.246
I was recently reading an

00:32:02.246 --> 00:32:04.196
article about a very ambitious

00:32:04.196 --> 00:32:06.056
effort to quantify the weight of

00:32:06.056 --> 00:32:07.366
all the biomass on earth.

00:32:07.536 --> 00:32:08.776
And so, I went to the study and

00:32:08.776 --> 00:32:09.886
I grabbed some of the numbers

00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:11.326
and I put them here in Calzy's

00:32:11.476 --> 00:32:13.026
Bookmarks function, which is a

00:32:13.026 --> 00:32:13.996
really handy way to store

00:32:13.996 --> 00:32:14.596
information.

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.506
Here, we can see this is the sum

00:32:16.506 --> 00:32:18.546
of the biomass of all the taxa

00:32:18.546 --> 00:32:19.166
on the earth.

00:32:19.466 --> 00:32:21.376
And it's rendered in gigatons of

00:32:21.376 --> 00:32:22.866
carbon, of course.

00:32:23.416 --> 00:32:25.236
Anyway, the Bookmark stores both

00:32:25.236 --> 00:32:27.166
the expression and the value.

00:32:27.166 --> 00:32:28.326
So, if we find a new form of

00:32:28.326 --> 00:32:29.506
life I can always update the

00:32:29.506 --> 00:32:30.106
expression.

00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:32.226
And then, the values themselves

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:33.616
can, actually, be stored up here

00:32:33.616 --> 00:32:35.206
in the memory area at the top of

00:32:35.206 --> 00:32:36.856
the screen, waiting patiently

00:32:36.856 --> 00:32:37.986
for me to drag them into another

00:32:37.986 --> 00:32:38.666
calculation.

00:32:39.756 --> 00:32:41.236
So, you're probably wondering,

00:32:41.236 --> 00:32:42.796
or at least I know in am, what's

00:32:42.796 --> 00:32:44.326
the prevalence of bacteria

00:32:44.326 --> 00:32:45.646
versus people on the earth.

00:32:45.866 --> 00:32:47.266
So, we go back in here to the

00:32:47.266 --> 00:32:47.876
Bookmark.

00:32:47.876 --> 00:32:48.936
I know you were wondering it.

00:32:49.286 --> 00:32:50.296
And you take a look, here, the

00:32:50.296 --> 00:32:52.036
weight of all bacteria on earth

00:32:52.386 --> 00:32:54.436
is 70 gigatons.

00:32:54.436 --> 00:32:55.256
I'm going to put that in there.

00:32:55.376 --> 00:32:56.486
And then, we're going to divide

00:32:56.486 --> 00:32:57.986
that by the weight of all the

00:32:58.036 --> 00:32:59.566
people on the earth, which is a

00:32:59.566 --> 00:33:02.266
paltry .06 gigatons.

00:33:02.906 --> 00:33:04.096
Now, if you notice that you've

00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:05.426
made a mistake, all you have to

00:33:05.426 --> 00:33:07.776
do is go into the expression, 3D

00:33:07.776 --> 00:33:09.356
Touch on the operator, put the

00:33:09.356 --> 00:33:10.146
correct one in.

00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:12.016
And this way, you can see that

00:33:12.016 --> 00:33:13.386
the weight of tall bacteria is

00:33:13.386 --> 00:33:15.276
about 1,200 times greater than

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:16.376
the weight of all people.

00:33:16.376 --> 00:33:17.736
That's a lot of bacteria.

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:18.786
So, wash your hands before

00:33:18.786 --> 00:33:19.716
dinner tonight, folks.

00:33:20.736 --> 00:33:22.556
There's a lot more great things

00:33:22.556 --> 00:33:23.586
Calzy can do that we don't have

00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:24.486
a whole lot of time for.

00:33:24.486 --> 00:33:25.676
But it's got support for things

00:33:25.676 --> 00:33:27.886
like Handoff and iCloud Sync,

00:33:27.886 --> 00:33:30.166
even Face ID, Touch ID

00:33:30.236 --> 00:33:32.236
protection for the bookmarks,

00:33:32.236 --> 00:33:32.806
Drag and Drop.

00:33:32.806 --> 00:33:33.796
Whole bunch of great things.

00:33:33.846 --> 00:33:34.756
Go ahead and check it out in the

00:33:34.756 --> 00:33:35.326
App Store.

00:33:35.326 --> 00:33:37.086
But before we go, a quick note

00:33:37.286 --> 00:33:38.806
about the inspirational story of

00:33:38.806 --> 00:33:39.906
the developer behind it.

00:33:40.696 --> 00:33:42.036
Gentleman from a small village

00:33:42.036 --> 00:33:43.616
in India working as a visual

00:33:43.616 --> 00:33:45.086
effects artist who decided he

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:46.706
wanted to harness his creativity

00:33:46.706 --> 00:33:47.606
in a different way.

00:33:47.866 --> 00:33:49.716
So, he taught himself Swift, as

00:33:49.716 --> 00:33:50.096
you do.

00:33:50.366 --> 00:33:51.716
And within just a few months,

00:33:51.836 --> 00:33:53.336
was creating great iPhone apps,

00:33:53.506 --> 00:33:54.606
including Calzy.

00:33:55.056 --> 00:33:56.076
Congratulations, Raja.

00:33:56.156 --> 00:33:56.396
>> All right.

00:33:57.516 --> 00:34:03.500
[ Applause ]

00:34:04.916 --> 00:34:05.206
>> All right.

00:34:06.746 --> 00:34:08.866
Great games are memorable.

00:34:10.366 --> 00:34:11.216
They're unique.

00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:13.206
They're artistic.

00:34:14.246 --> 00:34:15.835
They're filled with personality.

00:34:16.636 --> 00:34:18.275
And they have great performance.

00:34:19.496 --> 00:34:21.076
Our next winner has all those

00:34:21.076 --> 00:34:21.775
characteristics.

00:34:22.835 --> 00:34:25.446
Join me in congratulating Frost

00:34:25.806 --> 00:34:26.755
by Kunabi Brothers.

00:34:27.516 --> 00:34:45.500
[ Music ]

00:34:46.826 --> 00:34:47.815
>> Let's go right here.

00:34:48.516 --> 00:34:53.500
[ Music ]

00:34:55.045 --> 00:34:56.126
>> This is, actually, Kunabi

00:34:56.126 --> 00:34:58.086
Brothers' second time on stage,

00:34:58.486 --> 00:35:00.046
because another game of theirs,

00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:02.566
called Blek, won an Apple Design

00:35:02.566 --> 00:35:03.916
Award in 2014.

00:35:04.826 --> 00:35:06.366
They've now returned with a

00:35:06.366 --> 00:35:09.416
beautiful and calming freeform

00:35:09.416 --> 00:35:11.896
puzzle game that offers a deeply

00:35:11.896 --> 00:35:13.546
immersive space where players

00:35:13.546 --> 00:35:15.656
can interact with and experience

00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:16.986
the natural phenomenon of

00:35:16.986 --> 00:35:17.736
swarms.

00:35:18.846 --> 00:35:19.996
You've got to see this.

00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:21.726
Mike Stern.

00:35:21.766 --> 00:35:22.306
>> Thanks, John.

00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:24.436
So, swarming behavior has

00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:26.336
inspired scientists and artists

00:35:26.336 --> 00:35:27.106
through the ages.

00:35:27.576 --> 00:35:29.276
And now, it's inspired a really

00:35:29.276 --> 00:35:31.256
gorgeous and inventive game.

00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:33.136
Right from the level selection

00:35:33.136 --> 00:35:34.246
screen we can see this number

00:35:34.246 --> 00:35:36.296
one is comprised of tiny little

00:35:36.296 --> 00:35:37.496
light creatures swarming about.

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.716
And as we switch between levels

00:35:39.716 --> 00:35:41.016
we can see them scatter and

00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:43.206
reform giving us a preview of

00:35:43.206 --> 00:35:44.636
what's to come.

00:35:44.636 --> 00:35:46.196
Now, when we get into the game

00:35:46.196 --> 00:35:47.656
we see this stream of blue

00:35:47.656 --> 00:35:49.136
creatures enter the gameboard.

00:35:49.136 --> 00:35:50.756
And our objective, here, is to

00:35:50.756 --> 00:35:52.456
help these little guys find

00:35:52.456 --> 00:35:53.636
their way back to their home

00:35:53.636 --> 00:35:54.096
planets.

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:56.426
Now, Frost was designed for

00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:58.226
Touch and it really shows.

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.926
Interactions are so simple and

00:36:00.926 --> 00:36:02.826
intuitive and natural.

00:36:03.406 --> 00:36:06.076
And just behold how graceful and

00:36:06.156 --> 00:36:08.056
beautiful the swarm is, just

00:36:08.056 --> 00:36:08.996
with a little bit of

00:36:08.996 --> 00:36:10.076
interaction.

00:36:10.076 --> 00:36:11.606
It's really pretty.

00:36:12.536 --> 00:36:13.896
Now, it seems here that the

00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:16.476
objective it to try to take some

00:36:16.476 --> 00:36:17.636
of the blue creatures to one

00:36:17.636 --> 00:36:19.136
planet and some to the other.

00:36:19.136 --> 00:36:21.666
So, to start over I simply tap

00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:22.906
anywhere on the screen.

00:36:23.766 --> 00:36:25.676
And using multitouch I can draw

00:36:25.676 --> 00:36:27.526
two paths to each planet.

00:36:28.796 --> 00:36:29.846
Now, when those yellow rings

00:36:29.966 --> 00:36:31.796
fill, that's when I know how

00:36:31.796 --> 00:36:33.286
many creatures each planet has

00:36:33.516 --> 00:36:34.036
to hold.

00:36:34.646 --> 00:36:35.386
Little bit more.

00:36:36.776 --> 00:36:37.956
And once it fills all the way,

00:36:38.276 --> 00:36:39.776
this really beautiful animation

00:36:39.936 --> 00:36:41.126
plays to let me know that the

00:36:41.126 --> 00:36:42.246
level is complete.

00:36:42.246 --> 00:36:43.756
And on iPhone, they use haptics

00:36:43.926 --> 00:36:46.306
to punctuate that animation and

00:36:46.306 --> 00:36:47.566
other special moments.

00:36:47.626 --> 00:36:50.276
Now, every level in Frost is a

00:36:50.276 --> 00:36:51.626
work of art.

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.646
But I want to skip ahead here to

00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:55.386
a more advanced level and go

00:36:55.386 --> 00:36:58.476
from number 4 to number 24.

00:36:58.476 --> 00:37:00.876
Now, as we progress through the

00:37:00.876 --> 00:37:03.006
game we're introduced to new

00:37:03.006 --> 00:37:04.566
creative challenges along the

00:37:04.566 --> 00:37:05.296
way.

00:37:05.296 --> 00:37:07.656
But also, new species with

00:37:07.656 --> 00:37:08.896
different types of swarming

00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:09.476
behaviors.

00:37:09.516 --> 00:37:11.656
So, on this level we have yellow

00:37:11.656 --> 00:37:13.736
creatures and blue and red.

00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:15.156
And it seems, here, that my

00:37:15.156 --> 00:37:16.426
objective is to help the yellow

00:37:16.426 --> 00:37:17.446
creatures get to the yellow

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:17.886
planet.

00:37:18.346 --> 00:37:19.516
So, I just make a beeline from

00:37:19.516 --> 00:37:20.416
one place to another, but

00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:21.776
they're not responding.

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:23.316
Blue ones don't really do

00:37:23.316 --> 00:37:24.256
anything, either.

00:37:24.506 --> 00:37:26.646
Maybe, if I bring the red ones

00:37:26.646 --> 00:37:28.676
over here it'll do something.

00:37:28.676 --> 00:37:29.786
Oh, we can see those blue

00:37:29.786 --> 00:37:31.096
creatures really scattered.

00:37:31.466 --> 00:37:32.956
Now, what I want to do is just

00:37:33.086 --> 00:37:34.466
pause here, for a second, and

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:37.196
just kind of enjoy this moment

00:37:37.196 --> 00:37:38.506
that Frost creates for us.

00:37:39.086 --> 00:37:40.766
The mood that it sets is so

00:37:41.086 --> 00:37:42.906
ethereal, it's so soothing and

00:37:42.906 --> 00:37:43.646
so tranquil.

00:37:44.106 --> 00:37:45.246
Watching these creatures move

00:37:45.246 --> 00:37:47.166
around is really mesmerizing and

00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:48.116
kind of hypnotic.

00:37:48.846 --> 00:37:50.076
A lot of players will, actually,

00:37:50.116 --> 00:37:53.436
just kind of stop and enjoy this

00:37:53.476 --> 00:37:55.206
experience and experiment and

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:56.356
observe how the creatures

00:37:56.356 --> 00:37:58.426
respond to touch, and really

00:37:58.526 --> 00:37:59.056
soak it in.

00:38:00.616 --> 00:38:01.846
But, not me.

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:02.486
I like winning.

00:38:02.996 --> 00:38:04.896
So, I'm going to try to get the

00:38:04.946 --> 00:38:07.276
red creatures to move around,

00:38:07.346 --> 00:38:08.586
pick up the blue creatures who

00:38:09.056 --> 00:38:10.306
might give a lift to the yellow

00:38:10.306 --> 00:38:10.786
creatures.

00:38:11.056 --> 00:38:12.296
And help them find their way

00:38:12.296 --> 00:38:12.586
home.

00:38:13.246 --> 00:38:14.516
It's a crazy enough plan that I

00:38:14.516 --> 00:38:15.596
think it just might work.

00:38:16.676 --> 00:38:18.536
Now, Frost offers hours and

00:38:18.536 --> 00:38:20.136
hours of gameplay.

00:38:20.896 --> 00:38:22.326
And the sheer beauty of watching

00:38:22.436 --> 00:38:23.896
thousands of individually

00:38:23.896 --> 00:38:25.666
animating creatures move around

00:38:25.666 --> 00:38:28.036
your iPhone or iPad is really

00:38:28.036 --> 00:38:28.756
breathtaking.

00:38:29.726 --> 00:38:32.756
Now, in order to power this real

00:38:32.756 --> 00:38:34.606
time simulation, they needed

00:38:34.606 --> 00:38:35.766
Metal on iOS.

00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:37.686
It's the only consumer mobile

00:38:37.686 --> 00:38:38.846
device which has the

00:38:38.846 --> 00:38:41.406
computational power needed to

00:38:41.456 --> 00:38:42.786
render these complex

00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:44.836
programmatic animations.

00:38:46.046 --> 00:38:47.476
But the thing that I love most

00:38:47.866 --> 00:38:50.526
about Frost is how anyone can

00:38:50.586 --> 00:38:51.916
play this game, regardless of

00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:54.216
their age or where they live or

00:38:54.516 --> 00:38:55.676
what language they speak.

00:38:55.986 --> 00:38:57.856
It can be a delightful, calming,

00:38:57.856 --> 00:38:59.176
and engaging experience.

00:39:00.146 --> 00:39:02.006
This is a really beautiful game.

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:02.826
Congratulations.

00:39:03.516 --> 00:39:09.500
[ Applause ]

00:39:10.046 --> 00:39:10.556
>> Thanks, Mike.

00:39:10.876 --> 00:39:12.236
You had most of us mesmerized,

00:39:12.236 --> 00:39:12.816
there.

00:39:13.316 --> 00:39:14.456
All right.

00:39:14.626 --> 00:39:16.526
Earlier, I spoke of code and

00:39:16.526 --> 00:39:18.416
creativity, which when combined

00:39:18.416 --> 00:39:20.246
with technology can produce

00:39:20.246 --> 00:39:21.536
these transformative results.

00:39:22.356 --> 00:39:23.856
Our next winner is an app that

00:39:23.856 --> 00:39:25.786
is disrupting and uniquely

00:39:25.786 --> 00:39:27.476
changing things, how things are

00:39:27.476 --> 00:39:27.836
done.

00:39:29.056 --> 00:39:30.786
Congratulations to Triton

[ Music ]

00:39:58.436 --> 00:39:59.546
So, the developer here, Gauss,

00:39:59.976 --> 00:40:01.826
is reinventing surgical care

00:40:01.826 --> 00:40:03.276
using machine learning and

00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:04.976
computer vision on iOS.

00:40:05.076 --> 00:40:07.446
And you've got to see this to

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:08.156
believe it.

00:40:08.456 --> 00:40:09.396
So, let's take a look.

00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.186
Here's Chris and Divia from our

00:40:11.186 --> 00:40:13.786
Health Team to show you how it

00:40:14.456 --> 00:40:14.616
works.

00:40:15.486 --> 00:40:17.576
>> We love when teams tackle

00:40:17.726 --> 00:40:19.756
huge problems in unique ways.

00:40:20.176 --> 00:40:21.936
Especially, in healthcare.

00:40:22.616 --> 00:40:24.906
Today, many clinicians have no

00:40:24.906 --> 00:40:26.416
idea how to estimate how much

00:40:26.416 --> 00:40:28.296
blood patients are losing in

00:40:28.296 --> 00:40:28.976
procedures.

00:40:28.976 --> 00:40:31.376
As a result, a lot of clinical

00:40:31.376 --> 00:40:32.846
decisions are made based on

00:40:32.846 --> 00:40:34.886
guesstimation, which can lead to

00:40:34.886 --> 00:40:36.806
all sorts of complications.

00:40:37.446 --> 00:40:39.036
Gauss Surgical is solving this

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.576
problem using an iPad, machine

00:40:41.576 --> 00:40:43.216
learning, and computer vision.

00:40:43.736 --> 00:40:45.256
Before we show you a demo, I'd

00:40:45.256 --> 00:40:46.626
like to introduce you to Chris

00:40:46.626 --> 00:40:47.976
and the tools we'll be using.

00:40:48.666 --> 00:40:51.436
We have an iPad Pro with an IR

00:40:51.436 --> 00:40:53.016
sensor, and some surgical

00:40:53.016 --> 00:40:54.326
sponges that are used in

00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:55.906
operating rooms to soak up

00:40:55.906 --> 00:40:56.626
blood.

00:40:57.176 --> 00:40:58.526
Now, for the purposes of this

00:40:58.526 --> 00:40:59.956
demo, we're going to mimic some

00:40:59.956 --> 00:41:01.926
fake blood by using some red

00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:02.876
food coloring.

00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:04.986
But if you start to feel queasy,

00:41:04.986 --> 00:41:07.066
at all, please avert your eyes

00:41:07.066 --> 00:41:08.156
for just a moment.

00:41:09.256 --> 00:41:11.556
Gauss' app is super simple to

00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:11.916
use.

00:41:12.426 --> 00:41:14.036
All you have to do is hold up a

00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:15.286
sponge in front of the camera.

00:41:16.316 --> 00:41:18.696
From there, Gauss uses Core ML

00:41:18.696 --> 00:41:20.446
to detect the sponge using the

00:41:20.446 --> 00:41:21.836
camera and IR sensor.

00:41:22.466 --> 00:41:23.616
They've then developed some

00:41:23.706 --> 00:41:24.896
custom machine learning

00:41:24.896 --> 00:41:27.166
algorithms to analyze the red

00:41:27.166 --> 00:41:28.806
spots of blood and, actually,

00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:30.086
calculate blood loss.

00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:31.536
It's amazing.

00:41:32.516 --> 00:41:34.386
Gauss' app is FDA approved and

00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:36.026
HIPAA compliant.

00:41:36.596 --> 00:41:38.986
But now, let's see if it's hippo

00:41:38.986 --> 00:41:39.616
compliant.

00:41:39.616 --> 00:41:42.536
As you can imagine.

00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:44.766
As you can imagine, it's

00:41:44.766 --> 00:41:46.156
incredibly important in an

00:41:46.156 --> 00:41:47.946
operating room to make sure you

00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:49.516
don't accidentally double count

00:41:49.516 --> 00:41:50.096
a sponge.

00:41:50.636 --> 00:41:52.376
So, if Chris hold up the hippo

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:54.896
sponge one more time, even if in

00:41:54.896 --> 00:41:57.366
a different orientation, Gauss'

00:41:57.566 --> 00:42:00.156
app is able to detect that it's

00:42:00.156 --> 00:42:01.986
a duplicate and, actually, alert

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:02.146
Chris

00:42:02.146 --> 00:42:03.176
to the duplication.

00:42:04.436 --> 00:42:06.266
That is amazing.

00:42:06.956 --> 00:42:08.226
Gauss' app is being used in

00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:10.086
hospitals all across the country

00:42:10.086 --> 00:42:12.436
in labor and delivery use cases.

00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:14.036
And we couldn't be more excited

00:42:14.036 --> 00:42:14.916
about their work.

00:42:15.306 --> 00:42:16.926

00:42:31.606 --> 00:42:32.936
executed platformer.

00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:35.366
It's got a ton of personality,

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:38.496
has great performance, a fun

00:42:38.576 --> 00:42:40.546
soundtrack, and it's super

00:42:40.546 --> 00:42:40.966
addictive.

00:42:40.966 --> 00:42:43.506
And it took four years to make.

00:42:44.356 --> 00:42:45.626
Join me in celebrating our final

00:42:45.626 --> 00:42:47.616

[ Music ]

00:43:17.156 --> 00:43:18.546
Oddmar was developed by a team,

00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:20.226
a small team of four, two of

00:43:20.226 --> 00:43:22.156
whom are here, at a university

00:43:22.156 --> 00:43:23.906
in Turkey, which goes to show

00:43:23.906 --> 00:43:25.296
that great games don't always

00:43:25.326 --> 00:43:26.306
come from the places that you

00:43:26.306 --> 00:43:26.846
would expect.

00:43:27.906 --> 00:43:29.406
We've had a blast with this game

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.906
and we think you will, too.

00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:32.386

action-adventure platformer that

00:43:44.046 --> 00:43:45.856
is beautiful, charming, and

adventures of Oddmar, from

00:44:16.926 --> 00:44:18.456
magical forests to treacherous

00:44:25.386 --> 00:44:27.106
The game really shines with its

00:44:27.106 --> 00:44:28.626
visual elements, with beautiful

00:44:28.816 --> 00:44:30.616
scenic multiplane landscapes,

00:44:30.756 --> 00:44:32.156
lighting, and animation that

00:44:32.156 --> 00:44:33.346
almost brings it to life.

00:44:34.336 --> 00:44:36.086
Oddmar, our Viking hero, is so

00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:38.156
brilliantly animated that it

00:44:38.156 --> 00:44:39.426
puts a smile on your face,

00:44:49.166 --> 00:44:49.806
every level.

00:44:50.166 --> 00:44:51.286
And as the players progress

and fun ways.

00:44:57.366 --> 00:44:59.386
The game really does a fantastic

00:44:59.536 --> 00:45:01.466
job of bringing excitement with

00:45:01.466 --> 00:45:03.736
every new character, control,

00:45:03.736 --> 00:45:05.666
and level, while introducing

00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:07.186
these at a pace that allows the

00:45:07.266 --> 00:45:08.176
players to master it.

00:45:09.556 --> 00:45:11.656
The soundtrack influenced by the

00:45:11.736 --> 00:45:13.266
traditional Swedish folk music

00:45:15.856 --> 00:45:17.156
really gives the game its Nordic

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.716
Viking setting at every level.

00:45:19.866 --> 00:45:21.926
It was recorded at a studio in a

00:45:21.926 --> 00:45:23.296
small village deep in the

00:45:23.376 --> 00:45:25.000
forests of southern Sweden.

00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:27.876
So, every aspect of the game,

00:45:28.206 --> 00:45:30.516
from level design to story to

00:45:30.516 --> 00:45:32.116
music was made with great

00:45:32.306 --> 00:45:33.566
effort, dedication to detail,

00:45:33.656 --> 00:45:34.536
and craft.

As visually stunning as it is

00:45:37.476 --> 00:45:38.556
with the level of detail and

00:45:38.626 --> 00:45:40.416
artwork, Oddmar calls for a

00:45:40.416 --> 00:45:42.636
larger screenplay and we think

00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:44.046
you will love it on iPad Pro.

00:45:45.136 --> 00:45:46.496
It supports the use of game

00:45:46.496 --> 00:45:48.416
controllers, allows you to play

00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:50.546
and sync on multiple devices by

00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:51.476
saving on iCloud.

00:45:52.746 --> 00:45:54.596
Oddmar benefits from using Metal

00:45:54.856 --> 00:45:56.646

00:46:44.136 --> 00:46:45.166
handed and are walking away

00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:45.826
with, right now.

00:46:47.006 --> 00:46:48.986
This trophy is a solid piece of

00:46:48.986 --> 00:46:51.496
aluminum that lights up when

00:46:51.496 --> 00:46:51.986
touched.

00:46:52.806 --> 00:46:54.926
So, the Apple logo on top lights

00:46:54.926 --> 00:46:56.436
up just like the top of your

00:46:56.436 --> 00:46:57.056
laptop.

00:46:57.476 --> 00:47:01.046
It's very cool and it's a

00:47:01.046 --> 00:47:02.106
must-have.

00:47:02.106 --> 00:47:03.196
It's definitely something to

00:47:03.196 --> 00:47:04.406
collect and something to be

00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:05.546
super proud of.

00:47:05.876 --> 00:47:09.626

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:11.196

00:47:11.196 --> 00:47:12.796
almost one of everything that we

00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:15.686
make in its best configuration.

00:47:16.776 --> 00:47:22.026

00:47:22.196 --> 00:47:27.576

00:47:28.336 --> 00:47:30.646

AirPods.

00:47:42.846 --> 00:47:45.776
Not a bad haul.

00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:51.500
[ Applause ]

00:47:52.206 --> 00:47:53.106
Not a bad haul.

00:47:54.336 --> 00:47:55.786
So, congratulations to all of

00:47:55.786 --> 00:47:56.596
our winners, tonight.

00:47:56.596 --> 00:47:58.596
And for the great work that

00:47:58.596 --> 00:48:00.266
they've done in the past year or

00:48:00.266 --> 00:48:01.556
years, in some cases.

00:48:02.106 --> 00:48:03.976
These ten apps set new standards

00:48:03.976 --> 00:48:06.356
for innovation, design,

00:48:07.116 --> 00:48:09.396
brilliance, execution,

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:12.186
performance, creativity,

00:48:12.416 --> 00:48:15.006
craftsmanship, optimization,

00:48:15.386 --> 00:48:17.366
technology integration, and so

00:48:17.366 --> 00:48:17.876
much more.

00:48:20.256 --> 00:48:21.726
I want to thank you for joining

00:48:21.726 --> 00:48:22.216

00:48:22.216 --> 00:48:23.686
It's been a long day, but we

00:48:23.686 --> 00:48:25.086
appreciate your attendance.

00:48:25.606 --> 00:48:28.046
This is a special moment for all

00:48:28.046 --> 00:48:28.586
of our winners.

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:30.466
But it's, also, a special moment

00:48:30.506 --> 00:48:32.696
for you, their peers, and for

00:48:32.696 --> 00:48:33.876
our entire development

00:48:33.876 --> 00:48:35.266
community, many of whom are

00:48:35.266 --> 00:48:36.426
watching right now on the live

00:48:36.466 --> 00:48:36.856

next year inspired by these

00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:45.706
winners.

Check out their apps.

00:48:48.046 --> 00:48:48.976
Learn from them.

They've done an incredible job.

00:48:50.846 --> 00:48:52.376
As well as being inspired by all

00:48:52.376 --> 00:48:53.146
