[ Applause ]

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:29.866
>> Hi everyone.

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:31.916
Welcome to the Introduction to

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:32.986
Dark Mode session.

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:34.616
My name is Raymond Sepulveda,

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:36.866
and I'm a macOS designer on the

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.136
Human Interface Design team.

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:40.176
For the first half of today's

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:41.436
session, I'm going to be going

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:42.256
over some of the design

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:43.826
principles that went into the

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:45.756
design of Dark Mode, as well as

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:46.746
some of the design

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:47.686
considerations that you should

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:49.336
take into account when updating

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:50.546
your own applications to take

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:51.606
advantage of Dark Mode.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:53.576
Then, for the second half of the

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:55.316
session, my engineering

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:57.106
colleagues Rachel Goldeen and

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:58.266
Taylor Kelly from the Cocoa

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.756
Frameworks team are going to be

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:01.836
going over how to adopt and

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:03.506
support Dark Mode using an

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:04.866
example application that they

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:05.426
built together.

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:07.016
The three of us are super

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:08.016
excited to share all of these

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.246
details with all of you, so

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:10.086
let's jump right in.

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:13.086
As we announced in yesterday's

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:15.316
keynote, macOS 10.14 is going to

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:16.896
be getting a new interface

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:19.186
appearance, and we call it Dark

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:19.416
Mode.

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:22.146
The new design is very

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.466
attractive and engaging, while

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.036
at the same time being very calm

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:26.806
and understated.

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.566
These are great qualities for an

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.626
interface, and they make it

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.266
great for creative professionals

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:33.076
who are dealing with heavily

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:34.906
detailed images and colorful

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.516
assets such as images and video

00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:37.896
assets.

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:40.966
But, in actuality, it's actually

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.536
great for just about any type of

00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:44.526
user who is looking to

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:46.326
concentrate or focus on any

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:47.376
given task at hand.

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:48.936
So, whether you're trying to

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:50.396
concentrate on writing the next

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:52.856
great novel or you're trying to

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.146
read one without disturbing your

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.136
bedside partner, Dark Mode is

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:57.486
really great for either type of

00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:58.156
situation.

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:05.686
The interface shares a lot of

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:07.166
family resemblances between the

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.496
light appearance and the dark

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:09.846
appearance, and that is because

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.246
we wanted to encourage users to

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:13.066
switch between both appearances

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:16.116
easily and find the one that

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:17.386
really best suits their needs.

00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:18.896
And so it was very important

00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:19.876
that things like control

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:22.216
metrics, window layout, and the

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:24.186
distribution of translucent

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.826
materials be the same as much as

00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:26.746
possible between both

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:27.436
appearances.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:30.056
As such it's also equally

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:31.166
important that all of your

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.446
applications take full advantage

00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:35.316
of both appearances so that they

00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:37.156
update correctly between both

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.996
appearances no matter what the

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:40.716
system is running under.

00:02:40.716 --> 00:02:41.796
You really don't want to be that

00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:42.956
one light appearance that's

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:46.066
stuck in dark appearance.

00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:47.656
All in all, we're super happy

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:49.226
with how the design turned out,

00:02:49.226 --> 00:02:51.196
and we are really anxious to see

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:53.286
what you guys are going to turn

00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:54.576
your apps into as soon as you

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:55.796
get hands on the developer beta

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:56.896
and start adopting the Dark

00:02:56.896 --> 00:02:57.136
Mode.

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.386
Aside from Dark Mode, another

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:02.866
new interface feature that we

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.966
added into macOS 10.14 are

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:05.866
accent colors.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:08.036
Previous releases of macOS

00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:10.376
offered two accent colors, blue

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.196
and graphite, but for macOS

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:13.876
10.14, we've expanded the color

00:03:13.876 --> 00:03:15.266
palette to include eight fun

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:16.556
colors to really help you

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:18.756
personalize your Mac.

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:20.926
So, if you're like me and you

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:22.556
love the color red, you're going

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:23.696
to immediately switch over to

00:03:23.696 --> 00:03:25.596
the color red [laughs].

00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:30.016
If orange or yellow are more of

00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:31.456
your preference, you're going to

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:32.286
switch over to those, and we

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:34.316
make those available as well.

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:38.256
I should note that the accent

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:39.336
colors are not just a

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.376
sub-feature of Dark Mode, but

00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:42.626
they're also available in Light

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:42.896
Mode.

00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:44.986
So if you prefer Light Mode but

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:46.626
want green accent color, you can

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:47.316
do that as well.

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:50.316
So, now that we've covered a

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:51.856
little bit of the basics of what

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:53.896
Dark Mode is and what accent

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:55.616
colors are also, let's dive a

00:03:55.616 --> 00:03:56.696
little bit deeper into some of

00:03:56.696 --> 00:03:58.006
the design principles that went

00:03:58.006 --> 00:03:58.806
into Dark Mode.

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.686
At Apple, when we begin a new

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:02.916
design project, we like to

00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:04.326
establish a set of design

00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:05.456
principles to help guide us

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:06.476
throughout the entire design

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:06.996
process.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:09.506
And, with Dark Mode, there were

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:11.426
three in particular that we

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:12.786
referred to quite often

00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:14.606
throughout the entire process.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:16.505
The first one is the most

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:17.625
straightforward, so let's just

00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:19.696
jump right into that one, and

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:20.976
that is that dark interfaces are

00:04:20.976 --> 00:04:23.716
cool, period, right?

00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:25.386
They are almost effortlessly

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:26.736
cool in a way that light

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:28.116
interfaces sometimes kind of

00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:28.976
struggle to be.

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:31.006
But why is that, really?

00:04:31.386 --> 00:04:32.926
Part of it is because we all

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:34.206
have these notions of what a

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:35.706
dark interface is and what a

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:36.876
dark interface looks like.

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:38.646
And a lot of that is fed into us

00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:39.876
by what we've seen in pop

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:41.286
cultures in things such as

00:04:41.776 --> 00:04:43.626
sci-fi movies and action movies.

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:45.456
So much so that if I were to go

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:46.476
around the audience and ask

00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:47.716
everyone to give me one-word

00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:49.476
association of what a dark

00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:51.236
interface is to them, I'd get

00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:52.516
responses such as cool, of

00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:55.596
course; slick; professional;

00:04:56.056 --> 00:04:58.276
futuristic; and even beautiful.

00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:01.786
So going into the design for

00:05:01.786 --> 00:05:03.406
Dark Mode, we really wanted to

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:04.346
acknowledge all of these

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.246
aesthetic associations that we

00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:08.306
all have with dark interfaces,

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.986
while at the same time embracing

00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:12.536
a lot of the real benefits that

00:05:12.536 --> 00:05:14.496
a dark design offers you, such

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:16.256
as a higher contrast for

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:18.136
typography.

00:05:18.136 --> 00:05:20.426
We realize that Dark Mode is

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.176
really, really cool, and that a

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:23.216
lot of you are going to want to

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:24.656
adopt Dark Mode on your apps

00:05:24.776 --> 00:05:25.436
permanently.

00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:27.666
But, in actuality, only a small

00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:29.016
subset of apps really should be

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:31.666
dark all the time, and those are

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.646
things that are media-centric or

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:34.856
content-creation apps.

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:35.886
Those are the ones that are best

00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:37.246
suited to staying dark all the

00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:38.766
time, so if your app doesn't

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:39.516
fall into one of those

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:41.366
categories, it's better to let

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:42.686
your app follow what the system

00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:43.876
appearance is, rather than to

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.046
make it dark permanently.

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:49.606
The second principle was that

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.576
dark interfaces are not just

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:52.146
inverted.

00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:53.886
And, really, what's at the core

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:56.356
here is that when you look at a

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.946
dark interface, it can sometimes

00:05:57.996 --> 00:06:00.416
be easy to think of just taking

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:01.486
the light interface and

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.826
inverting it to end up with your

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:03.666
final result.

00:06:04.186 --> 00:06:05.946
But, in actuality, that can be

00:06:05.946 --> 00:06:07.986
very creatively limiting, and so

00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:09.526
it's better to take a look at

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:10.276
your elements and your

00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:12.186
application on a case-by-case

00:06:12.716 --> 00:06:16.006
basis and try to determine what

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:18.316
is the visual cue that they're

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.826
trying to communicate and then

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:21.926
figure out whether an opposite

00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:23.406
visual cue is necessary.

00:06:24.286 --> 00:06:25.136
So, if you take something, for

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:27.376
example, like, a standard Light

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:28.706
push button in the light

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:30.376
appearance, the buttons look

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:31.756
like this in their active state.

00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:33.656
And, then, when you click on

00:06:33.656 --> 00:06:35.026
them, the buttons darken.

00:06:35.236 --> 00:06:37.046
And this is generally true of

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:38.546
almost all of the controls in

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:39.636
the light appearance in that

00:06:39.686 --> 00:06:41.336
their click state is a darker

00:06:41.336 --> 00:06:42.486
version of what their active

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:43.056
state was.

00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:45.716
In Dark Mode, however, the

00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:47.096
general active state looks like

00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:48.996
this, and when you click on

00:06:48.996 --> 00:06:50.486
them, they brighten, and that,

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.096
again, is generally true of all

00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:52.866
of the controls.

00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:54.546
They will all generally brighten

00:06:56.496 --> 00:06:56.746
up.

00:06:56.746 --> 00:06:59.446
Another example are group boxes.

00:07:00.066 --> 00:07:01.126
In light appearance, the group

00:07:01.126 --> 00:07:02.966
boxes have a dark fill behind

00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:05.756
them and are shaded such along

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:07.586
the edges to give them a

00:07:07.586 --> 00:07:09.216
recessed quality such that they

00:07:09.216 --> 00:07:10.346
look like they're carved into

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:11.286
the window background that

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:12.436
they're inside of.

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:16.166
In Dark Mode, however, the group

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.586
boxes are treated almost as if

00:07:17.586 --> 00:07:19.176
they are self-illuminated.

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:22.156
But, at the end of the day, the

00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:23.856
general purpose of the group box

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:24.916
is the same between the two

00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:27.016
modes in that what they're

00:07:27.016 --> 00:07:28.066
really trying to communicate to

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:29.526
the user is that the contents

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:31.406
contained therein are all

00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:32.316
related somehow.

00:07:34.026 --> 00:07:35.956
Why I said that it was important

00:07:36.026 --> 00:07:38.166
to go on a case-by-case basis

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.976
and try and determine what the

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:43.176
visual cue that your elements

00:07:43.486 --> 00:07:45.266
are trying to communicate-- It's

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:46.916
important, is because, in some

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:48.306
cases, the visual cue that's

00:07:48.376 --> 00:07:50.206
being communicated is already

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:51.506
effective enough in the Light

00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:53.376
Mode and should be left as is in

00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:53.916
Dark Mode.

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:56.086
An example of this are the

00:07:56.086 --> 00:07:56.906
window shadows.

00:07:57.786 --> 00:08:00.596
As we all know, macOS is a

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:02.786
layered window environment, and

00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:03.946
the window shadows really help

00:08:03.946 --> 00:08:04.946
to communicate the sense of

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:06.236
depth, the Z-depth of the

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:06.766
windows.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:08.686
So, if we were to have inverted

00:08:08.686 --> 00:08:10.056
the window shadows, for example,

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:11.406
and started using a white

00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:13.246
shadow, for example, the entire

00:08:13.246 --> 00:08:14.606
UI would have become flat.

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:15.796
You would have lost that sense

00:08:17.756 --> 00:08:19.186
of depth.

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:20.256
Another thing to note is that

00:08:20.256 --> 00:08:21.836
the window shadows in macOS are

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:23.206
constructed of two layers.

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:24.666
We've got the diffused shadow

00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:25.546
and the rim shadow.

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:27.536
So, if we look at this little

00:08:27.536 --> 00:08:30.626
portion of the screen and look

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:31.256
at how the shadows were

00:08:31.256 --> 00:08:33.126
constructed and treated in Dark

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:35.166
Mode, the first thing to note is

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:36.775
that, in taking into

00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:38.895
consideration that users are

00:08:39.196 --> 00:08:40.775
going to be able to go back and

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:42.086
forth between light and dark

00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.536
appearance quite often and that

00:08:44.606 --> 00:08:45.916
some apps are going to stay dark

00:08:46.246 --> 00:08:47.766
all the time, it was important

00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:48.996
for us to keep the diffused

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.896
shadow exactly the same.

00:08:51.546 --> 00:08:53.706
So, we used the exact same

00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:55.406
shadow blur parameters for the

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:56.796
shadows in Dark Mode.

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.536
Next, we took a look at the rim

00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:02.426
shadows and saw what changes we

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:04.066
needed to do for those, and the

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:05.176
changes that we did for Dark

00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:06.696
Mode where we adjusted the

00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:07.826
opacity to make them a little

00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:09.816
bit higher so that the contrast

00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:12.086
edge was more defined and that

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:13.236
we made them a little bit

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:13.676
crisper.

00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:18.866
To further the focus and the

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:20.886
edge detail on the windows, we

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:24.026
added an inner rim stroke to the

00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:26.476
windows to really help define

00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:28.646
the windows and pop them off.

00:09:29.186 --> 00:09:30.306
The end result is that the

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:32.606
visual cue still looks very

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.406
similar to the light appearance,

00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:37.366
but the end result has been

00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:39.196
finely tuned for dark appearance

00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:40.906
so that it works much better.

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:47.926
The second principle was that

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:49.276
Dark Mode is content focused,

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.166
and this was the one that we

00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:51.676
referred back to the most often

00:09:51.676 --> 00:09:52.826
throughout the entire process,

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:53.246
actually.

00:09:54.246 --> 00:09:56.896
When you look at a light

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.066
interface screen, it can

00:09:58.066 --> 00:09:59.226
sometimes be a little difficult

00:09:59.226 --> 00:10:01.396
to tell what the content is,

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.366
where to focus your attention

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:04.606
to, especially when there are

00:10:04.606 --> 00:10:06.286
lots of windows on the screen.

00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:08.386
And part of the reason for that

00:10:08.386 --> 00:10:09.956
is because a lot of the content

00:10:10.006 --> 00:10:11.186
that we all create is just

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:12.456
bright in general.

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:16.336
However, in a dark UI, the

00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:18.326
content stands out because of

00:10:18.366 --> 00:10:20.206
the background being pretty

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:21.246
dark.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.676
All of the window chrome in the

00:10:22.676 --> 00:10:24.756
background generally just melts

00:10:24.756 --> 00:10:26.466
away, and the content becomes

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:27.646
the primary focus of your

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:28.136
attention.

00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:30.246
Generally, we found that there

00:10:30.246 --> 00:10:32.096
were three methods for how to

00:10:32.226 --> 00:10:33.996
treat your content regions

00:10:33.996 --> 00:10:35.656
inside of your windows to

00:10:35.656 --> 00:10:37.406
optimize the content focus.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:39.926
The first method was to just

00:10:40.066 --> 00:10:42.466
generally go completely dark.

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:43.946
An app like Finder is a great

00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:45.076
example of where this is

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:47.246
possible because of the way that

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.396
the content is displayed.

00:10:48.936 --> 00:10:50.646
Finder's content are displayed

00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:53.316
as colorful file icons and so

00:10:53.316 --> 00:10:54.516
the dark background really helps

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:56.606
the icons stand out as much as

00:10:58.106 --> 00:10:58.536
possible.

00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:00.626
The second method was to leave

00:11:00.736 --> 00:11:02.716
the content as is.

00:11:03.226 --> 00:11:04.826
Pages is a great example of what

00:11:04.826 --> 00:11:06.726
you see is what you get app,

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.036
where the contents should be

00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:09.646
rendered and presented exactly

00:11:09.646 --> 00:11:12.776
as the user authored and created

00:11:12.776 --> 00:11:12.946
it.

00:11:13.826 --> 00:11:16.276
Dark Mode is a great UI for what

00:11:16.646 --> 00:11:17.856
you see is what you get apps,

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.566
because the content really

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:21.906
becomes the primary focus, and

00:11:21.906 --> 00:11:23.576
the UI really becomes the

00:11:23.636 --> 00:11:25.136
secondary focus and almost melts

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:25.536
away.

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:32.846
The third method was to make the

00:11:32.846 --> 00:11:34.696
content region appearance a user

00:11:34.696 --> 00:11:35.246
option.

00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:37.456
Mail is a good example of an app

00:11:37.456 --> 00:11:38.616
where the appearance of the

00:11:38.686 --> 00:11:40.786
content might be ambiguous as to

00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:41.946
whether the user would prefer it

00:11:41.986 --> 00:11:44.386
to be light or dark, and so the

00:11:44.386 --> 00:11:46.486
best thing to do is to make an

00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:47.796
application setting so that the

00:11:47.796 --> 00:11:49.066
user can determine whether they

00:11:49.066 --> 00:11:50.276
want it to be light or dark on

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:51.406
their own, while their

00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:53.806
application's chrome area still

00:11:53.806 --> 00:11:55.416
respects the overall system

00:11:58.346 --> 00:11:58.806
appearance.

00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:00.216
One thing that all three of

00:12:00.216 --> 00:12:01.866
these windows had in common was

00:12:01.936 --> 00:12:03.796
that the chrome remained dark

00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:06.096
and became secondary to the

00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:06.826
content area.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:09.026
And Dark Mode kind of achieves

00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:10.666
this using a feature that we

00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:11.946
call desktop tinting, which

00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:14.586
causes the window's background

00:12:14.586 --> 00:12:16.576
colors to camouflage themselves

00:12:16.926 --> 00:12:17.966
with the desktop picture.

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:20.286
We found that completely

00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:22.386
desaturated gray colors have a

00:12:22.386 --> 00:12:23.606
tendency to have a color

00:12:23.606 --> 00:12:25.226
temperature that was sometimes

00:12:25.226 --> 00:12:26.336
in conflict with what your

00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:28.596
desktop picture was, and this

00:12:28.596 --> 00:12:30.496
effect was magnified when you

00:12:30.496 --> 00:12:32.646
have a translucent sidebar area,

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:35.696
for example, against a solid

00:12:35.696 --> 00:12:38.526
opaque area of your window, and

00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:39.626
so desktop tinting helps

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:40.416
mitigate that.

00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:41.986
Once applied, the desktop

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:43.656
tinting gives the whole window a

00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:45.346
harmonious color scheme, which

00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:48.716
helps it to blend in with the

00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:50.916
surrounding areas and really

00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:52.236
reduces that color temperature

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:52.906
disparity.

00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:56.616
So, how do we do the desktop

00:12:56.656 --> 00:12:57.776
tinting effect?

00:12:57.896 --> 00:12:58.916
The first thing that we do is,

00:12:58.916 --> 00:13:00.946
actually, we take a sample of

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:01.936
the desktop portion that is

00:13:01.976 --> 00:13:04.626
behind the window, and then we

00:13:04.686 --> 00:13:07.416
derive a average color for that

00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:09.656
area, and then we blend that

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:12.426
average color with a gray, which

00:13:12.496 --> 00:13:13.566
then becomes the window

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:14.346
background color.

00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:16.406
This background color is

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:18.366
dynamic, so as the user moves

00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:19.596
the window around the screen,

00:13:19.596 --> 00:13:21.186
the color will update itself so

00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:22.456
that the window always stays in

00:13:22.456 --> 00:13:24.326
sync with the wallpaper portion

00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:25.176
that was behind it.

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.566
So, if we look at the effect in

00:13:28.566 --> 00:13:29.746
action across a couple of

00:13:29.746 --> 00:13:31.656
different wallpapers, you can

00:13:31.656 --> 00:13:32.916
see that the window is adjusting

00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:34.676
itself on the right side to

00:13:34.676 --> 00:13:37.196
match the desktop picture that

00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:37.816
is behind it.

00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:41.196
Not only does the window

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:44.106
background color adjust itself

00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:45.526
to take advantage of the desktop

00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:47.566
color, but the controls also get

00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:48.666
a little bit of that going

00:13:48.666 --> 00:13:49.986
through them also due to the

00:13:49.986 --> 00:13:51.146
control's opacity.

00:13:53.396 --> 00:13:56.696
For users that work in

00:13:56.696 --> 00:13:58.756
color-sensitive applications or

00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:00.456
have very color-sensitive

00:14:00.796 --> 00:14:02.456
content or just generally would

00:14:02.456 --> 00:14:03.776
prefer not to have the desktop

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:07.996
tinting apply to their UI, we

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:09.986
offer the Graphite Mode so that

00:14:09.986 --> 00:14:11.466
they can disable the color

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:15.106
tinting altogether.

00:14:15.106 --> 00:14:16.946
If we take a look at the color

00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:18.106
swatches for the window

00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:20.306
background colors, along the top

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:21.546
there, we can see the window

00:14:21.546 --> 00:14:23.406
background color in the Light

00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:25.586
Mode, which is the standard

00:14:25.646 --> 00:14:26.546
light gray that we're all

00:14:26.606 --> 00:14:27.416
accustomed to.

00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:28.746
And, in the middle there, we've

00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:30.126
got the under page background

00:14:30.126 --> 00:14:31.876
color, which is a mid-tone gray,

00:14:32.376 --> 00:14:34.196
and then we've got the content

00:14:34.196 --> 00:14:35.836
background, which is the white

00:14:35.936 --> 00:14:36.936
background color that we're all

00:14:36.936 --> 00:14:38.976
familiar with behind all of our

00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:39.806
content areas.

00:14:40.716 --> 00:14:42.016
In the middle row, you can see

00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:43.876
how the desktop tinting affects

00:14:43.986 --> 00:14:45.636
these colors, and, then, along

00:14:45.636 --> 00:14:46.896
the bottom, you can see the

00:14:46.896 --> 00:14:48.476
effects of the graphite accent

00:14:48.546 --> 00:14:50.456
color disabling the desktop

00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:51.146
tinting effect.

00:14:54.566 --> 00:14:55.636
So, now that we've gone over

00:14:55.636 --> 00:14:56.866
some of the design principles,

00:14:57.036 --> 00:14:58.276
let's go into a little bit of

00:14:58.276 --> 00:14:59.426
the design considerations that

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:00.506
you should take into account

00:15:00.506 --> 00:15:03.316
when updating your apps.

00:15:03.316 --> 00:15:04.416
First, let's talk about colors.

00:15:06.186 --> 00:15:08.746
For macOS 10.14, we added a lot

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:09.286
of colors.

00:15:09.926 --> 00:15:12.056
We also removed a lot of colors,

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:15.446
updated some, and, as you can

00:15:15.446 --> 00:15:16.706
see behind me, these are some of

00:15:16.706 --> 00:15:17.616
our system colors.

00:15:17.826 --> 00:15:19.696
Along the bottom, we've got the

00:15:19.696 --> 00:15:21.026
dark variance of the colors,

00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:23.506
and, as you can see, the dark

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:24.916
versions are generally a little

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:26.626
bit brighter and more saturated.

00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:29.356
Rachel and Taylor are going to a

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:30.636
little bit deeper into the color

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:32.266
usage during their portion of

00:15:32.316 --> 00:15:34.136
today's session, but, for now, I

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:35.656
just generally want to try and

00:15:35.656 --> 00:15:36.566
cover three colors in

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:38.356
particular, which are the blues.

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:41.086
Going from left to right, we've

00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:42.336
got controlAccentColor,

00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.456
systemBlueColor, and linkColor.

00:15:45.146 --> 00:15:47.076
Linkcolor, as the name implies,

00:15:47.536 --> 00:15:49.936
is meant to be applied to links,

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:51.156
text links in particular.

00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:53.536
So, things that are hyperlinks,

00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:55.576
taking of the user to a website,

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:57.456
or a link within your

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.846
application that navigates the

00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:00.336
user to another area of your

00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:01.566
application-- those should be

00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:02.526
treated with linkColor.

00:16:03.476 --> 00:16:04.816
ControlAccentColor and

00:16:04.816 --> 00:16:06.696
systemBlueColor are really meant

00:16:06.696 --> 00:16:09.136
to be used on controls that have

00:16:09.196 --> 00:16:10.896
visible borders or button bezel

00:16:10.896 --> 00:16:13.496
backgrounds or for tinted

00:16:13.546 --> 00:16:13.856
glyphs.

00:16:15.086 --> 00:16:16.516
ControlAccentColor, as the name

00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:19.416
implies, is going to respond to

00:16:19.486 --> 00:16:21.296
whatever the system accent color

00:16:21.296 --> 00:16:22.866
is set to, in this case, red.

00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:25.026
So, if you have a custom control

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.186
that is trying to mimic the

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:28.086
appearance of a standard system

00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:29.886
control, or you just have a

00:16:29.886 --> 00:16:31.196
control that you would like to

00:16:31.296 --> 00:16:32.476
follow suit with whatever the

00:16:32.516 --> 00:16:34.486
system appearance is set to, you

00:16:34.486 --> 00:16:35.896
should use controlAccentColor.

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:38.036
If you have a control where it's

00:16:38.036 --> 00:16:39.386
important that the control stays

00:16:39.386 --> 00:16:41.646
blue because of informational

00:16:41.646 --> 00:16:43.076
purposes or for branding

00:16:43.076 --> 00:16:45.506
purposes, then systemBlueColor

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:46.516
is a better choice for you to

00:16:46.516 --> 00:16:46.846
use.

00:16:48.826 --> 00:16:50.286
Next, let's take a look at

00:16:50.286 --> 00:16:51.336
designing with vibrancy.

00:16:53.196 --> 00:16:54.926
When we talk about vibrancy,

00:16:54.926 --> 00:16:56.036
what we're generally referring

00:16:56.036 --> 00:16:58.066
to is the package of a

00:16:58.066 --> 00:17:00.356
translucent material working in

00:17:00.356 --> 00:17:01.526
conjunction with the content

00:17:01.526 --> 00:17:02.676
that is displayed above it.

00:17:03.226 --> 00:17:05.626
So, in this case, the vibrancy

00:17:05.705 --> 00:17:07.955
is the vibrant Finder sidebar.

00:17:10.076 --> 00:17:12.296
Generally, we have non-colored

00:17:12.726 --> 00:17:14.965
artwork that is meant to be

00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:16.076
treated vibrantly.

00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:19.195
An example of that is the glyphs

00:17:19.356 --> 00:17:21.606
and the text in the Finder

00:17:21.606 --> 00:17:23.175
sidebar here.

00:17:23.616 --> 00:17:25.756
The end result of the vibrancy

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:28.056
is is that the colors become

00:17:28.136 --> 00:17:30.196
higher saturation, and the

00:17:30.356 --> 00:17:31.946
contrast is increased for things

00:17:31.946 --> 00:17:32.456
like the text.

00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:35.616
Colored artwork, such as the

00:17:35.616 --> 00:17:37.416
finder tags in this example,

00:17:37.776 --> 00:17:38.506
should be treated as

00:17:38.506 --> 00:17:40.196
non-vibrant.

00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:41.636
Same thing with colored

00:17:41.636 --> 00:17:42.406
iconography.

00:17:42.816 --> 00:17:45.246
The vibrancy will destroy the

00:17:45.246 --> 00:17:46.836
original colors that you have in

00:17:46.836 --> 00:17:48.456
your image, and so you want to

00:17:48.456 --> 00:17:49.646
treat those as non-vibrant.

00:17:50.416 --> 00:17:52.756
So, taking a look at how you can

00:17:52.756 --> 00:17:55.806
construct vibrant content, it

00:17:55.806 --> 00:17:57.946
might seem almost obvious to

00:17:57.946 --> 00:18:00.466
just use opacities, in this

00:18:00.556 --> 00:18:02.726
case, opacities of white.

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:05.276
But while it's true that some

00:18:05.276 --> 00:18:06.636
color contribution from the

00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:08.156
background is occurring through

00:18:08.156 --> 00:18:12.206
the materials here-- and that's

00:18:12.206 --> 00:18:12.946
happening because of the

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:14.456
opacity-- the end result is

00:18:14.456 --> 00:18:16.346
actually not as highly saturated

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.336
as we would desire.

00:18:17.446 --> 00:18:19.546
And, as you can see along the

00:18:20.026 --> 00:18:22.946
bottom with the Quaternary Label

00:18:22.946 --> 00:18:25.396
Color, the legibility is a

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:26.446
little bit compromised.

00:18:27.696 --> 00:18:29.216
Instead, what you want to do is

00:18:29.266 --> 00:18:30.576
construct these using opaque

00:18:30.756 --> 00:18:31.636
grayscale colors.

00:18:32.416 --> 00:18:34.786
One thing to note here is that

00:18:34.886 --> 00:18:37.266
the text color for the RGB label

00:18:37.266 --> 00:18:39.756
colors here are full black.

00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:42.726
What's going to happen once the

00:18:42.726 --> 00:18:44.146
Blend Mode is applied is that

00:18:44.216 --> 00:18:46.406
the text that is black is going

00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:47.806
to become completely

00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:48.466
transparent.

00:18:48.916 --> 00:18:50.046
So, if you have areas of your

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.316
content that need to be treated

00:18:51.316 --> 00:18:53.236
as a knockout, use full opaque

00:18:53.326 --> 00:18:54.956
black, and if you have areas

00:18:54.956 --> 00:18:56.626
that need to be gradiate towards

00:18:56.896 --> 00:18:59.226
an opacity, use a gray that is

00:18:59.456 --> 00:19:00.706
ramping itself towards a full

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:00.916
black.

00:19:01.656 --> 00:19:03.186
This is true in Dark Mode, and

00:19:03.186 --> 00:19:04.506
the opposite is true in Light

00:19:04.546 --> 00:19:05.986
Mode, in light, vibrant areas, I

00:19:05.986 --> 00:19:08.486
should say, where white full,

00:19:08.896 --> 00:19:11.096
opaque white is full transparent

00:19:11.146 --> 00:19:12.646
and gradiating towards that is

00:19:12.726 --> 00:19:13.466
going to give you a

00:19:13.836 --> 00:19:14.596
transparency.

00:19:15.996 --> 00:19:18.156
So, once we apply the vibrancy,

00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:20.476
we can see that the gray colors

00:19:20.476 --> 00:19:23.116
become a lot more saturated, and

00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:26.016
the legibility of the Quaternary

00:19:26.016 --> 00:19:27.306
Color Label is a lot more

00:19:27.306 --> 00:19:27.776
improved.

00:19:28.386 --> 00:19:29.796
Putting them side by side, we

00:19:29.796 --> 00:19:32.326
can see just how much of a

00:19:32.326 --> 00:19:34.026
difference there is between the

00:19:34.026 --> 00:19:35.776
opacity construction, versus the

00:19:35.776 --> 00:19:36.856
grayscale construction.

00:19:36.856 --> 00:19:39.486
In some cases, over certain

00:19:39.486 --> 00:19:43.036
colors, the opacity construction

00:19:43.086 --> 00:19:45.466
will fly, but it's not exactly

00:19:45.516 --> 00:19:47.636
the best end result,

00:19:48.196 --> 00:19:50.046
aesthetically or legibility

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:50.476
wise.

00:19:52.536 --> 00:19:54.976
Next, let's take a look at

00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:56.396
artistically inverting glyphs,

00:19:56.856 --> 00:19:58.456
and, by artistically inverting,

00:19:58.456 --> 00:19:59.856
what I'm referring to is the

00:19:59.856 --> 00:20:01.856
process of creatively looking at

00:20:01.856 --> 00:20:03.516
your glyphs and determining what

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:05.316
areas need to be adjusted to

00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:06.916
take advantage of the Dark Mode,

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:08.856
for example.

00:20:09.546 --> 00:20:11.876
So, here we've got a set of our

00:20:11.996 --> 00:20:13.566
standard glyphs that we have in

00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:14.216
the light appearance.

00:20:14.876 --> 00:20:16.106
One thing to note is that the

00:20:16.106 --> 00:20:17.726
light appearances glyphs

00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:20.716
generally use a lot of edge

00:20:20.716 --> 00:20:22.996
strokes with hollow centers.

00:20:23.386 --> 00:20:24.406
And the reason for that is that

00:20:24.406 --> 00:20:25.746
we take advantage of the white

00:20:25.816 --> 00:20:27.186
backgrounds that these are

00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:29.156
generally placed on top of in

00:20:29.156 --> 00:20:32.086
order to denote form and shape.

00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:34.826
But, if we were to take these

00:20:34.826 --> 00:20:36.736
exact same vector forms and

00:20:36.996 --> 00:20:38.246
place them over a dark

00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:40.196
background, all of that sense of

00:20:40.426 --> 00:20:42.606
form and volume is kind of lost,

00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:44.666
and so we had to artistically

00:20:44.666 --> 00:20:46.526
invert them to bring back some

00:20:46.526 --> 00:20:47.766
of that sense of form and

00:20:47.766 --> 00:20:48.306
volume.

00:20:50.286 --> 00:20:51.976
Looking at how some of these are

00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:53.916
constructed, we've got a couple

00:20:53.916 --> 00:20:55.206
of simple examples, like this

00:20:55.206 --> 00:20:55.606
finder tag.

00:20:55.606 --> 00:20:58.886
On the left side, it's denoting

00:20:58.886 --> 00:21:00.826
a white tag with a dark eyelet

00:21:00.946 --> 00:21:01.346
cutout.

00:21:01.936 --> 00:21:03.286
On the right side, however, in

00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:05.406
Dark Mode, that sense of it

00:21:05.406 --> 00:21:06.976
being a white sheet of paper is

00:21:06.976 --> 00:21:07.336
lost.

00:21:07.816 --> 00:21:09.636
So, once we invert it, we get

00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:10.936
back that white sheet of paper

00:21:10.966 --> 00:21:13.126
with an eyelet knockout hole.

00:21:14.286 --> 00:21:15.386
Looking at how this is

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:18.976
constructed, generally, what you

00:21:19.546 --> 00:21:23.056
would do is expand the clipping

00:21:23.056 --> 00:21:24.686
paths, I should say, and then

00:21:24.906 --> 00:21:27.416
select your eyelet shape and

00:21:27.416 --> 00:21:28.756
then reverse the knockout on

00:21:29.506 --> 00:21:29.606
that.

00:21:29.606 --> 00:21:31.006
And then it's just a game of

00:21:31.046 --> 00:21:35.386
selecting any redundant vector

00:21:35.386 --> 00:21:38.896
paths and removing those.

00:21:38.946 --> 00:21:40.896
Taking a look at a slightly more

00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:42.856
complex shape, for example, the

00:21:42.856 --> 00:21:43.226
house.

00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:46.246
We've got a white house on the

00:21:46.246 --> 00:21:47.396
left side, and on the right

00:21:47.426 --> 00:21:48.566
side, the house isn't white

00:21:48.566 --> 00:21:48.996
anymore.

00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:52.056
So, inverting it returns us back

00:21:52.106 --> 00:21:54.936
to a white painted house.

00:21:56.096 --> 00:21:57.196
Generally, the construction for

00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.626
this is about the same as the

00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:02.376
other process, but one important

00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:04.066
aspect of this glyph, in

00:22:04.066 --> 00:22:06.316
particular, was that we have to

00:22:06.356 --> 00:22:09.116
add a new shape into the vector

00:22:09.116 --> 00:22:09.536
form.

00:22:09.846 --> 00:22:11.036
In this case, we're mimicking

00:22:11.036 --> 00:22:13.646
the roof line, creating a shadow

00:22:13.646 --> 00:22:15.326
underneath the roof that we're

00:22:15.326 --> 00:22:17.286
going to knock out.

00:22:17.416 --> 00:22:18.646
And this is important, because

00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:20.826
if we were to have left the

00:22:20.826 --> 00:22:21.816
construction of the house

00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:23.706
without that shadow line, the

00:22:23.706 --> 00:22:25.186
roof would have no definition,

00:22:25.186 --> 00:22:26.136
and it would be really hard to

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.586
see that at small size.

00:22:29.936 --> 00:22:32.156
Moving on to a more complicated

00:22:32.586 --> 00:22:35.056
glyph, like this mail envelope,

00:22:35.056 --> 00:22:35.666
for example.

00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:37.646
On the left side, we can see a

00:22:37.686 --> 00:22:38.986
sense of volume and shape.

00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:41.086
We've got two layers, generally.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.656
We've got the back flap of the

00:22:42.656 --> 00:22:43.626
envelope, and we've got the

00:22:43.626 --> 00:22:45.696
front flap of the envelope with

00:22:45.696 --> 00:22:47.026
a letter contained in between.

00:22:47.426 --> 00:22:48.876
On the right side, a lot of that

00:22:48.876 --> 00:22:50.456
sense of volume is just missing

00:22:50.456 --> 00:22:52.466
because of the lack of fill

00:22:52.556 --> 00:22:53.096
colors.

00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:56.306
And so, once we invert that, we

00:22:56.306 --> 00:22:57.576
return back to having a sense of

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:57.956
volume.

00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:01.736
Again, generally, the process of

00:23:01.776 --> 00:23:03.436
construction for this one is

00:23:03.436 --> 00:23:04.406
about the same as some of the

00:23:04.406 --> 00:23:06.706
other ones, but it's a little

00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:10.246
bit more detailed and time

00:23:10.246 --> 00:23:12.066
consuming just due to the number

00:23:12.066 --> 00:23:13.106
of paths that there are.

00:23:13.196 --> 00:23:14.866
But, generally, what you want to

00:23:14.866 --> 00:23:16.116
do is break it apart into two

00:23:16.116 --> 00:23:17.816
pieces, again, so that you have

00:23:17.816 --> 00:23:19.256
the front and the rear portion,

00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:20.936
and then you have your letter

00:23:20.936 --> 00:23:21.956
portion in between.

00:23:22.616 --> 00:23:24.636
One important detail that this

00:23:24.676 --> 00:23:29.026
glyph exemplifies is the dual

00:23:29.026 --> 00:23:30.756
opacities that we use in some of

00:23:30.756 --> 00:23:31.146
our glyphs.

00:23:31.336 --> 00:23:32.696
In this case, the letter is set

00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:35.536
to 80% opacity in order to make

00:23:35.536 --> 00:23:36.956
it secondary to the envelope,

00:23:36.956 --> 00:23:38.316
itself, being opened, which is

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:38.876
what we're trying to

00:23:38.906 --> 00:23:39.486
communicate.

00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:42.026
And the opposite is true in

00:23:42.026 --> 00:23:43.756
Light Mode also, where we do use

00:23:43.896 --> 00:23:45.906
80% opacities, in some cases,

00:23:45.906 --> 00:23:46.406
also.

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:50.796
So, quickly wrapping up what

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:51.846
we've covered so far.

00:23:52.906 --> 00:23:55.646
Dark interfaces are cool, so

00:23:55.646 --> 00:23:56.876
cool that you're probably going

00:23:56.876 --> 00:23:57.986
to want to make your app

00:23:58.386 --> 00:23:59.886
potentially dark all the time,

00:23:59.946 --> 00:24:01.016
but unless your app is a

00:24:01.116 --> 00:24:03.436
creative or media-centric app,

00:24:03.436 --> 00:24:05.016
you should reconsider that, and,

00:24:05.016 --> 00:24:06.656
instead make your app follow

00:24:06.656 --> 00:24:07.666
what the system appearance is

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:08.586
set to, instead.

00:24:09.396 --> 00:24:12.476
Don't limit your app design to

00:24:12.646 --> 00:24:14.396
just inverting your existing

00:24:14.396 --> 00:24:15.846
light appearance, and, instead,

00:24:16.016 --> 00:24:18.086
take a look at what elements are

00:24:18.086 --> 00:24:20.556
in your app on a case-by-case

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.266
basis, and try and determine

00:24:22.266 --> 00:24:23.896
what are the visual cues that

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:26.076
are trying to be communicated by

00:24:26.076 --> 00:24:27.806
the controls, and then determine

00:24:27.806 --> 00:24:29.116
whether an opposite visual cue

00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:33.206
is necessary or not.

00:24:33.206 --> 00:24:34.846
Then take a look at what type of

00:24:34.886 --> 00:24:36.806
content your app produces or

00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:39.836
displays, and then use that as a

00:24:39.836 --> 00:24:42.116
guidance to determine what type

00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:44.136
of method to use for how to

00:24:44.136 --> 00:24:45.336
treat your content area--

00:24:45.686 --> 00:24:46.886
whether to go fully dark,

00:24:47.406 --> 00:24:49.826
whether to make it stay as is,

00:24:49.936 --> 00:24:51.076
or whether to make it a user

00:24:51.076 --> 00:24:52.716
option via the app settings.

00:24:54.436 --> 00:24:57.106
Then, taking a look at colors,

00:24:58.986 --> 00:25:02.026
generally, you want to make sure

00:25:02.026 --> 00:25:03.526
that you're using the three

00:25:03.526 --> 00:25:04.666
colors that we went over,

00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:05.786
appropriately, if you have

00:25:05.876 --> 00:25:07.956
controls that are text controls,

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:11.026
try using text link if it's

00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:11.806
applicable.

00:25:12.306 --> 00:25:13.746
If you have controls that you

00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:16.176
want to follow the system accent

00:25:16.216 --> 00:25:18.746
color appearance, set those to

00:25:19.286 --> 00:25:20.736
control accent color, and if you

00:25:20.736 --> 00:25:21.866
have a control that has to stay

00:25:21.866 --> 00:25:24.626
blue all the time, adopt system

00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:25.756
blue color.

00:25:25.756 --> 00:25:27.976
And then Taylor and Rachel are

00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:29.576
going to go into a lot more

00:25:29.576 --> 00:25:30.986
detail about color uses, so

00:25:31.236 --> 00:25:32.916
definitely pay attention to

00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:33.986
their section.

00:25:34.646 --> 00:25:37.686
When constructing your vibrancy

00:25:37.686 --> 00:25:39.226
areas, make sure that you're

00:25:39.226 --> 00:25:40.856
constructing them in a way that

00:25:40.856 --> 00:25:42.186
takes full advantage of the

00:25:42.186 --> 00:25:44.046
vibrant effect blending, so make

00:25:44.046 --> 00:25:45.206
sure that you're using grayscale

00:25:45.206 --> 00:25:46.236
colors that are opaque.

00:25:46.316 --> 00:25:47.966
And if you have areas that need

00:25:47.966 --> 00:25:50.066
to be knockouts or have

00:25:50.066 --> 00:25:52.646
opacities, ramp towards black in

00:25:52.646 --> 00:25:54.246
Dark Mode or ramp towards white

00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:55.026
in Light Mode.

00:25:56.476 --> 00:26:00.056
And then, lastly, make sure that

00:26:00.056 --> 00:26:01.666
the glyphs that you're using are

00:26:01.736 --> 00:26:03.666
artistically inverted in order

00:26:03.746 --> 00:26:07.386
to showcase the intent that the

00:26:07.386 --> 00:26:08.746
glyphs are trying to communicate

00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:10.126
to the user as effectively as

00:26:10.196 --> 00:26:10.666
possible.

00:26:12.476 --> 00:26:14.486
Finally, make sure to go to the

00:26:14.486 --> 00:26:16.366
Human Interface Guidelines to

00:26:16.366 --> 00:26:18.146
see more design guidance.

00:26:19.426 --> 00:26:21.266
And then as well as checking the

00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:23.156
design resources section, where,

00:26:23.406 --> 00:26:24.796
by the end of the month, we're

00:26:24.796 --> 00:26:26.416
going to be making available

00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:28.086
updated Photoshop, and sketch

00:26:28.156 --> 00:26:29.376
templates, and kits for you to

00:26:29.376 --> 00:26:29.656
use.

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:32.086
And with that, I'd like to hand

00:26:32.086 --> 00:26:34.756
it off to Rachel to go over some

00:26:34.756 --> 00:26:36.326
details on how to adopt and

00:26:36.326 --> 00:26:37.086
support Dark Mode.

00:26:37.086 --> 00:26:38.076
Thanks

00:26:39.516 --> 00:26:42.500
[ Applause ]

00:26:46.136 --> 00:26:46.976
>> Thank you, Raymond.

00:26:46.976 --> 00:26:47.856
Hello everybody.

00:26:48.326 --> 00:26:49.636
Let's take a moment just to

00:26:49.636 --> 00:26:51.026
thank Raymond and the rest of

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:52.536
the design team for designing

00:26:52.536 --> 00:26:52.976
Dark Mode.

00:26:52.976 --> 00:26:53.976
Isn't it awesome?

00:26:54.516 --> 00:26:58.516
[ Applause ]

00:26:59.016 --> 00:27:01.376
Now Taylor and I will take you

00:27:01.376 --> 00:27:03.026
through the engineering basics

00:27:03.196 --> 00:27:05.586
of adopting Dark Mode in macOS

00:27:05.586 --> 00:27:06.116
Mojave.

00:27:06.746 --> 00:27:12.046
A while back, Taylor and I were

00:27:12.046 --> 00:27:13.516
chatting, and we discovered that

00:27:13.516 --> 00:27:15.896
we were both huge fans of

00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:16.626
chameleons.

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:18.926
And while we don't yet own our

00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:20.406
own pet chameleons, we thought

00:27:20.406 --> 00:27:22.266
we'd be prepared by writing an

00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:24.276
app called Chameleon Wrangler.

00:27:24.956 --> 00:27:26.666
We did this back in High Sierra,

00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:28.726
and so we thought, "Hey, let's

00:27:28.726 --> 00:27:29.996
update it for Mojave."

00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:33.506
The first thing we did was put

00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:35.266
our system in Dark Mode and

00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:37.946
launch our app from the dock.

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:40.116
And it didn't really look too

00:27:40.116 --> 00:27:40.466
dark.

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:44.056
In fact, it's exactly the same

00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:45.556
between light and dark.

00:27:46.796 --> 00:27:48.386
And you'll note throughout this

00:27:48.386 --> 00:27:49.926
portion of the talk that on the

00:27:49.926 --> 00:27:51.316
left, when we want to compare,

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:52.616
we'll have the light on the left

00:27:52.616 --> 00:27:53.616
and the dark on the right, so

00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:54.986
you can compare them side by

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:55.376
side.

00:27:55.986 --> 00:27:57.206
Can't actually run the system

00:27:57.206 --> 00:27:57.726
this way.

00:27:57.756 --> 00:27:58.536
It's just for show.

00:28:00.516 --> 00:28:02.466
So, what we needed to do was

00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:04.686
link against the 10.14 SDK and

00:28:04.736 --> 00:28:05.496
Xcode 10.

00:28:07.116 --> 00:28:09.166
We built and ran our app, and

00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:09.416
voila.

00:28:10.606 --> 00:28:11.486
It's a lot darker.

00:28:12.456 --> 00:28:13.596
Comparing with light, you can

00:28:13.596 --> 00:28:14.616
see a lot of things are

00:28:14.616 --> 00:28:16.256
different and darker,

00:28:16.256 --> 00:28:18.756
automatically, but there's still

00:28:18.756 --> 00:28:20.176
some things we'd like to fix up.

00:28:21.586 --> 00:28:23.576
So, we'll go into detail about

00:28:23.576 --> 00:28:24.386
some of the colors.

00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:27.976
There's a lot of colors.

00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:32.296
Let's take a look at this header

00:28:32.296 --> 00:28:34.096
area that's light green.

00:28:35.576 --> 00:28:39.416
We implemented this using a

00:28:39.616 --> 00:28:41.056
hardcoded color, where we

00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:42.716
specified our custom RGBA

00:28:42.716 --> 00:28:43.606
values.

00:28:45.016 --> 00:28:46.376
The problem with this approach

00:28:46.636 --> 00:28:48.056
is that it doesn't change

00:28:48.216 --> 00:28:49.036
between the different

00:28:49.036 --> 00:28:49.676
appearances.

00:28:50.306 --> 00:28:51.646
You're stuck with the same color

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:52.996
no matter what the system

00:28:52.996 --> 00:28:53.946
preference setting is.

00:28:56.056 --> 00:28:57.346
Instead of doing it this way,

00:28:57.746 --> 00:28:59.426
we're going to take advantage of

00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:01.256
colors in asset catalogs.

00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:03.266
You've been able to do this

00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:05.476
since 10.13-- have colors in

00:29:05.476 --> 00:29:08.196
asset catalogs, but now you can

00:29:08.196 --> 00:29:09.726
specify colors for different

00:29:09.726 --> 00:29:10.356
appearances.

00:29:10.906 --> 00:29:12.746
So, we've added a dark version

00:29:13.026 --> 00:29:13.976
of our header color.

00:29:15.196 --> 00:29:16.456
Asset catalog colors have

00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:17.716
several advantages.

00:29:18.396 --> 00:29:20.976
You can give them meaningful

00:29:20.976 --> 00:29:23.136
names that describe where the

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:24.886
color is used or how it is used,

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:25.876
and those are often called

00:29:25.876 --> 00:29:27.176
semantic names.

00:29:27.846 --> 00:29:31.106
You can have multiple

00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:32.676
definitions of the color, as I

00:29:32.676 --> 00:29:33.906
showed you, with the light and

00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:35.906
dark versions and also for

00:29:35.906 --> 00:29:38.476
different color spaces-- sRGB

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:38.846
versus P3.

00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:42.076
And it gives you a central

00:29:42.076 --> 00:29:44.256
location for defining all of

00:29:44.256 --> 00:29:44.886
your colors.

00:29:45.206 --> 00:29:46.686
That makes it easy to go in and

00:29:46.686 --> 00:29:47.806
tweak your colors without

00:29:47.806 --> 00:29:49.926
changing any code if needed.

00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:54.116
So, here's our color now in a

00:29:54.116 --> 00:29:56.296
asset catalog, and it's called

00:29:56.296 --> 00:29:57.656
headerColor, because it's the

00:29:57.656 --> 00:29:58.286
header color.

00:29:59.526 --> 00:30:00.916
And let's see how it looks now,

00:30:01.356 --> 00:30:02.576
using headerColor.

00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:04.606
Looks a lot better and dark with

00:30:04.606 --> 00:30:05.446
that dark green.

00:30:06.056 --> 00:30:07.846
But something becomes obvious,

00:30:08.946 --> 00:30:10.116
and that's the text.

00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:13.236
Chloe's name and age are hard to

00:30:13.236 --> 00:30:14.526
read now against the darker

00:30:14.526 --> 00:30:14.966
green.

00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:19.596
Things looked okay in light, but

00:30:19.596 --> 00:30:22.276
they don't look good in dark.

00:30:22.456 --> 00:30:24.516
Well, there, we were using black

00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:27.236
and dark gray, and those are

00:30:27.236 --> 00:30:28.956
static colors, also.

00:30:29.526 --> 00:30:31.686
Not exactly the same as

00:30:31.686 --> 00:30:33.266
hardcoded, because we're using

00:30:33.456 --> 00:30:36.446
available colors, but they don't

00:30:36.446 --> 00:30:36.896
change.

00:30:38.076 --> 00:30:39.766
So, instead of using asset

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:41.206
catalogs this time, we're going

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.906
to take advantage of dynamic

00:30:43.906 --> 00:30:44.626
system colors.

00:30:45.506 --> 00:30:48.416
NSColor has many dynamic colors

00:30:48.416 --> 00:30:50.366
available for you to use with

00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:51.766
definitions across the different

00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:52.386
appearances.

00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:55.106
And a special thing about

00:30:55.106 --> 00:30:57.156
NSColor is that the colors are

00:30:57.156 --> 00:30:59.476
resolved at draw time, which

00:30:59.476 --> 00:31:01.506
means that the actual RGBA

00:31:01.746 --> 00:31:04.596
values that are used depend on

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:06.286
the circumstances at the time

00:31:06.556 --> 00:31:07.366
that the color is drawn.

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.976
I'm going to go through some

00:31:09.976 --> 00:31:11.996
examples of dynamic system

00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:12.636
colors now.

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:15.766
Starting with the label colors

00:31:15.846 --> 00:31:16.856
that Raymond talked about

00:31:16.856 --> 00:31:19.806
earlier, and I'm showing the

00:31:19.806 --> 00:31:21.586
dynamic colors on the top half

00:31:21.916 --> 00:31:23.576
and some corresponding static

00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:25.076
colors just using black in

00:31:25.076 --> 00:31:26.606
varying levels of opacity on the

00:31:26.606 --> 00:31:27.306
bottom half.

00:31:27.966 --> 00:31:29.716
And, as you can see, in the

00:31:29.716 --> 00:31:31.026
light appearance, everything

00:31:31.026 --> 00:31:31.736
looks fine.

00:31:32.436 --> 00:31:34.626
But over in dark, labelColor

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:36.466
looks great still, but the black

00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:37.676
colors disappear against the

00:31:37.676 --> 00:31:38.456
dark background.

00:31:38.936 --> 00:31:42.856
Here's an example in the system

00:31:42.856 --> 00:31:45.326
in Mail of where labelColor and

00:31:45.326 --> 00:31:47.586
secondaryLabelColor are used.

00:31:48.626 --> 00:31:50.396
The more important text is given

00:31:50.396 --> 00:31:51.856
the labelColor, and the less

00:31:51.856 --> 00:31:53.436
important text is

00:31:53.436 --> 00:31:54.496
secondaryLabelColor.

00:31:55.196 --> 00:31:59.006
To find out which colors are

00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:01.296
dynamic, in the Interface

00:32:01.396 --> 00:32:03.886
Builder popup menu for colors,

00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:05.626
it'll show you the list, and

00:32:05.626 --> 00:32:07.056
they've done a really nice job

00:32:07.056 --> 00:32:09.726
of making those be the dynamic

00:32:09.776 --> 00:32:10.146
colors.

00:32:11.716 --> 00:32:14.876
So, now switching, once we know

00:32:14.876 --> 00:32:17.016
that, black color and dark gray

00:32:17.586 --> 00:32:19.686
to labelColor and

00:32:19.686 --> 00:32:21.756
secondaryLabelColor, this fixes

00:32:21.756 --> 00:32:23.866
our text, and it looks great in

00:32:23.866 --> 00:32:25.586
both light and dark.

00:32:26.876 --> 00:32:29.256
A little bit more about dynamic

00:32:29.256 --> 00:32:30.056
system colors.

00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:32.336
As Raymond showed you, there are

00:32:32.336 --> 00:32:35.146
a bunch of colorful system

00:32:35.146 --> 00:32:36.476
colors-- systemRed,

00:32:36.656 --> 00:32:38.176
systemYellow, systemGreen are

00:32:38.176 --> 00:32:39.296
just three examples.

00:32:40.086 --> 00:32:41.816
And they subtly change for the

00:32:41.816 --> 00:32:43.086
different appearances so that

00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:44.626
they look great in both places,

00:32:44.976 --> 00:32:46.896
as opposed to the static, plain

00:32:46.896 --> 00:32:48.276
red, yellow, green colors.

00:32:49.756 --> 00:32:51.166
Another special thing about

00:32:51.166 --> 00:32:53.736
using systemRed, etc., is that

00:32:53.736 --> 00:32:56.286
they will match other uses of

00:32:56.396 --> 00:32:58.706
systemRed throughout the OS as

00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:00.106
well as matching on iOS.

00:33:01.656 --> 00:33:03.246
So, it's great to stick to these

00:33:03.316 --> 00:33:05.826
kinds of colors when you have an

00:33:05.826 --> 00:33:07.176
informational content in your

00:33:07.176 --> 00:33:07.536
color.

00:33:07.536 --> 00:33:09.256
It needs to be red or yellow for

00:33:09.256 --> 00:33:10.326
a warning, for example.

00:33:13.276 --> 00:33:15.016
Raymond also talked about

00:33:15.706 --> 00:33:17.316
linkColor, systemBlue, and

00:33:17.316 --> 00:33:18.946
controlAccentColor, so I wanted

00:33:18.946 --> 00:33:20.146
to talk about that again.

00:33:21.486 --> 00:33:22.776
LinkColor and systemBlue are

00:33:22.776 --> 00:33:24.126
very similar but slightly

00:33:24.126 --> 00:33:26.296
different and use linkColor for

00:33:26.296 --> 00:33:29.466
actual links to webpages or for

00:33:29.626 --> 00:33:30.636
going someplace in your app,

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:33.786
whereas systemBlue is used for

00:33:33.786 --> 00:33:34.926
standard actions in your

00:33:34.926 --> 00:33:36.576
application, or you might even

00:33:36.576 --> 00:33:38.086
use controlAccentColor if you

00:33:38.086 --> 00:33:39.096
want to match the system

00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:40.576
preference, in this case,

00:33:40.576 --> 00:33:40.916
purple.

00:33:42.676 --> 00:33:45.106
You may search through your

00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:47.486
application code and find all

00:33:47.486 --> 00:33:48.866
the places you're using color

00:33:48.866 --> 00:33:51.526
and fix it all up and then still

00:33:51.526 --> 00:33:53.226
end up with a situation like

00:33:53.296 --> 00:33:55.916
this, where, for some reason,

00:33:55.946 --> 00:33:57.376
even though your text switched

00:33:57.376 --> 00:33:58.856
color, there's something behind

00:33:58.856 --> 00:34:00.236
it that's still drawing wrong.

00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:03.476
And if you're stuck and can't

00:34:03.476 --> 00:34:06.366
figure out what to do, I suggest

00:34:06.366 --> 00:34:08.505
taking advantage of Xcode's View

00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:09.005
Debugger.

00:34:09.716 --> 00:34:10.806
I'm just going to cover this

00:34:10.835 --> 00:34:13.025
briefly here, and the advanced

00:34:13.025 --> 00:34:14.466
Dark Mode session will go into

00:34:14.466 --> 00:34:16.565
more detail about debugging tips

00:34:16.565 --> 00:34:17.116
and tricks.

00:34:18.525 --> 00:34:22.196
So, I can see that light view is

00:34:22.196 --> 00:34:24.315
actually my scroll view, and I

00:34:24.315 --> 00:34:26.706
had set in the interface builder

00:34:27.106 --> 00:34:28.446
to a custom gray color.

00:34:28.926 --> 00:34:29.936
That's why I couldn't find it

00:34:29.936 --> 00:34:30.946
searching through my code.

00:34:31.996 --> 00:34:33.936
So, I switched it to the default

00:34:33.936 --> 00:34:36.016
background color, and now

00:34:36.146 --> 00:34:37.076
everything looks great.

00:34:38.156 --> 00:34:39.246
And while we're here on this

00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:40.485
text view, I'd like to go

00:34:40.485 --> 00:34:41.626
through some of the colors in

00:34:41.626 --> 00:34:43.505
play here that are dynamic

00:34:43.686 --> 00:34:45.136
system colors that also may be

00:34:45.136 --> 00:34:45.846
useful to you.

00:34:46.396 --> 00:34:50.746
First, there's textColor, which

00:34:50.746 --> 00:34:52.656
is switching between black and

00:34:52.656 --> 00:34:55.676
white; textBackgroundColors

00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:58.936
switches from white to black;

00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:02.116
selectedTextColor goes from

00:35:02.116 --> 00:35:04.496
black to white; and then

00:35:04.496 --> 00:35:06.346
selectedTextBackgroundColor,

00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:07.166
which is blue.

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.266
But you can see it's two

00:35:08.266 --> 00:35:10.376
different versions of blue, and

00:35:11.336 --> 00:35:12.676
this is special, because it

00:35:12.676 --> 00:35:14.136
follows the system preference

00:35:14.136 --> 00:35:15.146
for the highlight color.

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:16.616
And you can see, when the

00:35:16.676 --> 00:35:18.256
highlight color changes, the

00:35:18.256 --> 00:35:19.996
selectedTextBackgroundColor

00:35:20.386 --> 00:35:21.746
changes with it.

00:35:22.426 --> 00:35:24.896
Now, I'd like to move along and

00:35:24.896 --> 00:35:26.296
talk about accessibility.

00:35:28.676 --> 00:35:30.206
In the Accessibility display

00:35:30.206 --> 00:35:31.516
preferences, there's the

00:35:31.516 --> 00:35:33.216
Increase contrast checkbox.

00:35:34.526 --> 00:35:36.316
If we turn on Increase contrast

00:35:36.316 --> 00:35:38.706
mode, you'll see that colors and

00:35:38.706 --> 00:35:40.176
artwork throughout the system

00:35:40.176 --> 00:35:42.916
change to make the UI easier to

00:35:42.916 --> 00:35:43.986
see for people to see with low

00:35:43.986 --> 00:35:44.406
vision.

00:35:45.786 --> 00:35:49.616
Well, now in asset catalogs, we

00:35:49.616 --> 00:35:52.006
can add colors specially for the

00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:53.646
high contrast appearances as

00:35:53.646 --> 00:35:53.966
well.

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:56.256
So, here I've added to my header

00:35:56.256 --> 00:35:58.376
color a version for high

00:35:58.376 --> 00:36:00.306
contrast light and high contrast

00:36:00.306 --> 00:36:00.586
dark.

00:36:01.326 --> 00:36:04.526
And this is how Chameleon

00:36:04.526 --> 00:36:06.786
Wrangler now looks in the dark

00:36:06.786 --> 00:36:08.226
high contrast appearance.

00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:10.276
You'll notice that not only is

00:36:10.276 --> 00:36:11.666
my header color using that

00:36:11.666 --> 00:36:13.246
special color that I defined,

00:36:13.856 --> 00:36:15.386
the rest of the system colors

00:36:15.466 --> 00:36:17.586
are also specially defined for

00:36:17.586 --> 00:36:19.106
the high contrast appearances.

00:36:19.936 --> 00:36:22.256
And this is true for light high

00:36:22.256 --> 00:36:23.486
contrast, as well.

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:28.156
Now I'd like to move along and

00:36:28.226 --> 00:36:29.206
talk about images.

00:36:34.466 --> 00:36:36.426
We'll take a look at the toolbar

00:36:36.426 --> 00:36:37.156
buttons here.

00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:42.286
This chameleon color picker

00:36:42.286 --> 00:36:44.666
button looks pretty good in

00:36:44.666 --> 00:36:46.976
light, but in dark, that dark

00:36:46.976 --> 00:36:48.746
outline disappears against the

00:36:48.746 --> 00:36:50.026
dark background of the button.

00:36:51.226 --> 00:36:54.496
So, we'd like to have a special

00:36:54.496 --> 00:36:56.026
version of it for the dark

00:36:56.066 --> 00:36:58.046
appearance, and, once again, we

00:36:58.046 --> 00:36:59.866
turn to our asset catalog friend

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:04.126
and add a version for the dark

00:37:04.126 --> 00:37:04.736
appearance.

00:37:09.186 --> 00:37:10.746
And now it looks much better

00:37:10.746 --> 00:37:13.586
against the dark button with the

00:37:13.586 --> 00:37:14.396
light outline.

00:37:16.486 --> 00:37:17.756
That's great for full color

00:37:17.756 --> 00:37:18.226
images.

00:37:18.896 --> 00:37:21.936
How about these other two

00:37:21.936 --> 00:37:22.406
buttons?

00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:24.726
Well, they already look pretty

00:37:24.726 --> 00:37:24.966
good.

00:37:25.596 --> 00:37:26.726
We didn't have to do anything,

00:37:26.726 --> 00:37:27.906
so why?

00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:28.806
Why are these right?

00:37:29.806 --> 00:37:32.986
Well, that's because we had made

00:37:33.176 --> 00:37:35.266
these images template images.

00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:39.216
To tell you a little bit about

00:37:39.266 --> 00:37:41.166
template images, in case you

00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:42.326
don't already know about them,

00:37:43.776 --> 00:37:45.116
it's important to understand

00:37:45.246 --> 00:37:47.296
that the transparency of each

00:37:47.296 --> 00:37:51.066
pixel is maintained, but the

00:37:51.066 --> 00:37:52.036
color is ignored.

00:37:52.096 --> 00:37:54.386
You can make the starting image

00:37:54.386 --> 00:37:55.616
any color you like, that's

00:37:55.616 --> 00:37:56.186
ignored.

00:37:56.296 --> 00:37:57.556
It's only the transparency.

00:37:58.316 --> 00:37:59.946
They can be bitmaps or PDFs.

00:38:01.306 --> 00:38:02.716
And here's an example from the

00:38:02.716 --> 00:38:04.646
OS of the speaker volume image.

00:38:05.486 --> 00:38:08.046
The original image is black, and

00:38:08.256 --> 00:38:09.626
then it has this partially

00:38:09.626 --> 00:38:11.146
transparent section for the

00:38:11.146 --> 00:38:12.226
larger soundwaves.

00:38:14.196 --> 00:38:16.516
And if we put this image into an

00:38:16.516 --> 00:38:19.866
NSImageView, it's automatically

00:38:19.866 --> 00:38:21.406
given the Secondary Label Color,

00:38:21.406 --> 00:38:24.296
and you can see in light, it's a

00:38:24.826 --> 00:38:26.446
medium gray, and in dark, it's a

00:38:26.446 --> 00:38:27.076
lighter gray.

00:38:27.756 --> 00:38:28.596
And then the partially

00:38:28.596 --> 00:38:30.426
transparent areas have less

00:38:30.426 --> 00:38:33.956
contrast against the background.

00:38:35.426 --> 00:38:36.606
Another advantage of using

00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:37.786
template images is that they

00:38:37.786 --> 00:38:39.136
automatically pick up on the

00:38:39.136 --> 00:38:39.716
button state.

00:38:40.196 --> 00:38:43.746
When a button is disabled, the

00:38:43.746 --> 00:38:45.176
images are dimmer, and that's

00:38:45.176 --> 00:38:47.026
handled for you if you use

00:38:47.026 --> 00:38:47.756
template images.

00:38:53.566 --> 00:38:57.246
Okay. So, Chameleon Wrangler is

00:38:57.246 --> 00:38:58.246
now looking pretty good.

00:38:58.276 --> 00:38:59.686
We got our colors sorted out.

00:38:59.686 --> 00:39:01.146
We got some of our images sorted

00:39:01.146 --> 00:39:02.986
out, but there's more to the

00:39:02.986 --> 00:39:04.386
application than what you see

00:39:04.386 --> 00:39:06.266
here, so I'd like to invite

00:39:06.296 --> 00:39:08.216
Taylor to the stage to tell you

00:39:08.216 --> 00:39:08.986
about the rest of it.

00:39:10.126 --> 00:39:10.906
Thank you very much.

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:15.500
[ Applause ]

00:39:18.736 --> 00:39:19.336
>> Thank you Rachel.

00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:21.396
Now that Rachel's covered a lot

00:39:21.396 --> 00:39:22.766
of the fundamentals of having

00:39:22.766 --> 00:39:24.526
our colors and images react

00:39:24.526 --> 00:39:25.726
appropriately for Dark Mode,

00:39:26.356 --> 00:39:27.386
let's first take a look at

00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:28.486
applying some of those to some

00:39:28.486 --> 00:39:29.586
more detailed areas of our

00:39:29.586 --> 00:39:30.206
application.

00:39:30.376 --> 00:39:32.876
First up is Moodometer, where we

00:39:32.876 --> 00:39:34.746
can keep track of Chloe's mood

00:39:34.746 --> 00:39:36.046
shifts throughout the day.

00:39:37.036 --> 00:39:37.846
You can see here that the

00:39:37.846 --> 00:39:39.076
popover's background has

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.646
automatically adjusted for the

00:39:40.646 --> 00:39:41.126
Dark Mode.

00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:43.706
However, the button content is

00:39:43.866 --> 00:39:45.576
way too dark, still, on top of

00:39:45.576 --> 00:39:46.126
the background.

00:39:47.626 --> 00:39:48.456
Taking a look at our Asa

00:39:48.456 --> 00:39:50.136
Catalog, we can see that we've

00:39:50.336 --> 00:39:52.296
prebuilt these images with the

00:39:52.296 --> 00:39:53.596
color defined in the asset

00:39:53.596 --> 00:39:55.396
themself.

00:39:55.396 --> 00:39:56.316
So, we can use the technique

00:39:56.316 --> 00:39:57.776
that Rachel showed us, where we

00:39:57.776 --> 00:39:59.106
add a dark variant for those

00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:01.086
images with a lighter color.

00:40:02.336 --> 00:40:03.646
However, it's kind of

00:40:03.646 --> 00:40:05.016
unfortunate that we're only

00:40:05.016 --> 00:40:06.296
varying the fill color of these

00:40:06.296 --> 00:40:07.806
images but keeping the same

00:40:07.806 --> 00:40:08.136
shape.

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:10.206
So, there's probably a better

00:40:10.206 --> 00:40:13.016
way, and, in Mojave, there is,

00:40:13.156 --> 00:40:14.936
using this contentTintColor API.

00:40:15.976 --> 00:40:17.826
With this, you can create a

00:40:17.826 --> 00:40:19.566
template image and provide a

00:40:19.566 --> 00:40:21.106
custom tint color to be used

00:40:21.106 --> 00:40:21.946
instead of the default

00:40:21.946 --> 00:40:22.906
appearance sensitive one.

00:40:23.226 --> 00:40:24.666
That will be used as the base

00:40:24.666 --> 00:40:26.476
fill color for any of the places

00:40:26.476 --> 00:40:27.716
that the image appears.

00:40:27.716 --> 00:40:30.416
So, we can set the content tint

00:40:30.416 --> 00:40:32.326
color on an NSImageView to tint

00:40:32.426 --> 00:40:34.786
its image or on an NSButton to

00:40:34.786 --> 00:40:36.316
tint both its boot image and

00:40:36.316 --> 00:40:36.616
title.

00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:39.226
So, let's take a look at

00:40:39.226 --> 00:40:40.026
adopting this.

00:40:40.426 --> 00:40:41.486
The first step here is to

00:40:41.486 --> 00:40:42.976
convert these to simple template

00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:45.026
images and remember to set the

00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:46.896
render mode to be the template

00:40:46.896 --> 00:40:47.306
effect.

00:40:48.496 --> 00:40:49.426
Taking a look at Chameleon

00:40:49.426 --> 00:40:50.816
Wrangler now, we can see that

00:40:50.816 --> 00:40:52.316
these images are now getting the

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:53.906
default templating effect, which

00:40:53.906 --> 00:40:55.786
looks great in Dark Mode, but

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:56.896
the next step is going to be

00:40:56.896 --> 00:40:57.926
applying that color.

00:40:58.396 --> 00:41:00.426
So, we could just pull the color

00:41:00.426 --> 00:41:02.296
out of the asset, add a dark

00:41:02.296 --> 00:41:03.946
variant, and set the

00:41:03.946 --> 00:41:05.096
contentTintColor on these

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:06.616
buttons to be that named color.

00:41:06.616 --> 00:41:08.506
And this button will

00:41:08.506 --> 00:41:09.726
automatically pick the right

00:41:09.726 --> 00:41:10.986
variant based on whether it's

00:41:10.986 --> 00:41:11.716
appearing in the light

00:41:11.716 --> 00:41:14.256
appearance or dark appearance.

00:41:14.256 --> 00:41:15.656
However, Rachel also showed us

00:41:15.656 --> 00:41:16.366
how there are a number of

00:41:16.366 --> 00:41:18.306
colorful system colors that

00:41:18.306 --> 00:41:19.456
already have these light and

00:41:19.456 --> 00:41:20.926
dark variants, which we could

00:41:20.926 --> 00:41:21.556
use instead.

00:41:22.016 --> 00:41:24.646
For instance, we could use

00:41:24.776 --> 00:41:26.416
systemRed, systemYellow, and

00:41:26.416 --> 00:41:28.806
systemGreen, which, if we return

00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:29.986
back to Chameleon Wrangler, we

00:41:29.986 --> 00:41:31.626
can see looks really great and

00:41:31.626 --> 00:41:33.596
has those buttons pop on top of

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:34.196
that background.

00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:36.816
What's really cool about this

00:41:36.816 --> 00:41:39.086
combination is that not only do

00:41:39.086 --> 00:41:41.306
we get a very specific green

00:41:41.306 --> 00:41:42.686
color for both Light and Dark

00:41:42.686 --> 00:41:44.686
Mode, but with the content tint

00:41:44.686 --> 00:41:46.496
API, the system effects applied

00:41:46.496 --> 00:41:48.226
on top of that vary based on

00:41:48.226 --> 00:41:49.046
appearance as well.

00:41:49.926 --> 00:41:51.666
As Raymond discussed, in the

00:41:51.666 --> 00:41:52.856
light appearance, there's a

00:41:52.856 --> 00:41:54.316
darkening effect on top of that

00:41:54.316 --> 00:41:55.086
base tint color.

00:41:55.686 --> 00:41:56.436
Meanwhile, in the dark

00:41:56.436 --> 00:41:57.406
appearance, there's a

00:41:57.406 --> 00:41:58.966
brightening effect.

00:42:00.016 --> 00:42:01.776
All of these effects are further

00:42:01.776 --> 00:42:03.306
customized for the increased

00:42:03.306 --> 00:42:06.266
contrast setting without any

00:42:06.266 --> 00:42:07.566
changes from our application.

00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:09.446
So, it's really great that we

00:42:09.446 --> 00:42:11.156
didn't have to specify all 12 of

00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:11.936
these colors.

00:42:12.156 --> 00:42:13.226
And instead, we specified a

00:42:13.226 --> 00:42:14.786
single one and, thanks to

00:42:14.786 --> 00:42:16.046
dynamic system colors and

00:42:16.046 --> 00:42:17.766
dynamic system effects, we got

00:42:17.766 --> 00:42:18.936
all of this completely

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:19.586
automatically.

00:42:21.896 --> 00:42:23.616
So, our Moodometer is looking

00:42:23.616 --> 00:42:23.956
great.

00:42:24.736 --> 00:42:25.946
Next, we can step over to

00:42:25.946 --> 00:42:27.356
another type of app where we

00:42:27.356 --> 00:42:28.646
keep track of very important

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.506
information about Chloe, such as

00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:32.166
how stressed she's feeling or

00:42:32.166 --> 00:42:33.436
more importantly, what's her

00:42:33.436 --> 00:42:34.386
favorite type of berry?

00:42:35.476 --> 00:42:36.926
We can see here that this

00:42:36.926 --> 00:42:38.226
already looks great, because we

00:42:38.226 --> 00:42:40.916
are using stock Cocoa controls,

00:42:41.096 --> 00:42:42.446
which automatically adjust for

00:42:42.446 --> 00:42:43.006
Dark Mode.

00:42:44.316 --> 00:42:46.206
We can see how it reacts to the

00:42:46.266 --> 00:42:47.256
accent color feature that

00:42:47.256 --> 00:42:48.896
Raymond talked about by opening

00:42:48.896 --> 00:42:50.876
up system preferences, changing

00:42:50.876 --> 00:42:52.336
the color to a nice chameleon

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:54.216
striped yellow, and returning

00:42:54.216 --> 00:42:55.466
back to Chameleon Wrangler.

00:42:56.596 --> 00:42:57.666
We can, again, see that the

00:42:57.666 --> 00:42:59.436
built-in controls automatically

00:42:59.436 --> 00:43:00.886
adjust to that yellow accent

00:43:00.886 --> 00:43:02.816
color, including the focus ring

00:43:02.926 --> 00:43:03.736
and highlight color.

00:43:04.986 --> 00:43:05.976
However, we can notice that our

00:43:05.976 --> 00:43:07.546
custom tab bar has remained

00:43:07.546 --> 00:43:09.146
blue, even though we've changed

00:43:09.146 --> 00:43:09.756
the accent color.

00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:12.366
Because this blue doesn't really

00:43:12.366 --> 00:43:13.636
have any significance for our

00:43:13.636 --> 00:43:15.356
application, we probably want it

00:43:15.356 --> 00:43:17.586
to be following that accent

00:43:18.576 --> 00:43:18.716
color.

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:20.136
Like Rachel talked about, we

00:43:20.136 --> 00:43:21.876
have a few different colors that

00:43:21.876 --> 00:43:23.786
will follow the users' accent

00:43:23.786 --> 00:43:24.896
and highlight color selection.

00:43:25.876 --> 00:43:27.396
New in Mojave is a control

00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:29.186
accent color, which you can use

00:43:29.266 --> 00:43:31.166
to directly mimic the accented

00:43:31.166 --> 00:43:33.096
areas on system controls, such

00:43:33.096 --> 00:43:34.536
as the sides of popup buttons,

00:43:34.916 --> 00:43:36.386
default push buttons, or the

00:43:36.386 --> 00:43:37.706
selected segment of a segmented

00:43:37.706 --> 00:43:38.126
control.

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:40.936
There's also selected content

00:43:40.936 --> 00:43:41.926
background color, which is what

00:43:41.926 --> 00:43:43.006
you see in the background of

00:43:43.006 --> 00:43:44.586
selected table rows, and you can

00:43:44.586 --> 00:43:45.556
use to indicate custom

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:46.136
selection.

00:43:47.426 --> 00:43:48.486
And selected text background

00:43:48.486 --> 00:43:50.366
color is exactly what it sounds

00:43:50.366 --> 00:43:50.616
like.

00:43:51.136 --> 00:43:53.606
So, going back to our app, we

00:43:53.606 --> 00:43:54.906
can see that we're using system

00:43:54.906 --> 00:43:56.506
blue color for this custom tab

00:43:56.506 --> 00:43:58.376
selection, and, instead, we can

00:43:58.376 --> 00:43:59.696
just swap that over to using

00:43:59.696 --> 00:44:00.756
controlAccentColor.

00:44:02.676 --> 00:44:04.046
The next problem here with the

00:44:04.046 --> 00:44:05.516
tab bar is a little more subtle.

00:44:06.366 --> 00:44:07.956
If we bring our cursor over and

00:44:08.056 --> 00:44:10.046
press down on it, we can see

00:44:10.046 --> 00:44:11.086
that we're getting a darkening

00:44:11.086 --> 00:44:12.406
effect instead of the

00:44:12.406 --> 00:44:13.546
brightening effect that we

00:44:13.546 --> 00:44:14.586
should in Dark Mode.

00:44:15.846 --> 00:44:16.986
This is because we are taking

00:44:16.986 --> 00:44:18.256
that base color and just

00:44:18.256 --> 00:44:20.006
applying a constant 30%

00:44:20.006 --> 00:44:21.856
darkening effect to it, assuming

00:44:21.856 --> 00:44:23.116
that would look fine in the

00:44:23.116 --> 00:44:24.506
light appearance.

00:44:25.576 --> 00:44:27.356
Instead, we want to describe

00:44:27.356 --> 00:44:28.666
something that basically this

00:44:28.726 --> 00:44:30.976
color is being pressed, and that

00:44:30.976 --> 00:44:33.726
semantic description can carry

00:44:33.726 --> 00:44:35.316
whatever effect it needs to in

00:44:35.316 --> 00:44:36.176
the light versus dark

00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:37.416
appearance.

00:44:37.416 --> 00:44:38.596
So, with the new system effect

00:44:38.596 --> 00:44:41.546
API in Mojave on NSColor, we can

00:44:41.546 --> 00:44:42.946
describe that exact semantic.

00:44:43.836 --> 00:44:45.036
We can take our base color of

00:44:45.036 --> 00:44:46.806
controlAccentColor, say that we

00:44:46.806 --> 00:44:47.876
want to get the pressed variant,

00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:49.656
and it will react appropriately

00:44:49.746 --> 00:44:51.026
in both the light and dark

00:44:51.026 --> 00:44:52.246
appearance.

00:44:54.936 --> 00:44:56.316
There's one more area of our

00:44:56.316 --> 00:44:57.726
application where you can see

00:44:57.836 --> 00:44:59.586
the accent color, and that's in

00:44:59.586 --> 00:45:01.076
this photo browser where we draw

00:45:01.076 --> 00:45:02.406
a selection ring around the

00:45:02.406 --> 00:45:03.816
selected photo.

00:45:04.356 --> 00:45:06.126
Here, we were using the

00:45:06.226 --> 00:45:08.026
selectedContentBackgroundColor,

00:45:08.376 --> 00:45:09.576
and that, again, automatically

00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:11.066
adjusts based on the user's

00:45:11.066 --> 00:45:12.056
selected accent.

00:45:13.846 --> 00:45:14.696
Let's open up one of these

00:45:14.696 --> 00:45:15.986
photos and take a look at a

00:45:15.986 --> 00:45:17.956
nice, big, beautiful photo of

00:45:17.956 --> 00:45:18.336
Chloe.

00:45:19.056 --> 00:45:21.396
The first thing that stands out

00:45:21.396 --> 00:45:22.636
is the fact that the background

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:24.436
has not adjusted for Dark Mode.

00:45:25.066 --> 00:45:26.276
It's still using its light

00:45:26.276 --> 00:45:28.256
translucency effect similar to a

00:45:28.256 --> 00:45:29.106
hardcoded color.

00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:32.066
This effect is provided by

00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:33.896
NSVisualEfffectView, which

00:45:33.926 --> 00:45:35.246
provides the translucent blur

00:45:35.246 --> 00:45:36.616
materials you see across the

00:45:36.616 --> 00:45:37.026
system.

00:45:37.186 --> 00:45:38.766
For instance, there's the

00:45:38.766 --> 00:45:40.236
sidebars which blur onto the

00:45:40.236 --> 00:45:41.736
desktop and other windows behind

00:45:41.736 --> 00:45:43.446
it, as well as things like the

00:45:43.446 --> 00:45:44.886
title bar, which blur the

00:45:44.886 --> 00:45:45.886
content that's scrolled

00:45:45.886 --> 00:45:47.066
underneath.

00:45:47.966 --> 00:45:50.226
NSVisualEffectView also enables

00:45:50.226 --> 00:45:51.566
the vibrant foreground blending,

00:45:51.866 --> 00:45:53.636
that Raymond talked about, by

00:45:53.636 --> 00:45:55.586
taking a grayscale color plus a

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:57.206
Blend Mode and making it really

00:45:57.206 --> 00:45:58.846
pop on top of these backgrounds.

00:45:59.826 --> 00:46:00.906
The advanced Dark Mode talk is

00:46:00.906 --> 00:46:01.756
going to go into a lot more

00:46:01.756 --> 00:46:03.036
detail about how you can use

00:46:03.036 --> 00:46:04.366
those blend modes effectively.

00:46:06.686 --> 00:46:08.046
Turns out that a lot of places

00:46:08.046 --> 00:46:09.256
automatically get these blur

00:46:09.256 --> 00:46:10.676
materials for free.

00:46:10.856 --> 00:46:12.916
For instance, every titlebar of

00:46:12.916 --> 00:46:14.326
an NSWindow will automatically

00:46:14.326 --> 00:46:16.006
have a titlebar material showing

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:17.706
onto the content behind it.

00:46:18.496 --> 00:46:20.156
Source list table views and

00:46:20.156 --> 00:46:21.756
sidebar style split-view items

00:46:22.046 --> 00:46:23.286
will automatically get a sidebar

00:46:23.286 --> 00:46:24.866
material showing onto the

00:46:24.866 --> 00:46:26.166
content behind the window.

00:46:26.386 --> 00:46:29.436
For custom UIs it's pretty easy

00:46:29.436 --> 00:46:30.616
to build these custom effects

00:46:30.616 --> 00:46:31.426
ourselves, as well.

00:46:32.136 --> 00:46:33.326
But the most important quality

00:46:33.326 --> 00:46:34.726
of them are the material that

00:46:34.726 --> 00:46:36.276
you choose to have them

00:46:36.276 --> 00:46:36.776
represent.

00:46:37.976 --> 00:46:39.406
We have a few nonsemantic

00:46:39.406 --> 00:46:41.256
materials, which, like hardcoded

00:46:41.256 --> 00:46:43.126
colors, just describe the exact

00:46:43.126 --> 00:46:44.536
visual quality of the material

00:46:44.916 --> 00:46:46.256
and not the intent of what

00:46:46.256 --> 00:46:47.126
you're trying to represent.

00:46:48.086 --> 00:46:49.536
These will not be adjusted for

00:46:49.536 --> 00:46:50.786
Dark Mode and will stay with

00:46:50.786 --> 00:46:51.866
that exact quality.

00:46:53.066 --> 00:46:54.106
However, we have a number of

00:46:54.106 --> 00:46:55.486
semantic materials, as well,

00:46:55.986 --> 00:46:57.346
which allow you to describe what

00:46:57.346 --> 00:46:59.126
type of UI your custom UI is

00:46:59.256 --> 00:47:00.216
intending to represent.

00:47:00.216 --> 00:47:02.226
For instance, for a custom menu

00:47:02.226 --> 00:47:03.426
like UI, you would want to use

00:47:03.466 --> 00:47:04.296
the menu material.

00:47:04.416 --> 00:47:06.196
And these not only adjust for

00:47:06.196 --> 00:47:07.976
Dark Mode, but guarantee that UI

00:47:07.976 --> 00:47:10.246
to always match those materials

00:47:10.306 --> 00:47:11.556
even when the system changes in

00:47:11.556 --> 00:47:11.986
the future.

00:47:13.156 --> 00:47:14.236
We've had a few of these in the

00:47:14.236 --> 00:47:16.646
past, but in Mojave, we have

00:47:16.646 --> 00:47:17.966
several more so that you can

00:47:17.966 --> 00:47:19.346
make sure to really tailor your

00:47:19.346 --> 00:47:21.496
custom UI to match the material

00:47:21.596 --> 00:47:24.936
it needs to.

00:47:25.176 --> 00:47:26.506
Jumping back to our photo here,

00:47:26.506 --> 00:47:27.516
we can see that we were using

00:47:27.516 --> 00:47:28.706
the mediumLight material,

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:29.776
because we were trying to

00:47:29.776 --> 00:47:31.496
represent Quick Look style

00:47:31.496 --> 00:47:32.426
popover windows.

00:47:33.126 --> 00:47:34.296
And instead, we can just simply

00:47:34.296 --> 00:47:35.556
swap that over to the popover

00:47:35.556 --> 00:47:37.206
material and get the exact

00:47:37.206 --> 00:47:41.046
effect we want to in Dark Mode.

00:47:41.266 --> 00:47:42.856
Now, this isn't the only area

00:47:42.856 --> 00:47:45.076
where we get a unique material

00:47:45.076 --> 00:47:46.366
showing in the background of our

00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:46.516
UI.

00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:48.666
Like Raymond talked about,

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:50.146
there's this desktop tinting

00:47:50.146 --> 00:47:51.596
effect that's shown here in the

00:47:51.596 --> 00:47:52.916
background of our photo gallery.

00:47:53.436 --> 00:47:54.306
We're getting a little bit of

00:47:54.306 --> 00:47:55.396
that blue from that desktop

00:47:55.396 --> 00:47:57.146
behind it, creating this really

00:47:57.146 --> 00:47:58.486
visually harmonious result.

00:47:59.516 --> 00:48:00.836
It's a lot easier to see on top

00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:02.066
of a more vibrant background,

00:48:02.206 --> 00:48:03.686
such as these beautiful flower

00:48:03.686 --> 00:48:04.236
pictures.

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:08.626
There's three different variants

00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:10.806
that have semantics with these

00:48:10.806 --> 00:48:11.866
background materials.

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.436
There's the window backgrounds

00:48:13.436 --> 00:48:14.616
that we see on the backgrounds

00:48:14.616 --> 00:48:16.596
of generic windows; Under Page

00:48:16.596 --> 00:48:18.456
Background, which appears behind

00:48:18.456 --> 00:48:19.676
document areas such as in

00:48:19.676 --> 00:48:20.906
Preview or Keynote.

00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:23.726
And perhaps most commonly is the

00:48:23.726 --> 00:48:25.146
Content Background material,

00:48:25.726 --> 00:48:26.656
which is white in light

00:48:26.656 --> 00:48:28.306
appearance and, of course, dark

00:48:28.306 --> 00:48:29.206
in the dark appearance.

00:48:30.166 --> 00:48:31.216
In fact, all of these are now

00:48:31.216 --> 00:48:32.676
dark in the dark appearance but

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:34.306
also have that wallpaper tinting

00:48:34.366 --> 00:48:36.866
effect.

00:48:36.866 --> 00:48:37.766
The great news is that it's

00:48:37.816 --> 00:48:38.956
really not hard to get these

00:48:38.956 --> 00:48:39.546
effects.

00:48:39.776 --> 00:48:41.086
For the most part, it comes

00:48:41.086 --> 00:48:42.396
completely automatically by

00:48:42.396 --> 00:48:43.496
using system views.

00:48:43.496 --> 00:48:45.076
For instance, the default

00:48:45.076 --> 00:48:47.016
backgrounds of every window has

00:48:47.016 --> 00:48:48.396
that window background material

00:48:48.556 --> 00:48:49.116
built right in.

00:48:50.316 --> 00:48:52.336
In addition, [inaudible] views

00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:54.946
such as NSCollectionView or

00:48:54.946 --> 00:48:57.016
NSTableView also automatically

00:48:57.016 --> 00:48:58.246
come with the content background

00:48:58.246 --> 00:48:59.516
material built right in.

00:49:00.776 --> 00:49:01.776
We've seen a number of places

00:49:01.776 --> 00:49:02.826
across this system that were

00:49:02.826 --> 00:49:04.196
actually able to improve their

00:49:04.196 --> 00:49:05.996
Dark Mode support by deleting an

00:49:05.996 --> 00:49:07.916
override of these default colors

00:49:08.296 --> 00:49:09.186
that these views have.

00:49:10.486 --> 00:49:12.546
If you want to customize beyond

00:49:12.606 --> 00:49:13.816
the default color that these

00:49:13.816 --> 00:49:15.666
views have, you can explicitly

00:49:15.666 --> 00:49:17.556
set a variety of system colors

00:49:17.626 --> 00:49:19.346
as their background color to get

00:49:19.346 --> 00:49:20.926
the exact material effect you

00:49:20.926 --> 00:49:21.216
want.

00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:24.446
One really important note here,

00:49:24.446 --> 00:49:25.986
though, is that if you were to

00:49:25.986 --> 00:49:27.396
read the RGB values of these

00:49:27.396 --> 00:49:29.166
colors, they would not include

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:29.946
the desktop tint.

00:49:30.836 --> 00:49:31.796
This is because, as Raymond

00:49:31.796 --> 00:49:32.816
mentioned, this tint is

00:49:32.816 --> 00:49:33.876
extremely dynamic.

00:49:34.306 --> 00:49:35.606
As you move your window around

00:49:35.606 --> 00:49:36.956
on screen, that's getting

00:49:36.956 --> 00:49:38.596
updated asynchronously to the

00:49:38.596 --> 00:49:40.576
applications rendering itself,

00:49:40.576 --> 00:49:41.536
creating a really nice

00:49:41.536 --> 00:49:43.456
experience as the user is moving

00:49:43.456 --> 00:49:44.336
around windows.

00:49:45.556 --> 00:49:46.886
So, jumping back to Chameleon

00:49:46.886 --> 00:49:48.396
Wrangler, we automatically got

00:49:48.396 --> 00:49:49.976
this content background because

00:49:49.976 --> 00:49:51.226
we just use a stock

00:49:51.226 --> 00:49:52.006
NSCollectionView.

00:49:53.456 --> 00:49:55.006
In the vital section, we got

00:49:55.006 --> 00:49:56.196
that window background material

00:49:56.196 --> 00:49:57.466
showing through because we had

00:49:57.466 --> 00:49:58.996
nothing opaque covering it up.

00:50:00.186 --> 00:50:02.006
However, in our notes section,

00:50:02.326 --> 00:50:03.296
where we have this awesome

00:50:03.296 --> 00:50:05.836
custom stationary, we have a

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.426
light grey background that isn't

00:50:07.426 --> 00:50:08.456
appropriate for Dark Mode and

00:50:08.456 --> 00:50:10.016
hasn't been adjusted with that

00:50:10.016 --> 00:50:11.096
under page semantic.

00:50:11.576 --> 00:50:14.366
We can open up Interface Builder

00:50:14.366 --> 00:50:15.436
and see where we're setting up

00:50:15.436 --> 00:50:17.056
this background drawing view and

00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:18.756
see that, indeed, we are filing

00:50:18.756 --> 00:50:19.976
it with a custom gray color.

00:50:21.006 --> 00:50:23.356
And pretty quickly in IB, we can

00:50:23.356 --> 00:50:24.486
change that to using the Under

00:50:24.486 --> 00:50:25.986
Page Background color that

00:50:25.986 --> 00:50:27.626
represents that semantic and

00:50:27.626 --> 00:50:28.626
immediately see that we'll get

00:50:28.626 --> 00:50:30.696
the right result, making it look

00:50:31.116 --> 00:50:32.286
just at home with the rest of

00:50:32.286 --> 00:50:34.646
the document apps in Dark Mode.

00:50:34.646 --> 00:50:37.516
The next thing that kind of

00:50:37.516 --> 00:50:38.636
stands out here, though, is the

00:50:38.636 --> 00:50:40.156
dark foreground on top of light

00:50:40.156 --> 00:50:42.376
background of our stationary and

00:50:42.376 --> 00:50:43.036
document area.

00:50:43.036 --> 00:50:45.276
And because this is a WYSIWYG

00:50:45.276 --> 00:50:47.206
editor where we, as users of

00:50:47.336 --> 00:50:48.676
Chameleon Wrangler have complete

00:50:48.676 --> 00:50:51.276
control over the colors, images,

00:50:51.276 --> 00:50:53.876
and fonts seen within it, we

00:50:53.876 --> 00:50:55.846
expect this to stay the same as

00:50:55.846 --> 00:50:57.356
a light appearing document.

00:50:58.566 --> 00:50:59.656
However, there are a few subtle

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:01.406
details that don't seem quite

00:51:01.406 --> 00:51:01.696
right.

00:51:01.696 --> 00:51:04.026
For instance, the text highlight

00:51:04.026 --> 00:51:05.436
color is still getting the dark

00:51:05.436 --> 00:51:07.266
variant of the text highlights,

00:51:07.266 --> 00:51:08.546
as well as the autocorrect

00:51:08.546 --> 00:51:09.846
bubbles have the dark

00:51:09.846 --> 00:51:11.376
appearance, which really clashes

00:51:11.376 --> 00:51:12.396
with the light appearance of our

00:51:12.396 --> 00:51:12.866
document.

00:51:13.986 --> 00:51:15.186
We, basically, want to have

00:51:15.186 --> 00:51:16.776
everything in this area revert

00:51:16.776 --> 00:51:18.646
back to the light appearance,

00:51:19.146 --> 00:51:20.696
and we can do that using

00:51:20.756 --> 00:51:22.066
NSAppearance.

00:51:22.406 --> 00:51:23.636
It turns out that NSAppearance

00:51:23.636 --> 00:51:24.636
is what's been providing the

00:51:24.636 --> 00:51:26.466
magic of having light versus

00:51:26.466 --> 00:51:27.786
dark variance automatically

00:51:27.786 --> 00:51:29.306
switch in Dark Mode this whole

00:51:29.306 --> 00:51:29.646
time.

00:51:30.806 --> 00:51:31.746
You can conceptualize

00:51:31.746 --> 00:51:33.396
NSAppearance as a little bundle

00:51:33.816 --> 00:51:35.526
containing all of the colors,

00:51:35.756 --> 00:51:39.176
materials, images, and control

00:51:39.176 --> 00:51:40.486
artwork that you see across the

00:51:40.486 --> 00:51:41.026
system.

00:51:41.626 --> 00:51:44.176
Now, when your application does

00:51:44.176 --> 00:51:45.586
something like request to draw

00:51:45.586 --> 00:51:47.296
with labelColor, what that does

00:51:47.296 --> 00:51:48.476
is it looks up in the current

00:51:48.476 --> 00:51:50.016
appearance for what the exact

00:51:50.016 --> 00:51:51.166
RGB values should be.

00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:53.526
The same is true for control

00:51:53.526 --> 00:51:54.696
artwork or the different

00:51:54.696 --> 00:51:56.266
material effects.

00:51:56.826 --> 00:51:58.996
Now, what's new in Mojave is the

00:51:58.996 --> 00:52:00.546
dark appearance, which our

00:52:00.546 --> 00:52:01.876
designers have meticulously

00:52:01.876 --> 00:52:03.976
crafted with redefining

00:52:03.976 --> 00:52:05.406
everything across the system.

00:52:06.926 --> 00:52:07.886
When the system is running in

00:52:07.886 --> 00:52:09.416
Dark Mode, what happens is that

00:52:09.416 --> 00:52:10.586
the dark appearance gets applied

00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:11.916
to your application instead of

00:52:11.916 --> 00:52:13.306
the light appearance.

00:52:13.406 --> 00:52:14.776
So, when labelColor goes to draw

00:52:14.776 --> 00:52:16.376
itself, it references the dark

00:52:16.376 --> 00:52:18.036
appearance as white value

00:52:18.076 --> 00:52:19.146
instead of the light appearance

00:52:19.146 --> 00:52:19.866
as darker value.

00:52:20.716 --> 00:52:21.666
The same is true for all of

00:52:21.666 --> 00:52:22.526
those materials.

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:24.916
And these aren't the only

00:52:25.006 --> 00:52:26.376
materials in the system.

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:27.856
Right, these aren't the only

00:52:27.856 --> 00:52:28.836
appearances in the system.

00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:30.466
There are also the high contrast

00:52:30.466 --> 00:52:32.216
appearances, which get used when

00:52:32.216 --> 00:52:33.486
the accessibility high contrast

00:52:33.486 --> 00:52:35.046
setting is turned on, these will

00:52:35.046 --> 00:52:36.266
get applied to your application

00:52:36.266 --> 00:52:36.666
instead.

00:52:36.726 --> 00:52:38.906
And there's actually even more.

00:52:39.316 --> 00:52:40.026
There are the vibrant

00:52:40.026 --> 00:52:40.976
appearances that, again,

00:52:40.976 --> 00:52:42.366
completely redefine all of these

00:52:42.366 --> 00:52:44.536
colors that appear in sidebars

00:52:44.536 --> 00:52:45.416
and titlebars.

00:52:45.946 --> 00:52:48.046
And the advanced Dark Mode talk

00:52:48.046 --> 00:52:49.106
is going to go into more detail

00:52:49.106 --> 00:52:50.156
about how you can effectively

00:52:50.156 --> 00:52:51.746
use the assets that come out of

00:52:51.746 --> 00:52:53.216
those vibrant appearances to

00:52:53.216 --> 00:52:54.336
really make them stand out.

00:52:55.986 --> 00:52:59.706
Now, by default, the appearance

00:52:59.706 --> 00:53:01.196
of your application will follow

00:53:01.196 --> 00:53:01.686
the system.

00:53:02.336 --> 00:53:03.386
However, you can explicitly

00:53:03.386 --> 00:53:04.536
override it by setting the

00:53:04.536 --> 00:53:05.706
appearance property to whatever

00:53:05.706 --> 00:53:06.076
you want.

00:53:06.496 --> 00:53:08.196
So, here we have Chameleon

00:53:08.196 --> 00:53:09.496
Wrangler in Light and Dark Mode,

00:53:10.306 --> 00:53:11.536
and we can see it's following

00:53:11.536 --> 00:53:12.956
the system, but as soon as we

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:14.066
set its appearance to always be

00:53:14.066 --> 00:53:15.716
darkAqua, we can see it's always

00:53:15.716 --> 00:53:16.876
getting that dark appearance.

00:53:17.716 --> 00:53:19.326
The inverse is true by setting

00:53:19.326 --> 00:53:21.266
the explicitly light appearance,

00:53:21.266 --> 00:53:22.246
and, of course, setting it back

00:53:22.246 --> 00:53:23.756
to nil will have it return back

00:53:23.756 --> 00:53:25.126
to the default behavior of

00:53:25.126 --> 00:53:25.926
following the system.

00:53:27.746 --> 00:53:28.996
Now, we know that after a lot of

00:53:29.036 --> 00:53:30.766
you see your apps running in

00:53:30.766 --> 00:53:32.296
Dark Mode, you're going to be

00:53:32.296 --> 00:53:33.916
really tempted to have your app

00:53:34.216 --> 00:53:35.466
always be dark, because it's

00:53:35.466 --> 00:53:36.446
just going to look so good.

00:53:37.586 --> 00:53:39.246
But like Raymond mentioned, it's

00:53:39.246 --> 00:53:40.666
really important to keep in mind

00:53:40.666 --> 00:53:42.136
"When it is appropriate to have

00:53:42.136 --> 00:53:43.686
an always dark app?"

00:53:44.336 --> 00:53:45.586
This should be generally

00:53:45.586 --> 00:53:47.326
reserved for very media focused

00:53:47.326 --> 00:53:49.036
apps like QuickTime player or

00:53:49.036 --> 00:53:50.446
professional color-sensitive

00:53:50.446 --> 00:53:51.766
workflow apps, where it's

00:53:51.766 --> 00:53:53.146
important to eliminate all of

00:53:53.146 --> 00:53:54.546
the light behind the content.

00:53:55.586 --> 00:53:56.476
And, in general, it should be

00:53:56.476 --> 00:53:57.916
left up to a choice for the

00:53:57.916 --> 00:53:58.356
user.

00:53:59.546 --> 00:54:00.536
So, in general, this is the

00:54:00.536 --> 00:54:01.506
system preference.

00:54:01.716 --> 00:54:02.926
Some of you maybe already have a

00:54:02.926 --> 00:54:04.086
dark theme for your application

00:54:04.086 --> 00:54:05.476
controlled via app preference,

00:54:05.526 --> 00:54:06.796
so your first step would be to

00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:07.916
tie that back to the system

00:54:07.916 --> 00:54:10.156
preference so the people using

00:54:10.156 --> 00:54:11.426
the system can have a consistent

00:54:11.426 --> 00:54:12.786
experience.

00:54:13.366 --> 00:54:15.056
And in some ambiguous cases like

00:54:15.056 --> 00:54:16.286
Raymond mentioned, there may be

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.356
some additional need for an

00:54:17.356 --> 00:54:18.566
in-app preference, such as in

00:54:18.566 --> 00:54:20.296
the mail case, but for the most

00:54:20.296 --> 00:54:21.606
part, the system preference

00:54:21.606 --> 00:54:23.456
should be exactly what users go

00:54:23.456 --> 00:54:23.706
for.

00:54:23.706 --> 00:54:26.466
If you do decide you need to

00:54:26.516 --> 00:54:27.876
have an always dark application,

00:54:28.096 --> 00:54:29.276
it's really important to not to

00:54:29.276 --> 00:54:30.486
use the Vibrant Dark appearance

00:54:30.486 --> 00:54:31.926
on the entire window, because

00:54:31.926 --> 00:54:33.196
that's not appropriate for the

00:54:33.196 --> 00:54:35.416
opaque window areas of the

00:54:35.416 --> 00:54:37.136
application and are really only

00:54:37.136 --> 00:54:38.266
intended for sidebars.

00:54:39.316 --> 00:54:40.226
Instead, you want to use the

00:54:40.226 --> 00:54:41.866
Dark Aqua appearance if you want

00:54:41.866 --> 00:54:43.746
to have that always dark look.

00:54:44.596 --> 00:54:46.096
In addition to be able to be set

00:54:46.096 --> 00:54:47.626
on the window as a whole, you

00:54:47.626 --> 00:54:49.046
can also set it on an individual

00:54:49.046 --> 00:54:50.276
window or view scoping, and

00:54:50.626 --> 00:54:51.826
that's inherited by all of the

00:54:51.866 --> 00:54:52.856
views contained within it.

00:54:53.626 --> 00:54:55.086
For instance, here, we're

00:54:55.086 --> 00:54:56.506
setting the sidebar to always

00:54:56.506 --> 00:54:58.736
have the darkAqua appearance if

00:54:58.736 --> 00:54:59.506
we want to experiment with

00:54:59.506 --> 00:55:00.176
something like that.

00:55:00.596 --> 00:55:01.966
And all of the text and images

00:55:01.966 --> 00:55:03.646
within that also get that dark

00:55:03.646 --> 00:55:05.946
styling, but we can also use

00:55:05.946 --> 00:55:07.356
this to fix the problem we had

00:55:07.356 --> 00:55:08.916
before with our text area.

00:55:09.876 --> 00:55:11.786
We can see here that we actually

00:55:11.786 --> 00:55:13.316
want this entire document area

00:55:13.386 --> 00:55:14.486
to remain having a light

00:55:14.486 --> 00:55:16.086
appearance, and so by setting

00:55:16.086 --> 00:55:17.536
the lightAqua appearance, we can

00:55:17.536 --> 00:55:18.406
make sure that the text

00:55:18.406 --> 00:55:19.826
highlighting color gets the

00:55:19.826 --> 00:55:21.426
correct appearance as well as

00:55:21.426 --> 00:55:22.466
the autocorrect bubble

00:55:22.676 --> 00:55:24.196
inheriting that light appearance

00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:24.556
as well.

00:55:26.606 --> 00:55:27.546
However, in addition to be able

00:55:27.546 --> 00:55:28.756
to be used for some really cool

00:55:28.756 --> 00:55:30.426
effects, it can also lead to

00:55:30.426 --> 00:55:31.966
some hard-to-debug situations.

00:55:31.966 --> 00:55:34.386
For instance, here, we're using

00:55:34.386 --> 00:55:35.336
the vibrantLight appearance

00:55:35.336 --> 00:55:36.656
explicitly on our table view,

00:55:36.656 --> 00:55:38.546
and that looks perfectly fine in

00:55:38.546 --> 00:55:39.786
the light appearance, where it's

00:55:39.786 --> 00:55:41.366
actually already inheriting the

00:55:41.366 --> 00:55:43.546
vibrantLight appearance.

00:55:43.546 --> 00:55:44.806
In Dark Mode, this quickly

00:55:44.806 --> 00:55:46.586
becomes a very visible problem.

00:55:47.226 --> 00:55:48.426
We can see that the text and

00:55:48.426 --> 00:55:49.866
images inside that table view

00:55:49.866 --> 00:55:50.876
are now inheriting that

00:55:50.876 --> 00:55:52.636
vibrantLight appearance and look

00:55:52.636 --> 00:55:53.936
bad on top of that dark

00:55:53.936 --> 00:55:54.356
background.

00:55:54.356 --> 00:55:56.386
So, for the most part, we just

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:57.516
want to remove these explicit

00:55:57.516 --> 00:55:59.126
overrides in places where we

00:55:59.186 --> 00:56:00.776
really do not intend to have an

00:56:00.776 --> 00:56:01.986
always light appearance.

00:56:03.426 --> 00:56:04.416
This can also happen in

00:56:04.416 --> 00:56:06.116
Interface Builder, where, at the

00:56:06.116 --> 00:56:07.606
very bottom of the Attributes

00:56:07.606 --> 00:56:09.196
Inspector, we've accidentally

00:56:09.196 --> 00:56:11.006
overridden the appearance for

00:56:11.156 --> 00:56:12.656
our outline view to always be

00:56:12.656 --> 00:56:14.696
the light Aqua appearance.

00:56:14.696 --> 00:56:15.856
Here, the fix is simply to

00:56:15.856 --> 00:56:18.796
change it back to the inherited

00:56:18.796 --> 00:56:20.196
style so that it can make sure

00:56:20.196 --> 00:56:21.786
to follow Dark Mode when that's

00:56:21.786 --> 00:56:23.786
turned on, so do be sure to

00:56:23.786 --> 00:56:24.736
check for all of those.

00:56:26.176 --> 00:56:28.476
At this point, Chameleon

00:56:28.476 --> 00:56:29.956
Wrangler's looking really great

00:56:29.956 --> 00:56:30.686
in Dark Mode.

00:56:31.896 --> 00:56:33.226
But kind of an understated thing

00:56:33.226 --> 00:56:35.546
here is that, at this point,

00:56:35.686 --> 00:56:37.366
we've written 0 lines of code

00:56:37.566 --> 00:56:38.876
specific to Dark Mode.

00:56:40.116 --> 00:56:41.436
The types of changes necessary

00:56:41.436 --> 00:56:42.556
for being a great Dark Mode

00:56:42.556 --> 00:56:44.706
citizen is that you need to make

00:56:44.706 --> 00:56:46.756
sure to express the ideas

00:56:46.756 --> 00:56:48.556
semantically rather than

00:56:48.556 --> 00:56:49.006
literally.

00:56:49.306 --> 00:56:52.926
So, for instance, these same

00:56:52.926 --> 00:56:54.156
sets of changes allowed our

00:56:54.156 --> 00:56:56.686
application to not only look

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.966
great in Dark Mode but also in

00:56:58.966 --> 00:57:00.386
the light appearance.

00:57:00.786 --> 00:57:01.976
Adding support for things like

00:57:01.976 --> 00:57:03.416
the accent color as well as

00:57:03.416 --> 00:57:04.616
making our label colors more

00:57:04.616 --> 00:57:05.756
consistent with the rest of the

00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:06.146
system.

00:57:07.436 --> 00:57:09.246
Further, these same sets of

00:57:09.246 --> 00:57:11.196
changes needed to be great in

00:57:11.196 --> 00:57:13.446
Dark Mode are also the same sets

00:57:13.446 --> 00:57:15.146
of changes needed to have great

00:57:15.146 --> 00:57:16.906
support for the high contrast

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.056
accessibility setting.

00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:20.916
So, to reiterate what those

00:57:20.916 --> 00:57:22.436
steps were, the first and

00:57:22.436 --> 00:57:24.166
foremost was linking on the

00:57:24.166 --> 00:57:27.636
10.14 SDK using Xcode 10.

00:57:27.636 --> 00:57:29.536
For a handful of apps that

00:57:29.536 --> 00:57:30.966
already use system controls and

00:57:30.966 --> 00:57:32.986
system colors, this is the only

00:57:32.986 --> 00:57:34.026
step that's going to be needed,

00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:35.476
and it's already going to look

00:57:35.476 --> 00:57:36.306
great in Dark Mode.

00:57:36.846 --> 00:57:38.646
For the rest of us, the next

00:57:38.646 --> 00:57:40.536
step is to audit our app for the

00:57:40.536 --> 00:57:42.056
use of static colors,

00:57:42.736 --> 00:57:44.506
non-template images, and

00:57:44.666 --> 00:57:46.376
nonsemantic materials, and

00:57:46.376 --> 00:57:47.526
replace those as appropriate.

00:57:47.526 --> 00:57:49.396
For instance, this might be

00:57:49.396 --> 00:57:51.276
using a system color, a semantic

00:57:51.276 --> 00:57:53.216
material, or, in some cases,

00:57:53.216 --> 00:57:54.686
defining a custom asset catalog

00:57:54.686 --> 00:57:55.686
color or image.

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.416
And, again, it's important to

00:57:57.416 --> 00:57:58.326
keep an eye out for those

00:57:58.326 --> 00:58:00.216
accidental appearance overrides.

00:58:01.676 --> 00:58:02.676
The advanced Dark Mode talk is

00:58:02.676 --> 00:58:03.636
going to go into a lot more

00:58:03.636 --> 00:58:05.606
detail here, including how to

00:58:05.926 --> 00:58:07.636
correctly use NSAppearance, how

00:58:07.636 --> 00:58:09.376
to do custom drawing and effects

00:58:09.456 --> 00:58:11.426
within NSVisualEffectView, how

00:58:11.426 --> 00:58:12.526
to make sure all of the myriad

00:58:12.526 --> 00:58:13.716
of ways you might be drawing

00:58:13.716 --> 00:58:15.526
custom views work correctly in

00:58:15.526 --> 00:58:15.996
Dark Mode.

00:58:16.386 --> 00:58:19.076
Some tips and tricks for using

00:58:19.076 --> 00:58:20.146
View Debugger and Interface

00:58:20.146 --> 00:58:21.396
Builder to really polish your

00:58:21.396 --> 00:58:21.566
app.

00:58:22.186 --> 00:58:24.136
And because we know that a lot

00:58:24.136 --> 00:58:25.906
of you and your apps' fans are

00:58:25.906 --> 00:58:26.776
really going to be wanting to

00:58:26.776 --> 00:58:28.006
have Dark Mode as soon as

00:58:28.006 --> 00:58:29.696
possible, we want to make sure

00:58:29.696 --> 00:58:30.806
you can do that without

00:58:30.806 --> 00:58:32.336
sacrificing how far you can back

00:58:32.366 --> 00:58:32.736
deploy.

00:58:33.016 --> 00:58:34.716
So, in general, a lot of these

00:58:34.716 --> 00:58:35.846
features are available for a

00:58:35.886 --> 00:58:37.866
year or more, but the advanced

00:58:37.866 --> 00:58:38.876
talk is going to go into details

00:58:38.876 --> 00:58:39.856
about how to take that even

00:58:39.856 --> 00:58:40.486
further back.

00:58:41.096 --> 00:58:44.266
We have a few Cocoa Labs, but I

00:58:44.266 --> 00:58:45.226
also really want to point out

00:58:45.226 --> 00:58:46.356
the Dark Mode Lab, where, in

00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:47.746
addition to engineering support,

00:58:48.196 --> 00:58:49.416
Raymond and other members of the

00:58:49.416 --> 00:58:50.446
design team will be there to

00:58:50.446 --> 00:58:51.896
help answer any design questions

00:58:51.896 --> 00:58:52.686
you might have, as well.

00:58:52.746 --> 00:58:54.066
So, that's a really special

00:58:54.066 --> 00:58:55.476
treat that I encourage you to

00:58:55.476 --> 00:58:55.996
take a look at.

00:58:55.996 --> 00:58:58.826
Thanks for staying until 6:00

00:58:58.826 --> 00:59:00.596
today, and have a great rest of

00:59:00.596 --> 00:59:01.246
the WWDC.
