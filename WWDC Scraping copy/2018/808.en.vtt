00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:21.456
>> Thanks, Mike.

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:23.536
Hey everyone.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:25.916
How many of you're interested in

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:26.156
AR?

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:28.106
All right.

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.326
Cool. Now how many of you have

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:31.606
an AR app in the App Store

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:31.936
already?

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:34.876
Okay. A few less.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:37.726
I get it. AR can be pretty

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:38.276
intimidating.

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.716
Well, today we're going to look

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:42.466
at a few techniques that we use

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:44.516
which will hopefully help you in

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:45.006
two ways.

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:47.246
First, they're going to

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.886
hopefully help make AR more

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:52.346
approachable and second, we're

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:53.256
going to show you how you can

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:55.106
save time and money by making

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:56.246
sure you build the right things

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:58.386
before you write a single line

00:00:58.496 --> 00:00:59.306
of code.

00:01:00.286 --> 00:01:01.296
So let's get started.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.186
If you've seen previous talks by

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:07.766
my team here at WWDC, you may

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.896
already be familiar with our

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:11.726
revolutionary app Toast Modern,

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:14.626
the best app for finding and

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.096
rating the toast around you.

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:17.516
I know it's amazing.

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:20.436
Well, we've been building up our

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:22.976
database of toast, and now we've

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:24.836
been tasked with adding AR to

00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:26.826
this app.

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:28.206
I'm sure you're all aware that

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:29.586
the artisanal toast scene in the

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:31.146
Bay Area it's pretty big right

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:31.416
now.

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:35.666
Well, today it's going to get a

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:36.846
whole lot bigger.

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:42.196
Introducing ToastAR, the world's

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:46.036
first AR toast recognition and

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:46.896
rating app.

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:48.346
I know. Thank you.

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:48.926
Thank you.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.776
Through the use of computer

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:55.076
vision and AR, ToastAR lets you

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:56.556
check the ratings on a piece of

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:58.686
toast and get this, where it's

00:01:58.686 --> 00:01:59.026
from.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.106
Revolutionary I know.

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.136
I mean, you're all developers

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:04.296
for Apple platforms so you

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.716
expect the best APIs and the

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:07.926
best hardware.

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:09.726
Why not also expect only the

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:10.606
best toast too.

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.246
So how did we prototype this

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:14.996
beautiful, revolutionary app?

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:17.276
Well, you may think we used a

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:20.426
programming language like Swift

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:24.786
or a framework like ARKit or

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:26.376
maybe even a sophisticated

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:27.736
application such as Unity.

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:29.946
These are all valid ways to

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:31.796
prototype, but they're not the

00:02:31.796 --> 00:02:32.516
only solution.

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:37.276
Sometimes you can use low-tech

00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:38.736
physical prototyping techniques

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:40.226
to work through your design

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.616
problems before you write a

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:42.436
single line of code.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.046
So today I'm going to show you

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:46.646
how you can use just the camera

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:53.026
app and the world around you to

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:54.976
prototype for AR just like we

00:02:54.976 --> 00:02:55.696
did for ToastAR.

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:57.586
So before we get started,

00:02:57.586 --> 00:02:58.546
there's two terms you should be

00:02:58.546 --> 00:02:59.646
familiar with.

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:03.076
First world space.

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:04.976
When we talk about world space,

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.566
we're talking about design

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:08.886
elements in the world around you

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:09.576
and your device.

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:13.066
And when we talk about screen

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:14.846
space, we're talking about these

00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:16.466
elements on the screen of your

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:16.796
device.

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:20.216
So let's take a look at the

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.376
original design we got for

00:03:21.376 --> 00:03:22.616
ToastAR and work through our

00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:23.206
process.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:28.456
In this design, we have a label

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.446
in world space which shows us

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:32.466
where the toast is from and its

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:33.006
current rating.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.916
Now, you may want to jump in and

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.196
start coding this immediately.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.726
It looks pretty simple, but

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:40.366
instead we're going to save time

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:42.336
and money by making sure we are

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:43.746
building only the right things

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.426
before we write a single line of

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:46.606
code.

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:49.166
AR is about the world around

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:49.326
you.

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.386
So testing out your designs is

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.166
difficult through a single still

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.046
or even video.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.816
Physical prototyping, however,

00:03:58.046 --> 00:03:59.446
allows us to do this in an

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.516
approachable, low-tech and

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:02.646
highly-iterative manner.

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:05.256
So how did we get started here?

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.816
Well, we printed out our labels

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.366
and stuck them to some

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:10.946
toothpicks.

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:13.326
I know. I know.

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:15.796
It may seem odd, but this

00:04:15.796 --> 00:04:17.736
low-tech process is going to

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:19.255
hopefully help us in three ways.

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:22.106
First, we're going to be testing

00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:23.616
our designs in context.

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:25.776
Remember, AR is about the world

00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:26.146
around you.

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:29.256
Second, we're going to hopefully

00:04:29.256 --> 00:04:30.656
figure out any issues with our

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.586
design before we write a single

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:34.686
line of code.

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:37.246
And third, through this process,

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:39.206
hopefully we'll get new ideas

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:41.136
that will help make ToastAR even

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.116
better.

00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:44.646
But who even has a printer these

00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:45.196
days, right?

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:48.656
You can even just draw something

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:51.206
and cut it out.

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:54.476
So now that we have our labels

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:55.896
attached to our toothpicks,

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:57.336
well, we stick them in a piece

00:04:57.336 --> 00:04:57.756
of toast.

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.306
Then, just using the camera app,

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:02.756
we can test this design out in

00:05:02.756 --> 00:05:03.346
world space.

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:07.886
I know. Revolutionary here,

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:07.976
right?

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.796
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:13.636
When we tried this, we learned

00:05:13.636 --> 00:05:14.796
one thing really quickly.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.426
These labels, at an angle, are

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:18.086
pretty difficult to read.

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:20.126
So the label is hard to read at

00:05:20.126 --> 00:05:20.646
an angle.

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:23.266
Maybe we should have it always

00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:23.976
face the camera.

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:26.226
So let's try this out.

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:29.626
So with some help from a

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:31.606
co-worker and some extremely

00:05:31.646 --> 00:05:34.096
sophisticated hardware, okay,

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:35.836
it's a clear ruler but

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:37.076
beautiful.

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:39.326
We tested this out.

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:41.496
And we found that yes, the label

00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:42.846
is easier to read when it's

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:43.766
always facing the camera.

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:46.436
Well, this behavior is commonly

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:47.726
referred to as billboarding.

00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:49.256
And it seems like it'd be pretty

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:51.056
easy to implement in SceneKit

00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:52.916
using an SCNBillboardConstraint.

00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:55.746
But before we start coding this,

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.296
let's continue to test this

00:05:57.296 --> 00:05:58.866
design and make sure we're only

00:05:58.866 --> 00:05:59.726
building the right things.

00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:01.866
So how does the label work when

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:03.386
there's a lot more text or when

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:04.196
it's at a distance?

00:06:04.436 --> 00:06:05.456
Well, we can try this out pretty

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.706
easily too.

00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:09.416
Again, with the camera app, we

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:11.636
can test this out and we find

00:06:11.636 --> 00:06:12.806
that yes, it's a little

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:13.956
difficult to read when these

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:14.986
labels are at a distance.

00:06:15.456 --> 00:06:16.316
Maybe we should bring these

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:17.416
labels on the screen.

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:20.526
So how do we prototype this?

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:24.226
Well, we're talking about screen

00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:25.566
space, and we want to do this

00:06:25.566 --> 00:06:25.796
quickly.

00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:26.996
So we're going to go ahead and

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:27.656
use Keynote.

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:30.666
First, we're going to record a

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:34.786
video of our toast.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:36.136
We'll record a slow pan.

00:06:36.136 --> 00:06:38.346
And notice that we're going to

00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:40.106
pause on the toast to give our

00:06:40.106 --> 00:06:41.486
upcoming animation some time.

00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:46.456
Next, we're going to bring this

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:47.706
into Keynote.

00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:50.796
So you'll create a custom

00:06:50.796 --> 00:06:52.516
document size which matches the

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:53.576
device you're eventually going

00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:58.046
to put this on and then simply

00:06:58.046 --> 00:06:59.596
import your video and bring it

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:00.086
into Keynote.

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:06.136
Third, we're going to animate

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:10.096
our labeling, import our design,

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:12.846
add a move action, give it an

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:15.156
appropriate duration, and move

00:07:15.156 --> 00:07:16.626
it to the desired destination.

00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:21.146
Now here's the important part.

00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:22.356
We're going to check the build

00:07:22.356 --> 00:07:24.286
order and make sure our video

00:07:24.286 --> 00:07:25.956
and our animation begin at the

00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:28.036
same time but we're giving the

00:07:28.036 --> 00:07:30.136
animation a delay so it's on

00:07:30.226 --> 00:07:31.836
screen when the toast is in the

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:32.356
field of view.

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:36.616
Finally, we're going to put this

00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:38.296
on a device and test it out in

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:38.936
context.

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:43.836
So we'll put it on a device

00:07:43.966 --> 00:07:45.086
using Keynote for iOS.

00:07:45.086 --> 00:07:46.616
And we'll test this out in

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:47.136
context.

00:07:50.076 --> 00:07:52.326
Great. Looks like we could fit

00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:53.386
all the text we need on this

00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:53.676
label.

00:07:53.716 --> 00:07:55.896
And putting this on screen space

00:07:55.896 --> 00:07:57.446
will hopefully make it easier to

00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:58.716
expand the scope of this label

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:01.566
at a future date.

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:03.036
Now let's see how this scales,

00:08:03.036 --> 00:08:03.196
though.

00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:03.836
What happens when there's

00:08:03.836 --> 00:08:05.166
multiple pieces of toast in the

00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:05.686
field of view?

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.636
So using the same techniques,

00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:09.646
we'll try this out too.

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:15.426
Now the problem here is when

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:16.606
there's multiple pieces of toast

00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:18.966
in the field of view, I have no

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:20.056
idea which piece of toast I'm

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:22.416
currently interacting with.

00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:24.036
Maybe I should try putting an

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:27.266
indicator in world space so that

00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:28.516
I know which piece of toast I'm

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:29.456
currently interacting with.

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:30.956
Well, we can try this out too,

00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:31.546
quickly.

00:08:34.316 --> 00:08:35.756
So, again, with some help from

00:08:35.756 --> 00:08:37.176
our co-worker and our trusty

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:39.336
ruler, we can try this out too.

00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:41.346
Print out our design, attach it

00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:42.936
to the ruler, and try this out.

00:08:43.316 --> 00:08:44.796
It's the camera app world space.

00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:47.436
This seems to help us.

00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:48.726
We know which piece of toast

00:08:48.756 --> 00:08:49.766
we're currently interacting

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:50.426
with.

00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:54.016
So let's put it all together.

00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:56.666
Using the techniques we just

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:58.326
reviewed, we can put together a

00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:00.136
rough demo of our prototype.

00:09:00.136 --> 00:09:01.906
And when we know we're building

00:09:01.906 --> 00:09:06.036
the right things, we now know we

00:09:06.036 --> 00:09:07.296
have some high-fidelity

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.296
prototypes to base our code off

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:11.736
of.

00:09:11.946 --> 00:09:13.656
In just a few hours, we worked

00:09:13.656 --> 00:09:14.896
through problems that could have

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:18.256
taken us days to code through.

00:09:18.486 --> 00:09:19.326
So what did we learn?

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.586
Well, we learned these labels in

00:09:20.586 --> 00:09:21.916
world space are difficult to

00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:23.586
read at an angle and at a

00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:25.276
distance, so we brought them on

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:25.846
screen.

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:29.106
But we also learned that we

00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:30.436
needed indicators in world space

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:31.716
to let the user know what

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:32.806
they're currently interacting

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:32.976
with.

00:09:38.836 --> 00:09:40.636
Physical prototyping allowed us

00:09:40.636 --> 00:09:42.426
to test these AR experiences out

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:43.186
quickly.

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:46.576
We used the camera app to test

00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:48.006
our world space interactions.

00:09:49.336 --> 00:09:50.916
And we used Keynote to test out

00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:52.236
our screen space interactions.

00:09:52.236 --> 00:09:54.956
So how did prototyping help us?

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:58.276
Well, we tested our ideas, and

00:09:58.276 --> 00:09:59.136
now we're going to be saving

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:01.056
time and money by making sure we

00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:02.406
build the right things before we

00:10:02.406 --> 00:10:08.816
write a single line of code.

00:10:09.016 --> 00:10:10.496
We also got some new ideas along

00:10:10.496 --> 00:10:11.116
the process.

00:10:11.616 --> 00:10:13.216
These ideas helped make ToastAR

00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:13.766
even better.

00:10:13.766 --> 00:10:16.366
And take it from me, it's pretty

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:16.746
amazing.

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:20.506
Hopefully when you start working

00:10:20.506 --> 00:10:22.336
on your next project, you now

00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:25.406
have a few new tools when you

00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:27.836
tackle your next AR app.

00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:28.976
Thank you so much.
