Here is the stage for a truly

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:42.866
remarkable natural occurrence.

00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:46.896
Every year, a great migration is

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:49.336
made by one of the world's most

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:50.466
mysterious species.

Eleven and a half months of

For most, this momentous

for a select few the pilgrimage

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.546

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:41.536
Originating in the remote

putting the customer at the

00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:30.096
center of everything that we

00:09:30.096 --> 00:09:30.786
design.

00:09:31.706 --> 00:09:34.526
Every year, we deliver a major

00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:37.466
iOS update that brings awesome

00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:40.316
new features that will impact

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:41.246
the world.

00:09:42.076 --> 00:09:43.446
To tell you all about what we

00:09:43.446 --> 00:09:45.566
had planned for this year, I'd

00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:46.956
like to introduce Craig

00:09:46.956 --> 00:09:47.846
Frederique [phonetic].

00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:47.976
Craig.

[ Applause ]

00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:52.666
>> Hey, good morning.

00:09:53.516 --> 00:09:55.656
[ Applause ]

00:09:56.156 --> 00:09:56.566
All right.

00:09:59.396 --> 00:10:02.866
The next release of iOS is, you

00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:05.086
guessed it, iOS 12.

00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:08.416
Now, our customers, of course,

00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:10.936
are going to receive iOS 12 as a

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:12.786
free software update.

00:10:13.326 --> 00:10:15.296
Now, it's easy to forget now,

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:17.456
but iOS pioneered this approach

00:10:17.506 --> 00:10:18.816
of helping you get more out of

00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:20.476
the device you already own

00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:21.826
through free updates.

00:10:22.236 --> 00:10:23.116
And some of those updates have

00:10:23.116 --> 00:10:24.466
been really quite profound.

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:27.116
Like the App Store, giving us a

00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:29.116
whole new way to discover and

00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:29.946
download apps.

00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:31.866
It itself was delivered via

00:10:31.906 --> 00:10:33.666
software update, as were the

00:10:33.776 --> 00:10:35.546
folders we used to organize

00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:36.196
those apps.

00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:38.076
And can you imagine living

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:41.026
without Find My iPhone or

00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:42.786
iMessage with its end-to-end

00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:44.796
securely encrypted messaging.

00:10:44.796 --> 00:10:47.196
Or the revolution in iPad

00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:49.356
productivity with Slide Over,

00:10:49.356 --> 00:10:52.586
Split View, and Drag and Drop,

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:54.806
or AR, changing the way we

00:10:54.806 --> 00:10:56.426
interact with the world around

00:10:56.426 --> 00:10:58.666
us, all delivered via software

00:10:58.666 --> 00:10:59.176
updates.

00:10:59.176 --> 00:11:00.516
And of course we want to get

00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:02.306
these improvements to as many of

00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:03.766
our customers as possible.

00:11:04.236 --> 00:11:06.366
IOS 11 supports devices that

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:07.856
were introduced as far back as

00:11:07.856 --> 00:11:11.676
2013, like the iPhone 5S.

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:13.566
And we just love the way

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:15.916
customers race to update to our

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:16.876
newest releases.

00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:19.136
In fact, half of our customers

00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:22.426
upgraded to iOS 11 in just seven

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:22.686
weeks.

00:11:22.836 --> 00:11:23.976
It's incredible.

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:27.916
[ Applause ]

00:11:28.416 --> 00:11:31.596
Now as we stand here today, 81

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:33.756
percent of our over a billion

00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:35.706
active iOS devices are running

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:36.896
our latest release.

00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:39.406
And now, when you look at the

00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:42.256
competition, well it's hard to

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:43.566
say they really have a software

00:11:43.566 --> 00:11:43.966
update model.

00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:48.646
[ Applause ]

00:11:49.146 --> 00:11:51.496
So iOS has the fastest adoption

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:52.906
of any operating system, but

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:55.126
what's much more important to us

00:11:55.426 --> 00:11:57.256
is customer satisfaction, and

00:11:57.256 --> 00:11:58.696
we're thrilled to report that

00:11:58.696 --> 00:12:01.786
customer sat for iOS 11 is at 95

00:12:01.786 --> 00:12:01.976
percent.

[ Applause ]

00:12:07.156 --> 00:12:09.406
Now, delivering all of these

00:12:09.446 --> 00:12:10.976
features across such a wide

00:12:11.086 --> 00:12:12.506
range of devices will

00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:14.386
maintaining high performance is

00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:15.976
a challenge we take really

00:12:15.976 --> 00:12:19.506
seriously, and so for iOS 12, we

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:21.546
are doubling down on

00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:22.356
performance.

00:12:28.726 --> 00:12:30.386
We're working top to bottom

00:12:30.446 --> 00:12:32.396
making improvements, to make

00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:33.906
your device faster and more

00:12:33.906 --> 00:12:35.936
responsive, and because we want

00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:37.386
these changes to be available to

00:12:37.386 --> 00:12:39.326
the full range of our customers,

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:41.996
iOS 12 will be available on all

00:12:41.996 --> 00:12:43.976
the same devices as iOS 11.

00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:47.736
[ Applause ]

00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:50.276
This is the largest base ever

00:12:50.276 --> 00:12:52.786
supported by an Apple release,

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.526
and we're focusing our efforts

00:12:54.526 --> 00:12:57.036
especially on the oldest

00:12:57.036 --> 00:12:57.736
devices.

00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:00.376
And while it's still early days,

00:13:00.376 --> 00:13:01.996
we're really pleased with some

00:13:01.996 --> 00:13:03.146
of the results we're seeing.

00:13:03.336 --> 00:13:04.306
And so I'd like to share some

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:04.616
with you.

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.486
And I'm going to use an example

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:07.966
of a popular phone from a few

00:13:07.966 --> 00:13:08.556
years ago.

00:13:08.646 --> 00:13:10.466
This is the iPhone 6Plus.

00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:13.086
Now on that device, iOS 12

00:13:13.086 --> 00:13:13.966
delivers a number of

00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:15.096
improvements across common

00:13:15.096 --> 00:13:15.826
operations.

00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:17.846
You'll see that apps launch up

00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:19.306
to 40 percent faster.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.136
The keyboard can come up up to

00:13:21.246 --> 00:13:22.966
50 percent faster, and you can

00:13:22.966 --> 00:13:25.206
slide to take a photo at up to

00:13:25.206 --> 00:13:26.726
70 percent faster.

[ Applause ]

00:13:33.276 --> 00:13:35.176
Now our deepest focus this year

00:13:35.176 --> 00:13:37.306
is optimizing the system when

00:13:37.306 --> 00:13:38.576
it's under load, and that's

00:13:38.576 --> 00:13:39.546
where you need performance the

00:13:39.546 --> 00:13:41.856
most and where iOS 12 really

00:13:41.856 --> 00:13:42.436
shines.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:44.826
Now, we've put iOS 12 through

00:13:44.826 --> 00:13:46.936
our stress test, and we saw in

00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:48.836
those conditions Share Sheet

00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:51.086
coming up twice as fast and apps

00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:53.436
launching twice as fast.

00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:55.526
These are big, big improvements.

00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.496
Now this took changes-- thank

00:13:57.496 --> 00:13:57.986
you very much.

00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:00.696
This took improvements in many,

00:14:00.696 --> 00:14:01.986
many places in the system, and I

00:14:01.986 --> 00:14:03.156
want to highlight just one.

00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:04.936
And it starts with the silicon.

00:14:05.346 --> 00:14:06.346
You know, our tight

00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:08.736
collaboration with our chip team

00:14:08.996 --> 00:14:10.966
has enabled us to optimize iOS

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:12.906
across the full range of our A

00:14:12.906 --> 00:14:14.296
series silicon.

00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:17.086
Now CPUs traditionally respond

00:14:17.186 --> 00:14:18.496
to increased demand for

00:14:18.496 --> 00:14:20.856
performance by slowly ramping up

00:14:20.856 --> 00:14:21.776
their clock speed.

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:24.076
Well now on IOS 12, we're much

00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:24.766
smarter.

00:14:24.946 --> 00:14:26.646
When we detect that you need a

00:14:26.646 --> 00:14:27.816
burst of performance, like when

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:29.516
you begin scrolling or launching

00:14:29.646 --> 00:14:32.116
an app, we ramp up processor

00:14:32.116 --> 00:14:33.696
performance instantly to its

00:14:33.746 --> 00:14:35.966
highest states, delivering high

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:37.776
performance and to ramp it down

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.956
just as fast to preserve battery

00:14:39.956 --> 00:14:40.856
life.

00:14:40.856 --> 00:14:42.186
Now, these are just some of the

00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:43.706
improvements that are coming to

00:14:43.706 --> 00:14:45.956
not just our older devices, but

00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:48.916
the full range of devices, and

00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:50.706
that's a quick update on

00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:50.976
performance.

Now if this is all we'd done in

00:14:59.146 --> 00:15:00.466
iOS 12, I think it would be a

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.106
great release, but we've done

00:15:02.106 --> 00:15:02.886
more.

00:15:03.016 --> 00:15:03.836
Much more.

00:15:04.106 --> 00:15:05.296
And we have a lot to cover

00:15:05.296 --> 00:15:08.196
today, and it starts with

00:15:08.196 --> 00:15:09.316
augmented reality.

00:15:09.316 --> 00:15:09.966
Yeah. [applause and cheering]

00:15:09.966 --> 00:15:15.226
Now AR is transformational

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:16.096
technology.

00:15:16.386 --> 00:15:18.356
By bringing experiences into the

00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:21.126
real world, it enables all kinds

00:15:21.126 --> 00:15:22.506
of new experiences, changing the

00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:24.616
way we have fun and the way we

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:27.276
work, and in iOS 12, we wanted

00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:28.686
to make an easy way to

00:15:28.686 --> 00:15:31.096
experience AR across the system,

00:15:31.456 --> 00:15:33.096
and to do that, we got together

00:15:33.096 --> 00:15:34.656
with some of the greatest minds

00:15:34.696 --> 00:15:38.046
in 3D at Pixar, and together we

00:15:38.046 --> 00:15:40.426
created a new file format for

00:15:40.426 --> 00:15:40.806
AR.

00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:43.346
It's called USDZ, and it's a

00:15:43.346 --> 00:15:45.406
compact, single-file format

00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:47.626
that's optimized for sharing

00:15:48.016 --> 00:15:49.486
while retaining great 3D

00:15:49.486 --> 00:15:51.706
graphics and even animations.

00:15:52.296 --> 00:15:55.036
Now, you can use USDZ across the

00:15:55.036 --> 00:15:57.146
system from the files app, to

00:15:57.146 --> 00:15:59.066
Safari, even sharing them over

00:15:59.066 --> 00:16:00.926
messages and mail, and what's

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.536
great is you can place these 3D

00:16:02.536 --> 00:16:04.556
objects into the real world.

00:16:04.946 --> 00:16:06.856
It's something that's like AR

00:16:06.856 --> 00:16:07.416
quick look.

00:16:07.726 --> 00:16:08.856
It's really awesome.

00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:11.816
Now, we want all kinds of

00:16:11.886 --> 00:16:13.396
creatives to be able to create

00:16:13.396 --> 00:16:15.536
content for AR, and so we're

00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:16.586
working with the leading

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:19.366
companies for 3D tools and 3D

00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:22.266
libraries to bring their support

00:16:22.266 --> 00:16:22.806
for USDZ.

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:26.146
Now one company that's been all

00:16:26.146 --> 00:16:29.426
in on USDZ and ARKit is Adobe,

00:16:29.596 --> 00:16:30.756
and to tell you about what

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:31.996
they're up to, I'd like to

00:16:31.996 --> 00:16:33.796
invite Abhay Parasnis, their

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.776

00:16:52.046 --> 00:16:54.756
And with ARKit, Apple is by far

00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:56.586
the most powerful platform for

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:56.976
AR.

00:16:58.336 --> 00:16:59.816
So earlier Craig talked about

00:16:59.816 --> 00:17:00.686
USDZ format.

00:17:01.606 --> 00:17:02.816
It's actually a pretty big deal.

00:17:02.816 --> 00:17:05.915
There is now a way to deliver AR

00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:08.356
experiences across the entire

00:17:08.356 --> 00:17:09.226
iOS experience.

00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:13.086
And so today we are actually

00:17:13.306 --> 00:17:15.396
announcing that we are going to

00:17:15.396 --> 00:17:17.665
bring native USDZ support to

00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:18.976
Adobe's Creative Cloud.

00:17:19.516 --> 00:17:22.915
[ Applause ]

00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:26.126
With Creative Cloud, designers

00:17:26.126 --> 00:17:28.086
and developers will now be able

00:17:28.086 --> 00:17:30.686
to use familiar apps, apps that

00:17:30.686 --> 00:17:31.886
they know and love, like

00:17:31.886 --> 00:17:33.886
Photoshop or Dimension, to

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.436
create amazing AR content and

00:17:36.436 --> 00:17:38.596
bring it easily via USDZ.

00:17:38.596 --> 00:17:41.506
And of course, we are not going

00:17:41.506 --> 00:17:42.296
to stop there.

00:17:42.906 --> 00:17:44.356
We are going to bring the power

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.186
of immersive design to Creative

00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:48.706
Cloud with a new set of services

00:17:48.706 --> 00:17:50.726
and applications including a

00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:53.006
brand-new iOS application that's

00:17:53.076 --> 00:17:55.316
going to let all of you design

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.226
amazing AR experiences quickly.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.526
So, you will be able to bring in

00:18:00.526 --> 00:18:04.076
images, videos, text, any object

00:18:04.206 --> 00:18:06.576
from Creative Cloud directly

00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:08.236
into a native AR environment.

00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:11.726
In fact, for the first time with

00:18:11.726 --> 00:18:14.126
Creative Cloud and iOS, you will

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.406
have a what you see is what you

00:18:16.406 --> 00:18:18.906
get editing in AR.

00:18:18.906 --> 00:18:19.876
It's pretty cool.

00:18:20.086 --> 00:18:25.536
So, come join this afternoon

00:18:25.536 --> 00:18:26.766
State of the Union where we're

00:18:26.766 --> 00:18:28.246
able to give you a sneak peak of

00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:29.666
some of these new immersive

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:31.346
design tools for the first time.

00:18:31.906 --> 00:18:33.036
Thanks. Back to you Craig.

00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:35.361
[applause]

00:18:35.686 --> 00:18:36.296
>> Thank you, Abhay.

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:40.536
[applause] Now a critical part

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.816
of enabling AR is accurate

00:18:42.816 --> 00:18:44.756
measurement, and fortunately the

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:46.856
precise calibration of sensors

00:18:46.946 --> 00:18:49.046
in iOS devices and our tight

00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:50.746
hardware software integration

00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:52.456
mean that we do this really

00:18:52.456 --> 00:18:54.056
well, and we want to enable

00:18:54.056 --> 00:18:55.776
everyone to take advantage of

00:18:55.776 --> 00:18:56.746
this capability.

00:18:57.076 --> 00:18:59.316
So we're introducing a new app,

00:18:59.836 --> 00:19:01.376
and it's called Measure.

00:19:01.376 --> 00:19:03.516
It makes it really easy to

00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:05.226
measure objects, detect

00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:06.406
rectangles and get their

00:19:06.406 --> 00:19:08.076
dimensions, and measure lines

00:19:08.216 --> 00:19:09.896
along surfaces, and I'd like to

00:19:09.896 --> 00:19:10.856
show it to you now.

00:19:10.926 --> 00:19:15.176
[applause] Now, in looking for

00:19:15.806 --> 00:19:18.356
something to measure, I ended up

00:19:18.356 --> 00:19:21.186
digging through the attic and

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:24.936
came upon my old suitcase from

00:19:24.936 --> 00:19:27.296
my traveling days in college.

00:19:27.826 --> 00:19:29.876
A lot of memories in here.

00:19:30.326 --> 00:19:32.406
Now I'm actually in the Measure

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:34.516
app, and you see I can easily

00:19:34.516 --> 00:19:37.436
measure along this suitcase by

00:19:37.436 --> 00:19:41.736
just tapping and dragging out a

00:19:41.736 --> 00:19:44.166
line, like that, and check that

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:44.866
out.

00:19:45.016 --> 00:19:45.676
It's a measurement.

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.056
[applause] Now, what's really

00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:51.876
cool is I can extend these

00:19:51.876 --> 00:19:54.486
measurements so I can just tap,

00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:57.166
drag along another edge just

00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:59.956
like that, and even take it into

00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:03.646
full 3D by dragging down to the

00:20:03.686 --> 00:20:05.256
bottom like that.

00:20:05.256 --> 00:20:05.896
Isn't that cool?

00:20:06.516 --> 00:20:10.896
[ Applause ]

00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:12.276
Now I mentioned that we could

00:20:12.326 --> 00:20:14.316
automatically detect rectangles

00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:15.676
and show you dimensions of

00:20:15.676 --> 00:20:16.106
objects.

00:20:16.536 --> 00:20:18.306
So I have a photo here actually.

00:20:18.306 --> 00:20:19.686
It's one my mom always wanted me

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.166
to travel with of me as a baby,

00:20:22.526 --> 00:20:26.136
and so, you see, what I can do

00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:27.766
with Measure is it automatically

00:20:27.766 --> 00:20:29.056
detects the dimensions of that

00:20:29.116 --> 00:20:29.886
photo.

00:20:29.886 --> 00:20:33.016
I can just tap and get, oh,

00:20:33.016 --> 00:20:34.376
yeah, a cute little baby, wasn't

00:20:34.376 --> 00:20:34.443
I?

00:20:34.636 --> 00:20:35.526
And you can get measurements

00:20:35.576 --> 00:20:36.266
just like that.

00:20:36.266 --> 00:20:36.976
It's really fantastic.

00:20:37.516 --> 00:20:41.026
[ Applause ]

00:20:41.526 --> 00:20:44.036
Now, I'd like to turn now to

00:20:44.036 --> 00:20:46.376
USDZ and its support throughout

00:20:46.376 --> 00:20:46.906
the system.

00:20:47.286 --> 00:20:48.866
You know, you can experience

00:20:48.866 --> 00:20:50.456
USDZ in so many places, and one

00:20:50.456 --> 00:20:51.766
of those places is news.

00:20:52.206 --> 00:20:53.436
Now here's an article.

00:20:53.436 --> 00:20:54.496
We're all accustomed to seeing

00:20:54.496 --> 00:20:55.726
images in news articles.

00:20:56.196 --> 00:20:57.286
But check this out.

00:20:57.656 --> 00:20:59.476
Here you see a USDZ asset.

00:20:59.476 --> 00:21:00.676
It can just tap on this little

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:03.506
3D control and jump right in and

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:04.266
experience it.

00:21:04.266 --> 00:21:05.146
You can see the amazing

00:21:05.146 --> 00:21:06.646
animations that are possible,

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:07.856
and of course it's fully

00:21:07.856 --> 00:21:08.556
interactive.

00:21:09.246 --> 00:21:12.296
So I can zoom in and pan.

00:21:12.886 --> 00:21:15.056
Isn't that amazing?

00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:20.546
[applause] Now USDZ is also

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:21.366
great in the web.

00:21:21.646 --> 00:21:23.136
So here I am at the Fender

00:21:23.136 --> 00:21:24.436
website and actually let you

00:21:24.436 --> 00:21:25.816
configure your guitar with the

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:27.146
kind of finish and pickguard

00:21:27.146 --> 00:21:27.726
that you want.

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.626
So I can select a configuration

00:21:29.626 --> 00:21:31.396
option here, and then I can see

00:21:31.396 --> 00:21:32.856
the guitar I've configured.

00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:34.306
So I'm just going to tap in.

00:21:34.306 --> 00:21:36.186
Of course I can see the guitar

00:21:36.256 --> 00:21:37.846
here, but wouldn't it be cool if

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:39.426
I could see it in the real world

00:21:39.426 --> 00:21:40.686
in its real size?

00:21:41.626 --> 00:21:42.396
Well, there it is.

00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:42.636
Check that out.

00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:43.106
[applause] I think I'm going to

00:21:43.956 --> 00:21:50.306
capture that for posterity.

00:21:51.696 --> 00:21:53.726
And that's a quick look at USDZ

00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:56.806
and Measure in iOS 12.

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.026
Next-- thank you.

00:22:01.926 --> 00:22:02.586
[applause] Next, I'd like to

00:22:02.716 --> 00:22:04.816
talk about the key technology

00:22:04.816 --> 00:22:06.596
behind these augmented reality

00:22:06.596 --> 00:22:09.236
experiences, and that's ARKit.

00:22:09.236 --> 00:22:11.106
ARKit opens up the world of AR

00:22:11.156 --> 00:22:13.056
to hundreds of millions of

00:22:13.056 --> 00:22:15.026
users, making it the world's

00:22:15.026 --> 00:22:18.756
largest AR platform by far.

00:22:18.866 --> 00:22:20.656
And we're on a relentless pace

00:22:20.826 --> 00:22:22.646
of advancement with AR, and that

00:22:22.646 --> 00:22:26.496
continues today with ARKit 2.

00:22:26.796 --> 00:22:31.516
Yes. ARKit 2 delivers advances

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.386
with improved face tracking,

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:35.486
more realistic rendering, and

00:22:35.486 --> 00:22:37.906
support for 3D object detection

00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:39.956
and persistence, which enables

00:22:39.956 --> 00:22:42.076
launching into AR experiences

00:22:42.076 --> 00:22:43.456
associated with a particular

00:22:43.526 --> 00:22:46.116
object or a physical space, like

00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:47.486
starting a game built around a

00:22:47.556 --> 00:22:49.296
physical toy or having a

00:22:49.376 --> 00:22:50.776
physical classroom serve as the

00:22:50.826 --> 00:22:52.526
foundation for a lesson that was

00:22:52.586 --> 00:22:54.056
authored in AR.

00:22:54.336 --> 00:22:56.566
But probably best is the support

00:22:56.566 --> 00:22:58.656
for shared experiences.

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:00.756
Now this delivers true,

00:23:00.756 --> 00:23:02.996
multiuser augmented reality.

00:23:03.726 --> 00:23:04.986
You and the people around you

00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:06.416
will be able to see your own

00:23:06.456 --> 00:23:08.396
perspective on a common virtual

00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:08.916
environment.

00:23:09.306 --> 00:23:10.526
And to help all you developers

00:23:10.526 --> 00:23:12.686
get started, we created this

00:23:12.816 --> 00:23:14.506
sample app written in Swift that

00:23:14.506 --> 00:23:16.106
you'll all be getting today.

00:23:16.336 --> 00:23:18.376
Now, check out how both players

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:20.426
and even a third observer can

00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:21.676
all experience the same

00:23:21.676 --> 00:23:22.906
environment in real time.

00:23:23.006 --> 00:23:23.796
It's really fun.

00:23:24.516 --> 00:23:28.786
[ Applause ]

00:23:29.286 --> 00:23:31.456
Now, we've also brought in a

00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:33.266
select few developers into our

00:23:33.266 --> 00:23:34.426
labs over the last couple of

00:23:34.426 --> 00:23:36.736
weeks to work with ARKit, and

00:23:36.736 --> 00:23:37.596
they love it.

00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:39.566
Now, one of them is Lego.

00:23:40.066 --> 00:23:42.106
And what they've done is so fun,

00:23:42.356 --> 00:23:44.196
you just need to see it.

00:23:44.516 --> 00:23:46.216
So I'm pleased to invite Martin

00:23:46.326 --> 00:23:48.316
Sanders, director of innovation

00:23:48.316 --> 00:23:49.716
of Lego, to the stage to give

00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:51.226
you a live demonstration.

00:23:51.376 --> 00:23:51.676
Martin.

00:23:51.716 --> 00:23:52.776
>> Craig, thank you very much.

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:56.616
[ Applause ]

00:23:57.116 --> 00:23:58.876
Creating and playing with

00:23:58.946 --> 00:24:01.216
physical Lego sets brings great

00:24:01.216 --> 00:24:03.276
joy to millions of children and

00:24:03.386 --> 00:24:05.436
Lego fans all over the world.

00:24:06.186 --> 00:24:09.216
And now, with ARKit 2, we get to

00:24:09.216 --> 00:24:10.396
expand those creative

00:24:10.396 --> 00:24:12.336
possibilities like never before

00:24:12.336 --> 00:24:14.856
and take things beyond the

00:24:14.936 --> 00:24:15.386
physical.

00:24:16.286 --> 00:24:18.946
What we try to do is combine

00:24:18.996 --> 00:24:20.846
physical and digital together to

00:24:20.846 --> 00:24:22.136
really open up those creative

00:24:22.136 --> 00:24:24.016
play possibilities, because our

00:24:24.016 --> 00:24:25.676
Lego sets are really the start

00:24:25.676 --> 00:24:26.746
point for all of those

00:24:26.746 --> 00:24:28.026
children's imaginations.

00:24:28.026 --> 00:24:29.436
And when we get a chance to

00:24:29.436 --> 00:24:32.946
really imbed ARKit 2, it takes

00:24:32.946 --> 00:24:33.806
it to the next level.

00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:35.166
Let me show you what I mean.

00:24:36.996 --> 00:24:38.856
Here we have Assembly Square.

00:24:38.906 --> 00:24:40.336
It's one of our Lego creator

00:24:40.336 --> 00:24:42.496
sets and already has so many

00:24:42.496 --> 00:24:44.036
great details it's awesome to

00:24:44.036 --> 00:24:44.386
play with.

00:24:44.386 --> 00:24:45.846
But wouldn't it be great if we

00:24:45.846 --> 00:24:47.326
could take things even further?

00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:49.916
Well now with 3D object

00:24:49.916 --> 00:24:52.026
detection, we get to recognize

00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:53.836
our models and bring them to

00:24:53.836 --> 00:24:53.976
life.

00:24:54.516 --> 00:25:01.596
[ Music ]

00:25:02.096 --> 00:25:03.676
And just look at all of those

00:25:03.676 --> 00:25:05.226
rich details we can now bring

00:25:05.226 --> 00:25:08.086
into our sets, because when we

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:09.886
combine physical and digital

00:25:09.886 --> 00:25:12.226
together like this, it really

00:25:12.226 --> 00:25:13.616
opens up those creative play

00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:14.326
possibilities.

00:25:14.426 --> 00:25:16.976
And there's so much to do here.

00:25:16.976 --> 00:25:19.606
Did you see these icons of the

00:25:19.606 --> 00:25:20.746
people and objects?

00:25:21.626 --> 00:25:22.896
Well they represent missions and

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:24.196
stories that we can explore.

00:25:24.196 --> 00:25:27.386
And with a world as rich and as

00:25:27.386 --> 00:25:28.866
immersive as this, who wouldn't

00:25:28.866 --> 00:25:29.446
want to play?

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:30.926
So let's add a character.

00:25:31.226 --> 00:25:33.216
How about this little guy here?

00:25:33.216 --> 00:25:36.046
>> Welcome back, let's go on an

00:25:36.046 --> 00:25:36.316
adventure.

00:25:36.316 --> 00:25:36.636
>> Awesome.

00:25:36.636 --> 00:25:37.696
Let's go on an adventure.

00:25:37.696 --> 00:25:39.846
But going on an adventure with

00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:42.456
friends is often way more fun.

00:25:42.516 --> 00:25:44.216
Anders, why don't you pop in

00:25:44.216 --> 00:25:44.506
here.

00:25:44.506 --> 00:25:45.826
>> I'm always up for an

00:25:45.826 --> 00:25:48.106
adventure.

00:25:48.386 --> 00:25:48.616
>> Perfect.

00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:51.606
Because now with ARKit 2's

00:25:51.706 --> 00:25:53.706
multiuser support, we get to

00:25:53.706 --> 00:25:56.086
play with up to four friends in

00:25:56.156 --> 00:25:58.016
the same space.

00:25:58.016 --> 00:25:58.916
Let's go ahead and add a few

00:25:58.976 --> 00:25:59.816
things from our collection,

00:25:59.816 --> 00:26:00.126
Anders.

00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:03.176
>> Okay. I will add a bank over

00:26:03.176 --> 00:26:03.356
here.

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:05.486
>> Very nice, I like it.

00:26:05.956 --> 00:26:08.716
How about taking this for a

00:26:11.786 --> 00:26:13.256
spin.

00:26:13.466 --> 00:26:15.176
Let's just look at all those

00:26:15.176 --> 00:26:16.606
rich details you can see on the

00:26:16.606 --> 00:26:20.566
outside of the building and even

00:26:20.656 --> 00:26:23.536
on the inside.

00:26:23.536 --> 00:26:25.376
Yeah, I think I'm going to add

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:25.856
this guy.

00:26:25.856 --> 00:26:27.256
He's definitely going to keep

00:26:27.256 --> 00:26:27.956
the bank safe.

00:26:30.316 --> 00:26:32.476
Oh look, my character's hungry.

00:26:33.056 --> 00:26:33.926
Let's take him over to the

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:34.426
bakery.

00:26:35.196 --> 00:26:36.116
Well let's see what they have.

00:26:36.866 --> 00:26:39.086
Because now with ARKit 2, we get

00:26:39.206 --> 00:26:40.746
to see inside our physical

00:26:40.996 --> 00:26:43.026
creations and check out all the

00:26:43.066 --> 00:26:44.206
details that were hidden before.

00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:46.596
We've got a ballerina, a little

00:26:46.806 --> 00:26:49.336
music session going on, and

00:26:49.376 --> 00:26:50.636
let's make a bathroom-- oops

00:26:50.696 --> 00:26:51.086
sorry.

00:26:51.186 --> 00:26:52.616
Moving on.

00:26:52.616 --> 00:26:54.126
Oh, another play trigger in the

00:26:54.126 --> 00:26:54.576
bakery.

00:26:55.326 --> 00:26:56.146
Let's see what happens when I

00:26:56.186 --> 00:26:56.726
click on this.

00:26:56.726 --> 00:26:57.496
>> Um, fresh [inaudible].

00:26:57.656 --> 00:27:00.336
>> Oh, that doesn't look too

00:27:00.336 --> 00:27:00.426
good.

00:27:00.426 --> 00:27:01.176
>> Anders, I've got a situation.

00:27:01.806 --> 00:27:04.236
I'm going to need your help over

00:27:04.236 --> 00:27:04.716
here.

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:05.446
>> Yeah, okay, okay.

00:27:05.446 --> 00:27:06.686
I've got a firetruck.

00:27:06.686 --> 00:27:06.876
>> Perfect.

00:27:07.606 --> 00:27:09.026
You put out those flames while--

00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:10.246
oh, oh dear.

00:27:10.806 --> 00:27:11.666
Somebody's got themselves

00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:13.786
trapped on the roof, so I'm

00:27:13.886 --> 00:27:15.326
going to use this helicopter to

00:27:16.276 --> 00:27:18.286
go and pick up these clowns.

00:27:19.176 --> 00:27:21.516
[music] How are you getting on

00:27:22.036 --> 00:27:23.186
down there Anders?

00:27:23.456 --> 00:27:25.486
>> I'm almost done, almost done.

00:27:26.366 --> 00:27:27.576
>> Great. Those guys are safe.

00:27:27.966 --> 00:27:30.456
And the flames look like they're

00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:31.206
almost out.

00:27:33.056 --> 00:27:34.926
Perfect, we did it.

00:27:36.416 --> 00:27:37.246
Yeah. What?

00:27:38.516 --> 00:27:41.936
[ Applause ]

00:27:42.436 --> 00:27:44.316
And we've even unlocked a new

00:27:44.316 --> 00:27:45.276
item for our collection.

00:27:46.486 --> 00:27:47.646
But the fun doesn't need to end

00:27:47.646 --> 00:27:50.226
there because with ARKit 2, we

00:27:50.226 --> 00:27:53.166
get to save our entire world

00:27:53.416 --> 00:27:56.136
back into our physical set and

00:27:56.136 --> 00:27:57.326
pick up where we left off.

00:27:59.686 --> 00:28:00.856
[applause] All right.

00:28:01.116 --> 00:28:01.706
That's awesome.

00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:03.896
So much fun.

00:28:03.896 --> 00:28:05.286
But what makes this truly

00:28:05.286 --> 00:28:06.856
amazing is how with just a

00:28:06.936 --> 00:28:09.166
single Lego creation and ARKit 2

00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:10.546
it really opens up those

00:28:10.546 --> 00:28:12.046
creative play possibilities.

00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:14.466
So look out for more Lego AR

00:28:14.466 --> 00:28:16.016
experiences in the App Store

00:28:16.436 --> 00:28:17.176
later this year.

00:28:17.216 --> 00:28:17.976
Thank you very much everybody.

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:21.706
[ Applause ]

00:28:22.206 --> 00:28:23.936
>> Isn't that great?

00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:25.916
So that's our update on AR and

00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:26.586
iOS 12.

00:28:27.136 --> 00:28:28.726
Next, I'd like to turn to

00:28:28.866 --> 00:28:29.466
Photos.

00:28:29.896 --> 00:28:32.556
You know, over a trillion photos

00:28:32.596 --> 00:28:34.656
are captured on iPhone each

00:28:34.656 --> 00:28:38.516
year, and Photos is the best way

00:28:38.586 --> 00:28:41.096
to relive and share those

00:28:41.096 --> 00:28:41.706
moments.

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:43.996
This year we're making photos

00:28:44.096 --> 00:28:45.916
even better, and it starts with

00:28:45.916 --> 00:28:46.566
Search.

00:28:47.066 --> 00:28:49.126
Search has powerful object and

00:28:49.216 --> 00:28:50.166
scene recognition.

00:28:50.616 --> 00:28:51.766
It lets you search for photos

00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:53.106
based on things like searching

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:55.716
for cars or dogs or flowers, and

00:28:55.716 --> 00:28:56.836
that's a great way to explore

00:28:56.836 --> 00:28:59.256
your library, but in iOS 12,

00:28:59.476 --> 00:29:01.456
Search now starts working for

00:29:01.456 --> 00:29:04.216
you even before you start typing

00:29:04.286 --> 00:29:05.716
with Search suggestions.

00:29:06.206 --> 00:29:07.476
It'll highlight things for you

00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:09.876
like key moments and people that

00:29:09.876 --> 00:29:12.046
are important to you, places

00:29:12.046 --> 00:29:13.116
where you've taken some great

00:29:13.206 --> 00:29:14.516
photos and even categories of

00:29:14.516 --> 00:29:16.786
photos like hiking and water

00:29:16.786 --> 00:29:17.346
sports.

00:29:17.576 --> 00:29:19.506
And Search is much more powerful

00:29:19.506 --> 00:29:19.986
than ever.

00:29:20.376 --> 00:29:21.686
You can search for places by

00:29:21.686 --> 00:29:22.456
business name.

00:29:22.546 --> 00:29:23.726
So you could search for SFMOMA

00:29:23.726 --> 00:29:26.186
or even a broad category like

00:29:26.186 --> 00:29:26.856
museum.

00:29:27.526 --> 00:29:30.516
And, Photos indexes over four

00:29:30.516 --> 00:29:32.276
million events by time and

00:29:32.336 --> 00:29:32.676
place.

00:29:32.676 --> 00:29:34.536
Things like sporting events and

00:29:34.536 --> 00:29:36.066
concerts, and so you can search

00:29:36.066 --> 00:29:37.756
for them and find photos you

00:29:37.756 --> 00:29:39.046
took at those events.

00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:41.086
And search is super powerful.

00:29:41.256 --> 00:29:42.356
You can now search for multiple

00:29:42.356 --> 00:29:44.506
search terms like surfing and

00:29:44.506 --> 00:29:45.856
vacation and even get

00:29:45.856 --> 00:29:47.736
suggestions for additional

00:29:47.736 --> 00:29:49.126
search terms to help you find

00:29:49.206 --> 00:29:50.476
exactly what you're looking for.

00:29:50.996 --> 00:29:52.816
And now in iOS 12 we have an all

00:29:52.816 --> 00:29:53.436
new tab.

00:29:53.886 --> 00:29:55.746
It's called For You.

00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:58.186
And with For You, you have all

00:29:58.186 --> 00:29:59.416
of your memories, so those great

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:01.476
memory movies, but more like

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.396
featured photos highlighting a

00:30:03.516 --> 00:30:05.636
photo that you took on this day

00:30:05.636 --> 00:30:06.756
in past years.

00:30:07.126 --> 00:30:09.516
And Effects Suggestions, for

00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:11.106
instance, suggesting looping a

00:30:11.106 --> 00:30:14.016
live photo or applying a new

00:30:14.016 --> 00:30:15.646
portrait effect to one of your

00:30:15.646 --> 00:30:16.666
portrait photos.

00:30:16.986 --> 00:30:18.286
And we even highlight your

00:30:18.286 --> 00:30:20.316
shared album activity.

00:30:20.566 --> 00:30:22.016
Now when it comes to sharing,

00:30:22.266 --> 00:30:23.256
there are many ways you can

00:30:23.256 --> 00:30:25.566
share photos, but our focus is

00:30:25.566 --> 00:30:27.506
on sharing great photos with the

00:30:27.546 --> 00:30:29.616
people you care about most, and

00:30:29.616 --> 00:30:31.356
that's why this year in For You

00:30:31.356 --> 00:30:33.336
we've added Sharing Suggestions.

00:30:33.716 --> 00:30:35.616
So imagine you've gone out for a

00:30:35.616 --> 00:30:36.846
great dinner with some friends

00:30:36.846 --> 00:30:37.946
and you took some photos.

00:30:38.096 --> 00:30:40.026
Well afterwards in For You,

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:41.356
you'll see a suggestion like

00:30:41.416 --> 00:30:42.876
this to share those photos.

00:30:42.876 --> 00:30:44.896
If you tap in, you'll see that

00:30:45.016 --> 00:30:47.346
photos is even recommending a

00:30:47.496 --> 00:30:50.096
set of photos from that set that

00:30:50.096 --> 00:30:51.906
you might want to share and

00:30:52.196 --> 00:30:53.666
suggest who you might want to

00:30:53.666 --> 00:30:55.656
share them with based in part by

00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:57.006
the people that appeared in the

00:30:57.006 --> 00:30:57.546
photos.

00:30:57.906 --> 00:30:59.136
And when you share them, they're

00:30:59.136 --> 00:31:01.266
shared at full resolution out of

00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:04.216
your iCloud photo library and

00:31:04.566 --> 00:31:05.546
when you're friend receives

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:07.266
them, something really magical

00:31:07.266 --> 00:31:07.696
happens.

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.326
Their phone searches their

00:31:09.326 --> 00:31:10.826
libraries for other photos they

00:31:10.826 --> 00:31:12.536
took at that event and suggest

00:31:12.536 --> 00:31:13.886
that they share them back to

00:31:13.886 --> 00:31:15.736
you, so you both can end up with

00:31:15.736 --> 00:31:15.976
a full set.

00:31:16.516 --> 00:31:22.546
[ Applause ]

00:31:23.046 --> 00:31:24.106
Now this is built around

00:31:24.326 --> 00:31:25.436
iMessage so of course it's

00:31:25.476 --> 00:31:26.856
private, using end-to-end

00:31:26.856 --> 00:31:28.786
encryption, and all of those

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:30.706
smarts are done with on-device

00:31:30.886 --> 00:31:31.626
machine learning.

00:31:32.086 --> 00:31:33.786
So that's your quick update on

00:31:33.856 --> 00:31:36.306
Photos in iOS 12, and next,

00:31:37.116 --> 00:31:38.856
let's turn to Siri.

00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:40.936
Now Siri is by far the world's

00:31:40.936 --> 00:31:43.216
most used digital assistant with

00:31:43.216 --> 00:31:45.166
over 10 billion requests

00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:47.116
processed per month, and because

00:31:47.226 --> 00:31:48.796
Siri works across all your

00:31:48.796 --> 00:31:50.836
devices, it's always there to

00:31:50.836 --> 00:31:51.966
help you through your day

00:31:51.966 --> 00:31:53.316
getting things done.

00:31:53.746 --> 00:31:55.896
Now we all know that Siri works

00:31:56.256 --> 00:31:58.286
with many third-party apps for

00:31:58.286 --> 00:32:00.366
things like messaging, ride

00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:02.116
sharing, and payments.

00:32:02.626 --> 00:32:03.966
But we wanted to make Siri able

00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:05.956
to do much more for you, and

00:32:05.956 --> 00:32:07.516
we're doing that by taking

00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:09.226
advantage of the power of apps

00:32:09.356 --> 00:32:11.106
with a new feature we call

00:32:11.106 --> 00:32:11.986
Shortcuts.

00:32:12.536 --> 00:32:14.586
Now with shortcuts any app can

00:32:14.586 --> 00:32:17.016
expose quick actions to Siri.

00:32:17.276 --> 00:32:18.736
Let's look at some examples.

00:32:19.106 --> 00:32:20.746
Now say you have the Tile app

00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:22.116
because you're always losing

00:32:22.116 --> 00:32:22.856
your keys.

00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:25.016
Well, the Tile app can expose

00:32:25.266 --> 00:32:27.446
the option to add a shortcut to

00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:28.156
Siri.

00:32:28.156 --> 00:32:30.126
And you can assign your own

00:32:30.236 --> 00:32:32.136
phrase, such as I lost my keys

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:33.596
would be a good choice, and when

00:32:33.596 --> 00:32:36.026
you then say it, Siri will

00:32:36.026 --> 00:32:38.846
automatically activate Tile and

00:32:38.846 --> 00:32:40.266
show you right in the Siri UI

00:32:40.266 --> 00:32:42.086
start ringing your Tile just

00:32:42.086 --> 00:32:42.656
like that.

00:32:42.716 --> 00:32:43.676
It's really great.

00:32:43.676 --> 00:32:44.016
[applause]

00:32:44.516 --> 00:32:47.626
[ Applause ]

00:32:48.126 --> 00:32:49.676
Of course there's so many uses

00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:50.606
for this kind of thing.

00:32:50.606 --> 00:32:52.286
You could say game time to get

00:32:52.286 --> 00:32:53.546
your team's schedule from

00:32:53.836 --> 00:32:56.176
TeamSnap or help me relax to

00:32:56.176 --> 00:32:58.496
kick off a meditation or order

00:32:58.496 --> 00:33:00.766
my groceries to order your

00:33:00.766 --> 00:33:01.326
usual.

00:33:01.606 --> 00:33:03.876
You know, with millions of apps,

00:33:03.906 --> 00:33:05.546
Shortcut enables incredible

00:33:05.546 --> 00:33:07.096
possibilities for how you use

00:33:07.096 --> 00:33:07.656
Siri.

00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:10.756
Now, as you know, Siri is more

00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:11.526
than just a voice.

00:33:11.526 --> 00:33:12.936
Siri is working all the time in

00:33:12.936 --> 00:33:14.286
the background to make proactive

00:33:14.376 --> 00:33:16.276
suggestions for you even before

00:33:16.276 --> 00:33:19.776
you ask, and now with Shortcut,

00:33:20.196 --> 00:33:21.656
Siri can do so much more.

00:33:22.036 --> 00:33:23.406
So, for instance, let's say you

00:33:23.406 --> 00:33:24.926
order a coffee every morning at

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:26.676
Phil's before you go to work.

00:33:27.126 --> 00:33:28.856
Well now, Siri can suggest right

00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:30.336
on your lock screen that you do

00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:30.596
that.

00:33:30.596 --> 00:33:32.666
You tap on it, and you can place

00:33:32.706 --> 00:33:34.746
the order right from there.

00:33:35.196 --> 00:33:36.546
Or if when you get to the gym

00:33:36.746 --> 00:33:38.056
you use Active to track

00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:40.146
workouts, well that suggestion

00:33:40.146 --> 00:33:41.686
will appear right on your lock

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:42.066
screen.

00:33:42.506 --> 00:33:43.436
And this even works when you

00:33:43.436 --> 00:33:44.596
pull down into Search.

00:33:44.886 --> 00:33:46.316
You'll get great suggestions.

00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:47.876
Like say you're running late for

00:33:47.876 --> 00:33:49.306
a meeting, well Siri will

00:33:49.356 --> 00:33:50.956
suggest you text the meeting

00:33:50.956 --> 00:33:51.536
organizer.

00:33:51.536 --> 00:33:54.026
Or when you go to the movie,

00:33:54.026 --> 00:33:55.616
suggest that you turn on Do Not

00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:56.436
Disturb.

00:33:56.436 --> 00:33:57.586
That's just being considerate.

00:33:58.296 --> 00:34:01.096
And remind you to call grandma

00:34:01.096 --> 00:34:01.656
on her birthday.

00:34:01.656 --> 00:34:03.356
Just tap, and it'll dial the

00:34:03.356 --> 00:34:04.096
call for you.

00:34:04.846 --> 00:34:06.276
Now, we think we're all going to

00:34:06.276 --> 00:34:08.206
really enjoy using Shortcuts,

00:34:08.706 --> 00:34:10.266
and so we went a step further.

00:34:10.366 --> 00:34:11.616
We wanted to let you create your

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:15.226
own shortcuts as users, multiple

00:34:15.266 --> 00:34:16.606
steps across multiple

00:34:16.606 --> 00:34:18.755
applications, and we're doing it

00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:21.956
with a new Shortcuts app.

00:34:22.186 --> 00:34:23.706
So with the Shortcuts app, you

00:34:23.706 --> 00:34:25.846
could do something like create a

00:34:25.846 --> 00:34:28.016
shortcut for surf time, and it

00:34:28.016 --> 00:34:29.076
could go get you the surf

00:34:29.146 --> 00:34:30.936
report, look up the current

00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:33.085
weather, get you the ETA to the

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.416
beach, and even create a

00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:35.735
reminder for you to put on

00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:37.496
sunscreen when you get there.

00:34:37.806 --> 00:34:40.505
Now, it's all done with simple

00:34:40.565 --> 00:34:43.025
drag and drop steps in the

00:34:43.025 --> 00:34:45.416
Shortcuts editor right here.

00:34:45.766 --> 00:34:47.106
It's really easy.

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:48.466
Now to show you how Shortcuts

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:50.076
can streamline your day, I'd

00:34:50.076 --> 00:34:50.886
like to invite one of our

00:34:50.886 --> 00:34:52.936

00:35:05.596 --> 00:35:07.496
I'm am so stoked to show you

00:35:07.556 --> 00:35:08.296
Siri Shortcuts.

00:35:08.716 --> 00:35:09.736
To do that, I'm going to walk

00:35:09.736 --> 00:35:10.896
you through my day.

00:35:10.896 --> 00:35:12.006
So imagine it's the morning.

00:35:12.046 --> 00:35:13.386
I'm headed to work, and I pick

00:35:13.386 --> 00:35:15.596
up my phone, and I see this

00:35:15.636 --> 00:35:17.216
suggestion from Phil's Coffee.

00:35:17.726 --> 00:35:19.146
Siri has learned that I do this

00:35:19.146 --> 00:35:20.716
most mornings, so now I can just

00:35:20.756 --> 00:35:22.946
tap on the suggestion and I see

00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:24.096
all the details I need to

00:35:24.096 --> 00:35:26.066
confirm my perfect Mint Monkey

00:35:26.066 --> 00:35:27.316
Dough right here on the lock

00:35:27.316 --> 00:35:28.626
screen without even going into

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:29.016
the app.

00:35:29.276 --> 00:35:31.006
So let's get caffeinated.

00:35:31.006 --> 00:35:32.856
And I'm done.

00:35:33.816 --> 00:35:36.656
Fast forward a little bit, and

00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:37.946
I'm sitting at my desk at my

00:35:38.026 --> 00:35:39.236
office and I need to know when

00:35:39.236 --> 00:35:40.506
my next meeting is.

00:35:40.506 --> 00:35:41.726
I'll go to the Up Next widget,

00:35:41.726 --> 00:35:43.636
and it looks like I am running a

00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:44.856
little late for a rather

00:35:44.856 --> 00:35:46.796
important meeting, so I should

00:35:46.796 --> 00:35:48.046
probably let someone know.

00:35:48.416 --> 00:35:49.856
And it looks like Shortcuts is a

00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:50.776
few steps ahead of me.

00:35:50.886 --> 00:35:52.186
I could call into the meeting,

00:35:52.186 --> 00:35:53.656
or I could let the organizer

00:35:53.656 --> 00:35:54.616
know that I am running late.

00:35:55.166 --> 00:35:56.216
I should probably tell Arie

00:35:56.216 --> 00:35:56.776
what's up.

00:35:57.596 --> 00:35:58.536
That looks like just what I want

00:35:58.536 --> 00:36:00.906
to say, sorry Arie, let's send

00:36:01.756 --> 00:36:01.826
it.

00:36:03.436 --> 00:36:05.936
Perfect. I also want to show you

00:36:05.936 --> 00:36:07.616
how you can add a shortcut to

00:36:07.716 --> 00:36:08.166
Siri.

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:09.726
So let's take a look at Kayak.

00:36:09.916 --> 00:36:12.766
I keep all of my travel details

00:36:12.766 --> 00:36:13.386
in Kayak.

00:36:13.586 --> 00:36:15.246
Most important is my post WWDC

00:36:15.246 --> 00:36:17.646
relaxation trip to Los Angeles.

00:36:18.326 --> 00:36:19.766
You can see I have got my

00:36:19.926 --> 00:36:21.766
flight, my hotel, all the

00:36:21.766 --> 00:36:23.336
details, everything I need, but

00:36:23.336 --> 00:36:24.806
what I really want is to be able

00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:26.096
to use this and get to this

00:36:26.096 --> 00:36:27.886
information with my voice while

00:36:27.886 --> 00:36:29.146
I'm on the go.

00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:31.256
So, let's head back, and I can

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:34.026
just tap add to Siri, record my

00:36:34.026 --> 00:36:36.946
custom phrase, travel plans

00:36:36.946 --> 00:36:40.566
[beep], and I'm done.

00:36:40.566 --> 00:36:42.796
So now when I land at the

00:36:42.796 --> 00:36:44.466
airport and I'm about to get in

00:36:44.466 --> 00:36:45.996
a cab and I could really use

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.736
that hotel address, I can just

00:36:47.836 --> 00:36:52.186
say, travel plans.

00:36:52.506 --> 00:36:54.356
>> Kayak says your hotel is at

00:36:54.356 --> 00:36:56.176
929 South Broadway.

00:36:56.726 --> 00:36:58.236
You can check in after 3 p.m.

>> Isn't that cool?

00:36:59.766 --> 00:37:00.226

00:37:01.516 --> 00:37:06.546
[ Applause ]

00:37:07.046 --> 00:37:08.146
So I would love to be on that

00:37:08.146 --> 00:37:09.466
vacation, but I should, I don't

00:37:09.466 --> 00:37:10.966
know, probably finish this demo,

00:37:11.076 --> 00:37:13.076
so let's head back to work, and

00:37:13.076 --> 00:37:14.296
I can show you how the Shortcut

00:37:14.296 --> 00:37:15.716
app can help me with my commute

00:37:15.716 --> 00:37:16.556
home.

00:37:18.126 --> 00:37:19.866
We start in the Gallery where

00:37:19.866 --> 00:37:21.106
there's hundreds of premade

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:22.566
shortcuts that you can download,

00:37:23.016 --> 00:37:23.946
or we can hop over to the

00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:25.466
library, and I've got a bunch of

00:37:25.466 --> 00:37:26.536
shortcuts here, but I want to

00:37:26.536 --> 00:37:27.756
show you my heading home

00:37:27.756 --> 00:37:28.136
shortcut.

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:31.246
You can see that it's just

00:37:31.246 --> 00:37:32.226
really a series of steps.

00:37:32.786 --> 00:37:34.556
It grabs my location and travel

00:37:34.556 --> 00:37:36.586
time, and it sends my ETA to my

00:37:36.586 --> 00:37:37.236
roommate.

00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:39.446
It sets my HomeKit thermostat to

00:37:39.536 --> 00:37:41.026
70 degrees, and it turns on my

00:37:41.026 --> 00:37:41.466
fan.

00:37:41.996 --> 00:37:43.336
And last, it gets directions

00:37:43.336 --> 00:37:44.626
home with Apple maps with the

00:37:44.626 --> 00:37:45.916
best route to avoid traffic.

00:37:46.376 --> 00:37:48.386
Now this is already pretty cool,

00:37:48.656 --> 00:37:50.656
but I happen to be an NPR News

00:37:50.826 --> 00:37:52.426
junkie, so I should probably

00:37:52.426 --> 00:37:53.696
just add that to my shortcut to

00:37:53.766 --> 00:37:55.046
save me some trouble on the ride

00:37:55.046 --> 00:37:55.286
home.

00:37:55.626 --> 00:37:58.146
Let's tap search, and there's a

00:37:58.146 --> 00:37:59.686
bunch I can add here, but I can

00:37:59.686 --> 00:38:02.126
just tap Siri suggestions, and

00:38:02.126 --> 00:38:04.036
there it is, play KQED Radio,

00:38:04.246 --> 00:38:07.156
we'll drag this in, drop it, and

00:38:07.236 --> 00:38:07.666
we're set.

00:38:08.946 --> 00:38:10.376
I've already added the shortcut

00:38:10.466 --> 00:38:12.156
to Siri with a custom phrase,

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:14.436
heading home, so now, whenever I

00:38:14.436 --> 00:38:15.946
leave work, I can just say,

00:38:16.846 --> 00:38:19.616
heading home.

00:38:21.606 --> 00:38:22.516
>> You will get there in one

00:38:22.576 --> 00:38:22.796
hour.

00:38:23.346 --> 00:38:24.686
I sent a message to Cheryl.

00:38:25.296 --> 00:38:26.826
Your thermostat is set to 70

00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:28.156
degrees, and I turned on the

00:38:28.156 --> 00:38:28.746
fan.

00:38:28.746 --> 00:38:32.236
Playing KQED Radio [music].

00:38:39.046 --> 00:38:40.866
That's Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12.

Thank you so much.

It works on iPhone and iPad, and

00:38:55.856 --> 00:38:56.826
of course you can run your

00:38:56.826 --> 00:38:59.166

00:38:59.166 --> 00:39:00.136
your Apple Watch.

00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:02.896
Siri.

00:39:03.476 --> 00:39:06.696
Next, let's talk about apps, and

00:39:06.696 --> 00:39:08.166
to tell you about the latest,

00:39:08.166 --> 00:39:09.566
I'm going to hand it off to

00:39:18.906 --> 00:39:20.476
so great to be here.

00:39:20.476 --> 00:39:22.116
I'm excited to tell you about

00:39:22.116 --> 00:39:23.836
some great updates in some of

00:39:23.836 --> 00:39:26.006
our most popular apps, starting

00:39:26.006 --> 00:39:28.126
with one of my favorites, News.

00:39:28.396 --> 00:39:31.686
So News is a personalized feed

00:39:32.066 --> 00:39:33.146
where you can see all the

00:39:33.146 --> 00:39:34.816

And, our top stories are

00:39:39.956 --> 00:39:41.766
handpicked by the Apple News

00:39:45.796 --> 00:39:47.676
collection of curated content.

With our new browse tab, you can

00:39:51.866 --> 00:39:53.446
discover new channels and

00:39:53.486 --> 00:39:55.816
topics, and we've made it even

00:39:55.816 --> 00:39:57.606
easier to jump to your favorites

00:39:57.606 --> 00:39:59.366
because that's why they're your

00:39:59.366 --> 00:40:01.136
favorites, right?

00:40:01.496 --> 00:40:05.296
News shines on the iPad.

00:40:05.426 --> 00:40:08.206
We've added a new sidebar, and

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:09.456
it's a great way to navigate.

00:40:09.456 --> 00:40:12.846
It makes it easy and I fun to

00:40:12.846 --> 00:40:14.536
dig into the areas you're most

00:40:14.536 --> 00:40:15.526
interested in.

00:40:15.696 --> 00:40:16.936
So that's news.

00:40:17.606 --> 00:40:20.296
Now, we've completely rebuilt

00:40:20.686 --> 00:40:22.356
the Stocks app, and it's got a

00:40:22.356 --> 00:40:23.706
beautiful new design.

00:40:24.016 --> 00:40:26.216
Of course, you can still see the

00:40:26.216 --> 00:40:27.956
stock prices and the changes at

00:40:27.956 --> 00:40:29.826
a glance, but we've added spark

00:40:29.826 --> 00:40:32.596
lines, those little charts, that

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:33.896
show the stock performance

00:40:34.486 --> 00:40:35.346
throughout the day.

00:40:35.346 --> 00:40:38.236
And that's cool, but are you

00:40:38.236 --> 00:40:38.956
ready?

00:40:39.326 --> 00:40:40.816
We are so excited to announce

00:40:42.516 --> 00:40:44.396
we're bringing Apple News to

and the top stories in Stocks

00:40:53.566 --> 00:40:55.886
features business news, right,

It's pretty terrific.

00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:01.246
You can tap on any stock to get

00:41:01.246 --> 00:41:02.566
a more detailed view, so you can

00:41:02.566 --> 00:41:04.326
see an interactive chart that

00:41:04.326 --> 00:41:06.286
now includes after hours

00:41:06.376 --> 00:41:09.106

00:41:20.806 --> 00:41:23.186
and of course it's formatted to

00:41:23.276 --> 00:41:26.466
look gorgeous on the iPhone.

00:41:26.546 --> 00:41:29.596

advantage of the larger display,

We've also completely rebuilt

00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:53.326
Voice Memos to make it even

00:41:53.326 --> 00:41:57.106

iCloud support so your

going to love this.

00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:17.686
And we think that iBooks is the

00:42:17.686 --> 00:42:19.256
best way to discover and

00:42:19.256 --> 00:42:21.506

00:43:52.526 --> 00:43:53.766
take a moment to talk about

00:43:53.766 --> 00:43:55.186
something that's on a lot of

00:43:55.186 --> 00:43:56.576
people's minds lately.

00:43:57.416 --> 00:43:59.646
You know, iPhone and iPad are

00:43:59.646 --> 00:44:01.246
some of the most powerful tools

00:44:01.636 --> 00:44:03.896
ever created for learning,

00:44:04.206 --> 00:44:06.386
exploring, and keeping in touch,

00:44:07.196 --> 00:44:09.166
but some apps demand more of our

00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:10.696
attention than we might even

00:44:10.696 --> 00:44:11.306
realize.

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.986
They beg us to use our phone

00:44:14.096 --> 00:44:14.956
when we really should be

00:44:15.176 --> 00:44:16.246
occupying ourselves with

00:44:16.246 --> 00:44:16.946
something else.

00:44:17.026 --> 00:44:18.346
They send us flurries of

00:44:18.346 --> 00:44:20.726
notifications, trying to draw us

00:44:20.826 --> 00:44:22.446
in for fear of missing out.

00:44:23.076 --> 00:44:25.666
And some of us, it's become such

00:44:25.666 --> 00:44:26.986
a habit that, you know, we might

00:44:26.986 --> 00:44:28.516
not even recognize just how

00:44:28.516 --> 00:44:29.766
distracted we've become.

00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:32.556
Well, we've thought deeply about

00:44:32.606 --> 00:44:34.916
this, and today we're announcing

00:44:42.526 --> 00:44:44.306
understand how you're spending

00:44:44.306 --> 00:44:46.846
your time and balance the many

00:44:46.926 --> 00:44:47.976
things that are important to

00:44:47.976 --> 00:44:48.196
you.

00:44:50.776 --> 00:44:51.276
Disturb.

00:44:51.676 --> 00:44:53.416
There are times of the day, or

00:44:53.416 --> 00:44:54.586
times when you just don't want

00:44:54.586 --> 00:44:55.436
to be disturbed, and one of

00:44:55.436 --> 00:44:57.906
those, of course, is at night.

00:44:58.606 --> 00:44:59.546
Sometimes you wake up in the

00:44:59.546 --> 00:45:00.626
middle of the night, and you

00:45:00.626 --> 00:45:01.556
look at your phone, maybe just

00:45:01.596 --> 00:45:02.876
to check the time, and you're

00:45:02.876 --> 00:45:03.926
confronted with something like

00:45:03.926 --> 00:45:06.716
this, a barrage of notifications

00:45:06.716 --> 00:45:08.216
that spin you up and keep you

00:45:08.266 --> 00:45:09.666
from falling back asleep.

00:45:10.326 --> 00:45:12.466
And so we're introducing Do Not

00:45:12.466 --> 00:45:14.656
Disturb during bedtime where all

00:45:14.656 --> 00:45:16.406
you'll see is this.

00:45:17.026 --> 00:45:18.666
Nothing to get you spun up.

00:45:18.666 --> 00:45:19.956
And in the morning, yeah.

00:45:20.516 --> 00:45:26.026
[ Applause ]

00:45:26.526 --> 00:45:27.826
In the morning when you wake up,

00:45:27.976 --> 00:45:29.416
you're gently eased into your

00:45:29.416 --> 00:45:29.976
day.

00:45:29.976 --> 00:45:31.056
You can tap when you want to

00:45:31.056 --> 00:45:32.126
start confronting those

00:45:32.126 --> 00:45:32.916
notifications.

00:45:35.086 --> 00:45:37.056
Now we've all found ourselves in

00:45:37.096 --> 00:45:40.636
situations like this.

00:45:40.956 --> 00:45:42.206
[laughter] Now, rest assured, he

00:45:42.286 --> 00:45:43.736
stuck the landing on this one.

00:45:44.446 --> 00:45:47.026
But now Do Not Disturb can help,

00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:48.766
and we made it easier than ever

00:45:48.766 --> 00:45:49.966
to use Do Not Disturb because

00:45:49.966 --> 00:45:51.346
now we have a great new mode

00:45:51.346 --> 00:45:52.486
where when you press in to Do

00:45:52.486 --> 00:45:53.976
Not Disturb and Control Center,

00:45:54.656 --> 00:45:56.036
you can set an ending time for

00:45:56.036 --> 00:45:56.976
Do Not Disturb for when you

00:45:56.976 --> 00:45:58.686
leave a particular location or

00:45:58.686 --> 00:46:00.026
when an event ends on your

00:46:00.026 --> 00:46:00.456
calendar.

00:46:00.456 --> 00:46:01.416
So I think we're all going to be

00:46:01.416 --> 00:46:03.216
using Do Not Disturb a bunch

00:46:03.216 --> 00:46:03.496
more.

00:46:04.116 --> 00:46:06.086
Now next I want to talk about

00:46:06.086 --> 00:46:06.986
Notifications.

00:46:07.706 --> 00:46:10.596
Now, Notifications help keep us

00:46:10.596 --> 00:46:11.756
informed and connected to

00:46:11.756 --> 00:46:13.166
important things that happen

00:46:13.296 --> 00:46:15.406
throughout the day, and we'd

00:46:15.406 --> 00:46:16.806
like to give you more control

00:46:16.806 --> 00:46:19.116
over how many notifications you

00:46:19.116 --> 00:46:21.456
receive, and so we're enabling

00:46:21.456 --> 00:46:22.986
what we call Instant Tuning for

00:46:22.986 --> 00:46:24.096
Notifications right from the

00:46:24.096 --> 00:46:24.856
lock screen.

00:46:25.466 --> 00:46:26.596
You can press in to a

00:46:26.596 --> 00:46:28.076
notification, and from there,

00:46:28.076 --> 00:46:29.336
you can decide to send future

00:46:29.336 --> 00:46:31.236
notifications from that app

00:46:31.236 --> 00:46:32.676
directly to Notifications

00:46:32.676 --> 00:46:33.976
Center, bypassing your lock

00:46:33.976 --> 00:46:34.326
screen.

00:46:34.766 --> 00:46:36.776
Or turn them off altogether, and

00:46:36.856 --> 00:46:37.956
Siri will even help by

00:46:37.956 --> 00:46:39.356
suggesting that you turn off

00:46:39.356 --> 00:46:41.046
Notifications for apps that

00:46:41.046 --> 00:46:42.186
you're no longer using.

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:44.646
Now, we also wanted to give you

00:46:44.646 --> 00:46:46.436
help managing large numbers of

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:47.326
notifications.

00:46:47.666 --> 00:46:49.236
So I'm thrilled to announce that

00:46:49.236 --> 00:46:51.566
we're bringing to iOS support

00:46:51.566 --> 00:46:52.976
for grouped notifications.

00:46:53.516 --> 00:47:00.896
[ Applause ]

00:47:01.396 --> 00:47:03.136
Notifications are grouped not

00:47:03.196 --> 00:47:05.696
just by app but also by topic

00:47:05.696 --> 00:47:06.746
and thread.

00:47:06.746 --> 00:47:08.146
It gives you a great overview of

00:47:08.146 --> 00:47:09.026
the notifications you've

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:09.516
received.

00:47:10.006 --> 00:47:11.646
You can tap in and look at a

00:47:11.646 --> 00:47:12.656
particular group.

00:47:12.686 --> 00:47:14.496
But of course just as important

00:47:15.106 --> 00:47:17.156
with a single swipe, you can

00:47:17.156 --> 00:47:18.956
triage a whole group of

00:47:18.956 --> 00:47:20.126
notifications away.

00:47:20.366 --> 00:47:21.926
So that's Notifications.

00:47:22.516 --> 00:47:25.706
[ Applause ]

00:47:26.206 --> 00:47:28.206
Now, in addition to these great

00:47:28.356 --> 00:47:30.196
features for helping you limit

00:47:30.196 --> 00:47:32.366
distractions, we wanted to go

00:47:32.476 --> 00:47:34.096
further, and it's with a feature

00:47:34.096 --> 00:47:36.116
we call screen time.

00:47:36.576 --> 00:47:39.106
Screen time empowers you with

00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:41.386
both insight and control over

00:47:41.386 --> 00:47:43.536
how you spend your time, and it

00:47:43.536 --> 00:47:45.266
starts with reports.

00:47:46.046 --> 00:47:48.036
Every week, you get a weekly

00:47:48.036 --> 00:47:50.916
activity summary that details

00:47:51.106 --> 00:47:53.346
how you used your iPhone or

00:47:53.346 --> 00:47:53.636
iPad.

00:47:54.536 --> 00:47:56.496
You tap in, and you get to view

00:47:56.496 --> 00:47:58.236
your full activity report.

00:47:58.946 --> 00:47:59.996
It's really detailed.

00:47:59.996 --> 00:48:01.526
You get deep insight on how much

00:48:01.526 --> 00:48:03.076
time you're spending, where

00:48:03.076 --> 00:48:04.686
you're spending it, and even how

00:48:04.686 --> 00:48:06.046
your use breaks down during the

00:48:06.046 --> 00:48:07.706
day or the night.

00:48:09.146 --> 00:48:10.846
You get a summary of the time

00:48:10.846 --> 00:48:12.996
you're spending in apps, how

00:48:12.996 --> 00:48:15.336
much time you're spending, how

00:48:15.336 --> 00:48:16.946
often per hour you're picking up

00:48:16.946 --> 00:48:18.156
your phone and what's drawing

00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:21.026
you in and what apps are sending

00:48:21.026 --> 00:48:22.826
you the most notifications.

00:48:23.446 --> 00:48:25.236
Now, equipped with this insight,

00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:26.956
you can make decisions about how

00:48:26.956 --> 00:48:28.356
much time you want to spend with

00:48:28.356 --> 00:48:29.296
your device each day.

00:48:30.006 --> 00:48:31.096
But we know there are people who

00:48:31.096 --> 00:48:33.006
would like a little extra help

00:48:33.006 --> 00:48:34.626
in managing their use of apps,

00:48:34.936 --> 00:48:36.406
and for them we've created App

00:48:36.656 --> 00:48:37.176
Limits.

00:48:37.676 --> 00:48:39.176
So if in your activity report

00:48:39.946 --> 00:48:41.346
you see an app where you might

00:48:41.346 --> 00:48:42.296
want to be spending a little bit

00:48:42.296 --> 00:48:44.946
less time, well you can set your

00:48:44.946 --> 00:48:47.106
own limit, and then during the

00:48:47.106 --> 00:48:49.456
day, when you're using the app,

00:48:49.456 --> 00:48:50.276
you receive a helpful

00:48:50.276 --> 00:48:51.556
notification letting you know

00:48:51.556 --> 00:48:52.666
time is almost up.

00:48:53.516 --> 00:49:01.606
[ Applause ]

00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:03.106
And once you've reached your

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:04.246
limit, instead of the app,

00:49:04.826 --> 00:49:06.146
you'll see this.

00:49:06.146 --> 00:49:07.146
It's time to move on.

00:49:07.706 --> 00:49:08.596
Now, we'll let you grant

00:49:08.596 --> 00:49:09.746
yourself and extension if you

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:11.396
want, but we'll give you a

00:49:11.396 --> 00:49:12.796
reminder later to move along.

00:49:13.056 --> 00:49:15.586
Now, this is also in sync across

00:49:15.676 --> 00:49:16.996
your iPhone and iPad, so your

00:49:16.996 --> 00:49:18.796
limits apply to your total

00:49:18.796 --> 00:49:19.386
usage.

00:49:19.686 --> 00:49:20.536
And we think this is going to be

00:49:20.536 --> 00:49:23.626
helpful for many people, but

00:49:23.686 --> 00:49:25.556
especially for some kids.

00:49:26.246 --> 00:49:28.006
And we know this is something

00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.266
that can help families achieve

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:30.986
the right balance for them.

00:49:31.266 --> 00:49:32.476
And of course it starts with

00:49:32.476 --> 00:49:33.856
providing your kids with great

00:49:33.856 --> 00:49:34.956
information so they get an

00:49:34.956 --> 00:49:36.496
activity report of their own,

00:49:36.496 --> 00:49:39.366
but as a parent, you get one as

00:49:39.366 --> 00:49:43.076
well on your device, and based

00:49:43.076 --> 00:49:44.606
on what you see, you have the

00:49:44.606 --> 00:49:47.216
option of creating allowances.

00:49:48.516 --> 00:49:54.556
[ Applause ]

00:49:55.056 --> 00:49:56.596
Now you have many options.

00:49:56.686 --> 00:49:58.416
One of them is downtime, time

00:49:58.416 --> 00:49:59.406
when you want your kids to

00:49:59.446 --> 00:50:00.926
unplug altogether.

00:50:01.056 --> 00:50:02.616
For instance, at bedtime.

00:50:03.366 --> 00:50:05.636
And you can also limit your

00:50:06.156 --> 00:50:08.696
kids' time in apps by category

00:50:08.696 --> 00:50:10.126
or by individual app.

00:50:11.046 --> 00:50:12.206
Now, there's some apps you may

00:50:12.206 --> 00:50:13.586
want to always allow them to

00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:13.866
use.

00:50:13.866 --> 00:50:14.936
For instance, you may want them

00:50:14.936 --> 00:50:16.236
to be able to get at the phone

00:50:16.236 --> 00:50:17.526
at all times, so they can

00:50:17.526 --> 00:50:18.236
contact you.

00:50:18.236 --> 00:50:19.326
Or you may want to give them

00:50:19.326 --> 00:50:21.286
access to educational apps.

00:50:21.346 --> 00:50:23.576
And you can also limit access to

00:50:23.576 --> 00:50:25.926
only movies, apps, and websites

00:50:25.926 --> 00:50:28.116
that you deem age appropriate.

00:50:28.786 --> 00:50:30.496
Now, this works of course across

00:50:30.556 --> 00:50:33.026
their iPhone and iPad, and it's

00:50:33.026 --> 00:50:34.776
uses family sharing, so it's

00:50:34.776 --> 00:50:36.776
super easy to set up, and you

00:50:36.776 --> 00:50:38.996
can manage it all remotely from

00:50:56.046 --> 00:50:57.596
Now, next I'd like to talk about

00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:59.306
one of the most important uses

00:50:59.376 --> 00:51:01.196
of our devices, and that's

00:51:01.446 --> 00:51:02.356
communication.

00:51:02.356 --> 00:51:04.716
And we'll start with messages.

00:51:05.566 --> 00:51:07.516
Messages has given us fun ways

00:51:07.516 --> 00:51:09.366
to express ourselves with emoji

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:12.116
and now Animoji, and one of the

00:51:12.116 --> 00:51:14.116
things that make Animoji so fun

00:51:14.266 --> 00:51:15.706
is how expressive they are, you

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:17.666
know, from smiles to frowns, to

00:51:17.666 --> 00:51:19.236
nods of the head and blinking of

00:51:19.236 --> 00:51:19.726
the eye.

00:51:20.326 --> 00:51:22.626
Animoji does such an amazing job

00:51:22.626 --> 00:51:23.896
tracking our expressions.

00:51:23.896 --> 00:51:25.586
And this year, we're taking

00:51:25.586 --> 00:51:27.456
Animoji to a whole new level,

00:51:27.456 --> 00:51:29.606
the breakthrough new technology

00:51:29.676 --> 00:51:32.326
we call Tongue Detection.

00:51:35.606 --> 00:51:36.096
[applause] That's right.

00:51:36.796 --> 00:51:38.426
Now, you can make your favorite

Animoji do this.

00:51:41.856 --> 00:51:43.126
We're all going to be sticking

00:51:43.126 --> 00:51:44.606
out our tongues to our phones in

00:51:44.606 --> 00:51:45.276
the near future.

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:48.116
Now, we've also, we're also

00:51:48.116 --> 00:51:49.486
introducing some great new

00:51:49.486 --> 00:51:50.906
Animoji that I think you're all

00:51:50.906 --> 00:51:52.726
going to love, like ghost,

00:51:54.136 --> 00:51:59.906
koala, tiger, and T-Rex.

00:52:00.546 --> 00:52:05.036
But we wanted to take Animoji

00:52:05.286 --> 00:52:07.566
even further by making them even

00:52:07.566 --> 00:52:08.366
more personal.

00:52:09.636 --> 00:52:11.676
So I'm thrilled today to

00:52:11.676 --> 00:52:13.546
announce the arrival of the era

With Memoji you can create your

very own personalized Animoji.

you or the real you.

00:52:39.586 --> 00:52:41.816
And we've worked hard to build a

00:52:41.966 --> 00:52:43.696
deep set of customization

00:52:43.696 --> 00:52:45.216
options to let our customers

00:52:45.466 --> 00:52:48.916

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:50.076
of Memoji.

00:52:50.666 --> 00:52:52.296
It's really incredible what you

00:52:52.296 --> 00:52:53.026
can create.

00:52:54.106 --> 00:52:55.436
And we've designed a beautiful

00:52:55.436 --> 00:52:57.026
new experience to create these

00:52:57.026 --> 00:52:58.616

00:52:58.756 --> 00:53:00.586
fun and easy.

00:53:01.216 --> 00:53:02.696
Now, to tell you more about it,

00:53:02.726 --> 00:53:03.636
I'd like to invite one of the

Good morning.

I cannot wait to tell you what's

00:53:18.436 --> 00:53:19.106
new with Messages.

00:53:19.106 --> 00:53:21.196
Let's get started with Animoji.

00:53:21.896 --> 00:53:23.146
First, you need to meet the

00:53:23.146 --> 00:53:24.756
newest members of the team.

00:53:25.396 --> 00:53:27.406
We've got a new cat in town, our

00:53:27.406 --> 00:53:28.006
tiger.

00:53:29.536 --> 00:53:31.516
She's so cute.

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:35.316
And now, my personal favorite,

00:53:35.716 --> 00:53:37.056
the koala.

00:53:37.396 --> 00:53:42.406
Just getting excited scrolling

00:53:42.406 --> 00:53:42.916
through here.

00:53:43.556 --> 00:53:44.786
They can't all be cute and

00:53:44.786 --> 00:53:46.216
cuddly though, so here's our

00:53:46.216 --> 00:53:46.796
T-Rex.

00:53:46.796 --> 00:53:53.216
And we've our very own friendly

00:53:53.216 --> 00:53:53.906
little ghost.

00:53:54.886 --> 00:53:58.916
So much fun.

00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:01.666
And if I swipe right, here's

00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:04.096
where I can create my very own

00:54:04.096 --> 00:54:05.096
Memoji.

00:54:05.266 --> 00:54:06.916
Let me show you just how easy it

00:54:06.916 --> 00:54:07.756
is.

00:54:08.096 --> 00:54:09.886
I recently chopped my hair, so I

00:54:09.886 --> 00:54:11.406
want one that matches the new

00:54:11.406 --> 00:54:12.156
me.

00:54:12.656 --> 00:54:14.026
So I've selected a skin color,

00:54:14.026 --> 00:54:16.036
and now I'm trying to figure out

00:54:16.356 --> 00:54:17.836
just the right amount of

00:54:17.836 --> 00:54:18.246
freckles.

00:54:18.516 --> 00:54:20.836
It's a real Goldilocks scenario.

00:54:22.106 --> 00:54:23.496
Yeah, these are just right.

00:54:24.406 --> 00:54:27.156
Okay. Onto the main event.

00:54:27.816 --> 00:54:29.726
There are so many hairstyles to

00:54:29.726 --> 00:54:30.346
choose from.

00:54:30.796 --> 00:54:31.926
First, I'm going to grab my

00:54:31.926 --> 00:54:34.036
color, and then like I said, I

00:54:34.036 --> 00:54:35.946
need to go a little bit shorter.

00:54:36.556 --> 00:54:36.996
All right.

00:54:37.776 --> 00:54:39.936
Nope, this is the one.

00:54:41.126 --> 00:54:42.626
Now that I'm all set, I can of

00:54:42.626 --> 00:54:44.606
course select my eye color, and

00:54:44.606 --> 00:54:46.186
what's really amazing is as I'm

00:54:46.186 --> 00:54:48.046
making changes, the character up

00:54:48.046 --> 00:54:49.646
above is coming to life.

00:54:51.516 --> 00:54:53.656
There are tons of options for me

00:54:53.656 --> 00:54:54.226
to customize.

00:54:54.276 --> 00:54:56.686
I could add earrings, but what I

00:54:56.686 --> 00:54:58.676
really want is a great pair of

00:54:58.676 --> 00:54:59.956
Sunnies, so I'm going to come

00:54:59.956 --> 00:55:02.946
over to eyewear and pick out

00:55:03.836 --> 00:55:05.346
some frames.

00:55:05.776 --> 00:55:07.036
Maybe not for today.

00:55:07.326 --> 00:55:10.096
I think I need two lenses.

00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:12.136
These are the ones.

00:55:12.506 --> 00:55:13.796
Now that I have frames, I'm

00:55:13.796 --> 00:55:15.266
going to tint my lenses to make

00:55:15.266 --> 00:55:16.616

to introduce you to.

00:55:52.596 --> 00:55:54.206
This wasn't even in Craig's

00:55:54.206 --> 00:55:54.686
slides.

00:55:55.266 --> 00:55:57.276
We are bringing fun effects into

00:55:57.276 --> 00:55:58.236
the Messages camera.

00:55:58.816 --> 00:55:59.636
Let's take a look.

00:55:59.636 --> 00:56:01.736
I've a message here from my

00:56:01.736 --> 00:56:02.446
partner.

00:56:02.806 --> 00:56:04.506
It looks like he's informing me

00:56:04.506 --> 00:56:05.846
that he's bought our dog,

00:56:05.846 --> 00:56:08.636
Ferdinand, yet another tiny dog

00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:08.866
hat.

00:56:09.446 --> 00:56:10.436
This isn't even the first.

00:56:10.436 --> 00:56:12.786
I think this is the perfect

00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:14.446
opportunity for a response with

00:56:14.476 --> 00:56:15.966
this new fun camera.

00:56:16.716 --> 00:56:17.836
So I'll tap to pull up the

00:56:17.836 --> 00:56:19.576

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:20.926
little star over here on the

00:56:20.926 --> 00:56:21.146
left.

00:56:22.286 --> 00:56:24.316
Tapping on that gives me a strip

00:56:24.316 --> 00:56:25.756
with all sorts of new effects.

00:56:26.446 --> 00:56:27.686

00:56:27.686 --> 00:56:29.256
shapes or text.

00:56:30.166 --> 00:56:33.076

Ooh. So this is comic book.

00:56:35.616 --> 00:56:37.536
It's really fun, but for a

00:56:37.536 --> 00:56:40.096
response about a tiny dog hat, I

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:41.326
think I'm going to go in a

00:56:41.326 --> 00:56:42.926
different artistic direction.

00:56:44.236 --> 00:56:45.786
So what I really need to do is

00:56:45.786 --> 00:56:47.016
add a sticker from one of my

Yeah. Facetime is the way that

00:57:58.826 --> 00:58:00.206
so many of us connect with the

people in our lives and share

00:58:01.786 --> 00:58:02.796
some of our most important

00:58:02.796 --> 00:58:04.456
moments, and it's helped us

deepen our connect with people

introduced a great new way

because Facetime is now

01:00:15.426 --> 01:00:17.616
Now, what you probably notice is

01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:19.066
when Lauren spoke, her tile

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:20.996
automatically got larger to

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:22.716
reflect her prominence in the

01:00:22.716 --> 01:00:23.416
conversation.

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:25.216
This is totally automatic.

01:00:25.486 --> 01:00:26.736
Hey Roberto, how's it going back

01:00:26.776 --> 01:00:27.616
there in Cupertino?

01:00:28.366 --> 01:00:30.256
>> I'd say it's going pretty

01:00:30.446 --> 01:00:32.196
well, and Lauren, sorry for

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:34.166
stealing your spotlight.

01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:35.296
>> So this works of course for

01:00:35.296 --> 01:00:37.146
people in the roster as well.

01:00:37.146 --> 01:00:38.076
When they speak, they come

01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:38.526
forward.

01:00:38.656 --> 01:00:39.746
Hey Christopher, you ready to

01:00:39.746 --> 01:00:40.546
make your big entrance?

01:00:40.586 --> 01:00:43.016
>> Finally, my moment has come.

01:00:43.166 --> 01:00:43.876
Hello world.

01:00:43.976 --> 01:00:47.696
>> Now, well done.

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:51.456
Now you can control this too, so

01:00:51.496 --> 01:00:52.736
I want to bring Woody front and

01:00:52.736 --> 01:00:55.026
center, I just double tab.

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:55.846
There he is.

01:00:58.426 --> 01:00:59.826
Woody, your baby is performing

01:00:59.826 --> 01:01:01.016
admirably here.

01:01:01.336 --> 01:01:02.066
>> Thanks Craig.

01:01:02.066 --> 01:01:03.066
It's exciting to finally be able

01:01:03.066 --> 01:01:04.106
to share Group Facetime with

01:01:04.106 --> 01:01:04.406
everyone.

01:01:04.626 --> 01:01:05.856
>> It sure is.

01:01:05.856 --> 01:01:07.846
Now, we have not only all of

01:01:07.896 --> 01:01:09.696
this, but we've also brought the

01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:11.406
fun effects to the Facetime

01:01:11.616 --> 01:01:12.006
camera.

01:01:12.006 --> 01:01:14.286
I can just tap in, and I have

01:01:14.286 --> 01:01:17.956
access to Animoji, filters, and

01:01:18.036 --> 01:01:19.936
all of my sticker packs, and

01:01:19.936 --> 01:01:21.476
everyone else on the call can

01:01:21.476 --> 01:01:22.716
apply them too.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.186
Now this is the future.

01:01:26.976 --> 01:01:27.326
>> Hey, Craig.

01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:28.976
Check this out, I'm a comic book

01:01:28.976 --> 01:01:30.396
koala, something I've always

01:01:30.396 --> 01:01:31.936
wanted to be.

01:01:31.936 --> 01:01:32.486
[laughter]

01:01:32.486 --> 01:01:33.666
>> I'm glad you've finally been

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:34.776
able to express that side of

01:01:34.776 --> 01:01:35.696
yourself, Roberto.

01:01:35.696 --> 01:01:38.026
Hey, Tim, is that you?

01:01:38.326 --> 01:01:39.146
>> Yeah, it's me.

01:01:39.146 --> 01:01:40.306
I've signed up to help test

01:01:40.306 --> 01:01:40.896
Facetime.

01:01:40.896 --> 01:01:41.656
>> All right.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:49.026
[applause] Well, well thank you,

01:01:49.116 --> 01:01:49.226
Tim.

01:01:49.226 --> 01:01:50.426
Every little bit counts.

01:01:51.246 --> 01:01:52.636
>> Happy to help, and thanks to

01:01:52.636 --> 01:01:54.276
everyone on the Facetime team

01:01:54.276 --> 01:01:55.566
for making it a reality.

01:01:55.776 --> 01:01:57.906
I can't wait to start using it

01:01:57.906 --> 01:01:59.436
every Sunday night to follow the

01:01:59.546 --> 01:02:03.036
leadership team.

01:02:03.036 --> 01:02:04.086
>> Looking forward to that, Tim.

01:02:04.086 --> 01:02:06.316
Of course what I'm really

01:02:06.316 --> 01:02:07.716
looking forward to is getting

01:02:07.716 --> 01:02:09.716
Group Facetime to everyone on

01:02:09.716 --> 01:02:10.516
iOS 12.

01:02:10.516 --> 01:02:12.036
Thanks guys for a fantastic

01:02:12.066 --> 01:02:12.316
call.

01:02:12.316 --> 01:02:12.966
We'll see you back in Cupertino.

01:02:13.516 --> 01:02:21.726
[ Applause ]

01:02:22.226 --> 01:02:23.286
So that's Group Facetime.

01:02:24.086 --> 01:02:26.586
It works on iPhone, iPad, and

01:02:26.686 --> 01:02:29.266
Mac, and you can even answer an

01:02:29.336 --> 01:02:31.296
audio on your wrist on your

01:02:31.296 --> 01:02:32.176
Apple Watch.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.466
So that's Facetime and Messages,

01:02:35.826 --> 01:02:37.946
and this is iOS 12.

01:02:38.446 --> 01:02:40.906
Improved performance, new AR

01:02:40.906 --> 01:02:43.856
experiences, Siri Suggestions,

01:02:44.176 --> 01:02:46.676
Screen Time, Memoji and fun

01:02:46.676 --> 01:02:48.156
effects in the Messages camera,

01:02:48.626 --> 01:02:49.936
and Group Facetime.

01:02:50.106 --> 01:02:52.056
I hope you like it.

01:02:52.156 --> 01:02:53.046
I'm going to hand it back to

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:53.386
Tim.

01:02:53.446 --> 01:02:53.966
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

01:02:58.356 --> 01:02:59.076
>> Thank you, Craig.

01:03:01.016 --> 01:03:03.636
IOS 12 looks fantastic, and we

01:03:03.636 --> 01:03:05.326
can't wait for everyone to get

01:03:05.326 --> 01:03:06.756
their hands on it.

01:03:07.056 --> 01:03:09.216
Next up, we'd like to talk about

01:03:09.216 --> 01:03:10.736
the Apple Watch.

01:03:10.736 --> 01:03:14.586
Yeah. [applause] When we began

01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:15.866
development of the watch many

01:03:15.866 --> 01:03:17.866
years ago, we had a vision for

01:03:17.866 --> 01:03:20.216
just how impactful and essential

01:03:20.216 --> 01:03:22.796
it could become in our lives, so

01:03:22.796 --> 01:03:24.866
we worked very hard to create

01:03:24.986 --> 01:03:26.916
something that you would love

01:03:26.916 --> 01:03:28.696
and want to wear all the time,

01:03:29.526 --> 01:03:31.776
and customers do love it.

01:03:31.776 --> 01:03:33.636
In fact, Apple Watch is number

01:03:33.636 --> 01:03:38.216
one in customer satisfaction,

01:03:38.216 --> 01:03:39.216
[applause] and not just this

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.066
year, but every single year

01:03:41.066 --> 01:03:43.766
since we launched in 2015.

01:03:44.296 --> 01:03:46.246
And growth has been off the

01:03:46.246 --> 01:03:46.936
charts.

01:03:47.796 --> 01:03:50.356
Apple Watch grew 60 percent last

01:03:50.356 --> 01:03:50.686
year.

01:03:51.416 --> 01:03:53.056
We're constantly hearing from

01:03:53.056 --> 01:03:55.406
customers about the many ways

01:03:55.406 --> 01:03:57.176
that the Apple Watch has changed

01:03:57.176 --> 01:03:57.866
their lives.

01:03:58.196 --> 01:04:00.646
And I'd like to share just one

01:04:00.646 --> 01:04:02.696
of them with you this morning.

01:04:04.036 --> 01:04:06.696
Mary Dovgen was boating with her

01:04:06.756 --> 01:04:08.956
husband, John, when due to a

01:04:08.956 --> 01:04:11.406
medical condition all of John's

01:04:11.406 --> 01:04:13.496
muscles went completely limp,

01:04:13.496 --> 01:04:15.536
and he fell into the ice cold

01:04:15.536 --> 01:04:16.046
water.

01:04:17.036 --> 01:04:18.546
With her arms wrapped around

01:04:18.546 --> 01:04:21.086
John to keep him from drowning,

01:04:21.236 --> 01:04:24.006
Mary could not reach her phone

01:04:24.006 --> 01:04:25.846
to call for help.

01:04:26.436 --> 01:04:28.696
But with her Apple Watch, she

01:04:28.696 --> 01:04:31.306
was able to call Siri, or to use

01:04:31.406 --> 01:04:34.666
Siri to call 911, rescuers soon

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:36.936
arrived, and saved John's live.

01:04:38.516 --> 01:04:42.166
[ Applause ]

01:04:42.666 --> 01:04:45.426
As Mary told us, if it wasn't

01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:47.976
for my Apple Watch, he really

01:04:47.976 --> 01:04:49.046
would not be here today.

01:04:50.706 --> 01:04:52.176
This is just one of the many

01:04:52.176 --> 01:04:53.726
stories that we've heard about

01:04:53.726 --> 01:04:55.446
about how Apple Watch is

01:04:55.446 --> 01:04:57.016
impacting people's lives.

01:04:57.536 --> 01:04:59.416
They range from getting people

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:01.026
to be more active, to helping

01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:04.556
users live a healthier life, or

01:05:04.556 --> 01:05:06.296
even to alerting users to an

01:05:06.296 --> 01:05:07.516
elevated heart rate.

01:05:08.046 --> 01:05:10.496
Apple Watch brings such amazing

01:05:10.496 --> 01:05:12.966
capabilities right to the wrist,

01:05:13.496 --> 01:05:14.746
and of course at the heart of

01:05:14.746 --> 01:05:17.206
this is watchOS.

01:05:17.586 --> 01:05:19.206
We're excited to introduce

01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:22.016
watchOS 5 today, which brings

01:05:22.066 --> 01:05:23.976
even more ways for you to stay

01:05:23.976 --> 01:05:26.906
active and connected, and I'd

01:05:26.906 --> 01:05:28.676
like to hand it off to Kevin

01:05:28.676 --> 01:05:30.196
Lynch to tell you all about it.

01:05:30.506 --> 01:05:30.876
Kevin.

01:05:31.516 --> 01:05:36.546
[ Applause ]

01:05:37.046 --> 01:05:38.286
>> Good morning.

01:05:38.286 --> 01:05:39.286
You know, stories like that,

01:05:39.286 --> 01:05:40.476
about how Apple Watch is

01:05:40.476 --> 01:05:41.596
supporting people around the

01:05:41.596 --> 01:05:44.106
world in even extreme situations

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.456
like Mary and John's but also in

01:05:45.456 --> 01:05:46.936
their daily lives is really

01:05:46.936 --> 01:05:48.196
super motivating to us as a

01:05:48.196 --> 01:05:48.536
team.

01:05:48.536 --> 01:05:50.506
And there are things you do

01:05:50.506 --> 01:05:51.906
every day that shape your life.

01:05:51.996 --> 01:05:54.336
And Apple Watch has two

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:55.266
[inaudible] working to help you

01:05:55.546 --> 01:05:57.046
support those activities every

01:05:57.046 --> 01:05:57.316
day.

01:05:58.636 --> 01:05:59.766
First, staying active to

01:05:59.816 --> 01:06:00.986
increase your well-being and

01:06:00.986 --> 01:06:02.336
health and second being

01:06:02.336 --> 01:06:03.406
connected to the people and the

01:06:03.406 --> 01:06:04.566
information that you care most

01:06:04.566 --> 01:06:06.256
about, and we're moving watchOS

01:06:06.256 --> 01:06:07.726
in both of these areas.

01:06:08.406 --> 01:06:09.516
Let's start with health and

01:06:09.516 --> 01:06:09.996
fitness.

01:06:10.656 --> 01:06:11.596
Now much of the power in the

01:06:11.596 --> 01:06:12.726
health and fitness features that

01:06:12.726 --> 01:06:14.656
we've put in Watch are really

01:06:14.656 --> 01:06:15.936
empowered by the investment we

01:06:15.936 --> 01:06:18.056
do to make sure the data you see

01:06:18.056 --> 01:06:19.046
is accurate.

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:20.376
The data from our custom-built

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.216
heart rate sensor,

01:06:21.216 --> 01:06:23.436
Accelerometer, Gyro, GPS, are

01:06:23.436 --> 01:06:24.596
all thoroughly validated.

01:06:25.126 --> 01:06:26.456
In fact, from our fitness lab,

01:06:26.756 --> 01:06:28.416
we've studied over six terabytes

01:06:28.416 --> 01:06:30.496
of data where 12,000 study

01:06:30.496 --> 01:06:32.466
participants logged over 90,000

01:06:32.466 --> 01:06:33.466
hours of sessions.

01:06:33.496 --> 01:06:35.056
And they actually burned 2.3

01:06:35.056 --> 01:06:36.596
million calories doing this.

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:38.436
We believe this is the largest

01:06:38.436 --> 01:06:39.876
biometric data collection of its

01:06:39.876 --> 01:06:40.266
kind.

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.906
And we take this information and

01:06:42.906 --> 01:06:43.966
we work to integrate this

01:06:44.036 --> 01:06:45.066
seamlessly with the user

01:06:45.066 --> 01:06:46.536
experience so when you raise

01:06:46.536 --> 01:06:47.626
your wrist and you look at your

01:06:47.626 --> 01:06:49.126
activity rings, the information

01:06:49.126 --> 01:06:50.136
is not only accurate, but it's

01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:51.386
also meaningful to you.

01:06:51.786 --> 01:06:52.856
We really love hearing about

01:06:52.856 --> 01:06:54.246
your focus on closing these

01:06:54.246 --> 01:06:54.626
rings.

01:06:55.516 --> 01:06:56.596
And we really enable this

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:57.506
through a number of ways in

01:06:57.506 --> 01:06:58.176
Apple Watch.

01:06:58.846 --> 01:07:00.666
First, of course, we do daily

01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:01.706
coaching so you can see what

01:07:01.706 --> 01:07:02.786
your goals are for the day.

01:07:03.446 --> 01:07:04.826
We also support celebrations

01:07:04.826 --> 01:07:06.976
when you achieve your goals, and

01:07:06.976 --> 01:07:07.876
we have special edition

01:07:07.876 --> 01:07:09.496
challenges like the most recent

01:07:09.496 --> 01:07:11.176
birthday challenge that we did.

01:07:11.586 --> 01:07:13.236
And on a monthly basis, we do

01:07:13.236 --> 01:07:14.186
monthly goals that are

01:07:14.186 --> 01:07:15.256
personalized to you.

01:07:15.256 --> 01:07:17.626
And of course the activity app

01:07:17.626 --> 01:07:19.076
also supports activity sharing,

01:07:19.346 --> 01:07:20.366
which has become one of the most

01:07:20.366 --> 01:07:21.826
popular features of the activity

01:07:21.976 --> 01:07:22.306
app.

01:07:22.676 --> 01:07:25.056
Many of you love the excitement

01:07:25.056 --> 01:07:26.076
of good old-fashioned

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:27.516
competition though, so in

01:07:27.516 --> 01:07:29.416
watchOS 5, you can challenge any

01:07:29.416 --> 01:07:30.936
of your activity-sharing friends

01:07:30.936 --> 01:07:32.326
to a seven-day competition

01:07:32.326 --> 01:07:33.046
whenever you would like.

01:07:33.046 --> 01:07:35.496
And if they accept, you each try

01:07:35.496 --> 01:07:37.006
to win the week by closing your

01:07:37.006 --> 01:07:38.066
rings and earning points.

01:07:38.326 --> 01:07:39.296
You earn one point for each

01:07:39.326 --> 01:07:40.106
percent of a ring that you

01:07:40.106 --> 01:07:40.516
close.

01:07:40.596 --> 01:07:42.096
And while you're in the middle

01:07:42.096 --> 01:07:43.646
of a competition, your progress

01:07:43.646 --> 01:07:45.146
notifications are updated, do

01:07:45.146 --> 01:07:46.436
not only show you the progress

01:07:46.436 --> 01:07:47.586
your friends are making, but

01:07:47.586 --> 01:07:48.786
also where you stand in the

01:07:48.786 --> 01:07:49.506
competition.

01:07:50.046 --> 01:07:52.876
And when you win, you receive a

01:07:52.876 --> 01:07:53.376
new award.

01:07:53.906 --> 01:07:55.026
We're really excited about this

01:07:55.026 --> 01:07:55.716
edition, and if you're

01:07:55.716 --> 01:07:56.606
competition, it gives you a

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:57.946
whole new way to enjoy the

01:07:57.946 --> 01:07:59.476
activity app.

01:07:59.866 --> 01:08:00.496
Now when you're doing

01:08:06.156 --> 01:08:06.556
[applause]-- now when you do

01:08:06.556 --> 01:08:07.696
want to go do a workout, there's

01:08:07.696 --> 01:08:08.886
a lot of workout types you can

01:08:08.886 --> 01:08:10.606
choose from, and they all have

01:08:10.656 --> 01:08:11.876
custom algorithms to measure

01:08:11.876 --> 01:08:13.466
things like calorie burn, pace,

01:08:13.466 --> 01:08:15.216
distance, elevation gain, and

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.076
when you're swimming, it even

01:08:16.076 --> 01:08:17.416
counts laps and detects which

01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:18.526
swim strokes you're using.

01:08:18.756 --> 01:08:20.376
And with Gym Kit, your metrics

01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:21.756
are in sync with your favorite

01:08:21.756 --> 01:08:22.395
gym equipment.

01:08:22.626 --> 01:08:23.546
And we're really excited to

01:08:23.546 --> 01:08:24.486
bring more enhancements to

01:08:24.486 --> 01:08:27.046
workouts in watchOS 5, starting

01:08:27.046 --> 01:08:28.296
with a new workout type for

01:08:28.296 --> 01:08:28.926
yoga.

01:08:29.116 --> 01:08:30.336
Now this works primarily from

01:08:30.336 --> 01:08:32.725
your heart rate, and we

01:08:32.725 --> 01:08:34.256
calibrate this to your fitness

01:08:34.256 --> 01:08:35.595
through the rest of your day, so

01:08:35.595 --> 01:08:36.526
now you can more accurately

01:08:36.526 --> 01:08:38.095
track those yoga sessions

01:08:38.095 --> 01:08:39.616
including those intense Vinyasa

01:08:39.656 --> 01:08:40.026
sessions.

01:08:40.636 --> 01:08:42.685
New we've also added a new

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.166
workout type for hiking.

01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:45.986
This takes into account pace and

01:08:45.986 --> 01:08:47.676
heart rate and elevation gain so

01:08:47.776 --> 01:08:48.805
you can more accurately get

01:08:48.805 --> 01:08:50.055
exercise credit while you're

01:08:50.055 --> 01:08:51.756
hiking on steep terrain or

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:52.626
really long stages.

01:08:53.336 --> 01:08:56.725
And Apple watch has become a

01:08:56.725 --> 01:08:58.536
really great running companion

01:08:58.536 --> 01:08:59.816
especially now that we've added

01:08:59.816 --> 01:09:01.746
GPS and cellular and music

01:09:01.746 --> 01:09:02.366
streaming.

01:09:02.366 --> 01:09:03.496
And we're making this an even

01:09:03.496 --> 01:09:04.886
better experience now for

01:09:04.886 --> 01:09:06.166
training runs and races.

01:09:06.706 --> 01:09:07.666
In addition to current and

01:09:07.666 --> 01:09:09.066
average pace, you now have the

01:09:09.066 --> 01:09:10.456
option to keep track of your

01:09:10.456 --> 01:09:12.126
rolling mile pace, which is how

01:09:12.126 --> 01:09:13.435
fast you ran the immediately

01:09:13.435 --> 01:09:14.265
preceding mile.

01:09:14.986 --> 01:09:16.176
You can also now set a custom

01:09:16.176 --> 01:09:17.876
pace alert, so your Apple watch

01:09:17.876 --> 01:09:18.816
will tap you when you're above

01:09:18.816 --> 01:09:19.716
or below the pace that you've

01:09:19.716 --> 01:09:20.026
set.

01:09:20.916 --> 01:09:22.236
And finally, runners will now

01:09:22.236 --> 01:09:23.746
get cadence so you can see your

01:09:23.746 --> 01:09:24.836
current steps per minute.

01:09:24.836 --> 01:09:26.366
We're really excited for runners

01:09:26.366 --> 01:09:27.506
to try these out.

01:09:28.676 --> 01:09:28.906
Now--

01:09:29.515 --> 01:09:33.935
[ Applause ]

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:35.526
Now there are sometimes when you

01:09:35.526 --> 01:09:36.576
forget to start a workout on

01:09:36.576 --> 01:09:37.446
watch, but you've started

01:09:37.446 --> 01:09:39.176
working out, and to solve this

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:40.816
now, we're adding automatic

01:09:40.816 --> 01:09:41.765
workout detection.

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:47.555
[ Applause ]

01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:48.975
So your Apple Watch will now

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:50.106
offer to start tracking your

01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:51.256
workout if it senses that you're

01:09:51.256 --> 01:09:51.856
beginning one.

01:09:52.036 --> 01:09:53.326
And even if you press start

01:09:53.326 --> 01:09:54.866
sometime after you began working

01:09:54.866 --> 01:09:56.546
out, you'll get retroactive

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:57.706
credit for the workouts that you

01:09:57.706 --> 01:09:58.026
did.

01:09:59.516 --> 01:10:03.156
[ Applause ]

01:10:03.656 --> 01:10:04.946
And [inaudible] wills support

01:10:04.946 --> 01:10:06.326
all these great workouts on

01:10:06.326 --> 01:10:07.016
Apple Watch.

01:10:08.326 --> 01:10:09.146
Now when you reduce the

01:10:09.146 --> 01:10:10.256
intensity of your movement or

01:10:10.256 --> 01:10:11.836
your heart rate decreases but

01:10:11.836 --> 01:10:13.046
you forget to end your workout,

01:10:13.046 --> 01:10:14.596
of course Watch will also detect

01:10:14.626 --> 01:10:15.886
that and suggest that you stop.

01:10:16.516 --> 01:10:21.406
[ Applause ]

01:10:21.906 --> 01:10:23.256
So, all these new features,

01:10:23.346 --> 01:10:25.036
activity competitions, the new

01:10:25.036 --> 01:10:26.866
yoga and hiking workout, new

01:10:26.866 --> 01:10:28.446
features for runners and

01:10:28.446 --> 01:10:30.286
automatic workout detection are

01:10:30.286 --> 01:10:31.586
all enabling you to more

01:10:31.586 --> 01:10:32.876
accurately track your workouts

01:10:32.876 --> 01:10:34.866
and stay motivated while you do.

01:10:35.846 --> 01:10:36.826
Now let's talk about being

01:10:36.826 --> 01:10:37.476
connected.

01:10:38.496 --> 01:10:39.606
Apple Watch enables you to

01:10:39.606 --> 01:10:41.256
remain in the moment while also

01:10:41.256 --> 01:10:42.756
easily connected to the people

01:10:42.756 --> 01:10:43.766
and information that you care

01:10:43.766 --> 01:10:44.186
about.

01:10:44.686 --> 01:10:45.926
And the introduction of cellular

01:10:45.926 --> 01:10:47.126
made this even better.

01:10:47.126 --> 01:10:48.416
You can stay connected even when

01:10:48.416 --> 01:10:49.516
you're going out for an evening,

01:10:49.596 --> 01:10:50.986
running some errands, or even

01:10:50.986 --> 01:10:52.016
going for a swim.

01:10:52.546 --> 01:10:53.716
Or, stay in touch when your

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:54.686
phone might not be easily

01:10:54.686 --> 01:10:55.296
available to you.

01:10:56.316 --> 01:10:57.366
And staying connected with

01:10:57.366 --> 01:10:58.546
people you love is something

01:10:58.546 --> 01:10:59.756
that our customers love about

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:00.356
Apple Watch.

01:11:00.746 --> 01:11:01.906
You can easily make or receive a

01:11:01.906 --> 01:11:03.226
phone call, and you can hear the

01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:04.756
emotion and tone at the other

real time.

01:11:07.446 --> 01:11:08.816
Or you can use Messages to have

01:11:08.846 --> 01:11:10.886
impromptu, short conversations

01:11:10.886 --> 01:11:11.976
with loved ones in a Message

01:11:13.086 --> 01:11:14.986
In watchOS 5, you'll have an

01:11:14.986 --> 01:11:16.556
entirely new way to communicate

01:11:16.556 --> 01:11:17.166
on your watch.

01:11:17.396 --> 01:11:18.976
That's real-time voice but with

01:11:18.976 --> 01:11:20.246
a spontaneity of short

01:11:20.246 --> 01:11:20.746
messaging.

01:11:21.346 --> 01:11:28.636
>> Did you steal my chips?

01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:30.086
>> Maybe.

>> I cannot wait until you go to

01:11:35.276 --> 01:11:35.436
college.

[ Applause ]

01:11:44.046 --> 01:11:45.226
This is a new app by Apple

01:11:45.226 --> 01:11:45.606
Watch.

01:11:45.666 --> 01:11:47.306
It's fun, easy way to talk with

01:11:47.306 --> 01:11:48.076
friends and family.

01:11:48.406 --> 01:11:49.286
Let's take a look at how it

01:11:49.286 --> 01:11:49.646
works.

01:11:50.516 --> 01:11:51.546
First you choose who you'd like

01:11:51.546 --> 01:11:52.736
to enable Walkie Talkie with,

01:11:52.866 --> 01:11:54.416
and it suggests some people that

01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:55.606
you often communicate with, so

01:11:55.606 --> 01:11:56.476
you could easily add them.

01:11:56.476 --> 01:11:58.306
Now the first time that you do

01:11:58.306 --> 01:11:59.576
this, your friend will receive a

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:01.096
one-time request to allow a

01:12:01.096 --> 01:12:02.216
walkie talkie connection with

01:12:02.246 --> 01:12:02.496
you.

01:12:02.836 --> 01:12:04.226
If they accept, then you can

01:12:04.226 --> 01:12:05.206
speak to each other with walkie

01:12:05.206 --> 01:12:06.206
talkie whenever you like.

01:12:06.206 --> 01:12:08.426
And to do this, you just press

01:12:08.466 --> 01:12:10.526
to talk, and then your friend

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:11.906
can hear your voice just like a

01:12:11.906 --> 01:12:12.486
walkie talkie.

01:12:12.486 --> 01:12:14.856
And they're going to feel a

01:12:14.856 --> 01:12:15.546
[inaudible] beep beep sound

01:12:15.546 --> 01:12:16.536
right before your voice comes

01:12:16.536 --> 01:12:16.906
out.

01:12:16.906 --> 01:12:18.436
And this new watch-to-watch

01:12:18.436 --> 01:12:19.926
connection works over cellular

01:12:19.926 --> 01:12:21.576
or Wi-Fi, and it has really high

01:12:21.576 --> 01:12:22.366
audio quality.

01:12:22.366 --> 01:12:23.336
And it's a lot of fun.

01:12:23.336 --> 01:12:24.326
We can't wait for you to try

01:12:24.326 --> 01:12:24.906
this out.

01:12:24.906 --> 01:12:25.816

01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:35.766
the right information to you at

the right time.

01:12:36.856 --> 01:12:38.266
And Siri does this using machine

01:12:38.266 --> 01:12:39.136
learning, so it's going to get

01:12:39.136 --> 01:12:40.006
better at predicting your

01:12:40.006 --> 01:12:41.726
actions over time by combining

01:12:41.726 --> 01:12:43.536
inputs like the time of day,

your location, your daily

01:12:44.896 --> 01:12:46.296
routines, or which apps you use

01:12:46.296 --> 01:12:46.566
when.

01:12:46.966 --> 01:12:47.836
We're making some great

01:12:47.836 --> 01:12:49.436
enhancements to the Siri watch

01:12:49.436 --> 01:12:49.916
face now.

01:12:50.836 --> 01:12:52.036
First, we're adding new content.

01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:53.456
So now you can get live sports

01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:55.016
scores, you can get commute time

01:12:55.016 --> 01:12:56.756
home or to work, or you can see

01:12:56.756 --> 01:12:58.086
your heart rate, for example,

01:12:58.086 --> 01:12:59.676
after a workout or your resting

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:00.766
heart rate.

01:13:01.476 --> 01:13:03.076
And we're also adding Siri

01:13:03.076 --> 01:13:03.576
Shortcuts.

01:13:03.576 --> 01:13:04.766
So the shortcuts you saw coming

01:13:04.766 --> 01:13:06.766
to iOS 12 are also going to be

01:13:06.766 --> 01:13:07.856
available in watchOS.

01:13:08.526 --> 01:13:09.396
So in addition to getting

01:13:09.396 --> 01:13:10.926
relevant information, you'll

01:13:10.926 --> 01:13:12.546
also receive predicted shortcuts

01:13:12.546 --> 01:13:14.046
right on the Siri watch face.

01:13:14.506 --> 01:13:15.726
So in a wrist raise, you'll be

01:13:15.726 --> 01:13:17.236
able to directly do things like

01:13:17.596 --> 01:13:19.066
turn on your leaving home scene

01:13:19.106 --> 01:13:20.966
or start an outdoor walk or play

01:13:20.966 --> 01:13:22.416
your favorite morning playlist.

01:13:22.416 --> 01:13:24.216
And these shortcuts app based on

01:13:24.586 --> 01:13:25.796
whether you typically do those

01:13:25.796 --> 01:13:27.256
actions at those times.

01:13:27.456 --> 01:13:28.846
So super easy now to just tap

01:13:28.846 --> 01:13:29.796
and do those actions.

01:13:30.236 --> 01:13:32.586
Also for the first time, you can

01:13:32.586 --> 01:13:34.446
now use third party apps on the

01:13:34.536 --> 01:13:35.556
Siri watch face.

01:13:36.056 --> 01:13:37.446
So now you can see both relevant

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:38.686
content and shortcuts from your

01:13:38.686 --> 01:13:38.976
favorite apps.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:45.616
[ Applause ]

01:13:46.116 --> 01:13:47.176
So if you always go running with

01:13:47.176 --> 01:13:49.056
Nike Plus Run Club at a certain

01:13:49.056 --> 01:13:49.996
time or you're logging your

01:13:49.996 --> 01:13:51.486
meals with LoseIt or you use

01:13:51.486 --> 01:13:52.526
City Mapware to find your

01:13:52.526 --> 01:13:54.016
commute home, you just raise

01:13:54.016 --> 01:13:55.566
your wrist and tap, it's that

01:13:55.566 --> 01:13:55.936
easy.

01:13:56.386 --> 01:13:57.986
So new content, support for

01:13:57.986 --> 01:13:59.856
Shortcuts, and third-party apps

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:01.546
making for an even more powerful

01:14:01.546 --> 01:14:03.116
Siri watch phase.

01:14:04.286 --> 01:14:06.306
Now currently to talk to Siri

01:14:06.456 --> 01:14:07.236
you raise your wrist and you

01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:08.386
say, hey Siri.

01:14:08.426 --> 01:14:09.576
And when you think about this,

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:10.896
it's quite a strong signal when

01:14:10.896 --> 01:14:12.166
you raise your wrist and talk to

01:14:12.166 --> 01:14:12.836
your watch.

01:14:12.836 --> 01:14:13.746
It's kind of like when someone's

01:14:13.746 --> 01:14:14.796
standing right in front of you,

01:14:14.966 --> 01:14:15.766
you don't need to say hey

01:14:15.766 --> 01:14:16.676
because you have their attention

01:14:16.676 --> 01:14:18.486
already, so we're bringing this

01:14:18.486 --> 01:14:20.636
same social cue to Siri on the

01:14:20.636 --> 01:14:23.116
watch so you no longer need to

01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:23.856
say, hey Siri.

01:14:24.886 --> 01:14:26.046
You just raise your wrist and

01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:26.596
talk to Siri.

01:14:32.316 --> 01:14:32.776
[applause] Now we're also

01:14:32.776 --> 01:14:33.376
bringing a number of

01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:34.956
improvements to Notifications,

01:14:35.306 --> 01:14:36.536
which are now more actionable

01:14:36.536 --> 01:14:37.246
and interactive.

01:14:37.876 --> 01:14:38.906
So, for example, with this

01:14:38.906 --> 01:14:40.516
notification from Quantis, you

01:14:40.516 --> 01:14:41.556
can check in and share your

01:14:41.556 --> 01:14:42.856
flight details right from the

01:14:42.856 --> 01:14:43.646
notification.

01:14:44.516 --> 01:14:45.536
After you finish a ride with

01:14:45.536 --> 01:14:47.136
Dee, you can scroll down.

01:14:47.256 --> 01:14:48.646
You can rate your ride and pay

01:14:48.646 --> 01:14:50.256
with Apple Pay right there in

01:14:50.256 --> 01:14:51.016
the notification.

01:14:51.856 --> 01:14:53.076
And with this one from Yelp that

01:14:53.076 --> 01:14:54.356
your table is ready, if you need

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.616
a bit more time, you can extend

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:56.916
the reservation out a bit just

01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:57.576
by tapping here.

01:14:58.116 --> 01:14:59.556
So super easy now to interact

01:14:59.556 --> 01:15:00.506
right in place inside

01:15:00.506 --> 01:15:01.366
Notifications.

01:15:02.706 --> 01:15:04.006
We've also improved our Message

01:15:04.006 --> 01:15:04.716
notification.

01:15:05.216 --> 01:15:06.206
Today if someone sends you a

01:15:06.206 --> 01:15:07.836
weblink, you aren't able to view

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:08.396
it on your list.

01:15:08.976 --> 01:15:11.126
With watchOS 5, we've integrated

01:15:11.126 --> 01:15:12.266
WebKit, so now you have the

01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:14.106
ability to view web content and

01:15:14.106 --> 01:15:15.196
mail or messages.

01:15:16.376 --> 01:15:17.596
You can even tap on that link,

01:15:18.246 --> 01:15:20.356
yes, to easily view things like

01:15:20.576 --> 01:15:21.296
menus here.

01:15:21.366 --> 01:15:23.566
And while we think full browsing

01:15:23.566 --> 01:15:24.406
doesn't make sense on your

01:15:24.406 --> 01:15:25.726
wrist, there are times you get

01:15:25.776 --> 01:15:26.146
content.

01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:27.036
You'd like to see it right in

01:15:27.036 --> 01:15:28.246
the moment, and now you'll be

01:15:28.246 --> 01:15:29.706
able to do that and watch OS 5.

01:15:29.876 --> 01:15:30.756
And the contents can be

01:15:30.756 --> 01:15:32.156
formatted for the small screen,

01:15:32.156 --> 01:15:33.236
and the where reader made is

01:15:33.236 --> 01:15:34.316
available, it uses that on the

01:15:34.316 --> 01:15:34.806
watch.

01:15:35.096 --> 01:15:36.756
So WebKit on watchOS.

[ Applause ]

01:15:44.046 --> 01:15:45.086
Now with watchOS 4, we

01:15:45.086 --> 01:15:46.546
introduced an entirely new way

01:15:46.546 --> 01:15:47.656
to listen to music while you're

01:15:47.656 --> 01:15:48.456
on the go.

01:15:48.456 --> 01:15:50.096
You can stream 48 million songs

01:15:50.096 --> 01:15:51.076
on your wrist with Apple, or you

01:15:51.076 --> 01:15:52.666
can listen to automatically

01:15:52.666 --> 01:15:54.266
synced and created play lists.

01:15:54.656 --> 01:15:56.976
And now with watchOS 5, we're

01:15:56.976 --> 01:15:57.916
giving you even more to listen

01:15:57.916 --> 01:15:57.983
to.

01:15:58.516 --> 01:16:02.966
[ Applause ]

01:16:03.466 --> 01:16:03.886
That's right.

01:16:04.176 --> 01:16:05.816
The Apple podcast app is coming

01:16:05.816 --> 01:16:06.796
to Apple Watch.

01:16:07.306 --> 01:16:08.526
Upcoming episodes from

01:16:08.526 --> 01:16:09.796
subscribed podcasts will be

01:16:09.796 --> 01:16:10.926
automatically synced to your

01:16:10.926 --> 01:16:12.286
watch, so you can get them right

01:16:12.286 --> 01:16:14.636
there, or you can just ask Siri

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:15.996
to stream a podcast for you, and

01:16:15.996 --> 01:16:17.746
it'll start playing and playback

01:16:17.746 --> 01:16:19.316
resume across all your devices

01:16:19.356 --> 01:16:20.626
so you can continue just where

01:16:20.626 --> 01:16:21.276
you left off.

01:16:21.706 --> 01:16:22.626
So that's Podcast.

01:16:24.026 --> 01:16:24.886
Now those are the great new

01:16:24.886 --> 01:16:26.386
features coming in watchOS 5.

01:16:26.386 --> 01:16:28.066
So stay connected with people

01:16:28.066 --> 01:16:28.966
and information that you care

01:16:28.966 --> 01:16:30.186
most about, interactive

01:16:35.236 --> 01:16:36.246
course walkie talkie.

01:16:36.976 --> 01:16:37.836
Now we'd like to show you this

01:16:37.836 --> 01:16:39.626
stuff live in action, and we

01:16:39.626 --> 01:16:40.606
thought we'd increase the

01:16:40.606 --> 01:16:41.916
challenge a bit in our live demo

01:16:41.916 --> 01:16:43.496

01:16:43.496 --> 01:16:44.006
interesting.

01:16:44.226 --> 01:16:45.976
So, Jules, who helps lead our

01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:47.966
fitness experiences, is actually

01:16:47.966 --> 01:16:48.786
going to do the demo while

01:16:48.786 --> 01:16:48.976
biking.

01:16:58.546 --> 01:16:59.366
move and demonstrate and

01:16:59.366 --> 01:17:00.506

01:17:02.646 --> 01:17:03.706
I've got some great stuff to

01:17:03.706 --> 01:17:04.656
show you that I think you're

01:17:04.656 --> 01:17:06.316
really going to love, and the

01:17:06.316 --> 01:17:07.776
bonus is, I get to work on

01:17:07.776 --> 01:17:09.936
closing my rings while I do it.

01:17:09.936 --> 01:17:12.066
So, first, I'm super excited to

01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:13.676
show you how easy it is to start

01:17:13.676 --> 01:17:14.956
a workout with GymKit.

01:17:14.956 --> 01:17:18.716
I just tap to connect and accept

01:17:18.716 --> 01:17:20.296
on the watch, and now I can

01:17:20.296 --> 01:17:22.646
control and start the workout

01:17:22.646 --> 01:17:23.916
right here from the console on

01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:24.436
the bike.

01:17:24.986 --> 01:17:26.846
All of my data between the watch

01:17:26.906 --> 01:17:28.416
and the bike is in sync, and all

01:17:28.416 --> 01:17:29.526
of my workout metrics are

01:17:29.526 --> 01:17:29.986
accurate.

01:17:30.906 --> 01:17:32.046
Now, I wouldn't typically be

01:17:32.046 --> 01:17:33.286
trying to demo things for you

01:17:33.286 --> 01:17:34.336
and sneak in a workout at the

01:17:34.336 --> 01:17:35.916
same time, but I want to show

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:37.426
you activity competitions.

01:17:37.426 --> 01:17:39.536
And to do that, I need to keep

01:17:39.536 --> 01:17:39.986
moving.

01:17:40.296 --> 01:17:41.546
This morning I got this

01:17:41.546 --> 01:17:44.586
notification, and it says, your

01:17:44.586 --> 01:17:46.196
competition with Jay is down to

01:17:46.196 --> 01:17:47.636
the last day, and it's a close

01:17:47.636 --> 01:17:47.886
one.

01:17:48.326 --> 01:17:49.336
Have you got what it takes to

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:49.586
win?

01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:51.306
Have I got what it takes?

01:17:51.306 --> 01:17:51.976
You bet I do.

01:17:56.156 --> 01:17:57.716
But if I scroll down, I can see

01:17:57.716 --> 01:17:58.876
that Jay has moved ahead of me

01:17:58.876 --> 01:18:00.016
by a couple of points, and

01:18:00.016 --> 01:18:01.116
that's not okay because this

01:18:01.116 --> 01:18:02.046
thing ends tonight.

01:18:02.286 --> 01:18:03.756
So, I think I'm going to add a

01:18:03.756 --> 01:18:05.376
little resistance to this

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:07.156
workout here and work to earn as

01:18:07.156 --> 01:18:08.536
many points as possible and move

01:18:08.536 --> 01:18:09.606
ahead of Jay by the time this

01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:10.346
demo is done.

01:18:10.876 --> 01:18:13.956

him know I'm coming for him.

01:18:24.036 --> 01:18:25.466
If all goes well here, I'm going

01:18:25.466 --> 01:18:26.496
to go out with my girlfriends

from work to celebrate.

01:18:27.546 --> 01:18:29.606
And because we all know that Jay

is going to lose this

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:31.646
competition, maybe I should

01:18:31.646 --> 01:18:33.716
invite him along so it can be

01:18:33.716 --> 01:18:34.396
his treat.

01:18:35.156 --> 01:18:37.216
Now I can simply add to the

number of guests and confirm

01:18:38.776 --> 01:18:40.226
right here in the app without

01:18:40.226 --> 01:18:41.596
ever having to open it.

01:18:41.596 --> 01:18:42.746

Now in watchOS 5, notifications

01:18:50.376 --> 01:18:51.526
from apps are smartly grouped

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:52.736
together, and here are a couple

We're trying to get to a yoga

01:18:56.116 --> 01:18:57.276
retreat this summer, and it

01:18:57.276 --> 01:18:59.036
looks like she sent me a link.

Oh yeah, this looks beautiful.

01:19:06.946 --> 01:19:08.616
I'm already in, but I can

01:19:08.616 --> 01:19:09.986
continue to scroll through the

that they work.

01:19:35.526 --> 01:19:36.736
it's about this time each day

01:19:38.186 --> 01:19:39.176
my husband has logged our

Oh, good job, baby.

You slept two hours, and you

parents know that good naps

01:19:45.346 --> 01:19:46.476
equal good nights, so I'm

found in my calendar, and

waiting for me at the end of my

01:20:01.866 --> 01:20:03.756

Now, I want to check back in on

01:20:09.196 --> 01:20:10.846
this competition, but I thought

01:20:10.846 --> 01:20:12.106
it might be a good idea to get a

01:20:12.106 --> 01:20:13.486
little moral support from my

01:20:13.486 --> 01:20:14.326

And you heard Kevin say how

01:20:16.126 --> 01:20:17.796

left off in a workout.

01:24:53.536 --> 01:24:54.716
Now as Tim mentioned, last

01:24:54.906 --> 01:24:56.886
September, we introduced Apple

01:24:56.886 --> 01:24:59.526
TV 4K with the goal of bringing

01:24:59.526 --> 01:25:01.286
the highest quality cinematic

01:25:01.286 --> 01:25:03.266
experience right to your home.

01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:07.006
It offers both 4K and high

01:25:07.006 --> 01:25:09.006
dynamic range, including support

01:25:09.006 --> 01:25:11.036
for HDR 10 and Dolby Vision.

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:14.086
Time said, the new Apple TV is a

01:25:14.086 --> 01:25:16.596
high fidelity powerhouse.

01:25:16.626 --> 01:25:18.386
And to ensure you can enjoy this

01:25:18.496 --> 01:25:20.056
beautiful experience with as

01:25:20.056 --> 01:25:23.626
much content as possible, iTunes

01:25:23.626 --> 01:25:26.056
offers the largest collection of

01:25:26.136 --> 01:25:27.716
4K HDR movies.

01:25:28.516 --> 01:25:31.966
[ Applause ]

01:25:32.466 --> 01:25:33.776
And we've upgraded your

01:25:33.776 --> 01:25:35.196
previously purchased movies to

01:25:35.246 --> 01:25:37.886
4K HDR for free on all available

01:25:37.886 --> 01:25:38.336
titles.

01:25:39.586 --> 01:25:42.196
There are also, thank you, there

01:25:42.196 --> 01:25:44.836
are also many 4K and HDR TV

01:25:44.836 --> 01:25:46.406
shows available from popular

01:25:46.406 --> 01:25:48.476
services like Amazon Prime video

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:49.096
and Netflix.

01:25:50.676 --> 01:25:52.176
And we know what makes for an

01:25:52.176 --> 01:25:54.366
amazing cinematic experience is

01:25:54.366 --> 01:25:56.306
not just great picture quality.

01:25:56.746 --> 01:25:58.746
It's also incredible sound.

01:25:58.746 --> 01:26:02.486
So Apple TV 4K is bringing you

01:26:02.486 --> 01:26:04.626
the latest in audio technology,

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:07.976
Dolby Atmos.

01:26:10.516 --> 01:26:15.116
[ Applause ]

01:26:15.616 --> 01:26:18.316
With Atmos, you get room-filling

01:26:18.316 --> 01:26:18.806
sound.

01:26:19.106 --> 01:26:20.636
The perfect complement to the

01:26:20.686 --> 01:26:23.066
stunning visuals of Apple TV 4K.

01:26:23.736 --> 01:26:25.806
Now what makes Atmos so special

01:26:26.396 --> 01:26:27.786
is that unlike a traditional

01:26:27.846 --> 01:26:28.946
surround sound setup, where

01:26:28.946 --> 01:26:30.366
sound is assigned to channels

01:26:30.366 --> 01:26:31.536
like the left or the right,

01:26:32.876 --> 01:26:34.676
Dolby Atmos has the ability to

01:26:34.676 --> 01:26:36.726
completely immerse you.

01:26:37.236 --> 01:26:38.786
Atmos moves sound in

01:26:38.786 --> 01:26:39.966
three-dimensional space,

01:26:40.396 --> 01:26:41.756
creating an experience with

01:26:41.836 --> 01:26:44.006
powerful audio that flows all

01:26:44.006 --> 01:26:44.406
around you.

01:26:45.026 --> 01:26:46.686
It puts you right in the center

01:26:46.686 --> 01:26:47.346
of the action.

01:26:48.406 --> 01:26:50.116
All this with a home theater

01:26:50.116 --> 01:26:52.376
setup as simple as a Dolby Atmos

01:26:52.376 --> 01:26:54.566
enabled soundbar and an Apple TV

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:54.956
4K.

01:26:55.786 --> 01:26:58.556
In fact, Apple TV 4K is the only

01:26:58.556 --> 01:26:59.766
streaming player to be both

01:26:59.816 --> 01:27:01.436
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos

01:27:01.576 --> 01:27:01.976
certified.

01:27:02.516 --> 01:27:07.706
[ Applause ]

01:27:08.206 --> 01:27:09.916
And this Fall, iTunes will be

01:27:09.916 --> 01:27:11.386
bringing you the largest

01:27:11.386 --> 01:27:13.626
collection of Atmos content

01:27:13.626 --> 01:27:13.896
anywhere.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:16.796
And just like with 4K HDR, your

01:27:17.376 --> 01:27:18.726
iTunes libraries will be

01:27:18.726 --> 01:27:20.746
upgraded to include Dolby Atmos

01:27:20.786 --> 01:27:22.976
on all supported titles for

01:27:23.476 --> 01:27:27.646
free.

01:27:27.646 --> 01:27:28.496
[applause] Now of course these

01:27:28.496 --> 01:27:30.256
movies and so much more are

01:27:30.256 --> 01:27:32.056
available in the Apple TV app.

01:27:33.286 --> 01:27:35.376
The Apple TV app is the center

01:27:35.376 --> 01:27:37.256
of your video experience, a

01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:39.226
single place to find and watch

01:27:39.266 --> 01:27:40.426
what you love across your

01:27:40.516 --> 01:27:41.286
favorite apps.

01:27:41.916 --> 01:27:44.206
It's on Apple TV, iPad and

01:27:44.316 --> 01:27:45.966
iPhone where you can find not

01:27:45.966 --> 01:27:47.516
only On Demand TV shows and

01:27:47.516 --> 01:27:49.566
movies but also live content

01:27:49.936 --> 01:27:51.006
including sports.

01:27:51.526 --> 01:27:53.186
The Apple TV app now offers a

01:27:53.186 --> 01:27:56.086
huge range of live sports.

01:27:57.166 --> 01:27:59.136
And we've added live news to

01:27:59.136 --> 01:28:00.886
make it even easier to stay

01:28:00.886 --> 01:28:01.176
current.

01:28:02.426 --> 01:28:04.386
The edition of live sports and

01:28:04.386 --> 01:28:05.446
news providers brings the

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:07.116
coverage of the TV app to over

01:28:07.116 --> 01:28:10.496
100 video channels, giving you a

01:28:10.676 --> 01:28:12.716
massive selection of content all

01:28:12.716 --> 01:28:13.516
in one place.

01:28:14.356 --> 01:28:16.246
With all this, Apple TV is the

01:28:16.246 --> 01:28:18.266
best box to connect to your TV.

01:28:18.616 --> 01:28:20.366
And that's now more true than

01:28:20.366 --> 01:28:22.196
ever as more and more cable

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:24.256
companies fundamentally shift

01:28:24.616 --> 01:28:25.976
how video gets to your TV.

01:28:26.466 --> 01:28:27.936
This typical cable box is

01:28:27.976 --> 01:28:31.026
becoming a thing of the past as

01:28:31.076 --> 01:28:32.276
these companies embrace

01:28:32.276 --> 01:28:33.636
internet-based delivery.

01:28:34.236 --> 01:28:36.466
And many of them share our

01:28:36.466 --> 01:28:38.676
vision of Apple TV as the one

01:28:38.676 --> 01:28:41.106
device for live, On Demand, and

01:28:41.136 --> 01:28:43.666
Cloud DVR content.

01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:44.596
And we've already started

01:28:44.596 --> 01:28:46.076
working with partners around the

01:28:46.076 --> 01:28:47.486
world to make this a reality.

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.396
In France, we're working with

01:28:50.456 --> 01:28:51.166
Canal Plus.

01:28:52.246 --> 01:28:53.636
Almost a third of French

01:28:53.636 --> 01:28:55.036
households subscribe to Canal

01:28:55.106 --> 01:28:57.096
services, and their subscribers

01:28:57.156 --> 01:28:58.646
can now choose Apple TV to

01:28:58.776 --> 01:29:00.536
access more than 100 live

01:29:00.536 --> 01:29:02.896
channels and some of the biggest

01:29:02.896 --> 01:29:04.646
sports including the French Open

01:29:04.646 --> 01:29:05.236
in 4K.

01:29:06.236 --> 01:29:09.206
In Switzerland, we've partnered

01:29:09.206 --> 01:29:09.756
with Salt.

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:11.946
Salt just launched a new TV

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:14.036
service with more than 300 live

01:29:14.086 --> 01:29:16.226
TV channels, and it's available

01:29:16.226 --> 01:29:18.316
exclusively on Apple TV.

01:29:18.846 --> 01:29:21.606
And I'm really excited to

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:22.666
announce that here in the U.S.,

01:29:22.896 --> 01:29:24.526
Charter Spectrum will be coming

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:25.976
to Apple TV late this year.

01:29:26.516 --> 01:29:31.756
[ Applause ]

01:29:32.256 --> 01:29:34.526
That means that up to 50 million

01:29:34.526 --> 01:29:35.896
homes will be able to choose

01:29:35.896 --> 01:29:38.016
Apple TV to access all their

01:29:38.016 --> 01:29:39.986
live channels and thousands of

01:29:39.986 --> 01:29:40.926
On Demand programs.

01:29:41.536 --> 01:29:43.326
And, they'll be able to use Siri

01:29:43.326 --> 01:29:45.556
and the TV app to get access to

01:29:45.556 --> 01:29:47.326
their TV service not only on

01:29:47.326 --> 01:29:51.926
Apple TV but on iPhone and iPad

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:52.346
as well.

01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:53.556
Now with nearly any cable

01:29:53.556 --> 01:29:55.326
subscription, you can get access

01:29:55.416 --> 01:29:57.916
to dozens of video channels like

01:29:57.916 --> 01:30:00.626
ESPN, Showtime, NBC, and many

01:30:00.626 --> 01:30:02.836
more, but it used to be really

01:30:02.836 --> 01:30:04.896
painful to set up, having to

01:30:04.896 --> 01:30:06.156
authenticate each app

01:30:06.376 --> 01:30:07.146
individually.

01:30:07.376 --> 01:30:08.516
I'm sure all of you have seen

01:30:08.516 --> 01:30:09.926
that six-digit code you have to

01:30:09.926 --> 01:30:11.396
go online and type into a web

01:30:11.436 --> 01:30:11.726
browser.

01:30:11.726 --> 01:30:14.486
Well, last year we introduced

01:30:14.486 --> 01:30:15.256
single sign-on.

01:30:15.926 --> 01:30:17.836
Enter your cable credentials

01:30:17.836 --> 01:30:20.256
only once, and we unlock all of

01:30:20.256 --> 01:30:21.566
the apps your subscription

01:30:21.566 --> 01:30:22.186
supports.

01:30:22.936 --> 01:30:24.926
Well now we're making it even

01:30:24.926 --> 01:30:27.976
easier with zero sign-ons.

we'll securely and automatically

unlock all the supported apps

this is really awesome-- and

01:30:51.586 --> 01:30:52.816
Charter Spectrum will be the

01:30:52.926 --> 01:30:54.236
first to support zero sign-on

01:30:54.526 --> 01:30:55.446
and we'll be adding more

01:30:55.446 --> 01:30:56.446
providers over time.

We're also giving you even more

options for ways to control your

Now, one of the questions I get

asked the most about Aerials,

01:32:34.406 --> 01:32:36.076
collaborating closely with an

01:32:36.076 --> 01:32:38.046
amazing partner, filming some

01:32:38.186 --> 01:32:39.676
stunning footage from around the

01:32:39.676 --> 01:32:42.216
world with a very unique vantage

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:46.716
point, and here it is.

01:32:46.906 --> 01:32:46.986
Earth.

01:32:49.516 --> 01:32:55.206
[ Applause ]

01:32:55.706 --> 01:32:57.426
This is filmed by astronauts

01:32:57.426 --> 01:32:59.156
aboard the International Space

01:32:59.156 --> 01:32:59.866
Station.

01:33:00.156 --> 01:33:01.706
You can see Sicily just off the

01:33:01.706 --> 01:33:03.396
boot of Italy, and check out

01:33:03.396 --> 01:33:04.606
that Mediterranean Sea.

01:33:04.606 --> 01:33:06.516
The blue is just phenomenal.

01:33:06.516 --> 01:33:08.636
So here's a fun fact.

01:33:09.356 --> 01:33:10.946
The Space Station makes an orbit

01:33:10.946 --> 01:33:13.026
every 90 minutes, so that means

01:33:13.076 --> 01:33:15.926
they get 16 sunrises and sunsets

01:33:15.926 --> 01:33:16.356
every day.

01:33:16.356 --> 01:33:18.696
And with all those sunsets,

01:33:18.696 --> 01:33:21.206
nighttime can be particularly

01:33:21.286 --> 01:33:22.486
stunning the way those urban

01:33:22.546 --> 01:33:23.656
areas pop with light.

01:33:24.436 --> 01:33:25.666
Here we are flying over South

01:33:25.736 --> 01:33:26.796
Korea toward Japan.

01:33:27.596 --> 01:33:29.066
You can see Tokyo coming into

01:33:29.066 --> 01:33:31.006
view at the top, some distant

01:33:31.046 --> 01:33:33.296
stars, and even upper reaches of

01:33:33.296 --> 01:33:34.616
the Earth's atmosphere, which is

01:33:34.616 --> 01:33:36.306
that orange band enveloping the

01:33:37.096 --> 01:33:37.166
Earth.

01:33:41.146 --> 01:33:42.676
And here's one that might look a

01:33:42.676 --> 01:33:43.726
little more familiar.

01:33:43.966 --> 01:33:45.636
This is the Northern California

01:33:45.636 --> 01:33:47.166
coast heading southward.

01:33:47.896 --> 01:33:48.986
You can see Lake Tahoe

01:33:49.046 --> 01:33:51.646
surrounded by snowcaps and the

01:33:51.646 --> 01:33:52.496
San Francisco Bay.

01:33:54.096 --> 01:33:56.966
These are truly incredible and

01:33:56.966 --> 01:33:58.696
offer such a unique perspective

01:33:58.696 --> 01:33:59.226
on the world.

01:33:59.696 --> 01:34:01.586
I'd like to give a huge thanks

01:34:01.706 --> 01:34:03.026
to the International Space

01:34:03.026 --> 01:34:05.226
Station National Lab and CASIS

01:34:05.226 --> 01:34:06.546
for all their help in making

01:34:06.606 --> 01:34:07.606
this a possibility.

01:34:08.516 --> 01:34:13.846
[ Applause ]

01:34:14.346 --> 01:34:15.546
These are going to look

01:34:15.736 --> 01:34:19.366
incredible at home in 4K HDR.

01:34:20.596 --> 01:34:21.686
So that's tvOS.

01:34:21.686 --> 01:34:24.826
Apple TV gives you amazing

01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:27.546
picture and sound with 4K HDR

01:34:27.546 --> 01:34:29.066
and now Dolby Atmos.

01:34:29.836 --> 01:34:31.316
And the Apple TV app is the

01:34:31.516 --> 01:34:33.416
center of your video experience.

01:34:33.856 --> 01:34:36.326
Available on Apple TV, iPad, and

01:34:36.326 --> 01:34:38.076
iPhone, it's the one place to

01:34:38.076 --> 01:34:39.856
find all your favorite TV shows,

01:34:40.126 --> 01:34:41.676
movies, sports, and news.

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:43.366
And with that, I'll hand it back

01:34:43.366 --> 01:34:43.536
to Tim.

01:34:43.596 --> 01:34:43.826
Thank you.

01:34:44.516 --> 01:34:47.906
[ Applause ]

01:34:48.406 --> 01:34:49.236
>> Thanks Jen.

01:34:51.396 --> 01:34:55.346
Apple TV 4K and tvOS look and

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:56.656
sound awesome.

01:34:56.896 --> 01:34:58.636
You're really going to love it.

01:34:58.806 --> 01:35:00.026
Next up is the Mac.

01:35:01.236 --> 01:35:03.406
At Apple [applause]-- yeah.

01:35:05.056 --> 01:35:06.026
We love the Mac.

01:35:06.856 --> 01:35:08.696
The Mac was the first computer

01:35:08.696 --> 01:35:11.656
that made powerful technology so

01:35:11.656 --> 01:35:14.056
easy to use and put the customer

01:35:14.056 --> 01:35:16.076
at the center of the experience.

01:35:16.076 --> 01:35:17.736
And of course that remains at

01:35:17.736 --> 01:35:19.386
the core of all Apple products.

01:35:19.386 --> 01:35:23.576
For more than 30 years, the Mac

01:35:23.576 --> 01:35:25.546
has empowered people to create

01:35:25.546 --> 01:35:27.906
all kinds of amazing things,

01:35:28.926 --> 01:35:31.136
from the personal to the

01:35:31.136 --> 01:35:31.976
professional.

01:35:32.636 --> 01:35:34.706
Today, we're excited to take Mac

01:35:34.706 --> 01:35:36.606
a huge leap forward.

01:35:37.226 --> 01:35:39.156
The next version of macOS is

01:35:39.156 --> 01:35:40.906
chock full of new features

01:35:40.906 --> 01:35:43.246
inspired by pro-users but

01:35:43.246 --> 01:35:44.856
designed for everyone.

01:35:45.276 --> 01:35:47.256
I'd like to bring Craig back up

01:35:47.306 --> 01:35:47.856
to talk about it.

01:35:47.856 --> 01:35:47.976
Craig.

01:35:48.516 --> 01:35:54.556
[ Applause ]

01:35:55.056 --> 01:35:57.826
>> Hello again.

01:35:57.826 --> 01:35:59.576
It's true that macOS is the

01:35:59.576 --> 01:36:02.396
heart of what makes a Mac a Mac.

01:36:03.506 --> 01:36:05.636
And we want as many Mac users as

01:36:05.676 --> 01:36:07.186
possible to have access to our

01:36:07.186 --> 01:36:09.126
latest software, and that's why

01:36:09.286 --> 01:36:10.876
six years ago with the

01:36:10.876 --> 01:36:13.156
introduction of OS 10 Mavericks,

01:36:13.486 --> 01:36:15.096
we began offering our macOS

01:36:15.096 --> 01:36:17.566
updates free for Mac users.

01:36:17.566 --> 01:36:19.656
And 2013 was also the year that

01:36:19.656 --> 01:36:21.236
we first introduced our

01:36:21.236 --> 01:36:23.106
California naming theme.

01:36:24.036 --> 01:36:25.986
Now after spending a year by the

01:36:25.986 --> 01:36:28.036
ocean, we not only modernized

01:36:28.076 --> 01:36:29.876
the look and feel of macOS, but

01:36:30.416 --> 01:36:32.206
we headed to the mountains with

01:36:32.206 --> 01:36:34.016
macOS Yosemite.

01:36:35.266 --> 01:36:38.076
Now, as you may be aware, our

01:36:38.076 --> 01:36:39.646
naming of Mac releases is

01:36:39.646 --> 01:36:41.616
handled by our crack marketing

01:36:41.616 --> 01:36:44.766
organization, and as you've

01:36:44.766 --> 01:36:46.456
probably noticed, they went on a

01:36:46.736 --> 01:36:49.006
four-year mountain-bound bender.

01:36:50.936 --> 01:36:52.176
[laughter] In El Capitan we

01:36:52.176 --> 01:36:54.336
added metal, our ground-breaking

01:36:54.336 --> 01:36:55.626
graphics technology.

01:36:56.136 --> 01:36:57.696
In Sierra, we brought Siri to

01:36:57.696 --> 01:36:58.936
the Mac and extended our

01:36:58.936 --> 01:37:00.706
capabilities and continuity.

01:37:01.266 --> 01:37:03.466
And last year with High Sierra,

01:37:03.666 --> 01:37:05.566
we focused on deep technology,

01:37:05.676 --> 01:37:07.326
preparing the Mac for future

01:37:07.326 --> 01:37:07.886
innovation.

01:37:08.596 --> 01:37:10.146
Well this year, we made some

01:37:10.146 --> 01:37:13.246
striking changes to macOS, and

01:37:13.246 --> 01:37:15.446
we've left the high country for

01:37:15.446 --> 01:37:17.306
a place entirely different but

01:37:17.306 --> 01:37:20.046
not less beautiful and here

01:37:20.046 --> 01:37:22.046
still in California, and I'd

01:37:22.046 --> 01:37:23.286
like to take you there now.

01:37:24.156 --> 01:37:30.176
Our next release of macOS is

01:37:30.176 --> 01:37:32.006
macOS Mojave.

01:37:33.516 --> 01:37:39.556
[ Applause ]

01:37:40.056 --> 01:37:41.946
Now, Mojave is beautiful during

01:37:41.946 --> 01:37:43.366
the day, but what really

01:37:43.366 --> 01:37:45.486
captured our imagination was the

01:37:45.486 --> 01:37:47.886
beauty of the desert at night.

01:37:48.936 --> 01:37:52.566
And this inspired one of our

01:37:52.566 --> 01:37:55.156
most distinctive new features,

01:37:55.826 --> 01:37:59.726
and I'd like to show it to you

01:38:00.656 --> 01:38:00.726
now.

01:38:02.796 --> 01:38:05.846
So here we are live in macOS

01:38:06.196 --> 01:38:08.536
Mojave, and I'd like to show you

01:38:09.276 --> 01:38:11.006
a new side of Mojave.

01:38:12.056 --> 01:38:14.216
We call it dark mode.

01:38:15.516 --> 01:38:22.776
[ Applause ]

01:38:23.276 --> 01:38:25.476
And as you see, dark mode is not

01:38:25.476 --> 01:38:27.096
just about the dock or the menu

01:38:27.096 --> 01:38:27.386
bar.

01:38:27.386 --> 01:38:28.506
It extends to your Windows

01:38:28.506 --> 01:38:30.146
Chrome, your sidebar, and even

01:38:30.146 --> 01:38:32.196
the content of the Windows, and

01:38:32.196 --> 01:38:33.526
it's so great for Pros.

01:38:33.526 --> 01:38:35.256
It makes photographic content

01:38:35.706 --> 01:38:38.356
absolutely pop off the screen.

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:40.116
It's just gorgeous.

01:38:40.896 --> 01:38:44.116
It's so nice.

01:38:44.116 --> 01:38:46.386
And this is great not just for

01:38:46.386 --> 01:38:48.636
photography but when working on

01:38:48.726 --> 01:38:51.076
presentations or documents.

01:38:51.586 --> 01:38:53.106
It's also great doing ordinary

01:38:53.166 --> 01:38:53.506
things.

01:38:53.566 --> 01:38:54.706
Maybe you're working in a dark

01:38:54.706 --> 01:38:55.246
environment.

01:38:55.786 --> 01:38:57.166
Just look at calendar.

01:38:58.166 --> 01:39:00.736
Even mail in dark mode.

01:39:00.856 --> 01:39:01.626
It's so great.

01:39:02.606 --> 01:39:04.206
And I think some of us are going

01:39:04.206 --> 01:39:05.446
to want to run dark mode just

01:39:05.446 --> 01:39:07.126
because it's so cool.

01:39:07.316 --> 01:39:09.826
I mean your emoji look great.

01:39:09.826 --> 01:39:11.326
Your photos look great.

01:39:11.516 --> 01:39:13.586
I mean check out your album art

01:39:13.956 --> 01:39:16.766
and music or your For You feed

01:39:17.406 --> 01:39:18.286
in Apple Music.

01:39:18.706 --> 01:39:19.956
But I think one audience that's

01:39:19.956 --> 01:39:21.366
going to especially appreciate

01:39:21.366 --> 01:39:22.526
dark mode are some of you here

01:39:22.526 --> 01:39:24.746
in this room, our developers,

01:39:25.366 --> 01:39:26.796
because Expo looks fantastic in

01:39:27.116 --> 01:39:27.656
dark mode.

01:39:28.516 --> 01:39:33.096
[ Applause ]

01:39:33.596 --> 01:39:35.746
Whether it's your source code or

01:39:35.746 --> 01:39:37.396
even interface builder and all

01:39:37.396 --> 01:39:39.466
of its inspectors, they just

01:39:39.466 --> 01:39:41.826
look fantastic in black.

01:39:41.826 --> 01:39:44.666
And that's a quick look at dark

01:39:44.666 --> 01:39:44.966
mode.

01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:49.286
Now, we were so inspired by this

01:39:49.656 --> 01:39:51.926
changing desktop wallpaper that

01:39:52.206 --> 01:39:53.576
we decided to add a new feature

01:39:53.576 --> 01:39:54.966
to Mojave that I think you'll

01:39:54.966 --> 01:39:55.726
enjoy.

01:39:56.396 --> 01:39:58.676
It's called dynamic desktop, and

01:39:58.676 --> 01:39:59.576
when you're using it, you're

01:39:59.576 --> 01:40:01.836
desktop actually subtly changes

01:40:01.906 --> 01:40:04.196
throughout the day from morning,

01:40:04.706 --> 01:40:07.666
to afternoon, to evening.

01:40:08.406 --> 01:40:09.376
It's really cool.

01:40:10.086 --> 01:40:12.286
Now, there's much more to Mojave

01:40:12.286 --> 01:40:14.106
that I'd like to share with you

01:40:15.136 --> 01:40:16.706
through demos, and it starts

01:40:17.616 --> 01:40:18.586
with the desktop.

01:40:19.726 --> 01:40:23.416
Now, the desktop is so crucial

01:40:23.416 --> 01:40:25.186
to how many of us use our Macs.

01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:26.076
When we have files that we're

01:40:26.076 --> 01:40:27.786
actively working on, we often

01:40:27.786 --> 01:40:29.466
put them on the desktop, but the

01:40:29.466 --> 01:40:31.476
result can be a desktop that

01:40:31.476 --> 01:40:32.966
looks something like this.

01:40:34.746 --> 01:40:36.146
And so now in Mojave we have a

01:40:36.286 --> 01:40:38.376
really great solution, and we

01:40:38.376 --> 01:40:41.106
call it Desktop Stacks.

All of the contents of your

01:40:48.796 --> 01:40:51.416
desktop are automatically

01:40:51.416 --> 01:40:53.636
arranged into these stacks, and

01:40:53.636 --> 01:40:56.526
they can be arranged by kind, by

01:40:56.666 --> 01:40:58.856
date, or even by tag, and

01:40:58.946 --> 01:41:00.256
they're really easy to use.

01:41:00.356 --> 01:41:01.446
You just click on them.

01:41:01.606 --> 01:41:02.926
You can see all the contents in

01:41:02.926 --> 01:41:03.376
the stack.

01:41:03.766 --> 01:41:05.076
You can double click to open a

01:41:05.076 --> 01:41:07.136
document and put it away.

01:41:07.136 --> 01:41:08.896
And they stay organized.

01:41:09.286 --> 01:41:10.726
So for instance, if I bring

01:41:10.786 --> 01:41:12.756
forward mail, maybe I drag an

01:41:12.756 --> 01:41:14.076
image out, I want you to watch

01:41:14.076 --> 01:41:15.596
what happens because the image

01:41:15.656 --> 01:41:17.606
flies right into the right

01:41:17.776 --> 01:41:18.116
stack.

01:41:18.856 --> 01:41:20.806
Now you can also scrub your

01:41:20.806 --> 01:41:21.426
stacks.

01:41:21.806 --> 01:41:22.846
So, for instance, I'll just

01:41:22.986 --> 01:41:24.606
scrub across this stack.

01:41:25.866 --> 01:41:27.706
You see I can select between

01:41:27.706 --> 01:41:30.706
different photos, pick one up.

01:41:30.776 --> 01:41:32.026
Actually let me just hide mail

01:41:32.026 --> 01:41:33.366
here mid drag.

01:41:33.566 --> 01:41:34.986
I got a little excited with my,

01:41:36.516 --> 01:41:38.066
with all of my stack action.

01:41:39.706 --> 01:41:43.826
So I can just drag this out and

01:41:43.826 --> 01:41:45.796
drop it in just like that.

01:41:45.796 --> 01:41:47.676
And that's a quick look at

01:41:47.676 --> 01:41:48.476
Stacks.

01:41:48.546 --> 01:41:48.613
Now--

01:41:49.516 --> 01:41:52.966
[ Applause ]

01:41:53.466 --> 01:41:54.966
We've also brought some great

01:41:55.026 --> 01:41:57.076
new changes to the finder.

01:41:57.436 --> 01:41:58.946
I'd like to show them to you

01:41:58.946 --> 01:41:59.306
now.

01:42:00.226 --> 01:42:03.746
Now it starts with a new view.

01:42:04.266 --> 01:42:07.396
We all enjoy using icon view,

01:42:08.416 --> 01:42:09.286
list view.

01:42:09.396 --> 01:42:11.376
There's of course column view,

01:42:11.376 --> 01:42:13.716
but now we've added an all-new

01:42:13.716 --> 01:42:15.686
view called gallery view.

01:42:15.686 --> 01:42:18.566
It has a big preview up top, a

01:42:18.566 --> 01:42:19.846
set of thumbnails along the

01:42:19.846 --> 01:42:21.656
bottom, and it makes it easy to

01:42:21.656 --> 01:42:24.526
preview images, video,

01:42:24.936 --> 01:42:27.486
presentations, documents,

01:42:28.036 --> 01:42:31.306
spreadsheets, PDFs, and of

01:42:31.306 --> 01:42:33.596
course with images sometimes you

01:42:33.596 --> 01:42:35.086
want to know more detail about,

01:42:35.086 --> 01:42:35.936
for instance, how they were

01:42:35.936 --> 01:42:37.336
captured, and now the new

01:42:37.336 --> 01:42:39.786
sidebar in Mojave really helps

01:42:40.146 --> 01:42:42.756
because it now supports full

01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:45.056
metadata, so you can see around

01:42:45.056 --> 01:42:47.376
your photo, the camera you took

01:42:47.376 --> 01:42:49.776
the photo on, the kind of lens,

01:42:50.026 --> 01:42:51.836
the aperture settings, and so

01:42:51.836 --> 01:42:52.176
forth.

01:42:52.496 --> 01:42:53.486
It's really handy.

01:42:53.486 --> 01:42:55.886
And you'll notice also along the

01:42:55.946 --> 01:42:57.216
bottom there's this new area

01:42:57.216 --> 01:42:59.586
called Quick Actions, and Quick

01:42:59.586 --> 01:43:01.066
Actions that you act on the

01:43:01.066 --> 01:43:02.126
current photo.

01:43:02.356 --> 01:43:03.586
So, for instance, if I have a

01:43:03.586 --> 01:43:05.326
photo like this and I want to

01:43:05.326 --> 01:43:07.026
edit it, I don't have to open it

01:43:07.026 --> 01:43:07.956
and go through a new app.

01:43:08.486 --> 01:43:10.476
I can rotate it right here

01:43:10.476 --> 01:43:12.446
inside the finder.

01:43:12.706 --> 01:43:14.076
It's really powerful.

01:43:14.266 --> 01:43:15.786
Now this sidebar is available in

01:43:15.786 --> 01:43:16.916
other views of the finder.

01:43:17.336 --> 01:43:18.486
So for instance, I'm just going

01:43:18.486 --> 01:43:19.746
to bring up the preview pane

01:43:19.746 --> 01:43:21.106
here, and I'm going to do a

01:43:21.106 --> 01:43:25.136
multi selection of a PDF as well

01:43:25.136 --> 01:43:27.116
as several images, and you'll

01:43:27.116 --> 01:43:28.366
notice that the quick actions

01:43:28.366 --> 01:43:30.566
area is contextual, so it shows

01:43:30.566 --> 01:43:32.716
me create PDF as an option.

01:43:33.126 --> 01:43:34.406
I'm going to click create PDF,

01:43:34.406 --> 01:43:36.176
and it's going to assemble all

01:43:36.176 --> 01:43:38.256
of these photos into a PDF just

01:43:38.256 --> 01:43:39.406
like that.

01:43:39.406 --> 01:43:41.306
But what's really great is these

01:43:41.306 --> 01:43:43.496
actions are also customizable,

01:43:43.936 --> 01:43:45.396
so you can create automator

01:43:45.396 --> 01:43:47.446
actions and assign them to

01:43:47.446 --> 01:43:50.036
buttons here inside of Finder.

01:43:50.546 --> 01:43:51.616
So you'll notice that now that I

01:43:51.616 --> 01:43:53.596
have this PDF selected, I have

01:43:53.596 --> 01:43:55.426
an option to run a custom

01:43:55.426 --> 01:43:56.576
automator action that I've

01:43:56.576 --> 01:43:58.526
created called Watermark PDF.

01:43:59.526 --> 01:44:01.256
When I click it, my custom

01:44:01.256 --> 01:44:04.286
action runs, and my document is

01:44:04.286 --> 01:44:06.946
watermarked, just like that.

01:44:06.946 --> 01:44:08.436
And those are some quick

01:44:08.436 --> 01:44:10.666
enhancements to the finder.

01:44:12.516 --> 01:44:15.996
[ Applause ]

01:44:16.496 --> 01:44:18.256
Now a tool that I think many of

01:44:18.256 --> 01:44:20.026
us love when working with files

01:44:20.266 --> 01:44:21.626
is Quick Look, and now in

01:44:21.626 --> 01:44:23.616
Mojave, we made Quick Look more

01:44:23.696 --> 01:44:25.526
powerful than ever by

01:44:25.636 --> 01:44:27.196
integrating Markup.

01:44:27.196 --> 01:44:28.306
Let me show you how it works.

01:44:29.226 --> 01:44:32.286
So you see down here I have a

01:44:32.286 --> 01:44:34.186
permission slip and it's a PDF

01:44:34.186 --> 01:44:34.766
document.

01:44:34.766 --> 01:44:36.036
I'm just going to hit tap

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:38.306
spacebar to Quick Look it, and

01:44:38.306 --> 01:44:40.206
you notice now I have the option

01:44:40.336 --> 01:44:42.796
to invoke Markup.

01:44:42.796 --> 01:44:45.456
I click, and now I have access

01:44:45.456 --> 01:44:47.976
to my markup tools, including my

01:44:47.976 --> 01:44:49.616
ability to sign this document.

01:44:49.826 --> 01:44:52.056
I can just drag out my signature

01:44:52.056 --> 01:44:55.066
like this, and I'm done.

01:44:55.566 --> 01:44:57.916
Now this works for all kinds of

01:44:57.966 --> 01:44:58.506
files.

01:44:58.796 --> 01:45:00.836
So, for instance, with images I

01:45:00.836 --> 01:45:04.156
can rotate and crop, and with

01:45:04.156 --> 01:45:07.676
video I can even trim right here

01:45:08.136 --> 01:45:09.506
inside of Quick Look.

01:45:09.566 --> 01:45:11.876
And that's a quick look at Quick

01:45:11.876 --> 01:45:11.976
Look.

01:45:12.516 --> 01:45:16.886
[ Applause ]

01:45:17.386 --> 01:45:18.426
Next, I want to talk about how

01:45:18.426 --> 01:45:20.016
we capture content on our Mac

01:45:20.086 --> 01:45:21.136
because one of the tools I think

01:45:21.256 --> 01:45:22.976
many of us use all the time is

01:45:22.976 --> 01:45:24.736
Screenshots, and we've made

01:45:24.736 --> 01:45:26.656
Screenshots more powerful than

01:45:26.696 --> 01:45:27.886
ever in Mohave.

01:45:29.116 --> 01:45:32.636
So let's take a look here at a

01:45:32.716 --> 01:45:34.506
webpage, and I'm just going to

01:45:34.646 --> 01:45:35.726
take a screenshot in the

01:45:35.726 --> 01:45:36.436
traditional way.

01:45:36.436 --> 01:45:37.446
I'm going to screen shot a

01:45:37.446 --> 01:45:40.216
selection of the page, and I

01:45:40.216 --> 01:45:41.266
want you to watch what happens

01:45:41.266 --> 01:45:42.006
in the lower right.

01:45:42.006 --> 01:45:44.896
I get a thumbnail instantly of

01:45:44.896 --> 01:45:46.576
that screenshot, and when I

01:45:46.576 --> 01:45:47.656
double click in, I get an

01:45:47.656 --> 01:45:49.986
accelerated workflow right into

01:45:49.986 --> 01:45:51.456
Markup where I have access to

01:45:51.456 --> 01:45:52.536
all of my tools.

01:45:53.096 --> 01:45:54.426
So, for instance, if I want to

01:45:54.426 --> 01:45:57.036
create a magnification here, I

01:45:57.036 --> 01:46:01.246
can just drag that out.

01:46:01.506 --> 01:46:04.466
Magnify. It's that easy.

01:46:04.776 --> 01:46:06.206
But now we've also made it

01:46:06.206 --> 01:46:08.066
easier to access a variety of

01:46:08.066 --> 01:46:09.986
tools, so when I bring up my

01:46:09.986 --> 01:46:12.106
screenshotting, you see I'm

01:46:12.106 --> 01:46:13.966
presented with this hud that

01:46:13.966 --> 01:46:15.196
tells me I can capture the

01:46:15.196 --> 01:46:17.906
entire screen, a selected window

01:46:17.906 --> 01:46:19.886
or selection, but we've also

01:46:19.886 --> 01:46:22.336
added screen capture for video

01:46:22.806 --> 01:46:24.646
right into screenshotting.

01:46:24.856 --> 01:46:26.266
Let me show you how that works.

01:46:26.266 --> 01:46:27.936
So I'm going to go to a webpage

01:46:27.936 --> 01:46:29.456
here that has an animation

01:46:29.456 --> 01:46:29.746
running.

01:46:30.106 --> 01:46:31.476
I'm going to bring up my

01:46:31.476 --> 01:46:33.496
screenshotting tools, and say

01:46:33.686 --> 01:46:36.016
record the selected area.

01:46:36.496 --> 01:46:37.936
I'll just make a nice selection

01:46:37.936 --> 01:46:38.156
here.

01:46:39.186 --> 01:46:40.786
Okay. And I'm recording just

01:46:40.786 --> 01:46:41.836
like that.

01:46:41.836 --> 01:46:43.026
Of course I can manipulate the

01:46:43.026 --> 01:46:45.376
app, so all will be reflected in

01:46:45.376 --> 01:46:48.416
my recording, and when I'm done,

01:46:48.416 --> 01:46:49.546
I can click the stop button

01:46:49.546 --> 01:46:50.466
right up here.

01:46:50.866 --> 01:46:51.726
And now you notice I have this

01:46:51.806 --> 01:46:53.006
thumbnail in the lower right.

01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:55.706
Well I can actually pick this up

01:46:55.856 --> 01:46:57.656
and drag it into a new space and

01:46:57.856 --> 01:46:59.866
incorporate it right into a

01:46:59.866 --> 01:47:01.866
document, just like that.

01:47:02.676 --> 01:47:04.266
Now, we've further enhanced the

01:47:04.266 --> 01:47:06.336
way you capture content, and

01:47:06.446 --> 01:47:08.756
that brings me to Continuity.

01:47:09.126 --> 01:47:11.086
So Mac users love Continuity for

01:47:11.086 --> 01:47:12.436
the way it lets us work across

01:47:12.436 --> 01:47:15.306
our devices with things like Air

01:47:15.306 --> 01:47:16.866
Drop or the ability to unlock

01:47:16.926 --> 01:47:19.146
your Mac using your Apple Watch.

01:47:19.716 --> 01:47:20.876
When it comes to capturing

01:47:20.876 --> 01:47:22.836
content, we'll walk around with

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:24.206
one of the best content capture

01:47:24.206 --> 01:47:25.456
devices in the world in our

01:47:25.456 --> 01:47:27.056
pockets, our phones.

01:47:27.666 --> 01:47:29.126
And so we wanted to take

01:47:29.126 --> 01:47:30.806
advantage of continuity to bring

01:47:30.806 --> 01:47:32.126
that to the Mac with a feature

01:47:32.126 --> 01:47:34.216
we call Continuity Camera.

01:47:34.216 --> 01:47:36.176
Let me show you how it works.

01:47:37.756 --> 01:47:39.276
So here in my Keynote

01:47:39.276 --> 01:47:41.426
presentation, I have a space

01:47:41.426 --> 01:47:42.896
that's just waiting for a new

01:47:42.976 --> 01:47:44.766
photo, and on my phone right

01:47:44.846 --> 01:47:45.166
here.

01:47:46.306 --> 01:47:47.846
Well, when I select this object,

01:47:47.936 --> 01:47:50.666
I can choose to take a photo.

01:47:50.666 --> 01:47:51.806
And I want you to watch what

01:47:51.806 --> 01:47:53.026
happens when I select this to my

01:47:53.096 --> 01:47:53.766
phone.

01:47:54.066 --> 01:47:56.076
It automatically immediately

01:47:56.076 --> 01:47:59.616
lights up ready to take a photo.

01:47:59.716 --> 01:48:03.806
So I can take one like this, and

01:48:03.806 --> 01:48:06.726
when I do, I can select use

photo, and it apps directly in

01:48:08.736 --> 01:48:09.446
my document.

01:48:09.446 --> 01:48:09.966
Isn't that cool?

[ Applause ]

01:48:15.236 --> 01:48:16.296

01:48:16.296 --> 01:48:17.516
scanning documents.

01:48:18.166 --> 01:48:19.496
So here I have a place where I

01:48:19.496 --> 01:48:20.656
could use a scan.

01:48:21.376 --> 01:48:23.236
Once again, I'm going to select

01:48:24.016 --> 01:48:25.956
from the menu and this time scan

01:48:25.956 --> 01:48:26.466
document.

01:48:26.746 --> 01:48:28.676
Again, my camera lights up, this

time right in my document

01:48:29.926 --> 01:48:30.326
scanner.

01:48:31.036 --> 01:48:32.246
I just scan like this.

01:48:32.246 --> 01:48:34.546
I can save it.

01:48:35.616 --> 01:48:37.596
And my scan goes immediately,

01:48:37.596 --> 01:48:39.956
and I think I forgot to push the

01:48:39.956 --> 01:48:40.516
save button.

01:48:40.516 --> 01:48:41.556
Sorry about that everybody.

There you go, appears

01:48:42.846 --> 01:48:44.176

01:48:50.526 --> 01:48:53.496
I can take photos, stills, and

01:48:53.586 --> 01:48:55.976
even capture video, and this is

01:48:55.976 --> 01:48:57.486
a quick look at some great new

01:48:57.486 --> 01:48:58.936

you've come to expect from News

01:49:19.356 --> 01:49:21.606
on iOS, and it looks amazing on

01:49:21.606 --> 01:49:22.516
the Mac display.

01:49:23.026 --> 01:49:25.116
You get top stories picked by

you're personalized for you and

01:49:30.626 --> 01:49:34.956
that's not for me, and you also

01:49:34.956 --> 01:49:36.876
get this great new sidebar where

01:49:36.876 --> 01:49:38.786
you can drill in and jump right

01:49:38.786 --> 01:49:40.426
to the topics and channels you

01:49:40.526 --> 01:49:41.146

01:49:41.256 --> 01:49:42.546
News is going to be great.

01:49:43.006 --> 01:49:45.326
We also have Stocks coming to

01:49:45.326 --> 01:49:45.666

01:49:46.456 --> 01:49:48.096
Now you get your stock prices

01:49:48.096 --> 01:49:49.526
combined with high-quality

It shows you your watch list

with your prices on the left,

01:49:55.906 --> 01:49:57.716
and you can drill in to this

01:50:02.086 --> 01:50:03.006
great news.

We're also bringing Voice Memos

01:50:06.356 --> 01:50:06.746
to the Mac.

01:50:07.056 --> 01:50:08.666
Now Voice Memos is the most

01:50:08.786 --> 01:50:11.766
popular voice recorder on iOS,

01:50:11.866 --> 01:50:14.066
and so many of us use it to

01:50:14.166 --> 01:50:16.066
capture music recordings or

01:50:16.066 --> 01:50:17.966
lectures, and now that Voice

01:50:21.026 --> 01:50:21.916
Mac, you can take those

01:50:21.916 --> 01:50:23.456
recordings that you make and for

01:50:23.456 --> 01:50:24.986

01:50:26.816 --> 01:50:27.376
for a song.

01:50:40.416 --> 01:50:43.336
You can run your scenes as well

as monitor your video cameras,

01:50:53.466 --> 01:50:54.856
coming to Mojave.

[ Applause ]

01:51:00.186 --> 01:51:01.866
Next, I'd like to talk about

01:51:01.866 --> 01:51:03.586
security and privacy.

01:51:03.856 --> 01:51:05.826
You know, one of the reasons

01:51:05.986 --> 01:51:07.326
that people choose Apple

01:51:07.326 --> 01:51:08.776
products is because of our

01:51:08.776 --> 01:51:10.626
commitment to security and

01:51:10.626 --> 01:51:11.196
privacy.

01:51:11.986 --> 01:51:14.256
And we believe that your private

01:51:14.316 --> 01:51:16.656
data should remain private, not

01:51:16.756 --> 01:51:18.166
because you've done something

01:51:18.166 --> 01:51:19.356
wrong or that you have something

01:51:19.356 --> 01:51:21.076
to hide but because there can be

01:51:21.076 --> 01:51:22.946
a lot of sensitive data on your

01:51:22.946 --> 01:51:24.926
devices, and we think you should

01:51:24.926 --> 01:51:26.656
be in control of who sees it.

01:51:27.546 --> 01:51:29.546
Now, to begin we protect your

01:51:29.546 --> 01:51:31.396
information on your devices

01:51:32.076 --> 01:51:34.306
using state of the art hardware

01:51:34.306 --> 01:51:36.486
and software, and this year

01:51:36.486 --> 01:51:38.146
we're adding greater protections

01:51:38.556 --> 01:51:40.306
about how apps can access that

01:51:40.306 --> 01:51:40.916
information.

01:51:42.006 --> 01:51:44.166
Today, Apple devices check in

01:51:44.166 --> 01:51:45.736
with you before granting an app

01:51:45.736 --> 01:51:47.716
access to information like your

01:51:47.716 --> 01:51:48.426
location.

01:51:48.996 --> 01:51:50.156
You could tell because you'll

01:51:50.156 --> 01:51:51.466
see an alert just like this one,

01:51:52.056 --> 01:51:54.106
and macOS already provides

01:51:54.106 --> 01:51:56.586
API-level protections for things

01:51:56.586 --> 01:51:59.216
like contacts, photos, calendar,

01:51:59.216 --> 01:52:00.816
and reminders, but now in

01:52:00.816 --> 01:52:02.896
Mojave, we're extending these

01:52:02.896 --> 01:52:05.026
protections to include your

01:52:05.026 --> 01:52:07.856
camera and your microphone as

01:52:07.856 --> 01:52:09.186
well as protecting sensitive

01:52:09.186 --> 01:52:10.786
parts of your file system, like

01:52:10.786 --> 01:52:12.536
your mail database, your message

01:52:12.536 --> 01:52:14.426
history, and your backups.

01:52:14.916 --> 01:52:16.786
And all of this is protected by

01:52:16.786 --> 01:52:19.236
default for any app that you run

01:52:19.236 --> 01:52:20.226
on the system, an important

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:20.926
protection.

01:52:27.116 --> 01:52:28.106
Next, I want to turn to some

01:52:28.106 --> 01:52:30.006
great enhancements to Safari.

01:52:30.406 --> 01:52:31.756
Safari works really hard to

01:52:32.296 --> 01:52:33.856
protect your privacy, and this

01:52:33.856 --> 01:52:35.736
year it's working even harder.

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:37.856
Last year, we introduced

01:52:37.856 --> 01:52:39.556
intelligent tracking prevention

01:52:39.916 --> 01:52:41.546
to dramatically reduce the

01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:43.456
ability for apps to track you

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:45.486
across websites using cookies.

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:47.566
This is the kind of thing where

01:52:47.566 --> 01:52:48.946
you look at a product on one

01:52:48.946 --> 01:52:49.306
site.

01:52:49.656 --> 01:52:51.106
Then you move to another site

01:52:51.376 --> 01:52:53.096
and another site and somehow

01:52:53.096 --> 01:52:54.156
this is just following you

01:52:54.156 --> 01:52:55.286
wherever you go.

01:52:56.206 --> 01:52:58.116
Well, we've all seen these,

01:52:58.166 --> 01:53:00.486
these like buttons and share

01:53:00.486 --> 01:53:02.586
buttons and these comment

01:53:02.716 --> 01:53:03.246
fields.

01:53:03.896 --> 01:53:05.876
Well, it turns out these can be

01:53:05.876 --> 01:53:07.816
used to track you, whether you

01:53:07.816 --> 01:53:10.516
click on them or not, and so

01:53:10.516 --> 01:53:12.416
this year we are shutting that

01:53:12.496 --> 01:53:12.976
down.

01:53:23.026 --> 01:53:23.966
with one of these or one of

01:53:23.966 --> 01:53:25.526
these apps tries to access that

01:53:25.526 --> 01:53:28.186
information, you'll get this,

01:53:28.186 --> 01:53:30.416
and you can decide to keep your

01:53:30.416 --> 01:53:31.426
information private.

01:53:32.386 --> 01:53:37.116
Now next let's talk about

01:53:37.216 --> 01:53:37.896
Fingerprinting.

01:53:38.486 --> 01:53:40.776
You know, data companies are

01:53:40.776 --> 01:53:43.106
clever and relentless, and in

01:53:43.106 --> 01:53:45.936
addition to cookies, they use

01:53:45.936 --> 01:53:47.016
another method called

01:53:47.016 --> 01:53:47.876
Fingerprinting.

01:53:48.246 --> 01:53:49.336
And here's how it works.

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:51.346
Just like you can be identified

01:53:51.346 --> 01:53:53.516
by a fingerprint, it turns out

01:53:53.516 --> 01:53:55.456
that when you browse the web,

01:53:55.816 --> 01:53:57.476
you're device can be identify by

01:53:57.476 --> 01:53:59.516
a unique set of characteristics,

01:53:59.946 --> 01:54:02.276
like its configuration, its

01:54:02.416 --> 01:54:04.066
fonts that you have installed

01:54:04.066 --> 01:54:05.686
and the plug-insulin that you

01:54:05.686 --> 01:54:06.686
might have on the device.

01:54:06.686 --> 01:54:08.666
And these data companies can use

01:54:08.666 --> 01:54:10.136
the set of characteristics to

01:54:10.136 --> 01:54:11.736
construct a unique fingerprint

01:54:12.346 --> 01:54:14.266
to track your device from site

01:54:14.506 --> 01:54:14.976
to site.

01:54:16.666 --> 01:54:17.896
With Mojave, we're making it

01:54:17.896 --> 01:54:20.176
much harder for trackers to

01:54:20.216 --> 01:54:21.276
create a unique fingerprint.

01:54:22.006 --> 01:54:23.306
We're presenting webpages with

01:54:23.306 --> 01:54:24.816
only a simplified system

01:54:24.816 --> 01:54:25.606
configuration.

01:54:26.486 --> 01:54:27.806
We show them only built-in

01:54:27.876 --> 01:54:30.426
fonts, and Legacy plug-insulin

01:54:30.426 --> 01:54:31.426
are no longer supported, so

01:54:31.426 --> 01:54:32.696
those can't contribute to a

01:54:32.776 --> 01:54:34.736
fingerprint, and as a result,

01:54:34.736 --> 01:54:36.666
your Mac will look more like

01:54:36.666 --> 01:54:38.286
everyone else's Mac, and it will

01:54:38.286 --> 01:54:39.936
be dramatically more difficult

01:54:39.936 --> 01:54:41.296
for data companies to uniquely

01:54:41.296 --> 01:54:42.806
identify your device and track

01:55:34.116 --> 01:55:34.456
lot.

01:55:34.976 --> 01:55:36.106
We've got a bunch of great new

01:55:36.106 --> 01:55:37.596
features coming later this year

01:55:37.596 --> 01:55:38.666
that we'll cover in sessions.

01:55:39.806 --> 01:55:41.746
This year, we are turning our

01:55:41.926 --> 01:55:47.456
attention to the Mac App Store.

01:55:47.456 --> 01:55:48.246
[applause] Since it launched in

01:55:48.316 --> 01:55:50.666
2011, it's changed the way we

01:55:50.666 --> 01:55:52.236
download and install software

01:55:52.236 --> 01:55:54.746
for Mac, making it easy with one

01:55:54.896 --> 01:55:55.146
click.

01:55:56.136 --> 01:55:57.706
It's the biggest catalogue of

01:55:57.706 --> 01:55:59.266
Mac apps in the world.

01:55:59.776 --> 01:56:01.526
It's also a trusted and safe

01:56:01.526 --> 01:56:03.006
place to download software.

01:56:03.316 --> 01:56:05.086
Entrusting where you get your

01:56:05.326 --> 01:56:06.676
apps from has become more

01:56:06.676 --> 01:56:07.796
important than ever.

01:56:08.436 --> 01:56:09.976
Developers can distribute their

01:56:10.156 --> 01:56:12.936
apps to 155 countries and get

01:56:12.936 --> 01:56:14.586
worldwide payment processing,

01:56:14.586 --> 01:56:17.066
and it offers seamless software

01:56:17.286 --> 01:56:18.376
updates from one place.

01:56:18.376 --> 01:56:20.686
This adds up to a great

01:56:20.686 --> 01:56:22.096
experience for our users.

01:56:23.576 --> 01:56:24.566
We've spent a lot of time

01:56:24.646 --> 01:56:26.656
thinking about what people do on

01:56:26.656 --> 01:56:28.456
their Macs and wanting to create

01:56:28.456 --> 01:56:30.426
a place organized around those

01:56:30.536 --> 01:56:30.966
themes.

01:56:31.576 --> 01:56:33.886
So we've redesigned an all new

01:56:33.886 --> 01:56:35.726
Mac App Store from the ground

01:56:35.726 --> 01:56:37.676
up, and we're thrilled to show

01:56:37.676 --> 01:56:37.976
it to you now.

01:56:38.516 --> 01:56:45.636
[ Applause ]

01:56:46.136 --> 01:56:47.316
It's got a beautiful UI that

01:56:47.316 --> 01:56:49.536
should feel familiar but new and

01:56:49.536 --> 01:56:51.196
designed first and foremost to

01:56:51.196 --> 01:56:52.456
be a great Mac app.

01:56:53.366 --> 01:56:54.506
Starting with the new discover

01:56:54.506 --> 01:56:56.646
tab where each week you can find

01:56:56.776 --> 01:56:58.836
in-depth editorial about the

01:56:58.916 --> 01:57:01.096
best Mac apps through stories

01:57:01.096 --> 01:57:03.426
and collections and see what's

01:57:03.426 --> 01:57:05.196
most popular with top charts.

01:57:06.716 --> 01:57:08.806
Here's a story about musician

01:57:08.806 --> 01:57:10.816
and founder Karim Morsy.

01:57:11.086 --> 01:57:13.286
Learn about how he uses his app,

01:57:13.606 --> 01:57:15.986
Djay Pro 2, and get inspiration

01:57:15.986 --> 01:57:16.746
for your own set.

01:57:18.166 --> 01:57:20.456
Helpful videos auto play, so you

01:57:20.456 --> 01:57:22.276
can see what apps are capable of

01:57:22.276 --> 01:57:24.476
before downloading them.

01:57:25.036 --> 01:57:28.046
Visit the all-new create, work,

01:57:28.046 --> 01:57:30.486
play, and develop tabs where

01:57:30.486 --> 01:57:31.516
you'll find helpful

01:57:31.516 --> 01:57:33.806
recommendations and expertise

01:57:33.806 --> 01:57:35.216
around each theme.

01:57:36.706 --> 01:57:37.856
Here's the create tab where you

01:57:37.856 --> 01:57:39.456
can find apps that bring your

01:57:39.456 --> 01:57:40.836
artistic ideas to light.

01:57:41.826 --> 01:57:43.476
These tabs will also help you

01:57:43.476 --> 01:57:44.916
make the most of apps you might

01:57:44.916 --> 01:57:46.656
already have with tips and

01:57:46.656 --> 01:57:48.526
tutorials even the most expert

01:57:48.596 --> 01:57:50.086
users will find useful.

01:57:51.076 --> 01:57:55.006
The work, play, and develop tabs

01:57:55.556 --> 01:57:57.276
share the same beautiful design,

01:57:57.766 --> 01:57:59.046
and you can still browse by

01:57:59.046 --> 01:58:02.926
category on the categories tab.

01:58:03.116 --> 01:58:04.676
We've redesigned product pages

01:58:04.756 --> 01:58:06.816
too, bringing many features over

01:58:06.816 --> 01:58:08.716
from iOS based on our learnings

01:58:08.756 --> 01:58:09.066
there.

01:58:09.526 --> 01:58:11.496
It has more useful information

01:58:11.496 --> 01:58:13.476
like video previews available on

01:58:13.476 --> 01:58:14.916
the Mac App Store for the first

01:58:14.996 --> 01:58:17.446
time, an apps rank if it's

01:58:17.446 --> 01:58:18.746
charting and if it's been named

01:58:18.746 --> 01:58:19.516
editor's choice.

01:58:20.186 --> 01:58:22.906
Ratings and reviews are now

01:58:23.076 --> 01:58:25.106
front and center, and these are

01:58:25.236 --> 01:58:26.866
so important for app discovery.

01:58:27.326 --> 01:58:29.196
So we're introducing a ratings

01:58:29.196 --> 01:58:31.106
and review API for Mac apps.

01:58:32.036 --> 01:58:33.926
Now, it'll be easier than ever

01:58:33.926 --> 01:58:35.366
for people to leave feedback.

01:58:36.856 --> 01:58:38.436
We're really excited about the

01:58:38.436 --> 01:58:39.896
all-new Mac App Store.

01:58:40.206 --> 01:58:41.506
We've talked to some developers

01:58:41.506 --> 01:58:42.856
already, and they're really

01:58:42.856 --> 01:58:43.666
excited too.

01:58:44.276 --> 01:58:46.386
Like Microsoft, who will bring

01:58:46.386 --> 01:58:48.856
Office 365 to the Mac App Store

01:58:48.856 --> 01:58:49.876
later this year.

01:58:50.516 --> 01:58:53.566
[ Applause ]

01:58:54.066 --> 01:58:55.956
And Adobe is bringing Lightroom

01:58:55.956 --> 01:58:56.736
CC.

01:58:57.706 --> 01:58:59.886
Panic is bringing Transmit.

01:58:59.886 --> 01:59:03.506
And Bare Bones is bringing BB

01:59:03.506 --> 01:59:03.906
Edit.

01:59:04.326 --> 01:59:07.326
[applause] And many more great

01:59:07.386 --> 01:59:09.096
names are coming to the all-new

01:59:09.096 --> 01:59:10.346
Mac App Store too.

01:59:11.106 --> 01:59:12.446
We can't wait for you to check

01:59:12.446 --> 01:59:13.816
out the new Mac App Store.

01:59:14.226 --> 01:59:16.176
Now, I'll hand it back to Craig.

01:59:17.516 --> 01:59:23.006
[ Applause ]

01:59:23.506 --> 01:59:25.066
So we think the Mac App Store is

01:59:25.066 --> 01:59:26.606
going to inspire whole-new

01:59:26.606 --> 01:59:28.596
generations of apps, and so we

01:59:28.596 --> 01:59:29.956
want to talk about some of the

01:59:29.956 --> 01:59:32.416
technologies that will be behind

01:59:32.746 --> 01:59:34.426
some of that next generation.

01:59:34.826 --> 01:59:36.726
We spoke earlier about ARKit.

01:59:36.816 --> 01:59:38.906
I want to talk about two more.

01:59:39.716 --> 01:59:41.526
And let's start with Metal.

01:59:42.386 --> 01:59:44.016
Now Metal is the technology to

01:59:44.016 --> 01:59:45.416
get the highest performance

01:59:45.446 --> 01:59:47.656
graphics and computation from

01:59:47.656 --> 01:59:48.866
graphics processors.

01:59:49.306 --> 01:59:50.766
Metal was designed for modern

01:59:50.986 --> 01:59:51.216
GPUs.

01:59:51.216 --> 01:59:54.266
It's incredibly efficient, and

01:59:54.266 --> 01:59:55.346
that enables amazing

01:59:55.346 --> 01:59:56.936
console-level games like

01:59:57.076 --> 01:59:59.556
Fortnight from Epic to run great

01:59:59.556 --> 02:00:01.776
for the first time on mobile.

02:00:02.666 --> 02:00:04.286
But Metal also enables these

02:00:04.286 --> 02:00:06.756
games to scale to take full

02:00:06.756 --> 02:00:08.726
advantage of modern Macs.

02:00:09.386 --> 02:00:11.396
In fact, across iOS and the Mac,

02:00:11.546 --> 02:00:13.346
there are over one billion

02:00:13.446 --> 02:00:16.606
Metal-enabled devices, and we're

02:00:16.606 --> 02:00:18.196
constantly making Metal better.

02:00:18.946 --> 02:00:20.806
To bring the highest GPU

02:00:20.806 --> 02:00:22.376
performance in reach of all

02:00:22.926 --> 02:00:24.086
Macs, we've recently added

02:00:24.086 --> 02:00:27.156
support for external GPUs, and

02:00:28.686 --> 02:00:30.416
this is powered by Metal, and

02:00:30.416 --> 02:00:31.896
the results are truly mind

02:00:31.896 --> 02:00:32.396
boggling.

02:00:32.886 --> 02:00:35.116
For instance, running a filter

02:00:35.116 --> 02:00:36.816
in DaVinci Resolve, look at how

02:00:36.816 --> 02:00:38.896
it scales on the incredibly fast

02:00:38.896 --> 02:00:41.796
iMac Pro as you add up to four

02:00:41.796 --> 02:00:42.326
eGPUs.

02:00:42.326 --> 02:00:45.056
Now, the results are even more

02:00:45.056 --> 02:00:46.256
staggering when you take a

02:00:46.356 --> 02:00:48.486
13-inch MacBook Pro and add

02:00:48.486 --> 02:00:51.806
eGPUs to it, achieving up to 8.5

02:00:51.806 --> 02:00:53.206
times speedup.

02:00:53.206 --> 02:00:54.056
It's pretty awesome.

02:00:55.376 --> 02:00:57.606
Now, eGPUs also enable Macs to

02:00:57.606 --> 02:00:58.956
achieve all-new levels of

02:00:58.956 --> 02:01:00.886
performance and realism in 3D

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:02.386
rendering and gaming.

02:01:02.846 --> 02:01:04.276
Now this beautiful forest you

02:01:04.276 --> 02:01:06.106
see here, this isn't a video

02:01:06.106 --> 02:01:06.686
capture.

02:01:07.346 --> 02:01:09.676
This is from Unity's new Book of

02:01:09.676 --> 02:01:11.606
the Dead interactive demo, and

02:01:11.606 --> 02:01:13.816
it's being rendered live right

02:01:13.866 --> 02:01:16.956
now on a MacBook with an eGPU

02:01:16.956 --> 02:01:18.546
powering this display.

02:01:18.646 --> 02:01:19.796
I mean doesn't this look

02:01:19.796 --> 02:01:19.976
amazing?

02:01:20.516 --> 02:01:25.206
[ Applause ]

02:01:25.706 --> 02:01:26.966
Now, of course because this is

02:01:27.026 --> 02:01:28.986
rendered live, we can check

02:01:29.016 --> 02:01:30.436
what's up ahead, so let's start

02:01:30.436 --> 02:01:30.796
walking.

02:01:32.206 --> 02:01:33.726
Now Unity is using Metal's

02:01:33.956 --> 02:01:36.586
unified graphics and compute to

02:01:36.646 --> 02:01:39.076
generate real-time lighting and

02:01:39.106 --> 02:01:41.556
complex post-processing effects.

02:01:43.186 --> 02:01:46.696
So cool. And that's all rendered

02:01:46.816 --> 02:01:49.096
live on a MacBook running with

02:01:49.096 --> 02:01:50.096
an eGPU.

02:01:50.096 --> 02:01:50.976
It's pretty great.

02:01:51.516 --> 02:01:56.546
[ Applause ]

02:01:57.046 --> 02:01:58.056
Now another place where we're

02:01:58.056 --> 02:01:59.356
doing incredible acceleration

02:01:59.356 --> 02:02:01.366
with Metal is in machine

02:02:01.366 --> 02:02:01.756
learning.

02:02:02.236 --> 02:02:04.886
And today ML specialists usually

02:02:04.886 --> 02:02:07.336
use one of these third-party

02:02:07.336 --> 02:02:09.116
libraries to train their models

02:02:09.206 --> 02:02:11.396
using servers, and now it turns

02:02:11.396 --> 02:02:13.236
out we can accelerate tools like

02:02:13.306 --> 02:02:14.476
this with our new Metal

02:02:14.476 --> 02:02:15.866
performance shaders.

02:02:16.036 --> 02:02:17.616
We're seeing speedups of up to

02:02:17.616 --> 02:02:20.176
20 times and using the GPU with

02:02:20.176 --> 02:02:21.606
Metal instead of CPU-based

02:02:21.606 --> 02:02:22.166
training.

02:02:22.496 --> 02:02:23.826
And while speeding these tools

02:02:23.826 --> 02:02:25.446
up is great, we actually thing

02:02:25.446 --> 02:02:26.916
there's a better way for most

02:02:26.916 --> 02:02:29.226
developers, and that's training

02:02:29.226 --> 02:02:31.146
on the Mac you already have

02:02:31.496 --> 02:02:33.836
using a great new tool we call

02:02:33.836 --> 02:02:34.726
Create ML.

02:02:35.516 --> 02:02:39.536
[ Applause ]

02:02:40.036 --> 02:02:41.816
Now, Create ML is designed to

02:02:41.906 --> 02:02:43.816
let you train without being a

02:02:43.816 --> 02:02:45.126
machine learning expert.

02:02:45.566 --> 02:02:47.466
You can train vision and natural

02:02:47.496 --> 02:02:48.366
language models.

02:02:48.366 --> 02:02:49.926
You can bring your own custom

02:02:49.926 --> 02:02:51.186
data, and it's really easy to

02:02:51.186 --> 02:02:52.826
use because it's all built in

02:02:52.826 --> 02:02:53.946
Swift.

02:02:53.946 --> 02:02:55.246
In fact, you can use Xcode

02:02:55.326 --> 02:02:56.706
Playgrounds to train your model.

02:02:56.746 --> 02:02:58.846
Just drag one in, you're

02:02:58.846 --> 02:03:00.326
training set, you can drag in

02:03:00.326 --> 02:03:02.016
your test set as well, and the

02:03:02.016 --> 02:03:03.846
training is all GPU accelerated,

02:03:03.846 --> 02:03:05.686
so it's incredibly fast.

02:03:06.316 --> 02:03:07.966
Now, as an example, we worked

02:03:07.966 --> 02:03:09.076
with Memrise.

02:03:09.146 --> 02:03:10.846
They're a developer who uses the

02:03:10.846 --> 02:03:13.036
camera to identify objects and

02:03:13.036 --> 02:03:13.816
speak them in multiple

02:03:13.816 --> 02:03:16.016
languages, and in the past, they

02:03:16.016 --> 02:03:16.926
would train their model with

02:03:16.926 --> 02:03:18.766
20,000 images, and it would take

02:03:18.766 --> 02:03:21.766
them 24 hours to do so.

02:03:21.866 --> 02:03:23.906
Well now with Create ML, they

02:03:23.906 --> 02:03:27.266
can train that same model in 48

02:03:27.266 --> 02:03:28.976
minutes on a MacBook Pro.

02:03:29.516 --> 02:03:34.066
[ Applause ]

02:03:34.566 --> 02:03:37.186
And on iMac Pro, it's just 18

02:03:37.186 --> 02:03:37.386
minutes.

02:03:37.386 --> 02:03:39.446
And what's even more incredible

02:03:39.446 --> 02:03:41.066
is that model in the past for

02:03:41.066 --> 02:03:43.486
them was 90 megabytes, and now

02:03:43.486 --> 02:03:45.066
it's just three megabytes.

02:03:45.556 --> 02:03:46.946
It's a huge difference.

02:03:48.516 --> 02:03:51.706
[ Applause ]

02:03:52.206 --> 02:03:53.826
Now we also are making models

02:03:53.966 --> 02:03:55.886
run much faster on device using

02:03:55.886 --> 02:03:56.956
Core ML 2.

02:03:56.956 --> 02:03:58.486
Now Core ML is our technology

02:03:58.526 --> 02:04:00.186
for high performance on-device

02:04:00.186 --> 02:04:01.846
machine learning, and now it's

02:04:01.846 --> 02:04:02.676
better than ever.

02:04:03.506 --> 02:04:05.106
It's 30 percent faster in

02:04:05.106 --> 02:04:06.676
on-device processing using a

02:04:06.676 --> 02:04:07.726
technique called batch

02:04:07.826 --> 02:04:09.856
predictions, and you can reduce

02:04:09.856 --> 02:04:12.046
your model size by up to 75

02:04:12.096 --> 02:04:14.056
percent using quantization.

02:04:14.696 --> 02:04:18.016
And so that's Core ML and Create

02:04:18.016 --> 02:04:18.276
ML.

02:04:18.746 --> 02:04:19.826
You no longer have to be an

02:04:19.826 --> 02:04:22.566
expert in machine learning to

02:04:22.566 --> 02:04:23.976
build those techniques into your

02:04:25.256 --> 02:04:25.346
app.

02:04:25.616 --> 02:04:27.486
Now, these technologies are

02:04:27.536 --> 02:04:29.006
redefining what's possible in

02:04:29.076 --> 02:04:31.986
apps, and they're common not

02:04:31.986 --> 02:04:34.046
just to macOS but also to iOS,

02:04:34.046 --> 02:04:35.976
and the fact that the mac and

02:04:36.066 --> 02:04:38.736
iOS share so much technology has

02:04:39.086 --> 02:04:41.676
led people almost every year to

02:04:41.706 --> 02:04:44.336
keep asking us the question, are

02:04:44.336 --> 02:04:46.536
you merging iOS and macOS?

02:04:47.736 --> 02:04:49.586
So I'd like to take a moment to

02:04:49.726 --> 02:04:51.356
briefly address this question.

02:04:52.176 --> 02:04:54.966
No. Of course not.

02:04:55.516 --> 02:05:00.366
[ Applause ]

02:05:00.866 --> 02:05:02.526
We love the Mac because it's,

02:05:02.706 --> 02:05:04.206
and we love macOS because it's

02:05:04.326 --> 02:05:08.006
explicitly created that a unique

02:05:08.006 --> 02:05:10.196
characteristics of Mac hardware,

02:05:10.196 --> 02:05:11.616
like the ergonomics of the

02:05:11.696 --> 02:05:13.536
keyboard and the trackpad, the

02:05:13.536 --> 02:05:15.486
flexibility in displays and

02:05:15.486 --> 02:05:17.416
storage and because of the power

02:05:17.416 --> 02:05:18.076
it exposes.

02:05:18.076 --> 02:05:19.036
It makes the Mac able to

02:05:19.036 --> 02:05:20.686
accomplish almost anything.

02:05:21.256 --> 02:05:22.926
So we think that this question

02:05:22.926 --> 02:05:24.126
is actually coming from

02:05:24.186 --> 02:05:24.986
something else.

02:05:26.056 --> 02:05:28.126
You know, Mac users have access

02:05:28.126 --> 02:05:31.026
to a rich set of great native

02:05:31.026 --> 02:05:32.576
applications, apps that take

02:05:33.006 --> 02:05:35.076
full advantage of the power of

02:05:35.076 --> 02:05:36.176
Mac technologies.

02:05:36.786 --> 02:05:38.976
But Mac users also use apps

02:05:39.006 --> 02:05:40.356
based on other technologies.

02:05:40.896 --> 02:05:42.766
We routinely access web-based

02:05:42.766 --> 02:05:44.626
experiences like Netflix that

02:05:44.626 --> 02:05:46.636
build on WebKit, the

02:05:46.636 --> 02:05:48.416
standards-based web technology

02:05:48.416 --> 02:05:50.396
in Safari, and we also run

02:05:50.666 --> 02:05:52.776
sometimes cross-platform games

02:05:53.166 --> 02:05:55.786
built on technology like metal.

02:05:55.786 --> 02:05:58.616
And all of these platforms

02:05:58.816 --> 02:06:00.136
enrich the Mac user's

02:06:00.136 --> 02:06:00.906
experience.

02:06:01.416 --> 02:06:03.006
But we think there's room for

02:06:03.006 --> 02:06:05.166
one more, and so we'd like to

02:06:05.166 --> 02:06:06.656
give you a sneak peek of a

02:06:06.656 --> 02:06:08.676
multiyear project we have going

02:06:08.676 --> 02:06:08.916
on.

02:06:09.416 --> 02:06:10.846
Because we see a huge

02:06:10.846 --> 02:06:12.396
opportunity for the Mac to tap

02:06:12.396 --> 02:06:14.126
into the world's most vital app

02:06:14.126 --> 02:06:14.866
ecosystem.

02:06:15.676 --> 02:06:16.416
It's called iOS.

02:06:16.756 --> 02:06:18.316
I think you might be familiar

02:06:18.316 --> 02:06:18.816
with it.

02:06:19.306 --> 02:06:21.046
Now, there are millions of iOS

02:06:21.126 --> 02:06:22.466
apps out there, and we think

02:06:22.636 --> 02:06:24.206
some of them would be absolutely

02:06:24.206 --> 02:06:26.886
great on the Mac, and Mac users

02:06:26.886 --> 02:06:28.366
would love to have them there.

02:06:28.416 --> 02:06:30.546
And from a technical standpoint,

02:06:30.956 --> 02:06:32.436
it's actually a really good fit

02:06:32.436 --> 02:06:34.476
because from day one iOS and

02:06:34.476 --> 02:06:35.856
macOS have shared common

02:06:35.896 --> 02:06:36.706
foundations.

02:06:37.536 --> 02:06:39.626
But iOS devices and Mac devices

02:06:39.626 --> 02:06:41.006
of course are different, and the

02:06:41.006 --> 02:06:42.606
user interfaces are somewhat

02:06:42.606 --> 02:06:44.066
different and so the frameworks

02:06:44.066 --> 02:06:45.336
underneath are as well.

02:06:45.336 --> 02:06:46.686
And that makes today porting an

02:06:46.836 --> 02:06:49.016
app from one to the other some

02:06:49.016 --> 02:06:49.396
work.

02:06:50.276 --> 02:06:51.766
We wanted to make this much

02:06:51.866 --> 02:06:54.646
easier, and so we've taken some

02:06:54.766 --> 02:06:57.506
key frameworks from iOS and

02:06:57.506 --> 02:06:58.546
brought them to the Mac.

02:06:59.546 --> 02:07:01.016
And we've adapted them to

02:07:01.016 --> 02:07:02.816
specific Mac behaviors like use

02:07:02.816 --> 02:07:05.096
of trackpad and mouse, window

02:07:05.096 --> 02:07:07.266
resizing, integration of things

02:07:07.266 --> 02:07:08.986
like copy and paste and drag and

02:07:09.016 --> 02:07:10.666
drop into the system services on

02:07:10.666 --> 02:07:10.966
the mac.

02:07:11.966 --> 02:07:14.696
Now, phase one of this effort is

02:07:14.696 --> 02:07:16.236
to test it on ourselves.

02:07:16.786 --> 02:07:18.406
So this year in macOS, we've

02:07:18.456 --> 02:07:21.596
taken some of our own iOS apps,

02:07:22.126 --> 02:07:23.586
and we brought them to the Mac

02:07:23.696 --> 02:07:25.146
using those technologies to make

02:07:25.146 --> 02:07:26.046
sure it works well.

02:07:26.676 --> 02:07:27.656
You've actually heard about

02:07:27.656 --> 02:07:29.476
several of them earlier today,

02:07:29.476 --> 02:07:33.156
and it turns out they make

02:07:33.266 --> 02:07:35.446
fantastic Mac apps, and we're

02:07:35.446 --> 02:07:37.526
able to bring them to the Mac

02:07:37.586 --> 02:07:39.376
with very few code changes.

02:07:40.126 --> 02:07:41.606
Now, this is going to be coming

02:07:41.606 --> 02:07:43.576
to you developers next year.

02:07:44.506 --> 02:07:46.396
So you can easily bring your iOS

02:07:46.396 --> 02:07:48.236
apps to the Mac, and in the

02:07:48.236 --> 02:07:50.056
meantime, we hope you enjoy

02:07:50.056 --> 02:07:52.886

And of course there's even more.

02:08:18.416 --> 02:08:21.056
Like APFS now supports Fusion

02:08:21.056 --> 02:08:23.546
and hard drives, and Safari tabs

02:08:23.796 --> 02:08:25.206
can now have favicons if you

02:08:25.206 --> 02:08:25.776
want them there.

>> All the apps.

02:10:56.366 --> 02:10:56.716
>> Timeless.

02:10:56.716 --> 02:10:57.286
>> One drop.

02:10:57.286 --> 02:10:58.136
>> Splitter critters.

02:10:58.136 --> 02:10:58.986
>> Homework.

02:10:59.416 --> 02:11:00.916
>> Homework, you talk to her.

02:11:01.046 --> 02:11:01.976
>> My brother Derek created

02:11:02.066 --> 02:11:04.216
the app Refugees and Immigrants

02:11:04.216 --> 02:11:05.976
the creative, the collective.

02:11:06.046 --> 02:11:08.976
Why did I say the creative.

02:11:09.066 --> 02:11:09.976
>> At Christmastime, when most

02:11:10.046 --> 02:11:11.966
kids maybe would want skis or

02:11:11.966 --> 02:11:13.776
something, he wanted computer

02:11:13.776 --> 02:11:13.976
books.

02:11:14.046 --> 02:11:16.676
He stayed in his bedroom, making

02:11:16.676 --> 02:11:18.176
games while the other kids were

02:11:18.176 --> 02:11:18.956
outside playing.

02:11:19.066 --> 02:11:20.636
>> And when she is really doing

02:11:20.636 --> 02:11:22.386
the coding almost always we have

02:11:22.386 --> 02:11:23.976
to tell my daughter to stop,

02:11:24.046 --> 02:11:24.986
but then my daughter will be

02:11:24.986 --> 02:11:27.126
like, just give me another ten

02:11:27.126 --> 02:11:27.586
minutes.

02:11:27.586 --> 02:11:28.976
I want to get this solved first.

02:11:29.046 --> 02:11:30.916
>> When I watch him code, his

02:11:30.916 --> 02:11:34.896
eyes move in a weird way, and

02:11:34.896 --> 02:11:36.806
he's like totally focused.

02:11:37.266 --> 02:11:38.816
Even when my friends are over,

02:11:38.816 --> 02:11:39.626
I'd say, we'll look at

02:11:39.706 --> 02:11:42.046
Christopher, look at him.

02:11:42.046 --> 02:11:42.826
And they'd go, wow.

02:11:45.046 --> 02:11:45.976
>> When he first came to us with

02:11:46.056 --> 02:11:48.536
the idea, we were like, okay,

02:11:48.536 --> 02:11:48.956
good luck.

02:11:50.496 --> 02:11:51.906
>> He started off in his small

02:11:51.906 --> 02:11:52.976
little one-bedroom apartment

02:11:52.976 --> 02:11:53.976
with next to nothing,

02:11:54.576 --> 02:11:56.686
and sacrificed eating a burger

02:11:56.686 --> 02:11:58.136
and just have ramen just so that

02:11:58.136 --> 02:12:00.676
he could, and I'm like just buy

02:12:00.676 --> 02:12:00.976
the burger.

02:12:01.066 --> 02:12:02.306
And he's like no, that's three

02:12:02.306 --> 02:12:03.436
bucks that I could put towards

02:12:03.436 --> 02:12:03.746
the app.

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:06.066
>> Jeremy went out to build the

02:12:06.136 --> 02:12:07.426
first version of Yelp, and it

02:12:07.426 --> 02:12:08.696
was a total bust, a total

02:12:08.696 --> 02:12:08.976
failure.

02:12:09.046 --> 02:12:11.726
>> She tried really hard on a

02:12:11.726 --> 02:12:13.646
couple different titles, and

02:12:13.646 --> 02:12:14.816
you've never heard of them.

02:12:14.816 --> 02:12:16.556
And, you know, that's a really

02:12:16.556 --> 02:12:16.976
rough feeling.

02:12:17.126 --> 02:12:18.966
>> That was definitely a low

02:12:18.966 --> 02:12:20.576
point for Jeremy because it was

02:12:20.576 --> 02:12:22.756
like, hey we got to retool and

02:12:22.756 --> 02:12:22.976
try again.

02:12:23.176 --> 02:12:25.146
What Jeremy did notice in the

02:12:25.146 --> 02:12:26.556
data was that people loved

02:12:26.556 --> 02:12:28.396
writing comments, and that was

02:12:28.396 --> 02:12:30.066
really the genesis of the second

02:12:30.066 --> 02:12:31.646
version of Yelp, which worked.

02:12:32.086 --> 02:12:33.666
>> You have to be really okay

02:12:33.666 --> 02:12:35.186
with waking up to failure and

02:12:35.186 --> 02:12:36.836
then at the end of a whole bunch

02:12:36.836 --> 02:12:37.856
of failures is something that's

02:12:37.856 --> 02:12:37.976
great.

02:12:40.046 --> 02:12:41.726
>> Tessa didn't really think I

02:12:41.726 --> 02:12:42.976
want to make an app.

02:12:43.146 --> 02:12:44.836
Tessa found a problem, a food

02:12:44.836 --> 02:12:46.386
waste which you could use the

02:12:46.386 --> 02:12:47.976
app to help to solve.

02:12:48.046 --> 02:12:49.916
>> Emma's grandma was diagnosed

02:12:49.916 --> 02:12:50.856
with Alzheimer's.

02:12:51.076 --> 02:12:52.406
She even forgot my daughter's

02:12:52.406 --> 02:12:52.836
birthday.

02:12:53.536 --> 02:12:55.286
So Emma tried to search for an

02:12:55.286 --> 02:12:55.916
app that would help,

02:12:56.046 --> 02:12:56.976
but she couldn't find it.

02:12:57.066 --> 02:13:00.136
So she said, you know, why don't

02:13:00.136 --> 02:13:00.916
we just do it ourselves.

02:13:01.046 --> 02:13:03.456
>> My husband was a diabetic.

02:13:03.596 --> 02:13:07.086
That inspired Jeffrey to do

02:13:07.086 --> 02:13:08.676
something about diabetes, and

02:13:09.556 --> 02:13:11.726
it's an answer to a lot of

02:13:11.836 --> 02:13:13.066
people's prayers.

02:13:15.096 --> 02:13:17.466
>> Jessie won the iPhone game of

02:13:17.636 --> 02:13:17.806
the year.

02:13:18.366 --> 02:13:19.356
I couldn't believe that he made

02:13:19.356 --> 02:13:19.423
it.

02:13:19.546 --> 02:13:20.976
I mean to me it was remarkable.

02:13:21.496 --> 02:13:22.266
>> She pulled out her cell

02:13:22.446 --> 02:13:24.466
phone, and I saw his app on her

02:13:24.466 --> 02:13:25.356
phone, and I was like trying not

02:13:25.396 --> 02:13:26.666
to freak out, but oh my gosh.

02:13:27.526 --> 02:13:29.006
>> For my wife, it's not just

02:13:29.056 --> 02:13:31.016
creating, it's really wanting to

02:13:31.016 --> 02:13:32.976
be a part of something big.

02:13:33.116 --> 02:13:34.256
>> The one lesson that I learned

02:13:34.256 --> 02:13:35.456
from Jeremy every day is just

02:13:35.456 --> 02:13:37.636
that determination, tenacity, to

02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:37.956
focus.

02:13:38.596 --> 02:13:40.266
He foresaw the impact that the

02:13:40.486 --> 02:13:42.586
iPhone was going to have, and he

02:13:42.586 --> 02:13:43.696
bet everything on getting an app

02:13:43.696 --> 02:13:43.886
for it,

02:13:44.136 --> 02:13:45.426
and I think that it was one of

02:13:45.476 --> 02:13:47.636
the most important things that

02:13:47.706 --> 02:13:47.926
Yelp did.

02:13:48.326 --> 02:13:50.866
>> I think he's made a big

02:13:50.866 --> 02:13:52.316
difference, and so do thousands

02:13:52.316 --> 02:13:52.976
of other people.

02:13:53.606 --> 02:13:55.226
>> She wants to not just learn

02:13:55.226 --> 02:13:58.376
also teach others and it makes

02:13:58.376 --> 02:14:01.056
me really proud to see her

02:14:01.106 --> 02:14:01.286
blossom.

02:14:02.046 --> 02:14:03.406
>> As a parent, no better thing

02:14:03.406 --> 02:14:04.396
is letting your kids do what

02:14:04.396 --> 02:14:05.626
they want to do, because it

02:14:05.686 --> 02:14:06.576
isn't how much money you've

02:14:06.576 --> 02:14:06.906
made.

02:14:07.056 --> 02:14:08.926
It's really changes you've left

02:14:08.926 --> 02:14:09.466
behind.

02:14:09.676 --> 02:14:11.336
And she's hoping to leave a lot

02:14:11.336 --> 02:14:11.966
of change behind.
