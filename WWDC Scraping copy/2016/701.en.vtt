[ Music ]

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:28.026
>> All right.

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:29.726
Welcome. My name is Eric Tamura.

00:00:29.726 --> 00:00:33.256
I'm accompanied by Dominic
Giampaolo and we're going

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:34.976
to tell you a little bit
about Apple file systems.

00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:42.316
[ Applause ]

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:45.856
All right so this is going to
be a little bit of our roadmap

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:47.056
for our presentation today.

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:50.416
I'll tell you a little bit about
introduction and motivation.

00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:51.946
Why we decided to build this.

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:54.116
Some of the new features
that we've added

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:55.386
as part of Apple File System.

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:57.756
We'll do a short demo,
some of the new features.

00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:00.166
And then we'll wrap it
up with some new APIs

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.146
that you can use in your apps.

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:05.996
Okay, let's start it.

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:09.806
So as Sebastian mentioned,
Apple File System is available

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:12.296
in the WWDC build
of macOS Sierra

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:13.806
that you all got yesterday.

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:17.076
And it will be available as a
developer preview technology

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:21.496
in macOS Sierra once it
finally ships this fall.

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:24.486
So what is Apple File System?

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.616
It's our next generation
file system

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:28.936
that we've been building
for Apple products.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.796
And you might care about
this because it will run

00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.766
on watchOS, iOS, tvOS and macOS.

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.336
So as far as the
intended audience here,

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:41.746
we expect that some of you may
be either new to the platforms,

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:45.476
or you're a long time developer,
but we intend to cover all

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:48.746
of the high level of the new
file system in enough detail

00:01:48.746 --> 00:01:49.756
so you can follow along.

00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:53.876
So, one of the hallmarks of
this product is that we wanted

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:57.006
to scale from an Apple Watch
all the way up to a Mac Pro.

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:01.606
We also wanted to take advantage
of Flash and SSD storage,

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:04.916
because nearly all of
our products use SSDs.

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:09.086
And finally it's been built with
encryption as a primary feature

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:12.946
from the very beginning as we
brought this idea to fruition.

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:17.136
So you might be wondering
what about HFS+.

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:21.486
Well, we are currently shipping
HFS+ as our primary file system.

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:25.186
But its original design
is almost 30 years old

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:25.686
at this point.

00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:26.686
So how many of you would like us

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:29.176
to ship HFS+ for
another 30 years?

00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:34.746
Great. So HFS+ which
was designed in an era

00:02:34.746 --> 00:02:37.486
where floppies and hard
drives were state of the art,

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:39.686
and the world has
changed since then.

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:42.916
We now use SSDs and other next
generation storage technologies

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.466
evolving as well.

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:49.006
The data structures in HFS+ were
also relatively single treaded,

00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:52.116
so our B-trees are relying
on a big block in order

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:53.626
to access or mutate them.

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:58.766
And the data structures
are also relatively rigid.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.826
And by this we mean things
like the file record,

00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.466
or catalog record in HFS+,
which is more or less equivalent

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:07.716
to an inode in other filed
systems, is fixed in order

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:10.096
to add new fields, to
expand the file system,

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:12.426
give it new features, we
would have to incur the cost

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:15.296
of a backwards, incompatible
volume format change.

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:18.346
And by this we mean what happens
if we add a new feature to HFS+

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:21.566
and take it all the way back
to 10.5 and try to attach

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:22.746
that same file system?

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:24.056
What will happen?

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:27.546
So if we're concerned about
backwards compatibility as well

00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:30.546
as forwards compatibility
we're starting to think

00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:32.046
about well maybe it makes sense

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:34.326
to build something
completely new altogether.

00:03:34.386 --> 00:03:37.406
And so we thought
about something new.

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:40.406
So we wanted something
that was designed

00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:42.946
and tuned specifically
for Apple products.

00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:45.956
And other file systems
serve other purposes

00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:47.236
and they do it well.

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:48.936
In particular filers

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:53.556
or enterprise level storage
servers have a lot of features

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:55.706
that might not make
sense on Apple products.

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:58.246
We typically use a
single storage device all

00:03:58.246 --> 00:03:58.716
of our products.

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:01.996
And we have a wide
range of scale.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:07.216
So on an Apple Watch, you have
significantly DRAM and storage

00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:10.126
than does a Mac Pro, which
has tens of gigabytes

00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:12.766
of DRAM potentially, and
terabytes of storage.

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:15.086
So we wanted something
that's flexible and dynamic

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:18.305
and that's the platform
on which it's running.

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:23.256
So other things we wanted to
build, we wanted to add new

00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:24.976
and enhanced security
capabilities.

00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:29.146
So on iOS today we already
shipped a version of HFS+

00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:31.556
that uses per file encryption.

00:04:31.676 --> 00:04:33.336
So every file is
encrypted differently

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:36.826
on storage form every other
file on the file system.

00:04:37.546 --> 00:04:40.536
We want to take that a step
further and we'll dive into some

00:04:40.536 --> 00:04:42.796
of those features a little bit
later on in the presentation.

00:04:43.556 --> 00:04:45.246
And finally, we just wanted

00:04:45.246 --> 00:04:47.836
to add some new general
file system features

00:04:47.926 --> 00:04:49.446
that have been requested

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:52.016
and that we learned
were really important

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:53.926
for the future of our platforms.

00:04:54.926 --> 00:04:57.436
So before we get into these
new features, I just wanted

00:04:57.436 --> 00:05:00.096
to give you a brief
view of the landscape

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:02.566
of what storage software
looks like at Apple.

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:07.956
And so in terms of file systems
and storage, we talk about HFS+,

00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:12.206
but it's actually not just HFS+
in the little small bubble,

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:14.456
there's actually many
ancillary technologies

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:16.576
that comprise our
storage software.

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:19.446
So in the beginning, we
had HFS standard, almost,

00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:21.076
you know over 30 years
ago at this point.

00:05:21.716 --> 00:05:25.256
We then added HFS+, some
number of years later.

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:27.366
But we added crash
protection to it.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:30.486
So we gave it a journal of
case sensitive variant as well.

00:05:32.106 --> 00:05:35.576
We also added core storage which
gives us full disk encryption

00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:39.176
as well as our fusion drive,
which combines the speed

00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:41.236
of an SSD with the
capacity of a hard drive.

00:05:42.096 --> 00:05:44.836
And let's not forget all of
the iOS specific variants.

00:05:44.836 --> 00:05:48.916
We have an iOS specific
variant of HFS+ as well as one

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.636
that supports the
per file encryption

00:05:50.736 --> 00:05:51.676
that we just discussed.

00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:54.006
So our intention is that all

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:57.386
of these technologies will
get replaced by one thing,

00:05:57.876 --> 00:05:59.246
which is Apple File System.

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:04.016
So, let me tell you a
little bit about some

00:06:04.016 --> 00:06:05.956
of the new features
in Apple File System.

00:06:09.186 --> 00:06:13.126
So, this is a brief view of
what we've got on deck here,

00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:15.446
so we've got some improved
file system fundamentals,

00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:20.256
HFS compatibility, Space
Sharing, cloning files

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:24.166
and directories, snapshots,
and reverting to snapshots.

00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:27.136
A feature we're calling
fast directory sizing.

00:06:27.736 --> 00:06:30.366
Atomic safe save
primitives and encryption.

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:31.886
So you don't have to
memorize all of these,

00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:34.106
we will go into greater
detail of all of these

00:06:34.156 --> 00:06:35.196
in the upcoming slides.

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:40.296
So, first let's talk about some
of the improved fundamentals.

00:06:43.016 --> 00:06:45.666
So first it's been
Flash and SSD optimized.

00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:49.826
So on all of our devices, you
know on all of our iOS devices,

00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:53.486
but a lot of our Macs we ship
with SSDs so we want to be

00:06:53.486 --> 00:06:55.786
as friendly to the solid
state drives as we know how.

00:06:56.996 --> 00:06:59.196
It's also crash protected, APFS,

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:01.906
or Apple File System
employs a new and novel copy

00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:05.166
and write metadata scheme so
every metadata write is written

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.516
into a new location
on stable storage.

00:07:07.866 --> 00:07:11.016
We combine this with a
transaction subsystem

00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:14.046
which ensures that if you lose
power, if the machine panics,

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:16.796
or anything bad happens, you'll
either see a consistent view

00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:20.576
of what was on disk or you
won't see it at all, the change.

00:07:22.266 --> 00:07:25.736
We have modern 64-bit
native fields,

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:28.786
so the inode number has
been expanded to 64-bits.

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:32.556
We have timestamps
that are now 64-bits.

00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:35.036
We support nanosecond
time stamp granularity.

00:07:35.356 --> 00:07:37.366
We also support Sparks
Files for the first time

00:07:37.366 --> 00:07:38.356
on an Apple File System.

00:07:39.906 --> 00:07:43.486
And all of our file and
directory records that point

00:07:43.486 --> 00:07:44.906
at where the blocks
actually live

00:07:44.906 --> 00:07:46.706
on disks have been
expanded to 64-bits.

00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:50.056
Our data structures
were also expansible

00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:51.066
and allowed for future growth.

00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:54.596
So one thing that we
talked about HFS+ is

00:07:54.596 --> 00:07:56.976
that its data structures
are relatively rigid.

00:07:57.726 --> 00:08:01.836
And at APFS, or Apple File
System, the data structures

00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:04.586
that represent the core
inode are now flexible.

00:08:05.046 --> 00:08:06.496
So fields are either optional,

00:08:06.496 --> 00:08:07.886
or we may not have
invented them yet.

00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:10.756
So new fields that we may
choose to add down the line,

00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:13.516
will be correctly
recognized as not supported,

00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:16.826
or I don't understand if
you attach that storage

00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:19.986
to today's version
of macOS Sierra.

00:08:20.706 --> 00:08:24.116
In this way we can add
new features without fear

00:08:24.116 --> 00:08:25.846
of harming backwards
compatibility.

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.826
This also allow us to
have optional fields.

00:08:28.826 --> 00:08:32.635
So on some systems,
having the mere presence

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:34.696
of a file is enough to
convey some information.

00:08:35.356 --> 00:08:38.976
And so if you have a 0-byte file
you don't necessarily need all

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:41.126
the machinery that points at
which blocks live on disks,

00:08:41.216 --> 00:08:42.015
because they're needed.

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:43.476
So those fields are optional.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:48.336
It's also been optimized for
our Apple Software ecosystems.

00:08:48.336 --> 00:08:51.636
So we wanted to add features
and optimize the APIs

00:08:51.636 --> 00:08:53.416
that are extremely compelling

00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:55.506
for our platforms
moving forward.

00:08:55.506 --> 00:09:00.606
And we also have a
low latency design.

00:09:00.736 --> 00:09:03.326
And typically in file systems
latency is often a tradeoff

00:09:03.326 --> 00:09:05.026
between latency and throughput.

00:09:05.026 --> 00:09:07.906
And we've chosen to lean
on the side of latency.

00:09:08.136 --> 00:09:12.016
And we do this because we want
your apps when a user clicks

00:09:12.016 --> 00:09:14.626
on them on the desktop,
or they tap on them

00:09:14.626 --> 00:09:17.556
on your phone you want it to
come up quickly and responsively

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:19.306
and have very crisp animation.

00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:22.006
And the reason for that is when
you go down to the file system,

00:09:22.006 --> 00:09:24.346
we want to ensure that we
get you the answers you need

00:09:24.446 --> 00:09:25.766
as quickly as possible.

00:09:27.596 --> 00:09:29.886
And finally we have native
encryption support built

00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:30.696
into the file system.

00:09:31.216 --> 00:09:34.656
On HFS+ as we mentioned, it
uses per file encryption,

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:37.226
but those are stored on disk
through extended attributes.

00:09:37.656 --> 00:09:40.036
On Apple File System that's not
the case these are now first

00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:43.986
class citizens, first class
objects inside the file system.

00:09:45.316 --> 00:09:47.256
So that's a bit about
the fundamentals.

00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:50.436
So HFS compatibility, if all
of you have apps that run

00:09:50.436 --> 00:09:54.756
on HFS+ just fine, we intend
for those to continue to run

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:57.706
without any changes
whatsoever on your side.

00:09:58.366 --> 00:09:59.806
So Apple File System
will support

00:09:59.806 --> 00:10:02.126
and replace HFS+ functionality.

00:10:02.376 --> 00:10:04.936
And there's an asterisks there
because there's three things

00:10:04.936 --> 00:10:06.916
that we will not
support moving forward.

00:10:07.286 --> 00:10:10.416
One of them is exchange
data, the other search FS,

00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:14.596
and the third is directory
hard links for time machine.

00:10:15.646 --> 00:10:19.606
But every other API and
behavior will be supported just

00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:21.136
as it is on HFS+.

00:10:22.156 --> 00:10:25.036
So now I want to tell you a
little bit about Space Sharing

00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:26.566
which is one of the
features that we've added

00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:28.096
into Apple File System.

00:10:29.286 --> 00:10:31.086
So let's take a quick
poll how many of you

00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:33.636
in the audience have a
Mac or have used a Mac

00:10:34.036 --> 00:10:35.506
with more than one partition?

00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:37.396
Okay, great.

00:10:37.706 --> 00:10:41.916
We do as well, one of the
things that we do internally,

00:10:41.916 --> 00:10:44.836
is we want a development
version of OS on one partition,

00:10:44.836 --> 00:10:48.456
and we want you know the stable
released version on another.

00:10:48.826 --> 00:10:50.726
Or you might choose to have
your home directory on one

00:10:50.936 --> 00:10:53.956
and other different data that
you don't care about in another.

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:57.986
But one of the things that we've
learned through our analytics

00:10:57.986 --> 00:10:59.876
that come back when users
opt in to data collection

00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:02.836
and reporting their
statistics to Apple machines is

00:11:02.836 --> 00:11:05.076
that most end users
don't do this.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:06.896
They just have the
one partition.

00:11:07.296 --> 00:11:09.846
And the reason they don't
is because it's hard.

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:12.296
You have to know exactly
how you're going to lay

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:14.096
out your disk at the
time you set it up,

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.566
and changing it is
relatively expensive.

00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:19.236
Moreover, free space
on one partition,

00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:20.876
as you know does not translate

00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:23.396
into available free space
on another partition.

00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:25.016
So we're solving this

00:11:25.016 --> 00:11:26.826
with a feature we're
calling Space Sharing.

00:11:27.676 --> 00:11:30.166
So let's take an example
here, we'll work through this

00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:31.746
as we kind of explain
the feature.

00:11:32.236 --> 00:11:34.036
Let's say you're
downloading the latest

00:11:34.036 --> 00:11:36.356
and greatest cat video you
just got of the internet

00:11:36.356 --> 00:11:38.316
from your friend
over at AirDrop.

00:11:39.286 --> 00:11:42.466
And let's say that file
grows, and it gets bigger,

00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:45.856
in fact so big that you've
completely run out of space

00:11:46.056 --> 00:11:47.606
on the partition on
which you're running.

00:11:48.526 --> 00:11:50.286
Well there's not a whole
lot you can do in this case.

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:51.526
If you're out of space,
you're out of space.

00:11:52.006 --> 00:11:55.976
One thing you could do though is
completely destroy the partition

00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:58.706
immediately afterwards
and then grow partition 1.

00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:00.256
So let's look at that.

00:12:00.256 --> 00:12:04.796
We can destroy partition
2, partition 1 grows,

00:12:04.796 --> 00:12:08.396
and now you have enough space to
continue growing your cat video.

00:12:09.786 --> 00:12:12.126
But this is also inflexible
and presents a little bit

00:12:12.126 --> 00:12:15.446
of a problem if the file that
you're downloading wasn't

00:12:15.446 --> 00:12:18.916
on partition 1, but it was
in fact on partition 0.

00:12:19.726 --> 00:12:21.366
So in this case, you're going

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.816
to grow the file,
it will get bigger.

00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:26.106
And then even if
you have free space,

00:12:26.106 --> 00:12:29.166
or content that you're willing
to destroy on partition 2,

00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:33.576
we could destroy it, but then
partition 0 couldn't grow,

00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:36.056
because it's not adjacent
to any of the free space

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:37.006
that we just made available.

00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:38.556
So we think this is something

00:12:38.556 --> 00:12:40.316
that we can solve
with Space Sharing.

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:42.446
So in Apple File
System we've come

00:12:42.446 --> 00:12:45.356
up with this base concept
we're calling the container,

00:12:45.426 --> 00:12:48.186
applicably named because
it contains volumes

00:12:48.186 --> 00:12:49.506
or individual file systems.

00:12:50.616 --> 00:12:54.156
So, in this instance, Apple File
System containers represent the

00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:55.576
lowest level of functionality.

00:12:55.576 --> 00:12:58.676
And this is what encapsulates
our block allocator,

00:12:58.676 --> 00:13:00.736
as well as our crash
protection subsystem.

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:04.786
So let's say we have volume
0, which occupies some amount

00:13:04.786 --> 00:13:07.916
of free space in the partition,

00:13:08.776 --> 00:13:11.966
volume can grow,
or it can shrink.

00:13:12.896 --> 00:13:15.466
But in all these cases the free
space will dynamically resize

00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:18.236
to what's currently available
at the time that you request it.

00:13:18.956 --> 00:13:21.366
You can also create more than
one volume in the container

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:23.226
which will occupy
incrementally more space.

00:13:24.126 --> 00:13:26.826
And then if you wanted to
grow partition or volume 0,

00:13:26.826 --> 00:13:27.986
at this point you could do so.

00:13:28.466 --> 00:13:30.966
And now if you ask for how
much free space is available

00:13:30.966 --> 00:13:32.846
on the system you will
get the area that's

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:34.466
in the green rectangle
at the bottom.

00:13:35.266 --> 00:13:37.516
So developers take note, this
is something that's a little bit

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:40.506
subtly different from how you
may have computed free space

00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:41.076
in the past.

00:13:41.076 --> 00:13:42.356
If you're using some paradigm

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:45.896
like taking a total storage
size, subtracting the used space

00:13:45.896 --> 00:13:48.086
to get the free space,
that will no longer work,

00:13:48.306 --> 00:13:49.986
because other volumes

00:13:50.116 --> 00:13:52.766
on the container are also
participating in Space Sharing.

00:13:53.446 --> 00:13:56.616
Additionally, you can't
necessarily add up all

00:13:56.616 --> 00:13:58.286
of the used space either.

00:13:59.316 --> 00:14:02.836
So, next, I'm going to invite
Dominic up and he will tell you

00:14:02.836 --> 00:14:04.886
about cloning files
and directories.

00:14:05.516 --> 00:14:11.546
[ Applause ]

00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:13.426
>> Hi. Again my name is
Dominic and I'm going to walk

00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:14.776
through a couple of the
other higher level features

00:14:14.776 --> 00:14:16.186
that we have in APFS.

00:14:16.666 --> 00:14:18.176
First, we're going
to talk about cloning

00:14:18.176 --> 00:14:19.496
of files and directories.

00:14:19.896 --> 00:14:24.026
So here we have a file, TOP
SECRET APFS.key, that Eric has

00:14:24.026 --> 00:14:24.876
in his home directory.

00:14:24.876 --> 00:14:27.046
And it has references
to two blocks of data.

00:14:27.486 --> 00:14:30.326
Now if Eric wanted to make an
archive of this presentation

00:14:30.866 --> 00:14:33.446
as it existed at this point in
time, he could copy the data

00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:35.996
by reading it all in,
and writing it back out.

00:14:36.436 --> 00:14:38.906
That has obvious
costs in terms of CPU,

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:41.406
power, and disk space usage.

00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:44.416
Instead with APFS you
can clone the file.

00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:47.036
By cloning the file,
you copy the references

00:14:47.036 --> 00:14:49.326
to the data instead
of the actual data.

00:14:49.466 --> 00:14:53.546
So it's obviously much faster
and if it's a large file,

00:14:53.616 --> 00:14:55.686
you're not using twice
the amount of space,

00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:57.246
you're using exactly
the same amount

00:14:57.246 --> 00:14:59.556
of space plus a small
incremental amount

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:01.866
for the additional
references to the data.

00:15:02.386 --> 00:15:05.076
What a clone guarantees
in the file system is

00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:07.716
that if a modification is
made to either the original

00:15:07.716 --> 00:15:09.846
or the clone, the
file system will write

00:15:09.906 --> 00:15:11.566
that data to a new location.

00:15:11.616 --> 00:15:13.436
So the clone remains untouched.

00:15:14.476 --> 00:15:16.816
So this is an important
point to be aware of.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.946
When you have clones, you
will, at the time of the clone,

00:15:20.946 --> 00:15:22.366
you're not using any
additional space.

00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:24.966
As you continue to make
modifications, you will start

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.496
to use more and more space.

00:15:27.316 --> 00:15:33.336
In addition, because APFS, or
iOS and macOS support document

00:15:33.336 --> 00:15:36.356
in application bundles,
APFS will also allow you

00:15:36.426 --> 00:15:38.736
to clone an entire
directory hierarchy.

00:15:38.736 --> 00:15:41.746
So a document bundle is a
directory which contains a set

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.586
of files inside of it.

00:15:43.586 --> 00:15:45.876
APFS can clone that
atomically as well.

00:15:47.156 --> 00:15:48.966
Next let's talk about snapshots.

00:15:49.726 --> 00:15:51.346
Here, we have another
representation

00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:53.356
of a file system
with two files in it.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.436
BikeRacing and CoffeeOrigins.

00:15:55.966 --> 00:15:57.506
BikeRacing has two
blocks of data.

00:15:58.036 --> 00:15:59.526
And CoffeeOrigins has one.

00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:03.536
If we take snapshot of the file
system, we now have a separate,

00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:07.346
independently mountable, read
only copy of the file system

00:16:07.986 --> 00:16:11.196
that represents this data the
file system at the point in time

00:16:11.196 --> 00:16:12.496
that the snapshot was taken.

00:16:12.956 --> 00:16:15.376
Much like with clones,
if a write comes

00:16:15.376 --> 00:16:18.376
into the live file system, the
file system will put that data

00:16:18.376 --> 00:16:21.836
in a new location preserving
the integrity of the snapshot.

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:27.636
Likewise, if we were to delete
CoffeeOrigins.key to try to free

00:16:27.636 --> 00:16:31.016
up some space, the file system
can't reclaim those blocks

00:16:31.086 --> 00:16:34.476
because as you can see
the snapshot continues

00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:35.676
to refer to those blocks.

00:16:36.046 --> 00:16:37.606
This is an important
consideration

00:16:37.606 --> 00:16:40.486
that developers need to be aware
of when working with snapshots

00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:44.536
because when a file is deleted,
if it was present at the time

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:46.626
of a snapshot, the
blocks aren't reclaimed.

00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:49.786
So snapshots can cause you
to use all of your disk space

00:16:49.786 --> 00:16:52.716
if you don't harvest
them periodically.

00:16:53.416 --> 00:16:56.366
We expect that developers
will probably use snapshots

00:16:56.366 --> 00:16:59.926
for the purposes of having a
stable read only copy from which

00:16:59.926 --> 00:17:02.906
to perform a backup, but we're
looking for other feedback

00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:04.396
from developers on other uses

00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:05.816
that they might have
for snapshots.

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:08.066
So please come see us
in the lab at 12:30.

00:17:08.396 --> 00:17:10.596
Let us know what you would
like to do with snapshots.

00:17:12.876 --> 00:17:14.976
Now let's talk about
reverting to a snapshot.

00:17:14.976 --> 00:17:17.256
And this is another
feature that APFS supports.

00:17:17.256 --> 00:17:20.175
So we have the same state of the
file system here but we decide

00:17:20.175 --> 00:17:23.906
that well, we don't like
this, we'd like to revert,

00:17:23.906 --> 00:17:25.445
essentially a global undo.

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:28.376
We want to go back to the point
in time of the file system

00:17:28.376 --> 00:17:30.646
at the time the snapshot
was taken.

00:17:31.036 --> 00:17:33.956
So you can flag a
file system to revert

00:17:33.956 --> 00:17:35.136
to the state of a snapshot.

00:17:35.136 --> 00:17:38.606
And the next time it's mounted,
the file system will rewind,

00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:42.376
essentially to the point it was
at the time of the snapshot.

00:17:42.656 --> 00:17:44.636
And then allow you to
continue making changes

00:17:44.636 --> 00:17:45.766
from that point forward.

00:17:45.886 --> 00:17:48.596
So, again, you can see that
CoffeeOrigins.key came back

00:17:48.956 --> 00:17:49.906
and the change that was made

00:17:49.906 --> 00:17:51.686
to the other file
has been discarded.

00:17:52.116 --> 00:17:55.026
The snapshot continues to
exist and you can revert

00:17:55.026 --> 00:17:56.586
as many times as you would like.

00:17:59.286 --> 00:17:59.496
All right.

00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:01.596
Now let's talk about
fast directory sizing.

00:18:02.346 --> 00:18:03.176
This is an answer

00:18:03.176 --> 00:18:06.386
to the question how much space
does a directory hierarchy use.

00:18:06.706 --> 00:18:09.876
Now applications frequently
need to compute this size

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:13.126
for sizing an operation to
provide progress to the user.

00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:14.976
And the obvious way
to do this is

00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:17.766
to open the directory hierarchy
iterate all the contents

00:18:17.766 --> 00:18:19.946
recursively and look at the size

00:18:19.946 --> 00:18:22.126
of all the items
to add the size up.

00:18:22.126 --> 00:18:24.596
Of course users would
really like to know

00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:26.246
that answer a little
bit more quickly.

00:18:26.636 --> 00:18:29.596
On this next slide, if you focus
your attention on the left side

00:18:29.596 --> 00:18:32.096
of the screen, when the
get info panel comes up,

00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:34.586
you'll see it says,
calculating size.

00:18:36.806 --> 00:18:39.436
And after a couple of seconds
it populates with the size.

00:18:39.716 --> 00:18:41.226
That's what we're
looking to improve.

00:18:42.086 --> 00:18:44.466
So, the file system
could keep track of this.

00:18:44.466 --> 00:18:47.286
Obviously you could store the
size of the directory hierarchy

00:18:47.316 --> 00:18:50.866
with the directory itself,
but that has one main issue,

00:18:51.226 --> 00:18:53.456
how do you safely
update copy your parent

00:18:53.456 --> 00:18:55.286
and its parents on up the chain.

00:18:55.816 --> 00:18:58.476
So we're just delving a little
bit into file system internals,

00:18:58.536 --> 00:19:02.076
but when you have a lock on a
child when you're modifying it,

00:19:02.366 --> 00:19:03.906
you can't also lock your parent,

00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:05.766
because that's a
lock order violation.

00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:09.136
File system always lock
from the parent to child,

00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:11.006
never from the child
to the parent.

00:19:11.006 --> 00:19:13.746
And so if you start doing it
the other way you have deadlock.

00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:17.606
So APFS instead sidesteps
the problem.

00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:20.266
If the problem is storing
the size with the directory,

00:19:20.416 --> 00:19:22.146
well let's store the
size somewhere else.

00:19:22.546 --> 00:19:24.426
So by storing the
size separately,

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:27.576
we can use atomic
operations to update the size

00:19:27.696 --> 00:19:30.516
in a separate record that's
maintained by the file system.

00:19:30.926 --> 00:19:33.296
And we don't have any
lock order violations.

00:19:34.126 --> 00:19:36.076
This comes at a small
incremental cost

00:19:36.076 --> 00:19:39.026
for the additional size records,
but that's basically lost

00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:40.666
in the noise with the IO.

00:19:41.426 --> 00:19:43.266
All right.

00:19:43.386 --> 00:19:46.036
Next, we're going to talk about
atomic safe-save primitives.

00:19:46.716 --> 00:19:48.906
The first example is
just a basic file.

00:19:48.906 --> 00:19:52.496
This is how safe-save works
for a regular file today.

00:19:52.936 --> 00:19:55.136
So here I have
MakeMonneyFast.key.

00:19:55.546 --> 00:19:57.276
And I come up with some
brilliant new scheme

00:19:57.276 --> 00:19:58.556
for making money fast.

00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:01.356
And when the application
saves that data, it's written

00:20:01.356 --> 00:20:03.906
to a temporary location
off on the side.

00:20:04.346 --> 00:20:06.936
When the application is happy
that everything has been written

00:20:07.176 --> 00:20:10.016
and is safe out on disk,
it will ask the file system

00:20:10.016 --> 00:20:11.106
to perform a rename.

00:20:11.296 --> 00:20:13.826
Now renames of files
have always been atomic.

00:20:14.216 --> 00:20:16.676
The file system guarantees that
it either happens completely,

00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:19.196
and it's safe, or it
doesn't happen at all.

00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:22.246
In addition, the file system
will handle deleting the

00:20:22.246 --> 00:20:23.976
previous version
of the document.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.886
So that's great for regular
files, but what happens

00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:28.236
if you have a document bundle?

00:20:28.696 --> 00:20:32.516
So here we have a document
bundle ClutchConcertReview.rtfd,

00:20:32.626 --> 00:20:35.756
which is a directory
that contains the assets

00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:37.056
of the document inside of it.

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:40.386
And what happens today is
let's say I go see Clutch play

00:20:40.386 --> 00:20:43.416
and they play a really great
show and I update my review,

00:20:43.946 --> 00:20:45.346
that change is written out,

00:20:45.716 --> 00:20:47.996
but now what commences
is there's no way

00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:51.136
to do an atomic rename
of a directory over top

00:20:51.136 --> 00:20:54.206
of another directory, because
POSIX semantics don't allow

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:57.046
that if the destination
has something inside of it.

00:20:57.436 --> 00:20:59.186
So, we begin playing
a shell game.

00:20:59.826 --> 00:21:02.886
First, the document is moved out
of the way, the live document.

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:05.396
So at this point, if
something were to go wrong

00:21:05.396 --> 00:21:06.616
and the application crashed,

00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:09.326
or the system lost
power, users data is gone.

00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:13.996
Then, the application moves the
data into place, and last it has

00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:15.906
to handle deleting
the previous version

00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:18.386
of the directory,
the document bundle.

00:21:18.706 --> 00:21:20.876
So this is not atomic
and it's not safe.

00:21:20.876 --> 00:21:22.796
And this is something
that has kind of bugged us

00:21:22.796 --> 00:21:24.986
for a very long time and
we wanted to improve it.

00:21:25.546 --> 00:21:29.116
With APFS we introduced a
new system called renamex np

00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:32.846
for non POSIX, which
allows an atomic safe-save

00:21:32.846 --> 00:21:33.776
of the directory.

00:21:34.086 --> 00:21:36.686
So now, when the
application writes the data

00:21:36.686 --> 00:21:38.126
to its temporary location,

00:21:38.536 --> 00:21:41.206
and asks to perform the
rename operation APFS

00:21:41.486 --> 00:21:43.836
with atomically handle the swap

00:21:44.326 --> 00:21:46.676
and deleting the previous
version of the document.

00:21:46.676 --> 00:21:49.126
So this is now atomic and safe.

00:21:49.126 --> 00:21:51.426
Of course as a developer, you
probably won't have to resort

00:21:51.426 --> 00:21:53.846
to this low-level of system call

00:21:54.086 --> 00:21:56.746
because it's already been
adopted by Foundation for you.

00:21:56.746 --> 00:22:00.766
So you just get the benefit of
this improved behavior on APFS.

00:22:01.516 --> 00:22:07.816
[ Applause ]

00:22:08.316 --> 00:22:09.996
Next, I'm going to
talk about encryption.

00:22:11.126 --> 00:22:13.196
So as Eric mentioned, with HFS+,

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:16.236
on the Mac we use a
layer called Core storage

00:22:16.276 --> 00:22:19.446
that sits beneath HFS,

00:22:20.016 --> 00:22:22.466
and provides full disk
encryption among other things.

00:22:22.556 --> 00:22:24.016
It's a rather sophisticated
layer,

00:22:24.016 --> 00:22:25.156
and it does a lot of things.

00:22:25.936 --> 00:22:28.076
On iOS, we have a
different variant

00:22:28.076 --> 00:22:31.806
that stores encryption keys and
extended attributes that work.

00:22:31.806 --> 00:22:33.696
And those encryption
keys work in conjunction

00:22:33.696 --> 00:22:37.186
with the accelerated AES
hardware found on iOS devices

00:22:37.186 --> 00:22:39.046
to provide per file encryption.

00:22:39.436 --> 00:22:41.016
It's a kind of complicated story

00:22:41.016 --> 00:22:42.946
with two rather different
code bases.

00:22:43.286 --> 00:22:45.176
And with APFS, we
were looking to try

00:22:45.176 --> 00:22:47.566
and provide a more
complete story

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:49.026
across all of our products.

00:22:49.916 --> 00:22:53.386
So APFS supports multiple levels
of file system encryption.

00:22:54.026 --> 00:22:56.466
But first, the easiest level
we got this working day one,

00:22:56.466 --> 00:22:57.246
is no encryption.

00:22:57.736 --> 00:23:00.016
All data is written in
plain text, all data

00:23:00.016 --> 00:23:02.456
and metadata is written
in plain text to disk.

00:23:03.056 --> 00:23:05.896
The next level is to
have one key per volume.

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:08.296
So all sensitive metadata

00:23:08.566 --> 00:23:10.886
and data are encrypted
with the same key.

00:23:11.126 --> 00:23:12.646
This is essentially
the equivalent

00:23:12.646 --> 00:23:13.846
of full disk encryption.

00:23:14.536 --> 00:23:15.846
The most sophisticated level

00:23:15.846 --> 00:23:18.036
that we support is
multi-key encryption.

00:23:18.436 --> 00:23:21.376
Here, sensitive Metadata
is encrypted

00:23:22.146 --> 00:23:26.286
with a single key that's
distinct from the per file keys

00:23:26.326 --> 00:23:30.256
that are used in
encrypting individual files.

00:23:30.606 --> 00:23:33.376
In addition, because of how
snapshots and clones work,

00:23:33.736 --> 00:23:36.426
APFS supports per
extent encryption.

00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:40.076
So each region of a file can
be encrypted with its own key.

00:23:40.526 --> 00:23:42.426
This is unique and
no other file system

00:23:42.426 --> 00:23:44.446
out there supports
anything like this.

00:23:44.896 --> 00:23:47.706
In addition, this allows us
to unify our encryption story

00:23:47.706 --> 00:23:49.276
across all of our platforms.

00:23:49.916 --> 00:23:52.036
All right and with that I'll
turn it back over to Eric.

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:59.276
[ Applause ]

00:23:59.776 --> 00:24:02.166
>> Okay so now I'm going
to show you a quick demo

00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:06.766
of Apple File System on MacOS
Sierra using the WWDC build.

00:24:09.956 --> 00:24:12.066
So probably the easiest
and fastest way

00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:13.296
to start experimenting

00:24:13.296 --> 00:24:15.606
with Apple File System
is to use a disk image.

00:24:15.606 --> 00:24:16.806
So we're going to do that first.

00:24:17.886 --> 00:24:20.676
So, you can see on the command
line here I've typed hdiutil

00:24:20.676 --> 00:24:24.506
create-fs APFS which specifies
create me a disk image

00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:27.216
of type APFS, we give it
a size and we're going

00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:28.196
to do a sparse bundle.

00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:29.856
So it's going to warn you here,

00:24:29.856 --> 00:24:32.016
because this is an
in-development project

00:24:32.266 --> 00:24:34.566
and we want you to be aware

00:24:34.566 --> 00:24:39.076
that you are using something
that's not completed 100% yet.

00:24:39.426 --> 00:24:42.626
So, at this point it will
prompt me, I'll say yes.

00:24:44.556 --> 00:24:47.446
And you've created the disk
image, which if I attach.

00:24:53.056 --> 00:24:55.216
You can examine that on
the desktop, do a get info.

00:24:56.206 --> 00:24:59.446
You can see that in fact the
file system type is the APFS.

00:24:59.446 --> 00:25:01.196
So that's probably the
easiest way if you want

00:25:01.196 --> 00:25:03.866
to just get something
and try it out.

00:25:05.186 --> 00:25:09.226
So next I want to show
you some of the other,

00:25:09.226 --> 00:25:12.186
more advanced features
that we've added.

00:25:13.356 --> 00:25:13.876
I'll close that.

00:25:14.436 --> 00:25:17.486
So here I have two thumb sticks.

00:25:17.486 --> 00:25:19.106
These are just ordinary
thumb sticks.

00:25:19.106 --> 00:25:23.036
You can get them at any
standard office supply store.

00:25:23.676 --> 00:25:24.666
So I will plug in one.

00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:27.626
One is formatted as HFS+
and the other is formatted

00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:29.036
as Apple File System.

00:25:39.056 --> 00:25:41.756
So we'll also do
a get info on both

00:25:41.756 --> 00:25:44.746
so you can watch the free
space as it manipulates.

00:25:45.336 --> 00:25:51.836
So at this point I have some
demo photos of a trip to Italy.

00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:55.746
And there's a good
amount of storage in both

00:25:55.746 --> 00:25:56.886
of those directory hierarchies.

00:25:57.366 --> 00:26:00.586
But first we're going to start
by copying this latest copy

00:26:00.586 --> 00:26:02.566
of iTunes in the HFS volume

00:26:02.566 --> 00:26:04.846
and then we'll do the
same thing in APFS.

00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:07.896
So start the copy, as that goes.

00:26:07.896 --> 00:26:09.966
You can see the progress
bar there,

00:26:10.506 --> 00:26:11.716
but APFS already finished.

00:26:11.906 --> 00:26:13.626
Because it uses the
clone under the cover.

00:26:13.626 --> 00:26:17.076
So finder has already adopted
all of the new cloning behavior.

00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:19.716
So if you do a copy and finder
it will automatically clone

00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:21.046
for you behind the scenes.

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.926
And HFS still hasn't
finished yet.

00:26:23.516 --> 00:26:26.956
[ Applause ]

00:26:27.456 --> 00:26:31.506
Okay, so I could do the same
thing with the demo photos,

00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:33.866
which you can look in here,
there's several photos,

00:26:33.866 --> 00:26:36.166
they're all several
megabytes in size.

00:26:36.696 --> 00:26:43.056
Pay attention to the free space
up here, 3.35-gigabytes free.

00:26:43.146 --> 00:26:46.986
So if I do a copy, it's actually
going to do a clone for me

00:26:47.196 --> 00:26:50.216
and you notice the free space
actually did not decrease

00:26:50.216 --> 00:26:50.486
at all.

00:26:52.476 --> 00:26:56.996
So next, I'm going to
show taking a snapshot.

00:26:58.396 --> 00:27:01.126
So this uses the tool
called SnapshotUtil

00:27:01.126 --> 00:27:03.626
which will be available
in the public data once

00:27:03.626 --> 00:27:05.656
that releases to everybody.

00:27:06.656 --> 00:27:09.596
Oh, sorry this needs
to be run as root.

00:27:12.046 --> 00:27:13.966
Okay so now I've
created a snapshot,

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:17.586
I can examine it
with Snapshotutil-s.

00:27:24.046 --> 00:27:26.606
And you can see that it
now knows about APFS Snap.

00:27:27.136 --> 00:27:32.386
So I've created a map point,
already before this session.

00:27:33.016 --> 00:27:36.666
So I will mount this
snapshot at this time.

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:39.146
And you can see that
the snapshot showed

00:27:39.146 --> 00:27:42.336
up on the desktop and this
contains a read only view

00:27:42.336 --> 00:27:44.966
of the file system as
it exists at the time

00:27:45.076 --> 00:27:45.776
that I just took it, so.

00:27:46.516 --> 00:27:53.426
[ Applause ]

00:27:53.926 --> 00:27:54.986
So now in the APFS volume,

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:57.706
I'm going to create
a temporary file,

00:27:59.466 --> 00:28:01.906
hello I am a temporary file.

00:28:03.096 --> 00:28:04.596
Save that, close it.

00:28:04.596 --> 00:28:06.346
You can see that
it showed up here

00:28:06.686 --> 00:28:09.306
in that APFS volume this
is mounted read write.

00:28:09.366 --> 00:28:11.726
But it's not there
in the snapshot.

00:28:14.136 --> 00:28:18.006
Correspondingly, I
can also delete some

00:28:18.006 --> 00:28:19.446
of these demo photos.

00:28:19.676 --> 00:28:22.466
I'll move them to the
trash and then delete them.

00:28:24.146 --> 00:28:26.526
The free space actually
still does not decrease,

00:28:26.556 --> 00:28:31.006
because now they're pinned by
the presence of the snapshot.

00:28:31.116 --> 00:28:33.306
So if I wanted to delete
them I would also have

00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:35.936
to delete the snapshot.

00:28:38.476 --> 00:28:40.456
Okay, so that's just
a quick peak

00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:43.076
of Apple File System in action.

00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:50.546
[ Applause ]

00:28:51.046 --> 00:28:53.836
Okay, so let's talk about some
of the new APIs that we've added

00:28:53.916 --> 00:28:55.356
to support Apple File System.

00:28:56.476 --> 00:28:59.196
So first, is one that
we probably expect

00:28:59.196 --> 00:28:59.976
that you're familiar with.

00:28:59.976 --> 00:29:01.446
If you're using the Foundation

00:29:01.446 --> 00:29:04.576
or the FileManager these have
both been Swift enhanced.

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:09.116
So is use copy item or replace
item they will adopt either the

00:29:09.176 --> 00:29:12.186
clone or the safe-save
semantics that we just described

00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:14.146
for you automatically, you
don't have to do anything

00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:15.246
so it just comes for free.

00:29:15.786 --> 00:29:16.736
It automatically figures

00:29:16.736 --> 00:29:19.466
out if the file system
you're suing is HFS+

00:29:19.466 --> 00:29:21.836
or Apple File System and
will use the behavior only

00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:22.996
when it is appropriate.

00:29:24.476 --> 00:29:27.236
If, however you decide
that the Foundation

00:29:27.236 --> 00:29:29.476
or the FileManager doesn't
provide exactly what you need,

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:31.056
you can go a little bit lower

00:29:31.056 --> 00:29:33.396
and we have a library
called libcopyfile.

00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:36.426
And this supports the
copying of deep hierarchies

00:29:36.426 --> 00:29:37.896
and this is what we
used for a number

00:29:37.896 --> 00:29:39.296
of years before we had cloning.

00:29:40.066 --> 00:29:43.236
So copy files supports a new
bit, called COPYFILE CLONE.

00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:46.816
It's equivalent to the 5 or
6-bits that are below it.

00:29:47.236 --> 00:29:48.756
And we decided to
make this opt-in

00:29:48.756 --> 00:29:50.776
because if you're using
a specialized library

00:29:50.776 --> 00:29:53.446
like this you may not
necessarily want your

00:29:53.446 --> 00:29:55.396
[inaudible] and extended
attributes and everything else

00:29:55.396 --> 00:29:58.326
to be copied exactly
as they are.

00:29:58.726 --> 00:30:01.286
Whereas cloning will implicitly
copy all of those things.

00:30:01.686 --> 00:30:05.616
Again, this library will also
automatically call clone for you

00:30:05.616 --> 00:30:07.236
if the backend file
system supports it.

00:30:07.516 --> 00:30:09.766
And if not it will continue
to do what it's always done.

00:30:11.416 --> 00:30:14.156
These are the new
safe-save APIs, so renamex np

00:30:14.156 --> 00:30:17.736
and renameatx np are
the new system calls

00:30:17.736 --> 00:30:20.116
to support the safe-save
primitives.

00:30:20.796 --> 00:30:23.136
These are available in the
Man Pages in your version

00:30:23.136 --> 00:30:25.266
of macOS Sierra that you have
so if you'd like to take a peek

00:30:25.266 --> 00:30:26.876
at the Man Page,
they're right there.

00:30:27.026 --> 00:30:29.706
And these are the
cloning APIs as well.

00:30:29.836 --> 00:30:33.036
So clone files and its
variance, support the cloning

00:30:33.036 --> 00:30:34.216
of files and directories.

00:30:35.276 --> 00:30:38.996
So a word on compatibility,
we expect that the easiest way

00:30:38.996 --> 00:30:41.776
to get access to an
Apple File System images

00:30:41.776 --> 00:30:44.036
to use hdiutil as I showed you.

00:30:44.406 --> 00:30:46.406
It's currently available
in the command line only

00:30:46.486 --> 00:30:50.026
for macOS Sierra so as a
developer preview technology has

00:30:50.026 --> 00:30:53.276
not been fully wired up into
disk utility intentionally.

00:30:53.596 --> 00:30:55.476
So the fastest way
to use something

00:30:55.476 --> 00:30:57.446
like this hdiutil create-fs APFS

00:30:57.446 --> 00:31:01.046
and you can get a disk
image and attach it.

00:31:01.516 --> 00:31:05.766
You can also use diskutil
apfs to add a container,

00:31:05.766 --> 00:31:07.996
delete a container, add a
volume, delete a volume.

00:31:08.286 --> 00:31:11.576
Whatever lower-level
manipulations you want to do

00:31:11.746 --> 00:31:12.916
to the container itself.

00:31:13.666 --> 00:31:15.196
And finally, we also
have an FS check

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:16.936
that we've been working
on as well.

00:31:17.276 --> 00:31:20.326
So this will be able to
validate the file system

00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:21.626
as well as perform repairs.

00:31:21.976 --> 00:31:24.246
So that's also continuing
to be in development.

00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:27.216
So, some current limitations

00:31:27.216 --> 00:31:30.086
of Apple File System file
system in macOS Sierra.

00:31:31.136 --> 00:31:32.926
This will be supported
on data volumes only.

00:31:32.926 --> 00:31:35.566
We don't support booting from
Apple File System right now.

00:31:37.006 --> 00:31:40.556
Time machine backups with Apple
File System are not supported

00:31:40.556 --> 00:31:40.996
right now.

00:31:42.556 --> 00:31:45.466
File vault and fusion drive
support is still forthcoming.

00:31:46.646 --> 00:31:49.746
And currently the volume
format is case sensitive only

00:31:49.746 --> 00:31:50.156
right now.

00:31:50.246 --> 00:31:53.406
So if you're not sure that your
app requires case insensitivity

00:31:53.796 --> 00:31:56.206
please give it a try, create
a disk image or set it

00:31:56.206 --> 00:32:00.246
up on a partition on your
Mac, try substantiating it

00:32:00.246 --> 00:32:03.286
and running your app
from Apple File System

00:32:03.286 --> 00:32:05.166
and let us know how it's doing.

00:32:07.476 --> 00:32:09.036
Some other compatibility notes.

00:32:09.596 --> 00:32:12.186
Apple File System cannot
be shared over AFP.

00:32:12.186 --> 00:32:15.876
So if you want to use
file sharing, we recommend

00:32:15.876 --> 00:32:17.656
that you use SNB instead

00:32:17.746 --> 00:32:21.576
as a preferred file sharing
mechanism moving forward.

00:32:21.796 --> 00:32:26.026
OS X Yosemite or earlier
will not recognize Apple File

00:32:26.026 --> 00:32:26.726
System volume.

00:32:26.726 --> 00:32:29.466
So please do not take an Apple
File System instance all the way

00:32:29.466 --> 00:32:32.046
back to OS X Yosemite
or earlier.

00:32:32.046 --> 00:32:34.286
You will inevitably
get a dialogue

00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:36.476
that you don't want
to respond to.

00:32:37.896 --> 00:32:38.156
So, [laughter].

00:32:38.196 --> 00:32:43.446
macOS Sierra will have
a developer preview

00:32:43.446 --> 00:32:44.976
of Apple File System.

00:32:45.626 --> 00:32:49.036
And it will be a developer
preview technology once macOS

00:32:49.526 --> 00:32:52.466
Sierra ships this fall.

00:32:52.686 --> 00:32:55.976
So now you might be wondering
what's our roll-out plan.

00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:57.416
How do all of you get access

00:32:57.446 --> 00:32:59.686
to Apple File System
on your machines?

00:33:01.316 --> 00:33:02.086
We'll talk about that.

00:33:03.626 --> 00:33:05.096
So upgrading to Apple
File System.

00:33:05.096 --> 00:33:06.416
So you want these
great new features

00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:08.256
that we've shown you,
how do you get them?

00:33:08.846 --> 00:33:11.816
Well one way we could do
this is to require everybody,

00:33:11.816 --> 00:33:14.716
all users to back up their
systems, save it away,

00:33:14.716 --> 00:33:16.256
make sure everything's
completely safe

00:33:16.436 --> 00:33:18.616
and then erase the
volume, erase the device,

00:33:18.886 --> 00:33:21.776
restore it put a new OS back on
and then restore from backup.

00:33:22.086 --> 00:33:23.666
A process which will
take several hours,

00:33:24.036 --> 00:33:25.866
and hope that everything's
exactly as it was

00:33:25.866 --> 00:33:26.816
after you've restored it.

00:33:27.526 --> 00:33:28.286
Well, we're not doing that.

00:33:29.316 --> 00:33:32.476
Instead, Apple will provide
an in-place upgrade path

00:33:32.706 --> 00:33:35.466
from HFS+ to Apple File System.

00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:40.906
[ Applause ]

00:33:41.406 --> 00:33:44.806
In doing this, the user data
will remain exactly where it is

00:33:45.276 --> 00:33:49.096
and we will write, or Apple
will write the APFS metadata,

00:33:49.096 --> 00:33:51.946
brand new, into the
HPF+ free space.

00:33:52.076 --> 00:33:54.516
And we're doing this
for crash protection.

00:33:55.256 --> 00:33:56.856
This is a multi-second

00:33:56.856 --> 00:33:59.236
to multi-minute operation
potentially.

00:33:59.836 --> 00:34:02.896
And over that time, if the
device loses power, panics,

00:34:02.896 --> 00:34:06.126
anything bad happens we want the
data on the device to be safe

00:34:06.126 --> 00:34:07.996
and sound as if nothing
had ever happened.

00:34:08.565 --> 00:34:12.065
So the Apple File System
Converter will try to be

00:34:12.065 --> 00:34:13.266
as atomic as possible.

00:34:13.266 --> 00:34:14.886
It's not completely
instantaneous,

00:34:14.996 --> 00:34:17.775
but as the operation is
ongoing, if the device crashes,

00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:20.466
we intend for it
to be completely

00:34:20.585 --> 00:34:23.096
as if nothing had ever happened.

00:34:24.335 --> 00:34:26.406
So Apple File System will ship,

00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:29.496
by default on all
devices in 2017.

00:34:31.516 --> 00:34:36.946
[ Applause ]

00:34:37.446 --> 00:34:41.856
So to summarize, Apple File
System will be the default file

00:34:41.856 --> 00:34:46.065
system for all Apple products
2017, it's ultra-modern,

00:34:46.576 --> 00:34:49.045
it's crash protected, it
supports Space Sharing,

00:34:50.306 --> 00:34:52.156
we support cloning
and snapshots.

00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:55.686
Enhanced data security features
like the multikey encryption

00:34:55.996 --> 00:34:56.976
that we just discussed.

00:34:58.016 --> 00:35:01.376
It's also been tuned and
designed specifically

00:35:01.376 --> 00:35:03.746
for the Apple ecosystem
in all of our devices.

00:35:04.516 --> 00:35:07.786
So you can get more information
about Apple File System

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:12.746
at this URL behind me that will
have a developer guide as well

00:35:12.746 --> 00:35:16.156
as some sample code so that
you can see cloning of files

00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:17.636
and directories in action.

00:35:18.906 --> 00:35:21.816
So some takeaways for all
of you in the audience.

00:35:22.356 --> 00:35:23.916
Apple File System
is coming soon,

00:35:23.916 --> 00:35:26.196
2017 will be here
before we know it.

00:35:26.466 --> 00:35:29.966
I want you to please test your
apps against Apple File System

00:35:29.966 --> 00:35:32.406
with the macOS build
that you got yesterday.

00:35:33.086 --> 00:35:35.166
Try running your apps
on Apple File System.

00:35:35.286 --> 00:35:37.966
Please let us know
how that process goes.

00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:41.986
If you report any bugs, please
report them through Bug Reporter

00:35:41.986 --> 00:35:44.126
through traditional means
so that we can investigate.

00:35:44.366 --> 00:35:47.086
We all want you to love
it as much as we do.

00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:51.706
So, some related sessions.

00:35:51.706 --> 00:35:53.776
If you're interested in
learning more about some

00:35:53.776 --> 00:35:56.746
of the security features on
our platform, specifically iOS,

00:35:56.826 --> 00:35:59.726
we recommend that
you can take a look

00:35:59.726 --> 00:36:02.026
at How iOS Security
Really Works, which will be

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:04.116
in this room today at 4 o'clock.

00:36:04.646 --> 00:36:07.506
And with that, that's Apple
File System, we can't wait

00:36:07.506 --> 00:36:08.526
to see how you're
going to use it.

00:36:09.508 --> 00:36:11.508
