00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:35.336
>> Thank you.

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.666
Thank you.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.526
Thank you.

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:41.496
Thank you.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:43.486
Thank you.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:45.236
Thank you.

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:53.836
Before we start with
the keynote,

00:00:55.016 --> 00:01:01.046
we'd like to take a moment
to talk about the tragedy

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.266
that occurred yesterday
in Orlando, Florida.

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.266
We offer our deepest sympathies

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:13.016
to everyone whose lives were
touched by this violence.

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:20.226
It was senseless, unconscionable
act of terrorism and hate,

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:24.516
aimed at dividing
and destroying.

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:31.426
The Apple community is
made up of people from all

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:34.946
around the world, from
all different backgrounds

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.026
and all different
points of view.

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:41.816
We celebrate our diversity.

00:01:43.056 --> 00:01:45.936
We know that it makes
us stronger

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:49.046
and moves everyone forward.

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:58.756
Please rise and join us
in a moment of silence

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:05.566
to honor the victims and
the people who loved them.

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:27.016
Thank you.

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:35.686
Hello and welcome to WWDC 2016.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:40.606
It's great to be here at the
legendary Bill Graham Auditorium

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:42.636
in beautiful San Francisco.

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:48.106
We have a really big and
jam-packed morning planned

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:50.316
for you, and we couldn't
be more excited.

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:53.146
Let me give you some details
on the conference this year.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:57.666
This is our 27th Worldwide
Developers Conference.

00:02:58.306 --> 00:03:01.666
The developer community has
never been more vibrant.

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:05.496
We now have 13 million
registered developers

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:08.666
with 2 million added
in the last year alone.

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:14.856
The conference this year
sold out over 5000 attendees

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:19.256
and millions more watching
on the live stream.

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:22.756
This is truly a worldwide
conference.

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:27.696
We have people here
from over 74 countries.

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:32.226
We're excited that
we're attracting

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:34.476
so many new developers.

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:37.296
Over 70% of the attendees

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:40.246
at the conference this year
are attending the conference

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.686
for the very first time.

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:46.806
Now, we're investing in the
next generation of developers.

00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:51.176
We've awarded 350
scholarships this year.

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:58.366
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:00.106
These guys are incredible.

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:03.046
If you see them, make sure
that you congratulate them.

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:07.046
We have over 100 attendees
at the conference this year

00:04:07.376 --> 00:04:09.886
that are under 18 years of age.

00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:18.805
The youngest, the
youngest is only nine.

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:27.876
Wow. I met her yesterday
and she is going

00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:29.826
to make one heck of
a great developer.

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:38.976
This week is about
helping you get the most

00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:40.206
out of our platforms.

00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:43.336
So we have over 100
engineering-led sessions

00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:49.546
and over 150 hands-on labs
with over 1000 Apple engineers

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:51.766
on site here to help
you through the week.

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:59.226
The App Store started eight
years ago with only 500 apps.

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:04.866
Recently, we passed
a major milestone.

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:10.356
We now have 2 million
apps on the App Store.

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:17.036
[ Applause ]

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:24.296
Your 2 million apps had been
downloaded 130 billion times.

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:33.266
And as you know, the App Store
is the best business opportunity

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.276
for developers.

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:40.226
We're about to pass $50 billion
paid directly to developers.

00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:42.346
This is absolutely amazing.

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:50.356
And of course, successful
developers translates

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:53.706
to us having the best apps
on our platform for users

00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:55.826
and this is what really matters.

00:05:56.346 --> 00:05:59.076
Now, we have a busy
morning planned but I'd

00:05:59.076 --> 00:06:01.716
like to take a moment to talk

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:04.426
about why we do what
we do at Apple.

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:11.546
Our north star has always been
about improving people's lives

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:15.026
by creating great products
that change the world.

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:18.446
And we've been doing
this for a long time.

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:25.486
But today, for the very first
time, we're going to talk to you

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:28.276
about four Apple platforms.

00:06:29.426 --> 00:06:33.906
Each of these platforms
is category-defining

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:35.736
and world-changing.

00:06:37.026 --> 00:06:40.896
The Macintosh changed
personal computing.

00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:44.166
Today, it's the most innovative

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:46.326
and loved personal
computer on the planet.

00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:50.616
iPhone changed phones forever.

00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:55.206
It's the best smartphone
experience and the gold standard

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.016
by which everything
else is measured.

00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:04.036
The iPad magically transforms
a glass canvas into anything

00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:05.166
that you want it to be.

00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:08.606
It's our clearest
expression of the future

00:07:08.606 --> 00:07:09.966
of personal computing.

00:07:11.176 --> 00:07:14.486
Apple Watch, only one year old,

00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:18.566
it's already the ultimate
device for a healthy life.

00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:25.176
And Apple TV just announced
last fall based on the idea

00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:27.366
that the future of TV is apps,

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:31.636
it's already transforming the
biggest screen in our homes.

00:07:32.616 --> 00:07:36.276
Now, we love creating
great apps,

00:07:36.836 --> 00:07:40.836
we love creating great
products that change the world,

00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:43.446
but we can't do it alone.

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:47.996
Developers are a crucial
part of that journey.

00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:53.406
You are about-- You are a
part of everything that we do,

00:07:54.626 --> 00:07:57.176
and everything that we
will do going forward.

00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:01.546
Because it's together that
we enrich people's lives.

00:08:02.806 --> 00:08:07.726
Now, we offer you four
incredible platforms

00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:11.306
that power these world-changing
product experiences.

00:08:12.616 --> 00:08:15.906
watchOS, tvOS, OS X, iOS.

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:24.726
We're going to move each of
these platforms forward today

00:08:24.726 --> 00:08:28.336
and we'd like to get
started with watchOS.

00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:32.096
And to do that, I'd like
to invite Kevin Lynch up.

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:32.515
Kevin.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:41.436
>> Thank you, Tim.

00:08:42.336 --> 00:08:45.066
So I am really excited to
talk with you about watchOS

00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:46.646
and show you some
of what's ahead.

00:08:46.646 --> 00:08:50.236
Now, people who are using Apple
Watch love it, particularly

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:53.226
for quick glances at information
and quick interactions.

00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:56.846
And our top focus is performance
and we've made optimizations

00:08:56.846 --> 00:09:00.286
across the entire system
including a serious acceleration

00:09:00.286 --> 00:09:01.446
in app launch time.

00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:03.966
Your app should actually
respond instantly.

00:09:04.516 --> 00:09:08.506
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:09.926
The information you look

00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:11.846
at should be updated
before you go look,

00:09:11.846 --> 00:09:14.346
so it's ready the instant that
you are so you're not waiting.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:18.756
In watchOS 3, your favorite
apps can respond instantly.

00:09:18.846 --> 00:09:20.186
So let's take a look.

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:21.626
So we're going to
accomplish this

00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:23.246
by keeping your favorite
apps in memory.

00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:25.546
We're going to support
background updates of data

00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:27.746
and refresh the information
so it's ready the instant

00:09:27.746 --> 00:09:30.716
that you are, and then we
support quickly launching these

00:09:30.716 --> 00:09:31.986
apps and interacting with them.

00:09:31.986 --> 00:09:34.636
This is going to work for
both the built-in apps

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:35.936
and third-party apps.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:37.996
Let's take a look at an example.

00:09:38.796 --> 00:09:41.326
This is watchOS 2 and
we're going to look

00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:42.536
at an app called Onefootball.

00:09:42.536 --> 00:09:44.656
We're going to launch it from
the complication the bottom left

00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:46.326
and we're going to
see how long it takes.

00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:50.416
So here we are launching
the app, takes a few seconds

00:09:50.416 --> 00:09:53.176
to launch, and then once it
launches, it loads some data,

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.716
and it updates, there we go.

00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:58.466
So that is a pretty typical
example of watchOS 2.

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:00.116
Now, we're going to take a look

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:03.176
at Onefootball launching
in watchOS 3.

00:10:03.176 --> 00:10:04.686
Are you guys ready?

00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:06.096
OK, don't blink.

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:07.976
That's it.

00:10:08.516 --> 00:10:16.196
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:10:16.696 --> 00:10:19.496
So that example is about seven
times faster but it feels

00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:20.706
like a million times faster.

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.306
So now, we've made
it really easy

00:10:23.306 --> 00:10:24.586
to access your favorite apps.

00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:27.616
You can just press the
side button below the crown

00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:28.906
to show what we call the dock.

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:30.936
You can choose which
apps go here

00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:32.506
and you can quickly
scroll through them.

00:10:33.516 --> 00:10:37.346
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.466
The apps are now both glanceable
and interactive rather

00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:41.366
than separate concepts.

00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:43.186
This is a dramatic improvement

00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:44.316
in how it feels to
use the watch.

00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:47.456
So this increased performance
allowed us to have access

00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:48.956
to our favorite apps quickly.

00:10:48.956 --> 00:10:51.416
We want to be able to
access them anywhere.

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:53.786
So by using the side button,
we can get to them easily.

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.026
Now, another key
design goal we had was

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:57.926
to make the watch
feel more familiar.

00:10:58.196 --> 00:11:00.506
And so we've done
with the watch face,

00:11:00.536 --> 00:11:01.646
now we've added control center.

00:11:01.646 --> 00:11:02.896
You just swipe up
from the bottom,

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.646
just like on iOS,
and very familiar.

00:11:06.516 --> 00:11:09.436
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:12.836
So this is a giant improvement
at how it feels to use apps

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:16.126
and to navigate the watch very
simply and easily in watchOS 3.

00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:19.956
Now, we've also made it more
powerful to reply to messages.

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:23.436
So now, when you receive a
message, you can see the ways

00:11:23.436 --> 00:11:24.306
to respond right there.

00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:25.156
We've removed this step.

00:11:25.156 --> 00:11:26.566
You don't have to
actually press reply now.

00:11:26.566 --> 00:11:27.946
You can just pick the
way you'd like to reply.

00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:29.466
And if you just scroll down,

00:11:29.686 --> 00:11:31.936
you'll see your smart replies
right below the message.

00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:34.696
So you can just tap reply
in less than a second.

00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:38.056
Now sometimes, you don't see
exactly the response you like

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:41.266
and you're not in a situation
where you can use dictation,

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:41.926
so wouldn't it be great

00:11:41.926 --> 00:11:44.076
if you can just write
your message on the watch?

00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:46.966
Well, we're introducing a new
way to do that with something

00:11:46.966 --> 00:11:48.116
that we call Scribble.

00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:51.066
With Scribble, you have
a new way to respond just

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:52.616
by writing what you
like on the screen,

00:11:52.616 --> 00:11:54.186
and you can just
quickly draw the letters

00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:55.636
for your message right there

00:11:55.636 --> 00:11:57.506
like writing something
like Starbucks.

00:11:57.586 --> 00:11:59.606
You can see the letters go
right on top of each other.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:12:07.786 --> 00:12:10.116
So that's a great new way to
respond with just the response

00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:11.506
that you like on your watch.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.716
Now, the watch face is
great for quick looks

00:12:14.886 --> 00:12:16.216
and it reflects your style

00:12:16.216 --> 00:12:17.696
and it's also the
character of the device.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:20.996
Now, we've had Mickey as a fun
watch face that I like to use

00:12:20.996 --> 00:12:23.896
on weekends but I know what my
daughter is going to really love

00:12:23.896 --> 00:12:25.976
because Minnie is
coming to the watch now.

00:12:30.406 --> 00:12:32.306
And of course, you can choose
from a variety of colors

00:12:32.306 --> 00:12:34.196
for her outfit that match
her bands perfectly.

00:12:36.966 --> 00:12:38.786
Now, one of the most frequent
things people do is look

00:12:38.786 --> 00:12:39.746
at their activity rings

00:12:39.746 --> 00:12:41.896
and we're adding a new
watch face specifically

00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:44.956
for that called Activity, so
it's a great beautiful way

00:12:44.956 --> 00:12:46.216
to see your rings
throughout the day.

00:12:50.876 --> 00:12:52.566
It comes not only in
the analog version

00:12:52.566 --> 00:12:54.436
but also a really nice
chronograph version

00:12:54.436 --> 00:12:57.466
and a digital version, so a
super good way for looking

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:58.776
at your progress during the day.

00:12:59.426 --> 00:13:02.226
We've also added a really simple
new face that we call Numerals,

00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:05.526
which is very beautiful,
and the hours actually go

00:13:05.526 --> 00:13:08.536
around the dial during day, and
you can choose from a variety

00:13:08.536 --> 00:13:10.306
of fonts that match your style,

00:13:10.306 --> 00:13:12.816
so a really simple new
watch face called Numerals.

00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:15.546
Now, there's a lot of
watch faces to choose from

00:13:15.546 --> 00:13:17.556
and we're finding that
people are actually switching

00:13:17.556 --> 00:13:20.236
between faces for different
occasions, so we're going

00:13:20.236 --> 00:13:21.786
to make that super easy.

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:25.346
You can now just swipe to switch
the face you'd like to use,

00:13:25.466 --> 00:13:27.066
and you can choose
which faces you'd like

00:13:27.066 --> 00:13:29.556
and how they're configured so
you can easily get to them.

00:13:30.056 --> 00:13:33.066
We've also added the ability to
add more complications to faces

00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:34.876
like Weather here
on the photo's face.

00:13:35.366 --> 00:13:37.316
So now, really simple
to navigate

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:38.816
and use your watch
faces as well.

00:13:39.336 --> 00:13:40.776
Let's see all of this
stuff running live.

00:13:40.776 --> 00:13:43.366
For a demo, please
welcome Stacey Lysik.

>> Thank you, Kevin.

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:53.356
Good morning.

00:13:53.356 --> 00:13:56.016
I could not be more excited
to have the opportunity

00:13:56.016 --> 00:13:57.596
to show you watchOS 3 today.

00:13:57.976 --> 00:14:01.056
I wake up to my favorite
new face,

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:02.986
just the girl I've
been looking for.

00:14:04.646 --> 00:14:07.866
Now, in watchOS 3, you
have a place to keep all

00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:08.786
of your favorite apps.

00:14:08.936 --> 00:14:11.616
You choose which apps go in your
dock and you choose the order.

00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:13.956
I can bring up my dock by
pressing the side button.

00:14:14.376 --> 00:14:17.796
And I can swipe through my apps
one at a time or lay my finger

00:14:17.796 --> 00:14:20.026
down in these dots at the
bottom of the screen and fly

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.686
through my dock to
get to any app.

00:14:21.686 --> 00:14:24.616
And the apps in my
dock are live,

00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:27.006
so I can get a quick
glance at information

00:14:27.396 --> 00:14:29.496
without even launching an
app like how close I am

00:14:29.496 --> 00:14:31.056
to closing my activity rings.

00:14:31.826 --> 00:14:33.956
And the apps have been
redesigned to put me

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.106
within one tap of the
thing I most want to do.

00:14:36.106 --> 00:14:37.796
Let's take a look
at the Timer app.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:41.516
One tap to launch it and it's
right there waiting for me.

00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:46.016
I can still set a custom timer
if that's what I want to do,

00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:47.356
but the most common choices

00:14:47.356 --> 00:14:49.136
for a timer are right
here on the screen.

00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:52.106
So with one tap, I can
set a 10-minute timer

00:14:52.106 --> 00:14:55.456
and get right back
to what I was doing.

00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:57.936
Even my favorite apps from the
App Store can be in my dock

00:14:59.076 --> 00:15:03.466
like Sweat with Kayla, and Lyft,
and they are lightning fast too.

00:15:03.606 --> 00:15:06.266
Let's take a look.

00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:10.326
With one tap, I can call a car.

00:15:10.546 --> 00:15:11.496
Yikes, three minutes.

00:15:11.746 --> 00:15:15.636
I have so much to show you
like New Apps, Reminders

00:15:15.636 --> 00:15:19.746
and Find My Friends that have
been designed specifically

00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:21.156
for this kind of
quick interaction.

00:15:21.156 --> 00:15:22.286
Let's look at Reminders.

00:15:22.946 --> 00:15:25.546
Now, I can keep all my lists
with me throughout the day

00:15:25.546 --> 00:15:28.076
and just check things
off as I get them done.

00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:29.836
Here's my bucket list.

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:32.186
You don't get to
do this very often

00:15:33.096 --> 00:15:34.886
but today is just
one of those days.

00:15:35.516 --> 00:15:45.836
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:15:46.336 --> 00:15:48.836
Find My Friends takes
advantage of background updates

00:15:48.836 --> 00:15:51.806
to ensure I always have the
latest and greatest location

00:15:51.806 --> 00:15:52.876
for my friends and family.

00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:55.196
Now, I never have to worry
about whether my kids got

00:15:55.196 --> 00:15:57.226
to their activities on time.

00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:01.376
And we wanted to make changing
your watch face as easy

00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:03.326
as swiping through
apps on your dock.

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:05.846
And while Minnie is fabulous
for a casual weekend,

00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:08.016
sometimes I want to wear
something simple and elegant.

00:16:08.586 --> 00:16:11.756
Now, with an edge-to-edge swipe,
I can get to my Numerals face.

00:16:11.816 --> 00:16:15.756
And for those of you as obsessed
with closing your rings as I am,

00:16:16.046 --> 00:16:17.816
we now have the Activity face.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.876
Every time I raise my wrist,

00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:22.106
I get to see those big
beautiful rings reminding me

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:23.656
to get up and get moving.

00:16:23.656 --> 00:16:26.906
And I can launch my
workout right from the face.

00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:30.186
With the New Quick Start
feature, I can bypass setting

00:16:30.186 --> 00:16:32.096
up a goal and just get started.

[ Beeping Sound ]

00:16:36.606 --> 00:16:40.256
I didn't really come dressed for
a workout today, so I'm going

00:16:40.336 --> 00:16:43.476
to swipe over and that then
take us back to our watch face.

00:16:44.376 --> 00:16:46.866
Notifications are still right
where you think they'd be,

00:16:46.866 --> 00:16:48.476
pulled down from the
top of the screen.

00:16:49.076 --> 00:16:51.246
This is a message I saved
from my friend Isabel.

She's been teaching me a little
Mandarin and she wants me

00:16:54.676 --> 00:16:56.896
to reply about dinner
tonight in Chinese.

00:16:56.896 --> 00:16:59.146
I can do that with the
new Scribble feature.

Scribble works in
English and Chinese

Thank you.

And it's so exciting to
achieve this new level

00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:41.456
of performance on the watch.

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.006
And we're finding that people

00:17:43.006 --> 00:17:45.376
who are wearing Apple
Watch wear it all the time.

00:17:45.556 --> 00:17:48.176
And this opens up some new
great ways that we can help.

00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:50.436
And one of these is
actually getting help

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.036
in critical situations just

00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:53.636
by pushing a button
that's actually on you.

00:17:53.636 --> 00:17:56.966
So you might be having a
medical emergency, for example,

00:17:56.966 --> 00:17:58.206
or a safety situation.

00:17:59.106 --> 00:18:01.276
And we're going to be able
to help with that with SOS

00:18:01.276 --> 00:18:03.326
on the watch and we're going to
make it easy to call for help.

00:18:04.236 --> 00:18:06.986
To activate it, you just press
and hold the side button.

00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:09.796
It's going to countdown to
let you know it's calling 911.

00:18:09.796 --> 00:18:11.666
And then you're going
to be on a live call

00:18:11.666 --> 00:18:13.476
with the emergency services
right on your watch.

00:18:14.076 --> 00:18:17.396
This works either as a cellular
call via your iPhone or directly

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:18.756
from the watch if
you're connected to WiFi.

00:18:18.756 --> 00:18:22.996
Now if you're done talking on
the phone's emergency services,

00:18:23.386 --> 00:18:26.136
the watch will automatically
notify your emergency contacts,

00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:27.476
they'll send them a message.

00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:31.016
The message also will include
a map of your current location

00:18:31.016 --> 00:18:32.186
so they know where you are

00:18:32.186 --> 00:18:33.496
and they can coordinate
with each other.

00:18:34.286 --> 00:18:35.576
Now, after sending the message,

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:38.316
your watch will actually
now show your medical ID

00:18:38.316 --> 00:18:40.906
which is also a new
feature in watchOS.

00:18:40.906 --> 00:18:43.576
It has things like for
example your age and allergies

00:18:43.576 --> 00:18:45.286
and other information
you'd like to put there.

00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:48.576
And SOS works not
only just in the US

00:18:48.576 --> 00:18:49.796
but it works internationally.

00:18:50.216 --> 00:18:52.576
So for example you might
be traveling to some place

00:18:52.576 --> 00:18:55.686
like Hong Kong and you might not
know what the emergency number

00:18:55.686 --> 00:18:57.976
is to call but your
Apple Watch does.

[ Applause ]

00:19:05.826 --> 00:19:08.306
So in this case, it calls
999 rather than 911.

00:19:09.066 --> 00:19:11.316
So this is an emergency
feature that isn't one

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.206
that you'll use often
but when you need it,

00:19:13.206 --> 00:19:15.036
it's going to be
there and that's SOS.

00:19:15.036 --> 00:19:19.806
Now, one of the primary reasons
people are wearing the watch

00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:21.016
today is for fitness and health.

of the most popular apps

00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:42.016
in the Apple Watch
is the Activity app.

00:19:42.016 --> 00:19:43.576
And as Kevin and
Stacey have mentioned,

00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:46.606
many people have told us that
they actually become more active

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:49.576
because they become addicted
to closing the activity rings.

00:19:50.016 --> 00:19:50.976
And we love hearing that.

00:19:51.096 --> 00:19:54.206
But we also know that
many people are motivated

00:19:54.206 --> 00:19:55.096
by other things.

00:19:55.636 --> 00:19:57.586
Some people are motivated
by getting support

00:19:57.586 --> 00:19:58.776
from their family and friends.

00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.206
And if you're like
me, you're motivated

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:04.026
by good old fashion competition
and we wanted to make

00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:05.426
that possible as well.

00:20:06.046 --> 00:20:09.076
So with watchOS, we're
introducing activity sharing.

00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:11.366
And it couldn't be simpler.

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:13.636
All you have to do
is swipe to the right

00:20:13.636 --> 00:20:14.956
of your own activity rings

00:20:15.486 --> 00:20:17.386
and there you'll see
your selected family

00:20:17.386 --> 00:20:18.746
and friend's rings as well.

00:20:18.746 --> 00:20:22.886
Now you can sort by whatever
metric is most important to you.

00:20:22.886 --> 00:20:25.676
So you can sort by steps,
you can sort by workouts,

00:20:25.996 --> 00:20:27.676
you can even sort
by exercise minutes.

00:20:28.036 --> 00:20:31.326
Here you'll see that I've sorted
by the move ring and I'm right

00:20:31.326 --> 00:20:32.336
where you'd expect me to be.

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:37.036
I'm getting by butt kicked by
Stacey but I'm annihilating Jeff

00:20:37.036 --> 00:20:38.946
which makes me very happy.

00:20:40.186 --> 00:20:43.306
If you want to see more details,
all you do is tap on anyone

00:20:43.306 --> 00:20:46.036
on your activity list and
you'll get an up close look

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:48.856
at their activity rings,
but you can also see things

00:20:49.136 --> 00:20:50.306
like their daily step count

00:20:50.696 --> 00:20:53.306
and their workouts even
from third parties.

00:20:54.456 --> 00:20:56.836
But one of my favorite
features is

00:20:56.836 --> 00:20:58.926
that you can communicate
directly with the people

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:00.796
that you're sharing
activity with right

00:21:00.796 --> 00:21:02.846
in the Activity app
through messages.

00:21:03.706 --> 00:21:06.736
And when you do, you'll get
smart replies that are geared

00:21:06.736 --> 00:21:08.036
around fitness and activity.

00:21:08.996 --> 00:21:12.696
Some are supportive, some
are a little more competitive

00:21:13.336 --> 00:21:15.046
but you can also
do some fun things.

00:21:15.046 --> 00:21:16.656
For example, at the
end of a workout,

00:21:16.656 --> 00:21:18.226
you could send your
raising heart rate to one

00:21:18.226 --> 00:21:19.246
of your activity friends.

00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:25.646
Or your raising heart rate to
one of your activity friends

00:21:25.946 --> 00:21:30.046
or you can also send smack
talk in your own voice right

00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:30.976
through audio messages.

00:21:31.806 --> 00:21:33.606
So we think this is going
to be a great way for you

00:21:33.606 --> 00:21:35.176
and your friends
to stay motivated

00:21:35.486 --> 00:21:39.906
to keep each other active and
we can't wait for you to try it.

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:43.246
Now, our team has been
working hard to enable features

00:21:43.246 --> 00:21:44.606
that would allow more people

00:21:44.606 --> 00:21:46.116
to use the Activity
and Workout apps.

00:21:47.186 --> 00:21:48.656
And one group we've
been thinking a lot

00:21:48.656 --> 00:21:50.486
about is wheelchair users.

00:21:51.586 --> 00:21:53.936
Now, many wheelchair users
already have an Apple Watch.

00:21:54.596 --> 00:21:57.076
And they've witnessed and
told us that they love it

00:21:57.076 --> 00:21:59.186
because it gives them
instant access to messages

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:00.916
and notifications
right from their wrist.

00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:02.996
And this is particularly
important

00:22:02.996 --> 00:22:04.656
because many wheelchair
users have

00:22:04.716 --> 00:22:07.856
to tuck away their iPhone
securely throughout the day.

00:22:08.266 --> 00:22:10.916
But to do a great activity
and workout experience,

00:22:11.086 --> 00:22:13.556
we also recognize that we
couldn't just use the same

00:22:13.556 --> 00:22:15.956
algorithms that we've used
for non-wheelchair users

00:22:15.956 --> 00:22:18.266
because the biomechanics
are completely different.

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:22.266
For example, many wheelchair
users use a semicircular

00:22:22.266 --> 00:22:24.206
technique when they're pushing
their wheelchair throughout

00:22:24.206 --> 00:22:24.536
the day.

00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:28.676
But as the terrain changes
and the speed changes,

00:22:28.676 --> 00:22:30.526
they may switch to
an arc technique

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:32.066
or a single-loop over technique.

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.216
And this is what
makes it complicated.

00:22:34.296 --> 00:22:36.606
These are only a few of the
techniques that they may use.

00:22:37.326 --> 00:22:40.536
We knew that to do this right,
we not only have to do a lot

00:22:40.536 --> 00:22:42.736
of studies but we
would also need

00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:44.166
to enlist the help of experts.

00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:47.526
So, we worked with the
Challenged Athletes Foundation

00:22:47.526 --> 00:22:48.796
and the Lakeshore Foundation.

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:51.786
These are two of the
world's largest organizations

00:22:51.786 --> 00:22:54.026
that are dedicated to
promoting physical fitness

00:22:54.026 --> 00:22:55.216
for people in wheelchairs.

00:22:56.106 --> 00:22:58.496
With their help, we were
able to conduct the studies.

00:22:59.006 --> 00:23:00.926
And we were able to do
it on a wide variety

00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:03.136
of wheelchair users
including some veterans.

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:06.316
And now, wheelchair users
will have a setting.

00:23:07.316 --> 00:23:10.656
The time to stand notifications
will be changed to time to roll.

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:17.356
[ Applause ]

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:19.136
There will be two workouts

00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:21.926
in the workout apps specifically
dedicated to wheelchair users

00:23:22.086 --> 00:23:24.836
and of course the activity
rings will be optimized

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:25.746
for wheelchair pushes.

00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:29.306
We could not be more
excited about this feature

00:23:29.306 --> 00:23:31.166
and we're incredibly
thankful to our partners

00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:32.356
for helping make it possible.

00:23:33.516 --> 00:23:39.036
[ Applause ]

00:23:39.536 --> 00:23:41.556
Now, one of the things that
we've learned about health

00:23:41.556 --> 00:23:43.376
in Apple Watch is
that simple things

00:23:43.376 --> 00:23:45.886
like the activity rings
can be very powerful

00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:47.666
at helping people
change behavior.

00:23:48.146 --> 00:23:49.986
But we also know that
there's a lot more

00:23:49.986 --> 00:23:51.816
to health than just fitness.

00:23:52.066 --> 00:23:53.746
And we've been thinking
way beyond that.

00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:57.646
So with watchOS, we're
launching a brand new app

00:23:57.856 --> 00:23:59.886
for health, it's called Breathe.

00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:02.406
And it's designed to guide you

00:24:02.406 --> 00:24:04.616
through simple deep
breathing sessions

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:08.066
that can help you quiet
your mind, relax your body

00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:10.446
and just better deal
with everyday stress.

00:24:11.916 --> 00:24:14.976
Now, yoga practitioners have
been using deep breathing

00:24:14.976 --> 00:24:17.476
exercises for thousands
of years as a way

00:24:17.476 --> 00:24:19.286
to positively impact
the body and mind.

00:24:19.996 --> 00:24:22.976
But the medical community has
also embraced deep breathing

00:24:22.976 --> 00:24:24.696
as a great way to
improve daily health.

00:24:25.456 --> 00:24:28.436
Dr. Deepak Chopra, one
of the early advocates

00:24:28.696 --> 00:24:32.046
of body-mind medicine has said,
"Taking a moment every day

00:24:32.046 --> 00:24:34.186
to do some deep breathing
can reduce stress,

00:24:34.686 --> 00:24:36.366
calm the body-mind as well

00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:37.896
as have a long term
health benefits."

00:24:38.596 --> 00:24:41.906
Now to get to the
app, it's easy.

00:24:41.906 --> 00:24:44.276
You can launch it from your
watch face, you can launch it

00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:47.386
from the dock or like
the stand reminders,

00:24:48.436 --> 00:24:51.546
you can actually set smart
notifications to remind you

00:24:51.546 --> 00:24:54.646
and start building this as
a habit every single day.

00:24:55.886 --> 00:24:58.896
When you open the app, you
can easily change the amount

00:24:58.896 --> 00:25:00.226
of time you want
to do your session,

00:25:00.226 --> 00:25:04.626
from one to five minutes just
by turning the digital crown.

00:25:04.806 --> 00:25:07.886
And when you're in the app
experience, you'll be guided

00:25:07.886 --> 00:25:10.816
by beautiful visuals that make
it really easy to follow along.

00:25:11.266 --> 00:25:13.946
And if you prefer to do
this with your eyes closed,

00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:15.506
you can turn on the
haptic feedback

00:25:16.096 --> 00:25:18.446
and gentle taps will guide you

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:20.096
and you can do without
even looking.

00:25:21.136 --> 00:25:23.176
When the session is over,
you'll get a summary.

00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:26.166
And you'll also get your heart
rate from the last few seconds

00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:27.656
of the session you just did.

00:25:28.236 --> 00:25:30.176
Now if you already
do deep breathing,

00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:32.296
we think this is going to be
a great way for you to fit it

00:25:32.296 --> 00:25:33.476
into your day more often.

00:25:33.996 --> 00:25:35.926
But for those of you that
don't, we think this is going

00:25:35.926 --> 00:25:38.996
to be a great way to get started
and just one more simple way

00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:40.826
that it can help you
live a better day.

00:25:41.396 --> 00:25:43.906
These are just a few of the
exciting updates we have planned

00:25:43.906 --> 00:25:45.506
for fitness and health
in watchOS.

00:25:45.506 --> 00:25:47.766
Now I'm going to give
it back to Kevin.

00:25:48.516 --> 00:25:54.826
[ Applause ]

00:25:55.326 --> 00:25:55.836
>> Thank you, Jay.

00:25:55.936 --> 00:25:56.916
That was really terrific.

00:25:56.916 --> 00:25:59.236
I was actually using the
Breathe app back stage.

00:25:59.236 --> 00:26:00.196
It helped me a bit.

00:26:00.826 --> 00:26:06.496
So, watchOS 3 is a giant step
forward for you as developers.

00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:10.026
When someone adds your apps
to dock or to the watch face,

00:26:10.106 --> 00:26:12.416
it benefits from all the
instant launch experience

00:26:12.416 --> 00:26:14.446
that we're showing and
you get background time

00:26:14.446 --> 00:26:17.016
to update your information
before someone goes and looks.

00:26:17.016 --> 00:26:19.246
And that will enable
really quick interactions

00:26:19.246 --> 00:26:20.446
with your app on the watch.

00:26:21.026 --> 00:26:23.236
Now you can already build
apps that are native to watch

00:26:23.236 --> 00:26:24.936
that you can run
independent of iPhone,

00:26:24.936 --> 00:26:26.546
but we're also adding a number

00:26:26.546 --> 00:26:28.146
of new APIs you can
take advantage

00:26:28.146 --> 00:26:29.636
of when you're building
apps for the watch.

00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:33.616
One of those is support now
for Apple Pay within your app

00:26:33.616 --> 00:26:35.806
on the watch, so you can
do purchases right there.

00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:37.946
Fitness apps will now be able

00:26:37.946 --> 00:26:40.686
to run the background during
workouts enabling access

00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:43.336
to real-time heart rate
information and motion data.

00:26:43.336 --> 00:26:45.636
This is going to enable
a whole new category

00:26:45.636 --> 00:26:46.926
of fitness apps on the watch.

00:26:48.326 --> 00:26:51.516
Also we're enabling a much
richer and expressive apps

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:54.596
in watchOS including support
for SpriteKit and SceneKit,

00:26:54.596 --> 00:26:57.526
native event support from the
crown and for touch gestures.

00:26:59.206 --> 00:26:59.976
You can clap, it's good.

00:27:00.516 --> 00:27:03.636
[ Applause ]

00:27:04.136 --> 00:27:06.816
Audio and video can be embedded
right inside your app UI

00:27:06.906 --> 00:27:08.336
and you can connect
across devices

00:27:08.336 --> 00:27:09.976
with Game Center and CloudKit.

00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:13.106
So we're really excited about
what new apps now can be created

00:27:13.106 --> 00:27:15.036
on the watch and they're
going to be amazing.

00:27:15.476 --> 00:27:17.746
This is a great new
opportunity for all of you.

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:21.656
And the preview release
for you is available today,

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:22.966

and it's going to feel
like a whole new watch.

of what's coming

00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:36.976

00:27:57.326 --> 00:28:01.876
>> So let's talk about
tvOS and Apple TV.

00:28:02.086 --> 00:28:05.266
Last fall, we introduced the
next generation of Apple TV

00:28:05.396 --> 00:28:08.856
and for the first time,
developers had a modern platform

00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:11.616
like iOS to develop
for in the living room.

00:28:12.256 --> 00:28:14.846
And we said the future
of TV is apps.

00:28:15.816 --> 00:28:18.916
And the response to Apple
TV has been incredible.

00:28:19.376 --> 00:28:23.146
Here is what Chris Albrecht
the CEO of Starz had to say.

00:28:23.146 --> 00:28:25.746
tvOS has allowed Starz
to create an experience

00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:29.036
on Apple TV unlike
anything we've done before

00:28:29.036 --> 00:28:30.786
and our subscribers
are loving it.

00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:33.416
Here is what the CEO of BoomBit,

00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:36.166
a very popular iOS game
developer had to say.

00:28:36.396 --> 00:28:39.556
We easily extended our iOS game
experience to the living room,

00:28:39.556 --> 00:28:41.656
something that is
incredibly difficult to do

00:28:41.656 --> 00:28:42.946
on traditional consoles.

00:28:43.876 --> 00:28:47.676
Our last generation Apple TV
had 80 video channels and thanks

00:28:47.676 --> 00:28:51.876
to many of you, we now have
over 1300 video channels.

offers a great selection

00:29:06.906 --> 00:29:08.976
of live cable channels is

with over 100 live channels
video on demand exclusively

Great sports games like
NBA 2K, adventure games

00:29:44.146 --> 00:29:47.376
like Minecraft story
mode and SketchParty.

00:29:47.806 --> 00:29:50.576
Use your iPhone or iPad
to draw and then you sit

00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:51.666
around the TV to guess.

00:29:52.226 --> 00:29:55.816
It's a lot of fun to do this
with your group of friends.

00:29:55.946 --> 00:29:58.676
Now we've got great updates
to tell you about for tvOS

00:29:58.676 --> 00:30:01.646
and let me start with
the Apple TV remote app.

00:30:02.476 --> 00:30:05.396
Now Apple TV comes with
the incredible Siri remote.

00:30:05.616 --> 00:30:08.796
It uses touch for navigation,
Siri to tell it what you want

00:30:08.796 --> 00:30:11.176
to watch, and motion
to play games.

00:30:11.796 --> 00:30:13.366
But a lot of our
customers have told us

00:30:13.366 --> 00:30:15.176
that they would love
an app on their iPhone

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:17.066
that had all those
same capabilities,

00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:20.066
and so we're making a new
version of the remote app.

00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:21.256
This is what it looks like.

00:30:21.256 --> 00:30:22.976
It's got a beautiful
mount playing screen

00:30:22.976 --> 00:30:25.186
with playback controls,
but most importantly,

00:30:25.186 --> 00:30:27.346
all the features
of the Siri remote.

00:30:27.796 --> 00:30:30.506
You have touch for navigation,
Siri to give it commands,

00:30:31.146 --> 00:30:34.676
and it uses the accelerometer
and gyroscope to play games.

00:30:35.516 --> 00:30:40.006
[ Applause ]

00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:43.406
And of course, you can enter
text with the keyboard.

00:30:44.406 --> 00:30:48.776
Next let's talk about Siri.

00:30:48.886 --> 00:30:51.356
Siri changed the way we
interact with our television

00:30:51.606 --> 00:30:53.866
because now we just tell
it what we want to watch.

00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:56.306
And we're making it even better

00:30:56.306 --> 00:30:58.776
because now you can
search movies by topics.

00:30:59.546 --> 00:31:02.136
Now my daughter is actually
going to high school this fall

00:31:02.136 --> 00:31:04.176
and I remember back when
I went to high school,

00:31:04.236 --> 00:31:06.336
it's been a while, there
are some great movies

00:31:06.336 --> 00:31:07.796
that I'd love to watch with her.

00:31:08.326 --> 00:31:11.776
And now Siri makes this really
easy because I can just say,

00:31:12.006 --> 00:31:13.956
find high school
comedies from the 80s.

00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:14.396
I'm sorry.

00:31:14.396 --> 00:31:15.546
We'll do that one again.

00:31:15.606 --> 00:31:17.416
Find high school
comedies from the 80s.

00:31:17.996 --> 00:31:21.816
And there are some
of my favorites.

00:31:21.986 --> 00:31:23.346
I actually have watched
them all.

00:31:23.346 --> 00:31:25.046
Let's take a look at
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off"

00:31:25.046 --> 00:31:27.956
and with just one tap,
we can start watching.

00:31:33.006 --> 00:31:38.166
Now Siri actually searches over
650,000 movies and TV shows now,

00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:40.436
but what about YouTube?

00:31:40.946 --> 00:31:43.886
Well, that's easy too
because now you just ask Siri.

00:31:44.256 --> 00:31:48.516
Search YouTube for Steph
Curry three pointers.

00:31:51.806 --> 00:31:54.626
Siri launches YouTube and
shows you the results.

00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:58.366
But a big part of your TV
experience is live channels.

00:31:58.366 --> 00:32:01.896
And we've got some great
channels on Apple TV like ABC,

00:32:02.116 --> 00:32:05.416
CBS, FX and a lot more that
give you live channels.

00:32:05.416 --> 00:32:07.956
But to start watching,
you got to find the app,

00:32:08.456 --> 00:32:10.476
you got to launch it and then
you got to find the channel.

00:32:10.476 --> 00:32:13.386
Well, we've got a great new
feature called Live Tune-In.

00:32:13.756 --> 00:32:17.356
And all you have to
do-- watch ESPN 2.

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:21.156
Take them straight
to the action.

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:22.416
>> Goal.

00:32:23.516 --> 00:32:26.616
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:32:27.116 --> 00:32:31.206
>> And this is already working
with a lot of great channels

00:32:31.206 --> 00:32:34.126
and we're making Live
Tune-In available

00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:37.466
on both your iPad
and Apple TV as well.

00:32:38.386 --> 00:32:42.366
And one problem with this is,
let's be honest, when you go in

00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:44.546
and you launch a video
channel app for the first time,

00:32:44.706 --> 00:32:47.576
you get something like this.

00:32:47.576 --> 00:32:49.836
And you got to go find
a browser, authenticate

00:32:49.836 --> 00:32:52.896
with a code and then
authenticate

00:32:52.896 --> 00:32:54.146
to your TV provider.

00:32:54.176 --> 00:32:57.156
Well, we're going to make
this change a little bit.

00:32:57.156 --> 00:32:59.756
But it's worst because you got
to do it for each in every app.

00:33:00.306 --> 00:33:02.426
And now, we're going
to make it all go away

00:33:02.726 --> 00:33:04.566
with the feature we
call single sign-on.

00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:11.726
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:15.166
You sign in once on your
Apple TV and you get access

00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:16.536
to all of your network apps.

00:33:17.106 --> 00:33:19.886
And we make it even better,
we-- A page on the after,

00:33:19.886 --> 00:33:22.566
we'll show you all of the apps
that you now have access to.

00:33:22.906 --> 00:33:25.146
And of course, we're
bringing this to iOS as well.

00:33:25.146 --> 00:33:27.136
Now in addition to
single sign-on,

00:33:27.136 --> 00:33:28.416
we've got some other
great updates.

00:33:28.926 --> 00:33:31.356
Now Apple TV looks
beautiful but there are times

00:33:31.356 --> 00:33:33.516
where you wish it was darker
because you're in a home theater

00:33:33.516 --> 00:33:36.366
or a dark room and
now that's really easy

00:33:36.436 --> 00:33:38.456
because you can just
switch to dark mode.

00:33:43.206 --> 00:33:45.146
And we want to make
it even easier

00:33:45.146 --> 00:33:46.906
for customers to get your apps.

00:33:47.496 --> 00:33:50.116
And so just like when you
download an app on your iPhone,

00:33:50.116 --> 00:33:52.716
it automatically
downloads to your Apple TV,

00:33:52.716 --> 00:33:57.046
it now automatically
downloads to your Apple TV

00:33:57.396 --> 00:34:00.836
and this is really great
and I'm going to show you.

00:34:00.946 --> 00:34:03.916
So I get the major league
baseball app on my iPhone,

00:34:04.216 --> 00:34:07.276
you do nothing and there it
is right on your Apple TV.

00:34:12.196 --> 00:34:14.136
Now there's never been a
better time for all of you

00:34:14.136 --> 00:34:15.735
to build apps for the big screen

00:34:15.735 --> 00:34:18.025
and we've got some great new
features for you as well.

00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:19.815
First of all, ReplayKit

00:34:19.815 --> 00:34:22.406
where you can live
broadcast your gameplay

00:34:22.636 --> 00:34:24.686
or save the video
to share it later.

00:34:26.166 --> 00:34:27.936
We've got PhotoKit,
it gives you access

00:34:27.985 --> 00:34:30.326
to your complete
iCloud photo library,

00:34:30.326 --> 00:34:32.246
all the videos, all the photos.

00:34:32.476 --> 00:34:34.906
And of course HomeKit
where you can create apps

00:34:35.025 --> 00:34:37.916
to control all the devices
in your-- on-- at home.

00:34:37.916 --> 00:34:41.136
And that's just some of the
many features we've got.

00:34:41.136 --> 00:34:43.126
Things like support for
four game controllers,

00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:45.946
multiplayer game
sessions and a lot more.

00:34:46.396 --> 00:34:48.936
And that is a quick
update to the tvOS.

00:34:49.186 --> 00:34:52.746
A new Apple TV remote app,
great Siri enhancements,

00:34:53.156 --> 00:34:56.606
with topic search,
YouTube and Live Tune-In.

00:34:57.005 --> 00:34:59.316
Obviously single sign-on,
so now you get access

00:34:59.316 --> 00:35:02.006
to all your network apps and
great tools for developers.

00:35:03.566 --> 00:35:06.216
And all of you will get a
developer preview today.

I can't wait to see all of the
apps that you start building

00:35:08.666 --> 00:35:12.976

this fall and that is tvOS.

And good morning, it's
great to be back at WWDC

to talk to you about OS X.

00:35:37.116 --> 00:35:40.956
And of course, no
presentation at WWDC

00:35:41.276 --> 00:35:44.376
about OS X would be
complete without some kind

00:35:44.376 --> 00:35:45.786
of naming controversy.

00:35:46.726 --> 00:35:51.476
Now, I'm not talking about
some allegedly baked members

00:35:51.526 --> 00:35:53.986
of marketing team going on
some kind of vision quest

00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:56.086
around California looking
for a special name.

00:35:57.426 --> 00:36:00.646
I'm actually talking about
the name OS X itself.

00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:05.976
You know, OS X has been with
us as a name for over 15 years.

00:36:06.466 --> 00:36:07.896
And it served us so well.

00:36:07.896 --> 00:36:12.076
But as we look at it
alongside its younger brethren,

00:36:13.036 --> 00:36:14.196
something sticks out.

00:36:14.956 --> 00:36:18.386
We realized that there's a name
that would be so much clearer

00:36:18.486 --> 00:36:19.626
and so much more elegant.

00:36:20.156 --> 00:36:22.916
And so we're making it so.

00:36:23.176 --> 00:36:26.706
The name of the world's most
advanced desktop operating

00:36:26.766 --> 00:36:28.846
system is now Mac OS.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:36:38.936 --> 00:36:42.326
Now of course each version of
Mac OS does have a special name

00:36:42.326 --> 00:36:44.596
after a place that's
especially important

00:36:44.596 --> 00:36:46.766
to us here in California.

00:36:47.526 --> 00:36:50.296
And this year's Mac
OS is no different.

00:36:50.706 --> 00:36:53.336
But the choice this
time was obvious.

00:36:53.996 --> 00:36:57.966
Our latest newest OS
X is macOS Sierra.

new release.

With a big focus on continuity,
the iCloud and the fundamentals

00:37:13.536 --> 00:37:14.836
of the Mac experience.

00:37:15.126 --> 00:37:17.276
I want to start with continuity.

00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:20.266
Because continuity is like
magic, your devices are able

00:37:20.266 --> 00:37:22.466
to sense themselves around you

00:37:22.536 --> 00:37:26.326
and use secure peer-to-peer
wireless protocols to enable you

00:37:26.326 --> 00:37:28.136
to move from one task to another

00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:30.836
across your devices
just seamlessly.

00:37:31.426 --> 00:37:33.326
What we wanted to
take on this year,

00:37:33.786 --> 00:37:37.956
one task that we all do many
times a day every time we start

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:41.866
using our Macs and that
feature is called auto unlock.

00:37:42.316 --> 00:37:42.406
So--

[ Applause ]

00:37:48.056 --> 00:37:49.976
Today, when you first
approach your Mac to use it,

00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:51.676
the experience is
something like this.

00:37:51.976 --> 00:37:55.316
You open it up, you confront
with a password field,

00:37:55.316 --> 00:37:56.786
then you type, and
then maybe mistyped,

00:37:56.786 --> 00:37:59.826
and then retype your
password, and then you're

00:37:59.826 --> 00:38:00.756
in and using your Mac.

00:38:01.286 --> 00:38:02.216
But you know for many of us,

00:38:02.216 --> 00:38:04.576
we already have a device
securely authenticated

00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:07.366
to our wrists that
already knows who we are

00:38:07.366 --> 00:38:08.656
and could tell our Mac.

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:11.326
And so then, when
we open our Mac,

00:38:11.326 --> 00:38:13.596
it could be a little
bit more like this.

00:38:14.246 --> 00:38:15.436
And we're in.

00:38:16.386 --> 00:38:17.436
It's that simple.

[ Applause ]

00:38:22.896 --> 00:38:25.996
And we made this really secure
using time of flight networking

00:38:25.996 --> 00:38:28.836
to make sure it's you who's
that close to the machine

00:38:29.096 --> 00:38:30.846
who is unlocking it,
so it's really great.

00:38:31.296 --> 00:38:33.126
Now, the next continuity feature

00:38:33.726 --> 00:38:38.096
in macOS Sierra is
universal clipboard.

00:38:38.836 --> 00:38:41.116
Now-- Wow, gasp.

00:38:41.976 --> 00:38:47.486
So-- but I know copy and paste
is so fundamental to the way

00:38:47.486 --> 00:38:50.616
that we use our Macs
for so many years now.

00:38:50.976 --> 00:38:53.626
But what if when you
are on even your iPhone

00:38:53.626 --> 00:38:56.676
and you found some new text,
and you just want to copy it,

00:38:56.676 --> 00:38:57.796
that when you then
went to your Mac,

00:38:59.196 --> 00:39:01.656
well you could just
paste it right in.

00:39:02.396 --> 00:39:05.236
And now you can with
images, video,

00:39:05.236 --> 00:39:07.266
everything completely automatic.

00:39:11.146 --> 00:39:12.776
Now I'd like to move
on to iCloud

00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:14.916
and specifically iCloud Drive.

00:39:15.166 --> 00:39:18.156
Now today with iCloud
Drive, you can put documents

00:39:18.586 --> 00:39:20.696
into your iCloud Drive
that you explicitly want

00:39:20.696 --> 00:39:23.306
to make available to you
across your other systems

00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:25.186
as well as your iOS devices.

00:39:25.546 --> 00:39:27.346
And customers have been
quite a bit of this.

00:39:27.346 --> 00:39:30.346
There are actually 10
billion customer documents

00:39:30.346 --> 00:39:31.586
in iCloud drive today.

00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:33.876
But we want to take
this a step further.

00:39:34.296 --> 00:39:36.216
We want all of your documents

00:39:36.506 --> 00:39:39.066
and your desktop
accessible to you everywhere.

00:39:39.426 --> 00:39:41.756
So that when you're on one Mac,
maybe you're putting things

00:39:41.756 --> 00:39:43.456
in your normal documents
folder, well,

00:39:43.456 --> 00:39:44.746
of course those should
be available

the things that we're
working on right now, well,

00:39:51.496 --> 00:39:52.686
where do we put those?

00:39:52.906 --> 00:39:54.856
So often it's on our desktop.

00:39:55.096 --> 00:39:58.156
So let's make our desktop
available on our other Macs

00:39:58.156 --> 00:40:01.586
as well and have those
files be available to us

00:40:01.586 --> 00:40:03.246
on the go on our iPhones.

00:40:03.866 --> 00:40:04.336
Now you can.

00:40:05.516 --> 00:40:10.716
[ Applause ]

00:40:11.216 --> 00:40:13.596
Next up, optimized storage.

00:40:13.596 --> 00:40:15.456
You know, we love using our Macs

00:40:15.456 --> 00:40:16.956
and we fill them
with so much stuff.

00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:19.086
But you're going to end up
with a situation like this.

00:40:19.086 --> 00:40:22.386
And, we know, what
do you do about it?

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.616
Well, it turns out we're
going to give you a solution.

00:40:24.616 --> 00:40:26.326
And it works in two ways.

00:40:26.536 --> 00:40:30.156
First, it helps you make
room for the files that--

00:40:30.156 --> 00:40:33.486
your new files by keeping your
older ones up in the Cloud.

00:40:33.816 --> 00:40:36.406
So, whether it's your
full resolution photos,

00:40:36.406 --> 00:40:38.706
when your others are in
iCloud Drive or movies

00:40:38.706 --> 00:40:41.156
that you've already
watched in iTunes

00:40:41.156 --> 00:40:44.416
or even those old mail
attachments, we can clear off

00:40:44.446 --> 00:40:46.406
that space locally and
make those things available

00:40:46.406 --> 00:40:47.266
to you on demand.

00:40:47.586 --> 00:40:49.816
But we also want to make
it easy for you to get rid

00:40:49.816 --> 00:40:52.926
of files you'll never
use again automatically.

00:40:52.926 --> 00:40:56.016
Things like your Safari web
cache and maybe the trash

00:40:56.016 --> 00:40:57.526
that you keep forgetting
to empty

00:40:57.526 --> 00:41:00.016
and redundant data that's stored
by mail, well, we can get rid

00:41:00.016 --> 00:41:01.696
of all of that as well.

00:41:01.696 --> 00:41:04.316
And we provide a really
simple user interface

00:41:04.316 --> 00:41:05.846
to help you do it.

00:41:05.966 --> 00:41:09.216
Now, as a task, we took a
system that was nearly full,

00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:11.066
had about let's say
20 gigs free,

00:41:11.486 --> 00:41:13.256
and we put it through the paces.

00:41:13.256 --> 00:41:16.366
Now, it had a lot of photos
and a lot of documents.

00:41:16.716 --> 00:41:19.366
It had movies that were
already watched, mail with lots

00:41:19.366 --> 00:41:22.256
of attachment, apps,
system files and so forth.

00:41:22.256 --> 00:41:24.856
And we turned on all the
switches for optimized storage.

00:41:24.856 --> 00:41:29.396
And we went from 20 gigs
free to 150 gigs free.

00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:30.446
So, we think that's going

00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:31.816
to make a difference
for all of you.

00:41:32.516 --> 00:41:36.196
[ Applause ]

00:41:36.696 --> 00:41:38.936
Next, Apple Pay.

00:41:40.066 --> 00:41:44.896
So, we all love using Apple Pay
in stores to pay with our phones

00:41:45.226 --> 00:41:48.066
and our Apple Watch
at the cash register

00:41:48.066 --> 00:41:51.026
and to shop inside apps
on our iOS devices.

00:41:51.656 --> 00:41:52.456
So, of course, we wanted

00:41:52.456 --> 00:41:54.636
to bring this experience
to the Mac.

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:58.526
We thought long and hard about
exactly the right way to do it.

00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:00.336
And I think we'd nailed it.

00:42:02.516 --> 00:42:08.506
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:42:09.006 --> 00:42:11.016
I think we might have
an accessory business

00:42:11.016 --> 00:42:12.866
for some carrying straps,
can be very helpful.

00:42:13.136 --> 00:42:15.216
No, this is not how people
are going to shop on our Macs.

00:42:15.216 --> 00:42:17.806
We shop online, on
the web, in Safari.

00:42:17.806 --> 00:42:19.416
And so, what are we doing?

00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:21.856
We're bringing Apple
Pay to the web.

[ Applause ]

00:42:28.216 --> 00:42:31.586
So now, when you're shopping
online, you'll have a Pay

00:42:31.586 --> 00:42:33.696
with Apple Pay button
available to you.

00:42:33.966 --> 00:42:37.196
When you click it, a sheet comes
down that actually prompts you

00:42:37.196 --> 00:42:41.206
to securely authenticate your
purchase using continuity right

00:42:41.206 --> 00:42:42.976
on your iPhone with Touch ID.

00:42:43.516 --> 00:42:49.036
[ Applause ]

00:42:49.536 --> 00:42:52.996
And of course, this works
with your Apple Watch as well.

00:42:52.996 --> 00:42:55.606
So, you can authenticate with
just a tap on your wrist.

00:42:56.046 --> 00:42:58.166
And already, many, many
merchants are signed

00:42:58.166 --> 00:43:00.406
up to bring their
web storefronts

00:43:00.736 --> 00:43:02.286
to support Apple Pay on the web.

00:43:02.286 --> 00:43:05.576
And Apple Pay is expanding
hugely geographically.

00:43:05.576 --> 00:43:09.696
It's now available in the
United States, the UK, Canada,

00:43:09.696 --> 00:43:12.366
Australia, China and Singapore.

00:43:12.366 --> 00:43:13.736
And in the next few months,

00:43:13.736 --> 00:43:16.856
it's coming to Switzerland,
France and Hong Kong.

00:43:17.676 --> 00:43:19.246
Now, next, I want
to move to part

00:43:19.246 --> 00:43:21.846
of the Mac experience,
and that's tabs.

00:43:22.306 --> 00:43:26.536
You know, many of us love using
tabs to take a mess of windows

00:43:26.536 --> 00:43:29.286
that we have in Safari and
get them neatly organized

00:43:29.326 --> 00:43:30.536
in tab set.

00:43:30.686 --> 00:43:33.306
Well, now, we want
to bring that to all

00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:34.616
of your multi-windowed apps.

00:43:34.866 --> 00:43:37.446
So, maybe you have multiple
windows open in maps, well,

00:43:37.446 --> 00:43:38.956
you could organize
those in tabs.

00:43:39.446 --> 00:43:41.716
But because it's built into
the system, you could do

00:43:41.716 --> 00:43:43.516
that for third apps as well.

00:43:43.716 --> 00:43:45.676
In fact, we've implemented
it in a way

00:43:45.676 --> 00:43:48.266
that the apps you already have
installed can support this

00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:51.226
out of the box without
any modification,

00:43:51.426 --> 00:43:52.756
so tabs everywhere.

00:43:59.416 --> 00:44:01.566
So next, picture-in-picture.

00:44:03.256 --> 00:44:05.006
We love watching
video on the web.

00:44:05.006 --> 00:44:06.196
But sometimes, we
like to keep track

00:44:06.196 --> 00:44:07.646
of a video while we're
doing other work.

00:44:08.136 --> 00:44:08.866
Well now, you can.

00:44:08.866 --> 00:44:10.386
You can push the
picture-in-picture button.

00:44:10.386 --> 00:44:12.466
Your video goes under
a nice little PIP.

00:44:12.466 --> 00:44:15.496
You can move it around the
screen and it works great

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.276
in full screen as well.

features in macOS Sierra.

But there is one more.

00:44:33.246 --> 00:44:35.696
And this year, I'd
like to unusual step

00:44:35.736 --> 00:44:38.826
of letting this feature
introduce itself.

00:44:38.956 --> 00:44:41.646
>> Hi, it's me.

00:44:41.796 --> 00:44:43.236
It's sure is great
to be on the Mac.

00:44:43.956 --> 00:44:44.836
How about a demo?

00:44:44.996 --> 00:44:45.236
>> That's right.

00:44:45.276 --> 00:44:47.346

would like to a give a demo.

00:44:56.476 --> 00:44:57.416
So, let's get to it.

00:44:57.696 --> 00:45:02.266
So, we have macOS
Sierra right here.

00:45:02.326 --> 00:45:04.256
And the first thing
you'll notice is right here

00:45:04.256 --> 00:45:07.196
on the dock, we have
access to Siri.

00:45:07.846 --> 00:45:09.346
So, I can ask Siri a question.

00:45:09.346 --> 00:45:11.926
Let's say, how do you
like being on a Mac?

00:45:13.576 --> 00:45:16.936
>> Pretty awesome, lots of
space, aluminum unibody walls

00:45:17.016 --> 00:45:19.146
and no complaints about
the lack of Windows.

00:45:20.146 --> 00:45:20.256
>> So--

00:45:21.516 --> 00:45:24.326
[ Applause ]

00:45:24.826 --> 00:45:27.416
So, it's the same Siri
that we know and love.

00:45:27.416 --> 00:45:29.706
But now on a Mac, it
can do so much more.

00:45:29.796 --> 00:45:32.986
Things like sophisticated
queries for files

00:45:32.986 --> 00:45:37.346
like show the files I worked
on last week about the offsite.

00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:42.126
>> Have I ever told you
your file is so styling.

00:45:42.586 --> 00:45:44.626
>> So, we have my
search results.

00:45:44.626 --> 00:45:46.426
But what's really
incredible is I can refine

00:45:46.426 --> 00:45:49.316
that sophisticated query
with a follow on like,

00:45:49.316 --> 00:45:52.936
just the ones Ken sent me
that I tagged with draft.

00:45:53.586 --> 00:45:56.336
>> For your filling pleasure.

00:45:56.566 --> 00:45:58.606
>> So you see I have just
the files I'm looking

00:45:58.606 --> 00:45:59.316
for right there.

00:45:59.396 --> 00:46:02.446
But what's great is this is a
useful result that I may want

00:46:02.446 --> 00:46:03.846
to throughout the day as I work.

00:46:04.086 --> 00:46:05.936
So, I can actually click
on this plus button

00:46:06.106 --> 00:46:09.866
and pin it right here into
my notification center.

00:46:10.366 --> 00:46:12.046
And it is-- yeah,
it's really great.

00:46:12.046 --> 00:46:14.236
And this works for lots
of your Siri results.

00:46:16.156 --> 00:46:19.296
So, I'm going to actually open
this team offsite presentation,

00:46:19.706 --> 00:46:21.436
just working on a
little project here.

00:46:21.436 --> 00:46:23.006
I'll take this one full screen.

00:46:23.246 --> 00:46:24.656
We see we're planning
an offsite.

00:46:24.656 --> 00:46:25.746
There are a bunch of activities.

00:46:25.746 --> 00:46:28.326
But while I'm working in full
screen, Siri is there for me

00:46:28.326 --> 00:46:29.576
and helps me multitask.

00:46:29.576 --> 00:46:33.586
So, I can do things like, play
my power ballads playlist.

00:46:34.186 --> 00:46:35.566
[Background music] Oh yeah.

00:46:38.046 --> 00:46:41.966
So, Siri to the rescue
with some awesome tunes.

00:46:42.076 --> 00:46:44.256
I can let this play all day.

00:46:44.256 --> 00:46:46.436
But I think we'll
get on with the demo.

00:46:46.506 --> 00:46:49.146
So, I can actually use
my Siri results here

00:46:49.146 --> 00:46:51.046
to help me complete
this presentation.

00:46:51.046 --> 00:46:53.426
So, I have an image result
here for slacklining.

00:46:53.426 --> 00:46:55.486
Let me just click
in my Siri result.

00:46:55.936 --> 00:46:57.786
Drag it right into
my presentation.

00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:00.186
And I can also have Siri
search the web for me.

00:47:00.186 --> 00:47:03.806
So, let's do, search the web
for pictures of falconry.

00:47:05.066 --> 00:47:07.786
>> Here are some images of
falconry I found on the web.

00:47:08.116 --> 00:47:09.616
>> OK. That looks
like some good fun.

00:47:09.616 --> 00:47:11.866
So, I can actually take the
results right out of Siri

00:47:13.366 --> 00:47:15.056
and drag them into my document.

00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:16.076

[ Applause ]

00:47:21.696 --> 00:47:25.376
But, you know, I'd like to
actually replace this map

00:47:25.696 --> 00:47:28.546
with one that I've been
working on here on my iPad.

00:47:28.876 --> 00:47:31.676
So, my iPad is so great because
I can actually use my Apple

00:47:31.816 --> 00:47:33.586
Pencil to do some drawings.

00:47:33.586 --> 00:47:35.376
So, let's say, I'm going to
take my Apple Pencil here

00:47:35.376 --> 00:47:37.366
and I'm going to draw a path.

00:47:37.446 --> 00:47:39.226
Maybe we'll take
a hike like this,

00:47:39.226 --> 00:47:41.296
maybe out over here,
just like that.

00:47:41.296 --> 00:47:43.336
OK, that looks like
just the drawing I want.

00:47:43.336 --> 00:47:45.526
But of course, I'd like
to now get it on my Mac.

00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:47.266
So, how do I do that?

00:47:47.466 --> 00:47:49.446
Well, why don't I just copy it--

00:47:49.446 --> 00:47:52.466
but I'm not just copying it to
my iPad because when I return

00:47:52.466 --> 00:47:56.206
to my Mac, I can paste it just
like I would anything else,

00:47:56.836 --> 00:48:00.716

automatically into my document.

at this trip,

00:48:09.306 --> 00:48:11.006
I realized that it's
a horrible idea.

00:48:11.006 --> 00:48:14.346
So, I can actually use
Siri to message my friend.

00:48:15.086 --> 00:48:17.736
Tell Ken, maybe we
should just see a movie.

ready to send it.

>> Sent.

to do messaging at any time.

00:48:27.306 --> 00:48:30.396
And it can also help
me find that movie.

00:48:30.396 --> 00:48:32.226
What new movies are
playing this Friday?

00:48:32.466 --> 00:48:36.526
>> I found eight movies
playing on Friday.

00:48:37.046 --> 00:48:37.346
>> All right.

00:48:37.346 --> 00:48:38.796

looks pretty good.

00:48:40.486 --> 00:48:41.896
So, let's open that up.

00:48:42.126 --> 00:48:44.976
Now, I can go play the trailer.

00:48:45.046 --> 00:48:46.966
[Background music] But I
could also drop it right here

00:48:46.966 --> 00:48:48.536
into picture-in-picture.

00:48:48.606 --> 00:48:50.656
And you see in
picture-in-picture,

00:48:50.656 --> 00:48:54.116
I can actually resize if I want.

00:48:54.116 --> 00:48:56.986
I can reposition the PIP
window to any corner.

00:48:57.896 --> 00:49:01.306
And, of course, it works
great in full screen,

00:49:01.306 --> 00:49:03.796
right on top of my
other content.

00:49:03.866 --> 00:49:06.206
So, this movie looks
pretty good.

00:49:06.206 --> 00:49:08.856
So, I think I'll go
back into the browser.

00:49:09.326 --> 00:49:10.856
And let's actually
buy some tickets.

00:49:10.856 --> 00:49:13.486
So, I see there's a showing
here at 7:15, I'll select that.

00:49:14.296 --> 00:49:15.216
Select the amount.

00:49:15.216 --> 00:49:16.866
Let's go with 10 of us.

00:49:17.306 --> 00:49:19.706
And here you see, buy
with Apple Pay button.

00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:22.246
So, watch what happens
when I click buy Apple Pay,

00:49:22.566 --> 00:49:24.996
I'm prompted to confirm
here on my iPhone.

00:49:25.096 --> 00:49:27.626
I just used Touch ID
with my fingerprint.

00:49:28.816 --> 00:49:32.436
And I can securely authenticate
my transaction just like that.

00:49:33.866 --> 00:49:37.756
And that is a quick
look in macOS Sierra.

00:49:40.716 --> 00:49:44.816
So, Sierra, some great features
for continuity, the Cloud,

00:49:44.816 --> 00:49:49.016
Apple Pay, user experience
and, of course, Siri.

00:49:49.226 --> 00:49:50.586
And there's much more

00:49:50.586 --> 00:49:53.046
that you'll be hearing
about later today.

00:49:53.386 --> 00:49:55.866
Now, Sierra is available
to you developers

00:49:55.866 --> 00:49:58.066
in developer preview form today

00:49:58.236 --> 00:50:00.496
and we're doing a
public beta in July.

00:50:00.496 --> 00:50:02.736
You can sign up now
at beta.apple.com.

00:50:02.976 --> 00:50:06.426
And they'll be available to
everyone else in the fall

00:50:06.526 --> 00:50:08.476
across all of these systems.

00:50:08.846 --> 00:50:11.456
That is your update on macOS.

00:50:12.516 --> 00:50:20.436
[ Applause ]

00:50:20.936 --> 00:50:22.676
Next, let's turn to iOS.

00:50:23.456 --> 00:50:25.856
So, iOS, we're hitting
a big milestone

00:50:25.976 --> 00:50:30.386
because now I'm pleased
to introduce iOS 10.

00:50:31.516 --> 00:50:35.326
[ Applause ]

00:50:35.826 --> 00:50:39.456
Now, iOS 10 is a huge
release for the developers.

00:50:39.746 --> 00:50:44.006
And it is the biggest iOS
release ever for our users.

00:50:44.546 --> 00:50:47.956
Now, there are 10 big features
I want to talk about today.

00:50:47.956 --> 00:50:52.256
And let's start off with number
one, that's user experience.

00:50:52.836 --> 00:50:56.326
Now, in iOS 10, we've
redesigned the experience

00:50:56.326 --> 00:50:57.106
of the lock screen.

00:50:57.516 --> 00:51:00.686
With rich notifications, they
give you quick interaction

00:51:00.686 --> 00:51:04.006
with apps through the
expanded use of 3D Touch.

00:51:04.356 --> 00:51:05.916
But rather than just
talk about it,

00:51:05.916 --> 00:51:08.006
how about I just show
it to you right now?

00:51:08.006 --> 00:51:08.596
Let's do a demo.

00:51:09.516 --> 00:51:13.676
[ Applause ]

00:51:14.176 --> 00:51:16.316
Now, one thing a lot
of us have noticed now

00:51:16.316 --> 00:51:18.056
that we have our iPhone 6ses

00:51:18.056 --> 00:51:20.726
with the incredibly
fast Touch ID sensor is

00:51:20.896 --> 00:51:23.616
that we can just blow
past our notifications

00:51:23.616 --> 00:51:24.576
on our lock screen.

00:51:25.066 --> 00:51:26.216
We never even get to see them.

00:51:26.496 --> 00:51:30.386
And so, in iOS 10, we
have a great solution.

00:51:30.626 --> 00:51:32.156
It's called raise to wake.

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:34.596
And it lets you see
what's on your lock screen

00:51:35.066 --> 00:51:36.816
without ever touching a button.

00:51:36.816 --> 00:51:38.536
Let me show it to you now.

00:51:38.536 --> 00:51:42.976
I just raised my wrist and
phone wakes up just like that.

00:51:43.516 --> 00:51:48.666
[ Applause ]

00:51:49.166 --> 00:51:51.636
Now, the first thing you'll
notice is these beautiful

00:51:51.636 --> 00:51:54.256
notifications are
no longer causing us

00:51:54.296 --> 00:51:56.606
to darken the-- your wallpapers.

00:51:56.606 --> 00:51:57.666
So, you get to look at that.

00:51:57.666 --> 00:51:59.936
But what's more important is
they're really interactive

00:51:59.936 --> 00:52:00.786
through 3D Touch.

00:52:01.276 --> 00:52:03.566
So, for instance with this
calendar notification,

00:52:03.886 --> 00:52:05.666
I can just 3D Touch on it.

00:52:05.786 --> 00:52:08.586
And I can jump right in and
get all this rich detail

00:52:08.866 --> 00:52:10.446
about this invitation.

00:52:10.446 --> 00:52:11.446
I can see my calendar.

00:52:11.446 --> 00:52:13.516
And I can accept right here.

00:52:14.196 --> 00:52:16.966
Now, this is especially
great with messages.

00:52:16.966 --> 00:52:18.546
Let's 3D Touch into that one.

00:52:19.016 --> 00:52:21.896
And here, you see, I see the
message that was sent to me.

00:52:21.896 --> 00:52:24.546
I can respond right
here, the keyboard.

00:52:24.546 --> 00:52:27.396
But what's great is I can
stay in the conversation,

00:52:27.606 --> 00:52:28.906
right here on the lock screen.

00:52:28.906 --> 00:52:31.786
And even get rich responses
like images right inline.

00:52:31.866 --> 00:52:34.996
And this works really well
with third-party apps as well.

00:52:34.996 --> 00:52:37.536
So, for instance if I get
a notification from Uber,

00:52:37.536 --> 00:52:42.076
I can just press in and I get
this completely interactive

00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:46.836
and animated live status update
on my car as it comes in.

00:52:48.106 --> 00:52:48.716
It's really great.

00:52:51.436 --> 00:52:52.616
Now, of course as always,

00:52:52.616 --> 00:52:54.826
you can get your
notifications right here

00:52:54.826 --> 00:52:55.986
from the top of the screen.

00:52:56.356 --> 00:52:59.666
But now, with 3D Touch,
if you want to clear them,

00:53:00.036 --> 00:53:02.976
you can just press in and
clear them all with a tap.

00:53:03.186 --> 00:53:03.966
It's really great.

00:53:04.516 --> 00:53:07.586
[ Applause ]

00:53:08.086 --> 00:53:10.116
Now, control center is
available from the bottom

00:53:10.116 --> 00:53:11.006
of the screen as well.

00:53:11.006 --> 00:53:12.696
We can just swipe
up from the bottom.

00:53:13.116 --> 00:53:14.636
See, it's beautifully
redesigned,

00:53:14.636 --> 00:53:16.376
gives me great access
to all my controls.

00:53:16.376 --> 00:53:19.576
But if I swipe over, you
see, we have a special area

00:53:19.576 --> 00:53:21.716
for our music with
nice big controls

00:53:21.716 --> 00:53:23.636
and beautiful album
art right there.

00:53:26.656 --> 00:53:29.086
Now, we'd made it
easier than ever to get

00:53:29.086 --> 00:53:30.756
at your camera from
the lock screen.

00:53:31.066 --> 00:53:33.036
So, I can just slide
over from the right,

00:53:33.036 --> 00:53:34.466
and there's my camera.

00:53:34.706 --> 00:53:38.666
And it's easy to take a picture
of my demo notes, right there.

00:53:39.666 --> 00:53:40.336
That's good.

00:53:41.336 --> 00:53:43.436
And we've made it easier than
ever to get at your widgets.

00:53:43.436 --> 00:53:45.456
Just slide over the other way.

00:53:45.456 --> 00:53:46.936
You can see I have my weather.

00:53:47.226 --> 00:53:48.396
I have my calendar.

00:53:48.396 --> 00:53:50.416
I get my news top stories.

00:53:50.576 --> 00:53:52.636
And you notice these widgets
have the ability for me

00:53:52.636 --> 00:53:53.656
to get more information.

00:53:53.656 --> 00:53:57.576
So, I can do show more and
see the rest of my day.

00:53:57.576 --> 00:53:59.696
You'd like to think.

00:54:00.256 --> 00:54:04.096
And I can even get more
information right here

00:54:04.096 --> 00:54:05.916
from apps on my home screen.

00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:08.086
So, for instance, it looks
like I have decent number

00:54:08.086 --> 00:54:09.436
of unread e-mail messages.

00:54:09.436 --> 00:54:11.366
And now, if I 3D Touch there,

00:54:11.366 --> 00:54:14.626
I can see who it is I've been
ignoring this whole time,

00:54:14.696 --> 00:54:15.216
my VIPs.

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:20.196
Now, if I swipe over here, I
can also get great information

00:54:20.196 --> 00:54:22.276
on the activity without
even launching the app.

00:54:22.276 --> 00:54:24.776
I just 3D Touch in and
get a look at my rings.

00:54:25.236 --> 00:54:28.996
And this can work really well
with third-party apps as well.

00:54:28.996 --> 00:54:30.436
So, I'm going to jump into ESPN.

00:54:30.476 --> 00:54:33.106
I can see information
about my latest team.

00:54:33.106 --> 00:54:35.736
And if I want that widget
available to me at all times

00:54:35.736 --> 00:54:38.976
on My Today view, I can just
add that widget like that.

00:54:38.976 --> 00:54:41.706
And I go over to My Today
view, and there it is.

00:54:41.706 --> 00:54:43.756
And I can get that
show more information.

00:54:43.946 --> 00:54:45.806
And you see, I get
a graphical update

00:54:45.806 --> 00:54:47.576
on the highlights
from the last game.

00:54:47.576 --> 00:54:50.896
And if I tap in, live action.

00:54:51.276 --> 00:54:52.166
>> Curry to Igoudala.

00:54:52.946 --> 00:54:54.006
Shot clock at seven.

00:54:54.226 --> 00:54:55.716
Curry fakes, puts up a three.

00:54:56.736 --> 00:54:57.356
Bang.

00:54:57.526 --> 00:54:57.666
>> Bang.

00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:58.796
>> Stephen Curry from downtown.

00:54:58.926 --> 00:55:00.166
It's a 10-point game.

00:55:01.316 --> 00:55:01.816
>> Oh yeah.

00:55:02.126 --> 00:55:05.776
So, that is a quick look
at the new lock screen

00:55:05.776 --> 00:55:08.486
and home screen experience
in iOS 10.

00:55:08.936 --> 00:55:10.676
You have a beautiful
new control center,

00:55:10.976 --> 00:55:14.706
interactive notifications and
great ways to use your widgets.

00:55:14.946 --> 00:55:18.076
It's great on the iPhone
and the iPad as well.

00:55:18.746 --> 00:55:21.986
Next, number two, Siri,

00:55:22.426 --> 00:55:25.196
huge part of the user
experience in iOS.

00:55:26.106 --> 00:55:30.566
Now, Siri services over
two billion requests a week

00:55:30.566 --> 00:55:31.256
from customers.

00:55:31.256 --> 00:55:34.006
And there's so many things
that you can ask Siri.

00:55:34.516 --> 00:55:39.236
But now in iOS 10, Siri is going
to be able to do so much more

00:55:39.606 --> 00:55:42.556
because we're opening
up Siri to developers.

00:55:43.516 --> 00:55:53.076
[ Applause ]

00:55:53.576 --> 00:55:57.826
Now, you'll be able to ask
Siri, things like, send a WeChat

00:55:57.876 --> 00:55:59.716
to Nancy saying, I'll
be five minutes late.

00:56:00.636 --> 00:56:03.946
And Siri can summon up
the WeChat UI right inside

00:56:04.006 --> 00:56:05.256
of the Siri environment.

00:56:06.076 --> 00:56:09.856
Now, of course, Siri, because
it understands the domains

00:56:09.856 --> 00:56:12.176
of things like messaging,
it allows you to say things

00:56:12.176 --> 00:56:13.256
in so many different ways.

00:56:13.256 --> 00:56:16.226
I could've said, WeChat Nancy
that I'll be five minutes late

00:56:16.226 --> 00:56:17.566
or I need to send a message

00:56:17.566 --> 00:56:20.086
to Nancy via WeChat saying
I'll be five minutes late.

00:56:20.086 --> 00:56:22.416
And I could do that in all
sorts of different languages.

00:56:22.686 --> 00:56:25.436
But because now in iOS 10,
we have an intense API,

00:56:25.436 --> 00:56:29.086
it allows Siri to take
on that part of the work

00:56:29.336 --> 00:56:32.456
and lets the extension do what
it does best, like messaging.

00:56:32.976 --> 00:56:35.986
And so, now, we support
messaging with apps like,

00:56:36.586 --> 00:56:39.756
Slack and WhatsApp
and, of course, WeChat.

00:56:40.136 --> 00:56:43.156
It could do things like ride
booking in Siri with services

00:56:43.156 --> 00:56:48.626
like Uber, Lyft and Didi in
China, photo search for--

00:56:48.696 --> 00:56:52.326
in apps like IM,
Shutterfly and Pinterest.

00:56:52.996 --> 00:56:57.496
And you could start, pause
and stop your workouts in apps

00:56:57.496 --> 00:57:00.506
like MapMyRun, Runtastic
and Runkeeper.

00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:04.296
And even do payments to
send money to friends,

00:57:04.296 --> 00:57:08.856
with things like Number 26,
Square Cash and Alipay in China.

00:57:08.986 --> 00:57:11.806
And do VoIP calling through apps

00:57:11.806 --> 00:57:14.696
like Cisco Spark,
Vonage and Skype.

00:57:14.756 --> 00:57:17.096
And it works great
in the car as well.

00:57:17.096 --> 00:57:21.886
Because with CarPlay, you can
now safely send your messages

00:57:21.986 --> 00:57:26.106
as well as make VoIP calls all
inside the CarPlay environment

00:57:26.106 --> 00:57:27.216
with your favorite apps.

00:57:27.216 --> 00:57:29.936
And that's a quick
update on Siri.

00:57:31.516 --> 00:57:37.646
[ Applause ]

00:57:38.146 --> 00:57:40.706
Number three, QuickType.

00:57:40.706 --> 00:57:44.406
And the big news this year is
we're bringing Siri intelligence

00:57:44.646 --> 00:57:45.496
to the keyboard.

00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:50.616
So, today, QuickType is
able to use a context

00:57:50.616 --> 00:57:53.596
to help predict what
words you might type next.

00:57:53.946 --> 00:57:56.026
Well, now, we're
using deep learning

00:57:56.026 --> 00:57:57.906
and a technique specifically
called LSTMs

00:57:58.636 --> 00:58:02.416
to enable much more
intelligence in longer context.

00:58:02.526 --> 00:58:04.826
So, we can tell the difference
between, the Orioles are playing

00:58:04.826 --> 00:58:07.186
in the playoffs and the
children are playing

00:58:07.456 --> 00:58:09.406
in the park automatically.

00:58:09.406 --> 00:58:12.876
And Siri can help you do
responses more intelligently

00:58:12.876 --> 00:58:13.216
than ever.

00:58:13.216 --> 00:58:15.556
So, you might get
asked, where are you?

00:58:16.036 --> 00:58:18.656
Well, Siri can suggest right
there on the suggestion bar

00:58:18.656 --> 00:58:20.606
that you supply your
current location.

00:58:20.966 --> 00:58:22.726
Tap it and you can
get your location

00:58:22.726 --> 00:58:24.896
with the map right
into your transcript.

00:58:25.846 --> 00:58:28.266
And people might ask you
about contact information

00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:31.156
for a friend, well, Siri
can automatically offer

00:58:31.156 --> 00:58:33.556
up the most relevant contacts.

00:58:34.316 --> 00:58:37.756
Now, right locally on your
device, Siri has information

00:58:37.756 --> 00:58:39.536
about what you've been doing.

00:58:39.676 --> 00:58:42.336
And so, it can extract
information from a message

00:58:42.336 --> 00:58:43.616
that maybe says,
oh, you're talking

00:58:43.616 --> 00:58:46.086
about dim sum at
11 a.m. on Sunday?

00:58:46.086 --> 00:58:46.916
Well, when you go

00:58:46.916 --> 00:58:49.256
to automatically
create a calendar event,

00:58:49.256 --> 00:58:51.726
Siri can prefill it for
you with things like,

00:58:51.726 --> 00:58:53.046
oh, that must be brunch.

00:58:53.316 --> 00:58:54.396
Fill out the location.

00:58:54.666 --> 00:58:55.486
Pick the time.

00:58:55.846 --> 00:58:56.896
It's really smart.

00:58:57.716 --> 00:58:59.576
And Siri does so much more.

00:59:00.006 --> 00:59:01.986
It can check your
calendar availability

00:59:01.986 --> 00:59:02.916
for you automatically.

00:59:03.306 --> 00:59:06.276
Help you paste a recent
address automatically.

00:59:06.356 --> 00:59:09.756
Fill it in based on addresses
you were browsing in other apps.

00:59:10.496 --> 00:59:12.666
It can help you look
up terms it recognizes,

00:59:12.666 --> 00:59:14.706
things like movies
and restaurants.

00:59:14.706 --> 00:59:16.516
With one tap, you can
get more information.

00:59:16.926 --> 00:59:20.136
And Siri now-- the
QuickType keyboard supports

00:59:20.136 --> 00:59:21.826
multilingual typing.

00:59:22.136 --> 00:59:24.146
So, if you like typing
alternating maybe

00:59:24.146 --> 00:59:26.766
between English and
Spanish or Italian,

00:59:27.226 --> 00:59:28.556
you don't have to
switch keyboards.

00:59:29.356 --> 00:59:30.956
QuickType can follow
you automatically.

00:59:31.516 --> 00:59:33.666
[ Applause ]

00:59:34.166 --> 00:59:35.036
So, that's QuickType.

00:59:35.546 --> 00:59:38.596
Next, number four is photos.

00:59:39.126 --> 00:59:42.586
Now, we love capturing
so much of our lives

00:59:42.716 --> 00:59:45.746
on our cameras with--
on our iPhones.

00:59:45.786 --> 00:59:46.716
They're so great.

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:49.886
And with iCloud Photo Library,
we have those photos with us

00:59:49.916 --> 00:59:51.756
across all of our devices.

00:59:52.206 --> 00:59:55.456
Well, we wanted to give you
easier ways, of course, to find

00:59:55.456 --> 00:59:57.276
and experience the
photos that you've taken.

00:59:57.646 --> 00:59:59.726
And one of those is with places.

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:03.436
So now, we let you see all
of your photos on a map.

01:00:03.586 --> 01:00:05.946
It's a great way to
relive a trip for instance.

01:00:06.326 --> 01:00:09.536
But the big news in photos
this year is advanced

01:00:09.536 --> 01:00:10.386
computer vision.

01:00:10.896 --> 01:00:13.436
We're applying advanced
deep learning techniques

01:00:13.436 --> 01:00:17.006
to bring facial recognition
to the iPhone

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:20.266
and it's all done locally
on device taking advantage

01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:22.086
of the power of the
advanced silicon

01:00:22.446 --> 01:00:24.416
in all of our iOS devices.

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:27.756
You can get all of your most
important people automatically

01:00:27.756 --> 01:00:32.506
built in the people albums for
you automatically and all done

01:00:32.616 --> 01:00:33.986
with your privacy protected.

01:00:34.296 --> 01:00:36.576
Now, we're applying the
same kind of technology

01:00:36.576 --> 01:00:40.886
with deep learning to object
and scene recognition as well.

01:00:40.886 --> 01:00:45.046
In fact, we do 11 billion
computations per photo

01:00:45.366 --> 01:00:47.446
to be able to detect
things like there's a horse,

01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:49.286
there's water, there's
a mountain.

01:00:49.356 --> 01:00:52.346
And with this, you can do
really powerful searching

01:00:52.696 --> 01:00:53.666
on your device.

01:00:55.106 --> 01:00:57.746
But, you know, sometimes,
the magic in experiencing

01:00:57.746 --> 01:01:00.326
in your photos isn't just
about finding the photo

01:01:00.326 --> 01:01:01.746
that you know you're
looking for,

01:01:01.826 --> 01:01:04.796
it's about being reminded
serendipitously of a memory

01:01:04.796 --> 01:01:05.946
that would be so special.

01:01:05.946 --> 01:01:09.216
And so now, we're using
advanced artificial intelligence

01:01:09.516 --> 01:01:13.436
to analyze across your entire
photo library, all done locally

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:17.446
on device, to cluster together
photos and relate them based

01:01:17.446 --> 01:01:20.706
on location, the people
involved, the scenes.

01:01:21.106 --> 01:01:22.796
And out of this, be
able to surface memories

01:01:22.796 --> 01:01:25.076
that would be most relevant
to you at any given moment.

01:01:25.626 --> 01:01:28.396
We can bring forward
things like trips.

01:01:28.396 --> 01:01:30.576
We can spot trips that
might be important to you.

01:01:31.006 --> 01:01:33.516
We can figure out that you
might want to see photos

01:01:33.516 --> 01:01:36.696
of a highlight reel of the
last weekend or the last year

01:01:36.696 --> 01:01:38.426
and offer those to you
at just the right time.

01:01:39.466 --> 01:01:42.966
We can bring forward memories
of people that are special

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:44.316
to you or groups of people.

01:01:45.036 --> 01:01:48.386
And topics, special photos
you took, for instance,

01:01:48.386 --> 01:01:51.056
when you're on the water, at
the beach, at the mountains,

01:01:51.056 --> 01:01:53.976
these can make wonderful
memories to survey over time.

01:01:54.486 --> 01:01:57.096
But most important,
we pull these together

01:01:57.386 --> 01:02:01.666
into an intuitive user interface
that makes these so engaging.

01:02:02.526 --> 01:02:05.116
And I'd like to show
you that experience now.

01:02:06.516 --> 01:02:11.576
[ Applause ]

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:14.016
So let's take a look at photos.

01:02:14.016 --> 01:02:17.306
So we see there's a photo
album here of a family.

01:02:17.306 --> 01:02:18.006
But what you'll notice

01:02:18.006 --> 01:02:20.866
at the bottom is this
new tab called Memories.

01:02:21.096 --> 01:02:21.686
Let's take a look.

01:02:21.686 --> 01:02:24.906
So we can see here, there
are number of memories

01:02:24.906 --> 01:02:27.466
that have been offered up
into this memory speed.

01:02:27.466 --> 01:02:28.936
And at the top, there's
a vacation

01:02:28.936 --> 01:02:29.896
that the system has spotted

01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:32.276
where the family took
a trip to Tahoe City.

01:02:32.636 --> 01:02:34.256
Let's dive in and take
a look at a memory.

01:02:35.566 --> 01:02:38.006
Now you see there's actually
a movie up at the top,

01:02:38.006 --> 01:02:39.296
we'll talk more about
that later.

01:02:39.296 --> 01:02:42.146
And down below, there's
this beautiful layout

01:02:42.146 --> 01:02:43.736
of highlights of the photos.

01:02:43.736 --> 01:02:46.916
Now, I can tap Show All
and actually see a grid

01:02:46.916 --> 01:02:48.186
of every photo that was taken.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:50.856
But you can see how the
summary intelligently draws

01:02:50.856 --> 01:02:54.056
out the most special
photos into these highlights

01:02:54.056 --> 01:02:55.506
that are really great to browse.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:58.816
Now, if we go further down, we
see that it's actually pulled

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:02.356
up a set of people that are in
the photo, the family, grandma

01:03:02.356 --> 01:03:03.576
and grandpa and the uncle.

01:03:03.576 --> 01:03:06.596
And a map of the location where
all of those photos were taken.

01:03:07.256 --> 01:03:08.986
And down here at the bottom,

01:03:09.146 --> 01:03:11.256
we have related other
memories I might want

01:03:11.256 --> 01:03:12.266
to see related to this one.

01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:13.306
And it's really smart.

01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:18.026
So you see that the Santa Cruz
and Fourth of July memories,

01:03:18.216 --> 01:03:20.176
where grandma and grandpa
were both on the trip

01:03:20.176 --> 01:03:21.386
into Tahoe City and in these.

01:03:21.386 --> 01:03:22.716
So those are offered
up as related.

01:03:23.076 --> 01:03:25.076
And this Tahoe City trip
was an outdoor vacation,

01:03:25.076 --> 01:03:26.866
so it would offered up
another one like Alaska.

01:03:27.396 --> 01:03:30.116
And you can see, there's
another time the family was also

01:03:30.116 --> 01:03:32.126
at Tahoe City, but this
time in the winter.

01:03:32.126 --> 01:03:34.676
And I'm going to jump in
to that related memory.

01:03:34.716 --> 01:03:38.396
And you see once again, we have
photos and videos at the bottom.

01:03:38.396 --> 01:03:41.606
But I want to highlight the
movie up here at the top.

01:03:41.806 --> 01:03:44.826
You know, we all take so
many pictures and movies

01:03:44.826 --> 01:03:47.036
and we never go back to
actually assemble them

01:03:47.036 --> 01:03:48.436
into something we'd
want to watch.

01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:52.326
But, now our iPhone can do
that for us automatically.

01:03:52.326 --> 01:03:55.016
Let's see what the iPhone
has created for this memory.

01:03:56.516 --> 01:04:26.976
[ Music ]

01:04:27.476 --> 01:04:28.476
So, isn't that great?

01:04:29.516 --> 01:04:33.786
[ Applause ]

01:04:34.286 --> 01:04:36.496
The advanced computer vision

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:39.896
of the Photos App is now doing
analysis of just the right parts

01:04:39.896 --> 01:04:42.386
of the video to include
the right photos

01:04:42.386 --> 01:04:45.066
and it's editing them
together with the right mood

01:04:45.066 --> 01:04:46.426
and with the right music.

01:04:46.426 --> 01:04:48.626
Now, when you have
a memory like this,

01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:49.736
you often want to share it.

01:04:49.736 --> 01:04:51.696
And sometimes, you might want
to make it a little shorter say

01:04:51.696 --> 01:04:54.556
for sharing, so I can just
use this slider at the bottom

01:04:54.556 --> 01:04:55.926
and say, I'd like
it to be shorter.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.376
And maybe I want to change
the mood a little it.

01:04:58.376 --> 01:05:00.666
You notice there's a mood
slider just up above there

01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:02.396
and that was a pretty
great snowball fight.

01:05:02.396 --> 01:05:03.426
So I'll pick epic.

01:05:03.426 --> 01:05:05.406
And based on these changes,

01:05:05.436 --> 01:05:09.326
it's going to completely
re-edit the movie to new music.

01:05:09.376 --> 01:05:10.386
Let's take a look.

01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:25.836
[ Music ]

01:05:26.336 --> 01:05:27.066
That's pretty epic.

01:05:28.516 --> 01:05:32.616
[ Applause ]

01:05:33.116 --> 01:05:36.626
And that's a quick look
at memories in iOS 10.

01:05:36.696 --> 01:05:39.116
It's really fantastic
on your iPhone

01:05:39.116 --> 01:05:41.866
and it's great on
your iPad as well.

01:05:41.866 --> 01:05:44.916
And Mac gets many of these
new features as well.

01:05:45.156 --> 01:05:47.626
The great new face
recognition engine,

01:05:47.906 --> 01:05:51.166
scene and object recognition
search and the ability

01:05:51.166 --> 01:05:54.486
to browse photo and video
galleries of your memories

01:05:55.066 --> 01:05:57.296
and the Apple TV is
just such a great way

01:05:57.296 --> 01:05:59.226
to experience those
memory movies

01:05:59.506 --> 01:06:01.176
on the biggest screen
in your house.

01:06:01.676 --> 01:06:03.506
So that is Photos.

01:06:03.966 --> 01:06:07.926
Now next, I want to talk
about the big news in all

01:06:07.926 --> 01:06:09.636
of our biggest services
here at Apple.

01:06:09.636 --> 01:06:11.906
And to do that, I'm going
to bring up for number five,

01:06:12.066 --> 01:06:14.756
six and seven, Eddy
Cue, back to the stage.

01:06:14.756 --> 01:06:14.866

01:06:17.936 --> 01:06:19.146
>> Thank you, Craig.

01:06:21.256 --> 01:06:22.406
I love the new Photos.

01:06:22.406 --> 01:06:23.966
Can't wait to do it.

01:06:24.516 --> 01:06:26.646
So, let's talk-- Let's
get started with Maps.

01:06:26.756 --> 01:06:29.036
Now last year, we
introduced Nearby,

01:06:29.036 --> 01:06:31.726
a great way to find
places and transit

01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:33.306
with an incredible amount

01:06:33.306 --> 01:06:35.086
of detail including
all the entrances

01:06:35.086 --> 01:06:36.736
and exits from every station.

01:06:37.386 --> 01:06:40.336
But for iOS 10, we've got
an all new design for Maps.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:43.606
It starts with making it
easy to access controls

01:06:43.606 --> 01:06:45.286
and details on locations.

01:06:45.866 --> 01:06:48.556
And we're making Maps do
more for you in advance.

01:06:48.686 --> 01:06:49.756
It's more proactive.

01:06:50.396 --> 01:06:53.436
So you slide up from the
bottom and you can suggestions.

01:06:53.886 --> 01:06:57.836
Maps knows that usually, at
this time, I usually go to work,

01:06:57.836 --> 01:07:00.646
or it can look at a calendar

For example, let's take a
look at restaurants nearby.

But we're in San Francisco,
I feel like seafood.

to follow and control and we
even include traffic on route.

will automatically zoom in

along straight away,

01:07:40.516 --> 01:07:42.306
it willl automatically
zoom back out.

01:07:42.306 --> 01:07:45.836

see on your route where food

will tell you how much longer it

Maps will proactively
give you alternate routes

much time it'll save.

you can enable all new
capabilities in Maps.

01:08:46.576 --> 01:08:50.145
For example, you can make a
reservation using a popular app

01:08:50.145 --> 01:08:51.265
like OpenTable.

01:08:51.526 --> 01:08:55.106
You pick the number of people,
the time right inside of Maps.

you tap on directions and now,

request a car, I can pay for it

01:16:05.806 --> 01:16:08.566
Now when I want to
listen to nonstop music,

01:16:08.566 --> 01:16:11.676
I can go to view all
stations and listen

01:16:11.676 --> 01:16:14.336
to genre-based stations
like Pure Pop because I

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:16.346
like to listen to pop music
all day long, why not?

01:16:17.126 --> 01:16:19.976
But I think since we're
coming to the end here,

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:22.116
I would like to do something
a little bit different

01:16:22.116 --> 01:16:24.076
and play something
for the world, right?

01:16:24.506 --> 01:16:25.546
So let's play some real hits.

01:16:25.546 --> 01:16:27.246
Let's see what we've got.

01:16:27.246 --> 01:16:31.136
[Background Music] Now that
sounds like the beginning

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:34.206
of some good Ghanaian
highlife music.

01:16:34.206 --> 01:16:35.226
All right guys.

01:16:35.226 --> 01:16:36.756
Basically, it's all
new Apply Music.

01:16:36.756 --> 01:16:37.716
I hope you enjoyed it.

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:38.616
Thank you.

01:16:39.516 --> 01:16:47.376
[ Applause and Music ]

01:16:47.876 --> 01:16:49.096
>> Wow, wow, wow.

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:50.066
Thank you Boz.

01:16:51.056 --> 01:16:52.526
That's the all new Apple Music.

01:16:52.526 --> 01:16:56.576
It is incredible on your
iPhone, iPad, your Mac and PC.

01:16:56.576 --> 01:17:00.756
Your Apple TV and Android
too and that is Music.

01:17:01.836 --> 01:17:04.126
Number seven, let's
talk about news.

01:17:04.606 --> 01:17:06.796
And last fall, we
introduced Apple News

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:08.106
to bring you the best stories

01:17:08.246 --> 01:17:11.746
from the best publishers
all personalized for you.

01:17:12.056 --> 01:17:14.476
And we introduce it with a
great set of publications,

01:17:14.476 --> 01:17:16.176
but we've got a lot more.

01:17:16.526 --> 01:17:20.046
We now have over 2,000
publications in Apple News

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:22.136
and our readers are loving it.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:26.836
In fact, we have over 60 million
monthly users reading in news

01:17:27.316 --> 01:17:29.976
and with iOS 10, we've
got some big changes.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.466
It starts with an
all new design.

01:17:33.276 --> 01:17:34.236
Here's what it looks like.

01:17:35.356 --> 01:17:38.486
We've taken all of the stories
in For You and broken them

01:17:38.486 --> 01:17:42.436
up into clear sections which
make them easier to follow.

01:17:42.626 --> 01:17:43.636
Here's Top Stories.

01:17:44.976 --> 01:17:47.226
Here's Trending where you can
see the most popular stories

01:17:47.226 --> 01:17:47.836
right now.

01:17:49.076 --> 01:17:51.216
All of the topics you
follow like sports

01:17:52.206 --> 01:17:54.726
and news is even smart
enough to create new topics

01:17:54.726 --> 01:17:56.526
for you based on what you read.

01:17:56.796 --> 01:17:58.626
Here's one for me
on Formula 1 racing.

01:17:59.926 --> 01:18:02.286
And you're going to love
our Featured Stories

01:18:02.286 --> 01:18:04.816
where our editors
handpick the best stories.

01:18:04.816 --> 01:18:08.746
But we wanted the news to be
the place where you read all

01:18:08.746 --> 01:18:10.796
of the stories from your
favorite publications

01:18:11.246 --> 01:18:12.976
and that's why we're
introducing Subscriptions.

01:18:13.516 --> 01:18:16.176
[ Applause ]

01:18:16.676 --> 01:18:19.916
So now, you can read every
article from magazines

01:18:19.916 --> 01:18:21.506
like National Geographic,
newspaper--

01:18:21.506 --> 01:18:26.596
newspapers like the Wall Street
Journal right inside of news.

01:18:26.946 --> 01:18:28.516
And in addition to
subscriptions,

01:18:28.516 --> 01:18:30.896
we're bringing breaking
news notifications.

01:18:31.236 --> 01:18:33.576
And so now, you get the most
important stories delivered

01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:34.796
right to your lock screen.

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.846
That is our big update for News,

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:39.736

back to Craig now.

01:18:52.666 --> 01:18:53.226
>> Thank you, Eddy.

01:18:53.226 --> 01:18:56.816
It's just some fantastic
new designs.

01:18:56.976 --> 01:19:00.216
Now, on to number
eight and it's HomeKit.

01:19:00.716 --> 01:19:03.316
You know, before we announce
HomeKit two years ago,

01:19:03.316 --> 01:19:06.896
the home accessory space
was a mess of incompatible

01:19:06.896 --> 01:19:10.496
and insecure protocols and
accessories that required you

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:13.526
to download a separate app
that you needed to learn just

01:19:13.526 --> 01:19:16.276
to control each individual
accessory.

01:19:16.306 --> 01:19:19.456
But with HomeKit, we've
been changing all that.

01:19:19.516 --> 01:19:22.336
We're making sure that your
home automation products work

01:19:22.336 --> 01:19:25.246
together easily and securely.

01:19:25.526 --> 01:19:27.726
And this year, we've
rounded out the set

01:19:27.726 --> 01:19:29.926
of accessory types
supported by HomeKit

01:19:29.926 --> 01:19:31.906
to include important
new categories

01:19:32.316 --> 01:19:34.526
like cameras and door locks.

01:19:34.906 --> 01:19:38.406
And in fact, essentially
every major maker

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:40.756
of home accessories has shipping

01:19:40.756 --> 01:19:42.976
or has announced
support for HomeKit.

01:19:42.976 --> 01:19:46.216
And home builders are
getting on board as well.

01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:49.536
Some of the biggest builders
of homes here in United States

01:19:49.726 --> 01:19:51.796
and in China are now
building new homes

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.456
with HomeKit built right in.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:55.886
So you can move in and just
start controlling your home.

01:19:55.886 --> 01:20:01.096
But you know, this year,
we're taking the next big step

01:20:02.056 --> 01:20:04.736
for HomeKit and iOS in the home.

01:20:05.346 --> 01:20:07.986
We're building on
the HomeKit framework

01:20:09.126 --> 01:20:11.916
with a great new app
what we call Home.

01:20:12.356 --> 01:20:13.866
It's right on your
iOS home screen.

01:20:14.516 --> 01:20:17.376
[ Applause ]

01:20:17.876 --> 01:20:20.456
Now when you launch
the Home app,

01:20:20.456 --> 01:20:23.406
you get to see your own
personalized wallpaper

01:20:23.406 --> 01:20:25.506
and all of your accessories.

01:20:25.506 --> 01:20:26.736
No matter who are
they're made by

01:20:26.966 --> 01:20:28.406
and you can control
them so easily.

01:20:28.406 --> 01:20:30.426
If you want to turn on the
light, of course, just tap it.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:34.006
If you want to adjust the
dimmer, we'll just press

01:20:34.006 --> 01:20:35.906
in a little harder and slide

01:20:35.906 --> 01:20:38.096
and you can adjust the
dimmer just like that.

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:41.106
So you can tap, tap, tap
across all the accessories

01:20:41.106 --> 01:20:42.676
in your home, but sometimes,

01:20:42.846 --> 01:20:44.926
you'd like to trigger a
change to all of them.

01:20:44.926 --> 01:20:46.686
And for that, we have
something we call Scenes.

01:20:47.096 --> 01:20:49.886
So for instance, if you
want to get ready for bed,

01:20:49.936 --> 01:20:52.906
you can tap Good Night.

01:20:52.906 --> 01:20:54.846
You'll see they'll close
the living room shades,

01:20:54.926 --> 01:20:58.416
lock the front door, adjust the
thermostat, all in one step.

01:20:59.036 --> 01:21:01.556
Now Siri knows how to
interact with Scenes as well.

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:04.216
So in the morning, you
say good morning to Siri.

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:08.716
Well Siri can automatically
get your home all ready for you

01:21:08.716 --> 01:21:12.106
for the day and you can also
control your accessories

01:21:12.106 --> 01:21:13.566
without launching an app at all

01:21:13.566 --> 01:21:15.906
because HomeKit is
actually built right

01:21:15.906 --> 01:21:16.996
in to control center.

01:21:17.216 --> 01:21:19.526
Swipe up control
center, you can swipe

01:21:19.526 --> 01:21:22.686
over to see your home
controls and which is to tap,

01:21:22.686 --> 01:21:25.496
for instance, open
up your garage door.

01:21:26.146 --> 01:21:27.936
Now, HomeKit takes advantage

01:21:28.036 --> 01:21:30.036
of our interactive
notifications as well.

01:21:30.036 --> 01:21:32.946
So if someone rings the doorbell
for instance, you can tap in

01:21:33.006 --> 01:21:35.856
and actually get a live feed
of your front door camera,

01:21:36.506 --> 01:21:38.226
talk to them on the
Intercom if you want

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.816
and even unlock the door,

01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:42.556
all right from the lock
screen of your iPhone.

01:21:43.366 --> 01:21:44.576
Now, yeah.

[ Applause ]

01:21:50.486 --> 01:21:53.176
Now since your Apple TV is
always on, always plugged in,

01:21:53.176 --> 01:21:55.506
and always on the network
in your home, it can serve

01:21:55.636 --> 01:21:57.716
as a secure point
for remote access

01:21:57.716 --> 01:21:59.566
and automation within your home.

01:22:00.066 --> 01:22:02.896
So when you're on the go,
you can actually access all

01:22:02.896 --> 01:22:05.786
of your accessories,
securely end to end encrypted

01:22:05.786 --> 01:22:09.256
and you can setup automation
like Geofences so that

01:22:09.256 --> 01:22:11.606
when you roll into your
driveway, you can make sure

01:22:11.606 --> 01:22:14.456
that the garage door will
open, the lights will turn on

01:22:14.456 --> 01:22:16.356
and maybe even the hot tub
will start up in the back

01:22:16.416 --> 01:22:17.876
for you, all automatically.

01:22:22.106 --> 01:22:24.336
Now, the Home app is
great on the iPhone.

01:22:24.336 --> 01:22:26.546
It's also fantastic
on the iPad as well.

01:22:26.546 --> 01:22:27.846
So many people like
using the iPad

01:22:27.846 --> 01:22:30.656
as the ultimate home control
device whether they're mounted

01:22:30.656 --> 01:22:32.606
on the wall or on
the coffee table.

01:22:32.606 --> 01:22:35.786
And of course, there's
nothing beating the remote

01:22:35.786 --> 01:22:37.896
that you always have with
you right on your wrist,

01:22:37.896 --> 01:22:39.166
the Apple Watch, it comes

01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:41.776
with built-in home
control support as well.

01:22:42.336 --> 01:22:44.626

update on Home.

01:22:45.206 --> 01:22:46.816

You know, we all
receive a lot of calls,

01:22:56.566 --> 01:22:58.746
but we want to make sure that
when you miss their calls,

01:22:58.746 --> 01:23:00.746
you have the best
experience possible.

01:23:01.016 --> 01:23:04.936

get voice mail transcription

01:23:05.286 --> 01:23:07.896

get to see what was it's

01:23:07.896 --> 01:23:08.906

like this and we wonder
what the heck it's about.

And unfortunately, in China,
this can be a real problem

01:23:19.986 --> 01:23:22.056
where there's a lot
of voice mail spam.

01:23:22.566 --> 01:23:24.616
So now, we're supporting
an extension API

01:23:24.996 --> 01:23:28.666
where third parties like
Tencent can provide information

01:23:28.666 --> 01:23:31.746
automatically to tell you
a possible phone spam.

01:23:31.866 --> 01:23:33.586

is something like this

when you receive a call,

01:23:48.666 --> 01:23:50.226
a notification on
your lock screen.

01:23:50.746 --> 01:23:54.296
Well now in iOS 10, we
have a great new VoIP API,

01:23:54.296 --> 01:23:55.766
that means you're experience

01:23:55.766 --> 01:23:58.516

instead can be like this.

VoIP apps can now integrate
into the lock screen.

They're integrated in
your phone Recents.

01:24:10.606 --> 01:24:11.916
They're in your phone Favorites.

01:24:12.226 --> 01:24:14.496
And your contact card
has been enhanced,

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:17.056
so it remembers how you
like to call each person

01:24:17.056 --> 01:24:19.696
and you can access them
that way with just a tap.

01:24:21.116 --> 01:24:23.926
So we've been working
with our partner Cisco

01:24:24.326 --> 01:24:27.656
on elevating mobility
in the enterprise.

01:24:27.876 --> 01:24:30.666
And now using our
VoiP API combined

01:24:30.846 --> 01:24:34.116
with their Cisco Spark
app, it's never been easier

01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:36.726
to use your iPhone with
work because in addition

01:24:36.726 --> 01:24:40.196
to receiving calls made to
your personal cell number,

01:24:40.526 --> 01:24:43.376
you also can receive calls
made to your work number right

01:24:43.376 --> 01:24:46.676
from your iPhone whether you're
at your desk or on the go.

01:24:46.676 --> 01:24:49.386

01:25:05.316 --> 01:25:07.176
and people love sharing things

01:25:07.176 --> 01:25:09.666
with Messages whether
it's photos or links

01:25:09.726 --> 01:25:12.256
to their favorite websites,
but they look like this

01:25:12.336 --> 01:25:14.886
but not any longer because
now we have rich links.

01:25:15.296 --> 01:25:18.316
So when you share links, you
get artwork from the website,

01:25:18.936 --> 01:25:20.606
extracted titles,
it's really great.

01:25:21.236 --> 01:25:23.806
And it's especially awesome when
you get to share with things

01:25:23.806 --> 01:25:25.656
like video because
they can play right

01:25:25.656 --> 01:25:28.236
in line inside the transcript.

01:25:29.526 --> 01:25:30.496
Look at that guy go.

01:25:32.046 --> 01:25:35.816
Now, of course, we love
using our camera to share

01:25:35.816 --> 01:25:39.426
and we've made the camera
better than ever in Messages.

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:40.736
Now when you bring
up the camera,

01:25:41.166 --> 01:25:43.406
you immediately see what's
right in front of your camera.

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.296
Like someone in marketing
thought, that's what someone

01:25:45.296 --> 01:25:46.746
who sees when they bring
up with their camera.

01:25:47.316 --> 01:25:49.316
[ Laughter ]

01:25:49.616 --> 01:25:54.016
And you can also slide
over and see your family.

01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:56.796
It's such an incongruous
set of images.

01:25:57.886 --> 01:26:02.926
So, you can tap those and insert
them right into your transcript.

01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:04.486
It's really convenient.

01:26:04.486 --> 01:26:06.516
Now people really love Emoji

01:26:06.966 --> 01:26:10.706
and now we made them
three times bigger

01:26:10.706 --> 01:26:12.976
in the transcript
which is fantastic.

01:26:13.516 --> 01:26:17.706

And to help you always
reach for the right emoji,

01:26:20.296 --> 01:26:22.706
we're providing emoji
predictions

01:26:22.706 --> 01:26:24.966
as you type, super handy.

01:26:26.766 --> 01:26:28.806
But, you know, sometimes
you've typed the whole message

01:26:28.806 --> 01:26:30.046
and you realize at the end,

01:26:30.046 --> 01:26:32.056
you're totally lacking
an emojification.

01:26:32.406 --> 01:26:34.416
And so we've provided
the solution.

01:26:34.416 --> 01:26:35.896
When you tap on the
emoji button,

01:26:36.266 --> 01:26:38.876
we'll highlight all the
emojifiable words here

01:26:39.146 --> 01:26:42.746
and you just tap, tap,
tap, tap and emojify.

01:26:43.516 --> 01:26:52.006
[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:26:52.506 --> 01:26:54.576
Children of tomorrow will
have no understanding

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:55.326
of the English language.

01:26:55.906 --> 01:27:02.066
So, these are some great
new features in Messages.

01:27:02.496 --> 01:27:04.856
But you know, we wanted to
do something more fundamental

01:27:04.856 --> 01:27:07.956
with messaging because today
no matter what you say,

01:27:08.976 --> 01:27:10.576
it's always the same bubble.

01:27:10.576 --> 01:27:14.856
It always-- this comes across
the same way, but no longer

01:27:15.446 --> 01:27:17.836
because now we have
Bubble effects.

01:27:18.136 --> 01:27:21.976
So if you want to say it
loud, you can say it loud.

01:27:22.796 --> 01:27:25.156
And if you want to
say it more gently,

01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:28.216
well now you can
do that as well.

01:27:30.786 --> 01:27:33.316
And, you know, sometimes
you want to get

01:27:33.316 --> 01:27:34.446
across something personal.

01:27:35.126 --> 01:27:37.766
An Invisible ink gives
you the way to do that.

01:27:38.176 --> 01:27:40.276
So you can just slide your
finger across the bubble

01:27:40.276 --> 01:27:44.856
and clear away the message like
that and it's a really great way

01:27:44.856 --> 01:27:47.316
to share a surprise,
a little scared

01:27:47.316 --> 01:27:48.246
to see what's behind that.

01:27:48.646 --> 01:27:51.736
You can just slide across.

01:27:53.796 --> 01:27:56.896
OK. Now--

01:27:57.516 --> 01:28:02.556
[ Applause ]

01:28:03.056 --> 01:28:05.186
So sometimes, you just like
to send a quick affirmation,

01:28:05.186 --> 01:28:07.276
a quick tap back
and now you can.

01:28:07.346 --> 01:28:09.206
Just tap and your thumbs

01:28:09.206 --> 01:28:11.096
up can go right there
in the transcript.

01:28:11.966 --> 01:28:13.626
But, you know, there's
nothing more personal

01:28:13.626 --> 01:28:15.326
than your own handwriting.

01:28:15.846 --> 01:28:18.486
And so now we support
Handwritten messages,

01:28:19.036 --> 01:28:20.426
like handwriting bubbles.

01:28:20.426 --> 01:28:21.696
And you see when
it comes across,

01:28:22.126 --> 01:28:25.626
the care there is the ink just
settles in to the transcript.

01:28:25.626 --> 01:28:26.636
It's really beautiful.

01:28:26.636 --> 01:28:29.366
And, of course, we support
digital touch as well.

01:28:29.366 --> 01:28:31.636
So you can send these
very lively sketches,

01:28:31.676 --> 01:28:36.016
but also with video, photos,
even things like your heartbeat.

01:28:37.046 --> 01:28:40.356
And sometimes, what you say
really deserves using the

01:28:40.416 --> 01:28:41.356
whole screen.

01:28:41.556 --> 01:28:44.306

do that as well.

all of this possible

01:28:54.226 --> 01:28:56.756
in Messages has been
a huge effort,

01:28:56.846 --> 01:28:59.486
cross functional
effort across Apple.

01:28:59.536 --> 01:29:03.666
And so for our demo today, I
wanted to bring up some leads

01:29:03.666 --> 01:29:05.256
from both our engineering team

01:29:05.536 --> 01:29:09.166
and our human interface
design team to give a demo.

01:29:09.326 --> 01:29:11.976
So let's give a warm
welcome to Bethany and Emron.

We are so thrilled
to finally be able

01:29:23.586 --> 01:29:25.136
to show you what
we've working on.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:28.156
Now Emron and I are going to
show you the different ways

01:29:28.156 --> 01:29:31.006
that we use messages, but
I'm going to kick things off

01:29:31.106 --> 01:29:33.926
by jumping first into a
thread with my sister Lori

01:29:34.096 --> 01:29:35.696
who just got to a graduation.

01:29:35.806 --> 01:29:40.046
So let's write her back
and say give her my love

01:29:40.736 --> 01:29:45.326
and tell her I said
happy graduation day.

01:29:46.466 --> 01:29:48.176
OK. Now typically, I would hunt

01:29:48.176 --> 01:29:50.536
for the perfect emoji
to tack on the end.

01:29:50.626 --> 01:29:53.576
But now, when I tap on
the emoji button to switch

01:29:53.576 --> 01:29:56.856
to the emoji keyboard,
words throughout my message

01:29:56.856 --> 01:29:59.376
that can be swap for emoji
or automatically highlighted

01:29:59.376 --> 01:30:00.936
and all I have to do
is tap to replace them.

01:30:01.126 --> 01:30:04.266
So I'm going to tap to
replace love and I'm going

01:30:04.266 --> 01:30:05.996
to choose the type of
hearts I want to send.

01:30:06.496 --> 01:30:08.546
I'm going to do bedazzled
I think.

01:30:08.546 --> 01:30:10.716
And I can tap on happy
and I choose how happy

01:30:10.716 --> 01:30:12.526
and I choose how
happy I want to be.

01:30:12.526 --> 01:30:13.096
What do you think?

the upside down one.

>> -- yeah.

>> Hey, you be you
Bethany, you be you.

>> I'm going to do eyes
closed kind of happy and I tap

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:27.696
on graduation and then
switches to the cap

which there is no chance,
I would have found that.

been here for days.

ahead and send that off.

digital touch video and what's

01:30:41.786 --> 01:30:43.186
so awesome about this is

01:30:43.186 --> 01:30:46.866
that she created this entire
thing using digital touch right

01:30:52.376 --> 01:30:54.756
to let her know how I feel
about it, using tap X,

01:30:55.486 --> 01:30:57.126
which is as easy
as double tapping

01:30:57.636 --> 01:30:58.626
and sending back a heart.

It's that quick and
that fun and honestly,

it is my favorite way
to communicate now.

01:31:05.066 --> 01:31:07.406
So Lori says she can't
wait to see me this summer

01:31:07.526 --> 01:31:08.806
and I feel the same way.

01:31:08.876 --> 01:31:11.156
So I'm going to let her know,
I'm going to say, "Me too."

01:31:11.906 --> 01:31:13.936
And I'm going to send this
using a bubble effect.

01:31:14.546 --> 01:31:16.506
So I just press and
hold on the send button.

let her know how I'm feeling.

01:31:20.116 --> 01:31:25.216

little sarcastic I think.

felt it, that's for sure.

do you think, what color?

01:34:09.916 --> 01:34:09.983
>> Yeah.

01:34:15.766 --> 01:34:17.096
OK, so there we go.

01:34:17.176 --> 01:34:19.456
>> You know what, our
friends are always late

01:34:19.456 --> 01:34:20.356
to the game, they really are.

01:34:20.356 --> 01:34:21.076
>> Yeah, that's true.

01:34:21.076 --> 01:34:22.396
It's true.

01:34:22.446 --> 01:34:24.896
>> OK, looks like they're
playing in San Francisco

01:34:24.896 --> 01:34:28.256
and as you might expect with
a band like that, sold out.

01:34:28.426 --> 01:34:31.156
Now Bethany sent over an
affect with invisible ink,

01:34:31.426 --> 01:34:33.276
this is fantastic
for when you want

01:34:33.276 --> 01:34:34.346
to keep something a surprise

01:34:34.346 --> 01:34:36.406
which it looks like
you may have.

01:34:36.756 --> 01:34:38.496
So now, to reveal
all the contents,

01:34:38.496 --> 01:34:40.036
all I have to do
is use my finger

01:34:40.036 --> 01:34:41.746
to swipe away the particles.

01:34:42.016 --> 01:34:44.126
Let's have a look.

01:34:44.296 --> 01:34:45.976
Oh, Bethany, you got us tickets.

01:34:46.046 --> 01:34:46.546
>> You know.

01:34:47.596 --> 01:34:48.886
>> Always coming through.

01:34:48.886 --> 01:34:51.376
Always coming through, it seems
like everyone else agrees,

01:34:51.376 --> 01:34:53.326
I'm going to show
my appreciation

01:34:53.326 --> 01:34:56.856
by sending some big emoji here,
make sure I put myself in there.

01:34:57.471 --> 01:34:59.471
[ Laughter ]

01:34:59.926 --> 01:35:02.576
And to close things
off, let's do this

01:35:02.576 --> 01:35:04.006
with a full screen effect.

01:35:04.586 --> 01:35:07.436
We got some lovely ones
here like lovely balloons.

01:35:08.156 --> 01:35:11.076
Let's swipe over to confetti.

01:35:12.026 --> 01:35:14.976
Then I'm going to
go with this one.

[ Music and Applause ]

you to try it.

01:35:37.016 --> 01:35:38.546
It's just incredible work.

01:35:39.126 --> 01:35:42.216
Well, so those are some
highlights from Messages,

01:35:43.096 --> 01:35:45.356
but you know, we thought when
it comes to expressing yourself

01:35:45.356 --> 01:35:48.606
that there was so much more
we could do if we could tap

01:35:48.606 --> 01:35:52.246
in to all of the creativity
of all of you developers,

01:35:52.846 --> 01:35:55.326
and so we're opening up
Messages to developers

01:35:55.326 --> 01:35:56.916
as well with iMessage apps.

01:35:59.516 --> 01:36:02.506
[ Applause ]

01:36:03.006 --> 01:36:07.026
With the iMessage apps, iMessage
has an app drawer with all

01:36:07.026 --> 01:36:09.996
of your iMessage apps, you
can tap the plus and get

01:36:09.996 --> 01:36:12.186
to the App Store
and find other apps.

01:36:12.416 --> 01:36:13.356
You download them, of course.

01:36:13.696 --> 01:36:14.716
They're here in your drawer.

01:36:14.716 --> 01:36:17.166
And there's so many different
kinds of apps you can create.

01:36:17.636 --> 01:36:21.196
From things like stickers,
an artist can create stickers

01:36:21.196 --> 01:36:23.216
as well without even
writing any code.

01:36:23.456 --> 01:36:26.166
But for developers who do want
to write code, they have access

01:36:26.166 --> 01:36:30.206
to the full iOS SDK including
access to the camera,

01:36:30.516 --> 01:36:34.266
so you can incredible animated
effects with apps like JibJab.

01:36:34.596 --> 01:36:37.796
You can accomplish more
sophisticated tasks as well

01:36:37.796 --> 01:36:39.766
like payment with
Square Cash, allowing you

01:36:39.766 --> 01:36:42.256
to pay someone right
through the messages thread.

01:36:42.466 --> 01:36:43.966
They can receive
it and redeem it

01:36:44.516 --> 01:36:47.336
on the receiving end
right inside of Messages.

01:36:47.846 --> 01:36:50.736
There's so much you can
do with iMessage apps.

01:36:50.736 --> 01:36:52.316
I'd like to show you a couple

01:36:52.316 --> 01:36:54.326
of the possibilities
in a demo right now.

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:55.556
Let's take a look.

[ Applause ]

01:37:01.016 --> 01:37:03.636
So let's dive here
into a conversation.

01:37:04.016 --> 01:37:06.386
See here is a thread
with the family.

01:37:06.386 --> 01:37:09.096
Now I can respond
with text of course,

01:37:09.096 --> 01:37:12.386
but now with iMessage apps, I
can just bring up my app drawer

01:37:12.386 --> 01:37:14.226
and I can get to all

01:37:14.226 --> 01:37:16.926
of my different iMessage apps
including some great stickers.

01:37:17.426 --> 01:37:19.206
So let me dive into
these Mickey stickers.

01:37:19.636 --> 01:37:21.306
We can see that they're
all animated.

01:37:21.636 --> 01:37:24.186
I can actually look
through them like this.

01:37:24.186 --> 01:37:28.666
I can swipe between my stickers,
so maybe some from "Inside Out".

01:37:29.536 --> 01:37:30.866
Here some from "Finding Dory".

01:37:30.866 --> 01:37:35.406
If I want to send one, just tap,
drop it right in just like that.

01:37:35.876 --> 01:37:37.466
It's really easy and
they're really fun.

01:37:38.506 --> 01:37:40.726
And now, here I received another
photo and the great thing

01:37:40.726 --> 01:37:43.946
about stickers is you can
actually peel them off

01:37:43.986 --> 01:37:45.356
and attach them to bubbles.

01:37:45.636 --> 01:37:46.946
So, you know, this one will cool

01:37:46.946 --> 01:37:48.756
if I could just take
the sun over here.

01:37:49.136 --> 01:37:50.996
Maybe put that up
there on the corner

01:37:51.386 --> 01:37:55.926
and then maybe a little
seal off here on the side.

01:37:56.736 --> 01:37:57.676
Just like that.

01:37:57.716 --> 01:37:59.926
It's really pretty cool what
you can do with these messages.

01:37:59.926 --> 01:38:02.136
Well, look, I got a
message from Brian here.

01:38:02.136 --> 01:38:02.896
Let's take a look at this.

01:38:02.896 --> 01:38:05.586
He says, "We're placing an order
for lunch after the keynote."

01:38:05.766 --> 01:38:08.806
And we can see he's doing that
actually with an iMessage app.

01:38:09.086 --> 01:38:12.116
So he's used DoorDash
and he's placing an order

01:38:12.116 --> 01:38:12.826
at Curry Up Now.

01:38:12.826 --> 01:38:15.896
So I can just tap in
and see what's going on.

01:38:15.896 --> 01:38:18.266
Now, there's a group cart
that we're all collaborating

01:38:18.266 --> 01:38:20.026
on through the iMessage apps.

01:38:20.026 --> 01:38:21.486
I'm going to look at that.

01:38:21.696 --> 01:38:24.986
Looks like Phil has
ordered the Naughty Naan

01:38:24.986 --> 01:38:26.616
and Jaws [assumed
spelling] has ordered,

01:38:26.616 --> 01:38:27.386
Brian's ordered as well.

01:38:27.386 --> 01:38:28.436
So I can put in my order.

01:38:28.436 --> 01:38:31.416
And I'm going to go for
this Deconstructed Samosa.

01:38:31.416 --> 01:38:32.356
That looks pretty good.

01:38:32.966 --> 01:38:35.796
And I'm sure Tim would
like one as well.

01:38:35.796 --> 01:38:37.986
And, well, it would be rude
if, you know, we ate in front

01:38:37.986 --> 01:38:39.476
of you guys without
getting you some.

01:38:39.476 --> 01:38:42.276
So we'll just up this
up a little bit here

01:38:43.026 --> 01:38:46.796
and we can just add that to
our, to our cart like this

01:38:46.796 --> 01:38:51.096
and then drop it,
write in the messages.

01:38:51.586 --> 01:38:54.766
And it's fortunate Brian
will be paying for this.

[ Applause ]

01:38:59.596 --> 01:39:01.226
So, a final thing
I'd like to show you

01:39:01.226 --> 01:39:05.886
with iMessage apps are these
really fun interactive kinds

01:39:05.886 --> 01:39:06.336
of apps.

01:39:06.656 --> 01:39:08.326
And one example is JibJab.

01:39:08.326 --> 01:39:10.306
So let's jump right
into JibJab here.

01:39:10.706 --> 01:39:12.876
We see there are a whole
bunch of fun things.

01:39:12.876 --> 01:39:15.356
You can scroll through and
see the options I can also

01:39:15.356 --> 01:39:18.096
of course select from
a gallery of faces.

01:39:18.436 --> 01:39:22.686
Let's pick Eddy maybe and,
you know, I can just drop him

01:39:22.686 --> 01:39:26.636
in to the transcript
just like that.

01:39:27.036 --> 01:39:29.156
And I think this gives
you the sense of the power

01:39:29.156 --> 01:39:31.336
of iMessage apps and iOS 10.

10 huge features in iOS 10.

But of course there is so
much more that we can't have--

talk about right now
but I can't help myself

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:05.486
but mention just a couple more
things like Notes collaboration.

with multiple people
in the same note.

so you can scroll from message

01:40:13.226 --> 01:40:16.306

on your iPhone and iPad.

than ever.

video image stabilization.

So they're buttery smooth and
they're editable now as well.

01:40:25.356 --> 01:40:29.026
And finally, split
view in Safari on iPad.

01:40:29.026 --> 01:40:33.326

by side in Safari on your iPad.

It's also a gigantic
release for our developers.

01:40:45.256 --> 01:40:46.046
When you think about it,

01:40:46.106 --> 01:40:49.186
experiences like the lock
screen with notifications.

01:40:49.456 --> 01:40:55.286
The phone, maps, messages,
every major area of iOS now open

01:40:55.286 --> 01:40:58.076
to developers and so
many other options.

01:40:58.506 --> 01:41:00.786
But, you know, all
of this great work

01:41:01.156 --> 01:41:04.576
in iOS 10 would be
meaningless to us if it came

01:41:04.576 --> 01:41:06.756
at the expense of your privacy.

01:41:07.936 --> 01:41:13.066
And so, in every feature that
we do, we carefully consider how

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:14.286
to protect your privacy.

01:41:14.916 --> 01:41:18.246
With apps like FaceTime
and Messages and HomeKit,

01:41:18.326 --> 01:41:23.096
we make sure to use end to end
encryption by default and always

01:41:23.296 --> 01:41:24.606
to protect your communication.

01:41:24.606 --> 01:41:29.166

advanced deep learning

and artificial intelligence
analysis of your data,

01:41:32.626 --> 01:41:35.176
we're doing it on device
using the incredible power

01:41:35.176 --> 01:41:37.316
of the silicon on your
iPhone and your Mac,

01:41:38.046 --> 01:41:41.176
keeping your personal
data under your control.

01:41:41.576 --> 01:41:44.496
And when you do do searches on
the internet maybe for a route

01:41:44.606 --> 01:41:47.976
and maps or a search for
information in Spotlight,

01:41:48.676 --> 01:41:50.696
we don't build any
user profiles.

01:41:51.826 --> 01:41:54.646
Now, of course one of
the important tools

01:41:54.646 --> 01:41:58.136
in making software more
intelligent is to spot patterns

01:41:58.136 --> 01:42:00.756
on how multiple users
are using their devices.

01:42:01.076 --> 01:42:03.736
For instance, you might want to
know what new words are trending

01:42:03.736 --> 01:42:07.516
so you could offer them up more
readily in a QuickType keyboard.

01:42:08.546 --> 01:42:12.196
Well, differential privacy is
a research topic in the area

01:42:12.196 --> 01:42:17.006
of statistics and data analytics
that uses hashing, subsampling

01:42:17.006 --> 01:42:19.106
and noise injection
to enable this kind

01:42:19.106 --> 01:42:22.626
of crowd-sourced learning
while keeping the information

01:42:22.626 --> 01:42:25.116
of each individual user
completely private.

quick peek at what we were doing

work as groundbreaking.

that incorporating
differential privacy broadly

Let's do it.

01:43:37.516 --> 01:44:22.546
[ Music ]

01:44:23.046 --> 01:44:25.726
And that is iOS 10.

01:44:26.516 --> 01:44:34.456
[ Cheering and Applause ]

01:44:34.956 --> 01:44:38.796
All of you developers get
the developer preview today.

01:44:38.796 --> 01:44:41.516
And again, we're doing
a public beta this July.

01:44:41.666 --> 01:44:44.536
Sign up now at beta.apple.com
and we'll let you know

01:44:44.566 --> 01:44:46.216
when you can download it.

01:44:46.416 --> 01:44:50.556
And iOS 10 will be available
to all of our users this fall

01:44:50.556 --> 01:44:54.556
as a free upgrade across
all of these devices.

01:44:55.126 --> 01:44:56.796
That is iOS.

01:44:57.486 --> 01:44:59.146
Now, I'd like to
hand it back to Tim.

01:44:59.256 --> 01:44:59.976
Thank you very much.

01:45:00.516 --> 01:45:07.366
[ Cheering and Applause ]

01:45:07.866 --> 01:45:09.016
>> Thanks, Craig.

01:45:09.016 --> 01:45:13.166
iOS 10 is fantastic and
it's an enormous release.

01:45:13.276 --> 01:45:16.316
I couldn't be more
proud and more excited

01:45:16.316 --> 01:45:17.766
about the incredible
advancements

01:45:17.766 --> 01:45:19.286
across all of our platforms.

01:45:20.196 --> 01:45:23.606
Now, as we said earlier,
an important part

01:45:23.606 --> 01:45:27.836
of making this platform so
capable is our developers.

01:45:28.626 --> 01:45:32.176
We believe it's crucial that
we provide the best tools

01:45:32.436 --> 01:45:33.986
so you can create the best apps.

01:45:34.986 --> 01:45:36.346
That's why we created Swift.

01:45:37.426 --> 01:45:40.356
Swift is a powerful and
intuitive programming language

01:45:40.616 --> 01:45:44.976
for iOS, Mac OS,
watchOS, and tvOS.

01:45:45.496 --> 01:45:50.276
And writing Swift code is fun
and interactive and apps written

01:45:50.276 --> 01:45:51.976
in it are lighting fast.

01:45:53.546 --> 01:45:56.836
Since we released Swift
less than two years ago,

01:45:57.776 --> 01:46:00.926
we've seen an amazing response
from the developer community.

01:46:01.656 --> 01:46:04.206
There's already more
than 100,000 apps

01:46:04.206 --> 01:46:08.716
that have adopted the use of
Swift code including great apps

01:46:08.716 --> 01:46:10.866
like Twitter and
Strava and Lyft.

01:46:12.296 --> 01:46:16.426
Now, we wanted everyone to
use Swift so we released it

01:46:16.586 --> 01:46:19.196
as open source in
December and since then,

01:46:19.196 --> 01:46:21.186
the adoption has been amazing.

01:46:21.796 --> 01:46:24.926
It's already the number one
language project on GitHub.

01:46:26.666 --> 01:46:30.996
Swift is powerful but it's also
simple and it's approachable.

01:46:31.296 --> 01:46:34.046
So it can be your very
first programming language.

01:46:35.216 --> 01:46:38.846
This is a very important
point for us.

01:46:39.536 --> 01:46:44.586
Because Swift is so easy to
learn, it has the potential

01:46:44.586 --> 01:46:46.886
to bring many more
people into coding.

01:46:47.796 --> 01:46:50.816
And this is an idea we would
like to take even further.

01:46:51.766 --> 01:46:56.766
So today, we're introducing
a new app for iPad.

01:46:58.056 --> 01:47:00.506
We call it Swift Playgrounds.

01:47:01.516 --> 01:47:09.546
[ Cheering and Applause ]

01:47:10.046 --> 01:47:14.426
Swift Playgrounds will
revolutionize the way people

01:47:14.466 --> 01:47:17.366
learn to code and they'll
be able to do it right

01:47:17.496 --> 01:47:22.376
on their iPad which instantly
makes it accessible for hundreds

01:47:22.376 --> 01:47:24.246
of millions of people
around the world.

01:47:25.116 --> 01:47:26.696
There's never been
anything like this.

01:47:27.426 --> 01:47:30.906
We believe it's the absolute
best way to teach everyone

01:47:30.906 --> 01:47:35.066
to code, combining the powerful
Swift programming language

01:47:35.486 --> 01:47:38.906
and the powerful
capabilities of iPad.

01:47:39.616 --> 01:47:43.896
To show it to you, I'd like
to invite Cheryl Thomas up.

01:47:44.146 --> 01:47:44.596
Cheryl?

01:47:45.516 --> 01:47:50.426
[ Cheering and Applause ]

01:47:50.926 --> 01:47:52.266
>> Thank you, Tim.

01:47:52.266 --> 01:47:54.146
I am thrilled to show
you Swift Playgrounds,

01:47:54.146 --> 01:47:55.356
an incredible new app

01:47:55.956 --> 01:47:58.256
that transforms how
kids learn to code.

01:47:58.256 --> 01:48:00.296
I'll launch it right now.

01:48:02.456 --> 01:48:05.116
We land on this gorgeous
screen full

01:48:05.116 --> 01:48:07.026
of custom content from Apple.

01:48:07.026 --> 01:48:11.396
Up at the top are lessons and
down below we have challenges.

01:48:11.996 --> 01:48:14.536
I'm going to start with
the very first lesson

01:48:14.536 --> 01:48:16.456
in the Fundamentals of Swift.

01:48:17.866 --> 01:48:20.556
We see a preview of the
content with graphics

01:48:20.556 --> 01:48:23.346
and a description
and I'll open it.

01:48:24.186 --> 01:48:26.186
It starts with an introduction

01:48:26.186 --> 01:48:29.486
to the coding concept I'll
be learning and when I'm good

01:48:29.486 --> 01:48:33.016
and ready, I can just tap in the
lower corner to start coding.

01:48:33.016 --> 01:48:37.936
Over on the right, you can see
we have an interactive world

01:48:37.936 --> 01:48:40.386
that I can explore using touch.

01:48:41.356 --> 01:48:45.116
I'll swipe it, looks
good, and pinch to zoom.

01:48:45.116 --> 01:48:46.996
This is Byte.

01:48:46.996 --> 01:48:49.356
He is my character.

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:51.386
I think he's irresistible.

01:48:51.386 --> 01:48:55.056
And I'll be controlling
him with code.

01:48:55.056 --> 01:48:58.486
Over on the left are
instructions that explain

01:48:58.486 --> 01:49:01.636
and help guide me through
the problem I'll be solving

01:49:01.976 --> 01:49:04.026
and down below is
where I enter my code.

01:49:04.026 --> 01:49:08.836
Byte has been waiting patiently
so I'll tap to enter Swift code.

01:49:08.836 --> 01:49:12.976
You can see commands have
appeared at the bottom.

01:49:12.976 --> 01:49:16.666
These are just like QuickType
suggestions but for code,

01:49:17.516 --> 01:49:20.246
my objective in this lesson
is to get him to the end

01:49:20.316 --> 01:49:21.946
of that path and
collect the gem.

01:49:22.326 --> 01:49:27.146
So I'll tap move forward three
times and then collect gem.

01:49:27.866 --> 01:49:30.726
Watch the world on the
right as I run my code.

01:49:31.186 --> 01:49:32.416
Byte moves forward.

01:49:32.416 --> 01:49:35.986
He follows the commands in
the exact order I've entered,

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:39.246
gets the gem and I've
completed my very first lesson.

01:49:40.516 --> 01:49:45.796
[ Applause ]

01:49:46.296 --> 01:49:47.976
Kids are going to love them.

01:49:48.196 --> 01:49:51.206
Now, I can continue to the
next lesson in the series

01:49:51.206 --> 01:49:53.856
or I can jump around
to wherever I'd like.

01:49:54.236 --> 01:49:57.116
To do that, I tap in the
top left to open the table

01:49:57.116 --> 01:50:00.706
of contents and you can
see we include a ton

01:50:00.766 --> 01:50:04.976
of great content here to
engage and motivate learners.

01:50:05.476 --> 01:50:08.486
This one on loops,
looping all the sides,

01:50:08.486 --> 01:50:09.606
looks a little interesting.

01:50:09.606 --> 01:50:10.896
I'm going to check it out.

01:50:11.786 --> 01:50:14.826
Now we have a few lines
of code already filled in.

01:50:15.166 --> 01:50:18.226
I'll go ahead and run
it and see what happens.

01:50:19.366 --> 01:50:20.496
Byte moves forward.

01:50:20.736 --> 01:50:26.176
He gets the gem but
then he just stops.

01:50:26.176 --> 01:50:26.956
Poor little guy.

01:50:27.796 --> 01:50:29.656
He's going to need some help.

01:50:29.986 --> 01:50:32.776
The solution here, and I
know you've all got this,

01:50:32.846 --> 01:50:35.696
is that I need to repeat
that block of code four times

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:38.656
to get Byte around all
four sides of the world.

01:50:39.086 --> 01:50:41.466
To do that, I'm going
to need a for loop.

01:50:41.796 --> 01:50:46.046
I'll tap the plus up top to open
my code library and all I have

01:50:46.096 --> 01:50:50.226
to do is just drag a for
loop right into my code.

01:50:51.276 --> 01:50:51.976
Now watch this.

01:50:51.976 --> 01:50:55.176
I can tap that loop,
grab the end of it

01:50:55.176 --> 01:50:57.956
and just drag it
all around my code.

01:50:58.516 --> 01:51:04.376
[ Applause ]

01:51:04.876 --> 01:51:07.046
All right, I'll tap
the number placeholder,

01:51:07.206 --> 01:51:09.266
set this loop to
repeat four times.

01:51:09.266 --> 01:51:09.566
Looks good.

01:51:09.566 --> 01:51:13.746
OK. Keep your eyes on
Byte as I run my code.

01:51:14.036 --> 01:51:17.806
He moves forward, gets the gem,
makes a turn, and this time

01:51:17.806 --> 01:51:20.846
with the added for loop,
he just keeps ongoing.

01:51:20.846 --> 01:51:24.076
I finished another
lesson and I'm well

01:51:24.076 --> 01:51:25.876
on my way to mastering loops.

01:51:26.336 --> 01:51:31.486
Wouldn't this had been cool when
we were all learning to code.

01:51:31.486 --> 01:51:34.736
I mean come on, you
students, let me hear it.

01:51:34.736 --> 01:51:34.946
Come on.

01:51:35.516 --> 01:51:42.796
[ Cheering and Applause ]

01:51:43.296 --> 01:51:47.436
Swift Playgrounds is a fantastic
app to master the basics,

01:51:47.626 --> 01:51:49.126
but it doesn't stop there.

01:51:49.526 --> 01:51:50.536
Let me show you.

01:51:50.776 --> 01:51:52.536
I'll tap in the top
left corner to go

01:51:52.536 --> 01:51:53.956
to my library at Playgrounds.

01:51:54.436 --> 01:51:58.116
I can also explore advanced
coding and use the power

01:51:58.116 --> 01:52:01.876
of the iOS SDK to do
almost anything I'd like.

01:52:01.876 --> 01:52:04.786
I happen to have something
I've been working on.

01:52:05.796 --> 01:52:08.006
It combines my two
favorite things, physics

01:52:08.106 --> 01:52:09.836
and emoji, interestingly.

01:52:10.756 --> 01:52:15.046
OK. You can see that this
is a lot more sophisticated

01:52:15.046 --> 01:52:16.076
than what we've been doing.

01:52:16.826 --> 01:52:19.016
I have some emoji on the
right, thank goodness.

01:52:19.386 --> 01:52:20.706
I can tap to add more.

01:52:20.706 --> 01:52:23.156
And that's a big bee.

01:52:23.156 --> 01:52:26.206
OK. Now, I can also
fling them around.

01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:27.686
And because this
is physics emoji,

01:52:27.686 --> 01:52:29.596
they create a nice
little reaction.

01:52:30.136 --> 01:52:32.726
But you also notice they're all
just falling down to the bottom.

01:52:32.726 --> 01:52:36.006
And that's because right
not gravity is fixed.

01:52:36.486 --> 01:52:37.946
So I'm going to go
ahead and play

01:52:37.946 --> 01:52:39.366
around with gravity a little bit

01:52:39.856 --> 01:52:41.056
because who doesn't
like to do that.

01:52:41.896 --> 01:52:44.296
I'm going to double tap
to bring up the keyboard.

01:52:45.776 --> 01:52:48.466
We've built a completely
new coding keyboard

01:52:48.466 --> 01:52:50.056
and it is awesome.

01:52:50.226 --> 01:52:51.776

numbers and symbols.

01:53:01.836 --> 01:53:03.096
We're using Swift programming

01:53:03.096 --> 01:53:04.586
and they're right
at my fingertips.

01:53:04.826 --> 01:53:10.426
I'm going to quickly set the
world's angle, world.angle equal

01:53:10.426 --> 01:53:12.126
to the gyroscope's angle.

01:53:12.126 --> 01:53:13.286
Looks good.

OK. Now, look at the
bottom of the keyboard.

I press and drag down.

for multiplication.

to see that again.

I bet you knew that
though, right?

01:53:31.236 --> 01:53:32.626
Look at the W key.

01:53:32.626 --> 01:53:35.616
I'm going to press and
drag down for a number two.

01:53:36.056 --> 01:53:38.586
OK. Let's see what kind
of impact this had.

01:53:38.616 --> 01:53:40.826
Let's take this full
screen and run my code.

01:53:41.206 --> 01:53:44.136
Of course, because my
playground now has access

01:53:44.136 --> 01:53:47.496
to the iPad hardware,
as I pick up the iPad

01:53:47.496 --> 01:53:52.606
and I tilt it, all
my emoji react.
