Alright! Good to hear!

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.716
So, you know the phrase,

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:42.216
with great power comes
great responsibility.

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:45.956
Right? So, you've heard that
from Spider-Man stories,

00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:49.036
whether that's comic books
or TV shows or films,

00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:54.116
but really the phrase connects
to all these characters up here.

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:57.156
Our heroes and our villains,
see the only difference

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:59.616
between our heroes and our
villains is how they decide

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:03.576
to respond, the choices they
make once they realize they

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:04.816
have power.

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:07.356
So, that's the phrase;

00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:10.056
with great power comes
great responsibility.

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:13.566
And I learned that
phrase early on.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:17.426
See, like the characters
I had moments in my life

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:19.526
that made me make decisions.

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:23.326
I was lucky, when I was very
young, when I was like four

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:27.166
or five, my mom let
me watch reruns

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:31.486
of the 1960s Spider-Man
cartoon that was kind of made

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:33.266
up with panels from
the comic book.

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:38.016
And something about Spider-Man
just grabbed my attention.

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:41.666
I don't know if it was
those bright primary colors;

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.146
the red and the blue.

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:45.186
Perhaps it was his
big white eyes.

00:01:45.456 --> 00:01:47.386
Maybe it was because
he was young and funny.

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:48.916
I don't know, but something

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:50.376
about Spider-Man
really grabbed me

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.946
like no other character
had before.

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:56.406
In fact, I was into him so much
I remember two years later,

00:01:56.406 --> 00:02:00.966
it was the book fair for my
second grade class at school,

00:02:01.586 --> 00:02:03.746
and I walked in and there

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:06.866
against the back wall
I saw Spider-Man.

00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:09.716
Not actually Spider-Man,
it was a small reprint,

00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:13.176
a paperback sized reprint
of his comic books;

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.006
Amazing Spider-Man
seven through 13.

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:16.796
I never forget, and I walked up

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:18.046
and I grabbed it,
and I bought it.

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:23.166
And I read that book over
and over and over again.

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:26.716
And it opened my eyes
to a whole new world.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.846
It introduced me to
the Marvel Universe,

00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:32.676
and from that moment
on I was hooked.

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:34.836
That was my thing, comic books.

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:37.926
And I was one of those crazy
kids who never stopped.

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:41.606
I read them through grade
school, through high school,

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:43.546
and even through college.

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:49.236
And I had a pretty good
collection until the summer

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:53.346
between my freshman and
sophomore year at college.

00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:56.216
It was -- I remember
it was one evening

00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:58.856
and I saw some weird
lights out the window.

00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:01.926
This was an apartment I was
living in with my mother,

00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:04.816
my parents had divorced
when I was in high school.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:06.466
So, I saw these weird lights.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:09.016
I go outside and I see
that the apartment building

00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:10.986
that we live in is on fire.

00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:14.826
And the flames were
starting over on one side

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:17.346
and our apartment
unit was down here.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.846
And as the flames started going

00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:22.796
across the building I
was running in and out

00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:24.716
of the apartment
building grabbing things

00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:26.786
that I thought we
couldn't replace.

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:32.016
So, these were years before we
had such things as an iPhone,

00:03:32.016 --> 00:03:36.006
I know horrible, so our
pictures were physical,

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:37.236
they were in photo albums.

00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:39.316
So, I was running in
and out of the building,

00:03:39.516 --> 00:03:42.396
our apartment building,
grabbing photo albums,

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:45.026
I was grabbing some
pieces of furniture,

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:48.226
pictures off the wall,
whatever I could grab

00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:50.616
that I thought had
sentimental value.

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:53.316
And then I remember
the lights went

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.516
out in the building,
no more electricity.

00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:57.976
And I knew I had one
more chance to go in.

00:03:59.126 --> 00:04:03.036
So, I run in, I can't see
really, I'm feeling my way

00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:06.606
through the apartment, down
the hallway, into my bedroom,

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:09.916
I open my closet door
to get one more thing

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:14.036
from the apartment,
a box of comic books.

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.906
Now you might think
that's kind of crazy.

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.935
Why would someone run
into a building that's

00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:21.526
on fire to get comic books?

00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:25.576
Well, I mean at that moment
it kind of crystalized

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:28.886
in my mind how much the comics

00:04:29.316 --> 00:04:31.836
and these characters
meant to me.

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:35.926
So, I mentioned my parents
had a divorce, and if anyone

00:04:35.926 --> 00:04:39.106
who has been through a divorce,
or experienced it as a child,

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:41.756
you know how unsettling it is,

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:45.486
and it sort of rolls this
grenade into your life.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:49.366
But during that, during
our moving around,

00:04:49.786 --> 00:04:52.776
whatever was happening in
my life, and even the fire,

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:56.216
I had really good friends,
friends that helped me

00:04:56.386 --> 00:04:58.476
through these events in my life.

00:04:59.136 --> 00:05:01.946
And luckily those friends helped
guide me eventually to work

00:05:01.946 --> 00:05:06.746
for Marvel, the company I dreamt
of working for ever since I was

00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:09.046
that little kid watching
the cartoon.

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:13.066
And when I got to Marvel, that's
when the real learning began,

00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:15.376
and that's when that mantra,

00:05:15.786 --> 00:05:19.746
with great power comes great
responsibility, really sunk in.

00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:23.566
See not only does it
apply to our characters,

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:26.686
and the decisions they must
make with their abilities,

00:05:27.086 --> 00:05:30.436
it also applies to us,
the employees at Marvel.

00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:35.036
So, we say to ourselves,
what is our power.

00:05:35.886 --> 00:05:38.256
Well, our power is
we're able to work

00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:40.866
with these amazing
characters, only we can.

00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:45.626
Our other power is our
storytelling skills.

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:49.026
We think we're pretty good at
telling stories, whether it's

00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:52.326
in film, or in print,
or through video games.

00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:54.696
That's where I work now,
as the Creative Director

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:56.576
for the Marvel Games Division.

00:05:57.496 --> 00:06:00.726
So, if that is our power, the
characters and the stories

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:03.656
that we tell with them,
what is our responsibility?

00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:07.526
Well, our responsibilities
are to create stories

00:06:07.526 --> 00:06:10.026
that in some way help people.

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:14.226
That connect to them,
that speak to them,

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:19.336
and hopefully give them
inspiration in a way

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:22.036
that they can then
apply it to their lives.

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:27.316
Now, I mentioned I had
some friends, some friends

00:06:27.316 --> 00:06:30.686
that helped me through my
life and led me to Marvel,

00:06:31.336 --> 00:06:33.306
and to embrace power
and responsibility.

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:37.606
And even though we grew
up at different times,

00:06:38.256 --> 00:06:40.486
probably in different
locations around America,

00:06:40.486 --> 00:06:44.606
and if not around the world,
I think you know my friends.

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:47.096
I think you do.

00:06:47.626 --> 00:06:50.736
Let's see, there's six of them
I want to talk about today.

00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:55.746
My first friend, he was a skinny
kid, he grew up in Queens,

00:06:56.186 --> 00:06:58.376
and he really wanted to
give back to his country.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:01.036
He wanted to serve the country,
and he thought the best way

00:07:01.036 --> 00:07:03.916
that he could do that would
be joining the military.

00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:06.736
And so he would go -- he
went to a recruitment office

00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:07.566
and they turned him away.

00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:09.156
They said he was too skinny.

00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:10.046
He had flat feet.

00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:10.896
They didn't want him.

00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:13.086
But that did not
deter my friend.

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:15.656
He kept going to different
recruitment offices.

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:20.096
And there was a soldier
who was going on a mission,

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:21.506
and he went from one
recruitment office

00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:24.386
to another collecting some
papers, and he saw my friend.

00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:27.846
And he said, didn't I -- I just
saw that kid at the other place.

00:07:28.426 --> 00:07:30.986
And he said, to his
fellow soldiers,

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:32.536
that's the guy we want.

00:07:33.456 --> 00:07:34.606
And the other one said, him?

00:07:34.606 --> 00:07:35.276
The skinny one?

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:35.826
And he said, yeah.

00:07:36.696 --> 00:07:39.666
See, it's not about
this muscle right here,

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:41.246
it's about this muscle.

00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:43.466
I can see this kid has heart.

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:45.026
He's not giving up.

00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:49.036
That's the kind of person
we want in our army.

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:50.906
So, my friend was lucky.

00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:51.866
He succeeded.

00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:52.426
He got in.

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:53.656
He became a soldier.

00:07:53.876 --> 00:07:57.306
He not only became a soldier,
some called him a super soldier.

00:07:57.616 --> 00:08:00.716
In fact some call him a
living legend of World War II.

00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:02.976

my first friend, right?

So, here is the cover
to his first comic.

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:13.276
See the date up there, 1941.

00:08:13.846 --> 00:08:17.376
And what's remarkable and
really cool about this cover?

00:08:17.806 --> 00:08:19.116
Well, what is he doing on it?

Who's he punching?

Hitler! Because that's
what you would do, right?

00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:25.576
If you were in a room with
Hitler and you had the shield

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.636
and the powers, you'd sock
him in the jaw [laughter].

00:08:29.616 --> 00:08:32.155
Little problem with that.

00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:36.226
See, this comic was
published in the summer, 1941.

00:08:36.976 --> 00:08:41.586
Months before December,
months before Pearl Harbor,

00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:46.336
months before America was
officially entered into the war.

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:52.206
So, when his creators, Jack
Kirby and Joe Simon came

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:55.916
to work they were in trouble.

00:08:56.896 --> 00:09:00.736
There were protesters
outside and when they got

up into the offices
of Timely Comics,

00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:05.516
and that's what Marvel was
before they were Marvel,

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:08.846
they were called Timely,
they got up to the offices,

00:09:08.846 --> 00:09:11.776
they were yelled at
by the publisher.

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:15.986
He said, Jack and Joe,
what are you doing?

00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:18.386

Captain America, of all things,

00:09:22.486 --> 00:09:25.616
and he's wrapped in the
American Flag, and he's punching

in the face the leader
of a country

00:09:28.056 --> 00:09:29.526

They knew what was going on.

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:06.716
They knew about the ghettos.

00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:08.806
They knew about the work camps.

00:10:09.126 --> 00:10:11.716
They knew what the
Nazis were doing

00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:18.996
and they thought America should
go over there and stop them.

00:10:19.206 --> 00:10:21.106
It's also important -- what
did they give Captain America?

00:10:21.106 --> 00:10:22.106
What is he holding?

00:10:22.526 --> 00:10:23.616
Is it a bazooka?

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.376
Is it a machine gun?

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:27.056
No, it's a shield.

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:30.976
Like I said, these
comics are an art form.

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:33.196
They send messages.

00:10:33.296 --> 00:10:36.576
So, I think they chose a shield
because what does a shield do?

00:10:36.576 --> 00:10:37.986
Well, it defends him.

00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:39.796
Look, it's blocking that bullet.

00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:43.736
They're saying a message
that Captain America

00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:47.006
and America itself should
go over and protect those

00:10:47.006 --> 00:10:49.486
that can't protect themselves.

00:10:49.876 --> 00:10:50.846
So, it was a big hit.

00:10:50.936 --> 00:10:52.306
But like I said, it
was controversial

00:10:52.346 --> 00:10:55.446
because some felt we should
still be isolationists.

00:10:55.736 --> 00:10:57.986
And why are we -- why is
he punching the leader

00:10:57.986 --> 00:10:59.256
of this nation?

00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:02.326
But they thought it was more
important to make the statement.

00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:04.056
And that's not the last time

00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:07.756
that we've made statements
with Captain America.

00:11:07.756 --> 00:11:10.836
So, here we have a cover
to an issue that came

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:14.016
out just a year ago, but you
see that's someone different

00:11:14.016 --> 00:11:14.726
in the suit, right?

00:11:14.896 --> 00:11:17.866
So, you see above the Captain
America name, Sam Wilson,

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:21.066
The Falcon, who you may
know from the films;

00:11:21.066 --> 00:11:23.036
from Captain America
Winter Soldier,

00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:24.276
Captain America Civil War.

00:11:24.276 --> 00:11:28.176
In the comic books
he was Cap's partner.

00:11:29.086 --> 00:11:31.266
In fact there was a time,
for about 50 issues,

00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:34.606
where they changed the name
of the comic book and it went

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:37.246
from being Captain America to
Captain America and Falcon.

00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:41.526
And I know for me as a young
boy, to see a white man

00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:45.396
and a black man, from
different backgrounds as equals,

00:11:45.396 --> 00:11:48.176
working together, that
had an effect on me.

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:50.136
So, we recently did a story

00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:53.896
where Steve's Super Soldier
Serum was running out,

00:11:54.576 --> 00:12:00.216
and he said to Sam, America
still needs a Captain America.

00:12:00.576 --> 00:12:01.796
Will you take the shield?

00:12:02.766 --> 00:12:03.786
Will you take over for me?

00:12:04.756 --> 00:12:06.516
And we did -- and he said, yes.

00:12:06.796 --> 00:12:10.426
We published this, and of
course we had some reactions.

00:12:10.456 --> 00:12:13.636
People were not happy,
and we get it.

00:12:14.136 --> 00:12:15.626
People feel -- why
are you messing

00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:16.946
around with my character?

00:12:17.476 --> 00:12:18.386
You know, you're ruining them.

00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:19.586
Why are you changing thing?

00:12:20.146 --> 00:12:21.876
And we even get people
saying, you know,

00:12:21.876 --> 00:12:23.886
why have you turned
Captain America black?

00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:28.686
And we had to say, well we
didn't turn Steve Rogers a

00:12:28.686 --> 00:12:31.006
different -- make him
into a different race.

00:12:31.006 --> 00:12:34.346
This is actually Sam
Wilson, and he's earned this.

00:12:34.756 --> 00:12:36.266
He's stood behind
Captain America,

00:12:36.266 --> 00:12:38.036
and with him, for decades.

00:12:38.036 --> 00:12:41.336
He deserves his chance
to be Captain America.

00:12:42.356 --> 00:12:44.486
Now why did we do this?

00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:47.206
Well, we like to try different
things with our characters

00:12:47.206 --> 00:12:49.556
and stretch the brand
and push the brand,

00:12:49.696 --> 00:12:51.436
but we also like to say things.

00:12:52.006 --> 00:12:54.116
So, I'm just thinking
in my mind,

00:12:54.116 --> 00:12:56.246
and I don't know exactly what
the creators were saying,

00:12:56.246 --> 00:12:58.696
but I think perhaps
they were saying

00:12:58.696 --> 00:13:02.126
that it doesn't matter what
the color of your skin is,

00:13:03.126 --> 00:13:04.216
if you have the heart.

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:08.656
If you have the heart you
can be Captain America too.

00:13:10.716 --> 00:13:14.236
My next friend, he
was also a skinny kid.

00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:18.706
He was from Queens as well.

00:13:18.706 --> 00:13:21.936
He was a bit of what
you would call a nerd.

00:13:22.516 --> 00:13:24.766
He was picked on by the jocks.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.536
See he was really into
science, my friend.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.906
And he was an orphan
and he was raised

00:13:30.906 --> 00:13:33.246
by an older aunt and uncle.

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.006
And he really felt the
world was against him.

00:13:36.746 --> 00:13:39.616
And one day his uncle said
to him, hey, when you grow

00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:42.476
up you're going to have a lot of
power because -- you're smart.

00:13:43.266 --> 00:13:44.286
So, when you do grow

00:13:44.286 --> 00:13:47.726
up you should use your
powers responsibly.

00:13:48.486 --> 00:13:50.746
And my friend kind
of said, whatever.

00:13:51.476 --> 00:13:54.986
And when he grew up and he was
a teenager he realized he was

00:13:55.076 --> 00:13:58.276
pretty smart and he did
have some amazing abilities,

00:13:58.706 --> 00:14:02.176
and one night he was out and
there was a cop, police officer,

00:14:02.176 --> 00:14:04.556
chasing a thief and the
cop was yelling, hey,

00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:05.646
hey help me stop this thief.

00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:10.256
And my friend said, from now on
I'm looking out for number one,

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:11.746
and he took a step back.

00:14:12.146 --> 00:14:13.366
And that thief ran by,

00:14:13.846 --> 00:14:16.266
and as fate would have it
two days later that thief ran

00:14:16.326 --> 00:14:19.856
into my friend's uncle
and shot him dead.

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:23.706
And my friend said, if only
I'd listened to my uncle,

00:14:23.706 --> 00:14:25.686
one of the only nice
men in my life.

00:14:26.186 --> 00:14:28.956
If I'd listened to him
he would still be alive

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:32.616
and my aunt wouldn't be
devastated by his loss.

00:14:32.876 --> 00:14:36.796
And from that moment forward,
as a dedication to his uncle,

00:14:36.796 --> 00:14:39.706
he decided, I will use
my powers responsibly.

00:14:40.206 --> 00:14:41.206
So, who am I talking about?

00:14:41.206 --> 00:14:44.096
My next friend -- Spider-Man!

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:45.936
So, now it's 1963.

00:14:46.776 --> 00:14:48.286
I mention that because all

00:14:48.286 --> 00:14:50.356
of our creators were
using our comics to talk

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.346
about what's going
on around them.

00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:55.756
And this was really the birth
of the Marvel Character.

00:14:56.446 --> 00:14:57.726
And what do I mean by that?

00:14:57.726 --> 00:15:00.646
Well, Spider-Man looked
a little different

00:15:00.936 --> 00:15:02.266
than heroes that came before.

00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:04.396
And once you start reading
his adventures you found

00:15:04.396 --> 00:15:06.416
out he was truly different.

00:15:06.936 --> 00:15:11.346
And his creators, Stan Lee and
Steve Ditko, they got yelled

00:15:11.346 --> 00:15:13.186
at too when they came into work.

00:15:13.416 --> 00:15:16.406
So, they came into work and
the publisher, Martin Goodman,

00:15:16.476 --> 00:15:18.096
said, what are you doing?

00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:24.726
You've published a comic with a
character named after a spider

00:15:25.306 --> 00:15:27.696
and he has an insect
on his chest.

00:15:28.306 --> 00:15:29.796
Everybody hates bugs.

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:31.606
What are you doing?

00:15:31.736 --> 00:15:32.816
And you've covered his face.

00:15:32.816 --> 00:15:34.506
He looks like a bank robber.

00:15:34.506 --> 00:15:35.706
We can't see his face.

00:15:36.156 --> 00:15:38.526
And worst of all,
he's a teenager!

00:15:39.336 --> 00:15:41.016
Teenagers should be sidekicks.

00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:43.416
Who wants to read
about a teenager?

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.646
Well, the new generation did.

00:15:46.476 --> 00:15:48.876
So, the greatest generation
is back from World War II.

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:50.106
It's 20 years later.

00:15:50.106 --> 00:15:52.266
It's the rise of
the teenage culture.

00:15:52.736 --> 00:15:54.096
They have disposable income.

00:15:54.436 --> 00:15:56.116
They want to read about
heroes that are different.

00:15:56.116 --> 00:15:58.056
They want to read about
heroes that are like them.

00:15:58.716 --> 00:15:59.786
They want to read about heroes

00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:02.996
that are a little more
relatable, who are not perfect,

00:16:03.326 --> 00:16:05.876
they're not square jawed
aliens from another world,

00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:08.836
or rich billionaires, they
are skinny Peter Parker

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:10.636
from Queens who gets picked on.

00:16:11.186 --> 00:16:14.466
But the publisher
didn't realize this,

00:16:14.856 --> 00:16:17.336
didn't know who was
going to read this book.

00:16:17.336 --> 00:16:19.096
And so he's yelling
at Stan and Steve,

00:16:19.426 --> 00:16:20.576
what the hell are you doing?

00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:24.926
As you can guess, at that moment
in comes someone from sales.

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:27.886
Boss, boss, look at
the sales numbers!

00:16:29.226 --> 00:16:30.926
Keep doing it!

00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:32.196
Another hit.

00:16:32.346 --> 00:16:36.406
And you can see what made
him really different.

00:16:36.406 --> 00:16:40.576
I mean check out poor Peter
over there in the bow tie,

00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:43.946
and the glasses, and the kids
pointing at him, and laughing

00:16:43.946 --> 00:16:48.166
at him, and as you can see, via
the art, without reading a word,

00:16:48.166 --> 00:16:49.866
you see that he's ostracized.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.326
He feels alone.

00:16:51.596 --> 00:16:52.826
He is an underdog.

00:16:53.276 --> 00:16:54.126
But look behind him.

00:16:55.006 --> 00:16:57.406
Look at the shadow
of the hero within.

00:16:57.406 --> 00:17:01.456
And don't we all feel
that way sometimes.

00:17:01.746 --> 00:17:03.866
We feel the world is against us.

00:17:03.866 --> 00:17:08.506
We feel the world is judging us,
but we know, we know within us,

00:17:08.955 --> 00:17:12.236
if given the opportunity,
lies greatness.

00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:16.056
So, as with Captain America,

00:17:16.356 --> 00:17:17.965
Spider-Man was a
bit controversial

00:17:17.965 --> 00:17:19.496
when he came out,
with some readers.

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:20.536
They didn't get it.

00:17:20.715 --> 00:17:21.616
But many more did.

00:17:21.616 --> 00:17:25.476
And that wasn't the only
controversial things

00:17:26.126 --> 00:17:27.665
that we did with him.

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:33.886
Let's see, in 1970 the president
happened to be Richard Nixon,

00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:38.036
believe it or not, went to Stan
Lee, and President Nixon said,

00:17:38.426 --> 00:17:40.526
Stan we have this
problem with drugs.

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:43.266
And we're going to lose
a lot of young people.

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:47.466
And President Nixon knew
how popular the comics were,

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:48.586
that Marvel were publishing.

00:17:48.586 --> 00:17:50.516
And he said, could
you do a comic book

00:17:50.516 --> 00:17:53.526
that would mention
the drug problem?

00:17:54.696 --> 00:17:56.636
Stan thought about it and he
said, you know what, I will.

00:17:56.636 --> 00:18:01.086
And what was remarkable
is he did it in the pages

00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:02.256
of Amazing Spider-Man.

00:18:02.766 --> 00:18:05.586
Now we had many characters
to choose from.

00:18:05.746 --> 00:18:07.206
Stan could have selected one

00:18:07.206 --> 00:18:09.036
of our less popular
characters, but he didn't.

00:18:09.596 --> 00:18:10.416
He picked Spider-Man.

00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:12.666
Now, you'll see there's
something that's not

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:14.036
on this cover.

00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:19.166
Now see up there on the top
right of Amazing Fantasy 15.

00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:20.986
That's the Comic's
Code Authority Stamp,

00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:23.736
was a seal of approval
that basically told parents

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:26.836
that the comic was safe for
younger readers to read,

00:18:26.836 --> 00:18:29.166
it didn't have, you
know certain levels

00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:31.396
of violence, things like that.

00:18:31.926 --> 00:18:34.426
What's not on this cover?

00:18:34.426 --> 00:18:35.386
There's no Comic's Code.

00:18:35.506 --> 00:18:37.516
See what happened was,
when we were ready

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:39.466
to publish it Stan
gave the comic

00:18:39.466 --> 00:18:42.356
to the Comic's Code Authority
to read and to give their stamp

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:45.326
of approval and the Comic's Code
said, you can't publish this.

00:18:46.036 --> 00:18:47.296
Stan said, why not?

00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:49.496
He said because it
mentions drugs.

00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:52.826
Stan said, but it's not
doing it in a positive way.

00:18:52.826 --> 00:18:54.286
It's an antidrug story.

00:18:54.286 --> 00:18:55.246
And they said, we don't care.

00:18:55.866 --> 00:18:58.736
You -- the Comic's Code says
there can be no mention of drugs

00:18:58.966 --> 00:19:01.356
in the comic, so you
can't publish this

00:19:01.356 --> 00:19:03.366
with the Comic's Code
Stamp of Approval.

00:19:03.586 --> 00:19:06.766
And Stan said, good, we're
going to publish it anyway;

00:19:07.136 --> 00:19:08.006
without the Comic's Code.

00:19:09.136 --> 00:19:13.896
First time that happened,
and it was a hit.

00:19:14.706 --> 00:19:16.066
People really responded to it.

00:19:16.466 --> 00:19:21.036
They responded to, really kind
of a smart, difficult story.

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:23.906
In the story Peter's
roommate, Harry Osborn,

00:19:23.906 --> 00:19:27.016
the son of the Green
Goblin, had a pill problem,

00:19:27.776 --> 00:19:30.386
and Spider-Man had to council
him and finally get him help.

00:19:30.386 --> 00:19:32.816
But they handled it in
a way that the readers

00:19:32.816 --> 00:19:34.176
at the time could appreciate.

00:19:34.896 --> 00:19:37.606
Stan was really speaking to
the readers in a language

00:19:37.606 --> 00:19:38.526
that they wanted to hear.

00:19:39.366 --> 00:19:42.016
But, as you can guess, it
was a little controversial,

00:19:42.016 --> 00:19:43.996
but sometimes we've
got to take a stand.

00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:47.296
Right? We have to use
art to send a message.

00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:50.066
But it didn't stop
there, with that issue.

00:19:50.066 --> 00:19:54.196
No. We use Spider-Man
from time to time

00:19:54.496 --> 00:19:55.496
to speak to other things.

00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:58.696
So, in this case it was
2011, and we had a line

00:19:58.696 --> 00:20:01.926
of comics called The Ultimate
Line of Marvel Comics.

00:20:01.926 --> 00:20:03.926
They were set on another
world where we kind

00:20:03.926 --> 00:20:05.626
of started -- we started now.

00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:08.006
Rather than having our
history starting in the 60s,

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:09.366
we kind of started
this new line,

00:20:09.366 --> 00:20:10.646
but wanted to make it different.

00:20:10.706 --> 00:20:12.356
We wanted to make it unexpected.

00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:16.726
And so actually on that
world that Peter Parker died

00:20:16.936 --> 00:20:20.926
in battle protecting Aunt
May from the Green Goblin.

00:20:21.326 --> 00:20:25.466
And in that reality there was
a boy named Miles Morales,

00:20:26.216 --> 00:20:30.126
who happened to also be
infected by a spider bite.

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:33.776
And when that world's Peter
Parker died Miles decided the

00:20:33.776 --> 00:20:35.556
world still needs a Spider-Man.

00:20:35.556 --> 00:20:37.886
So, he made his own
costume and he became

00:20:38.146 --> 00:20:41.316
that world's Spider-Man.

00:20:41.596 --> 00:20:44.586
And, as you can see, looks a
bit different from Peter, right?

00:20:44.986 --> 00:20:47.346
He's half African American,
and he's half Puerto Rican.

00:20:47.686 --> 00:20:52.926
And I remember the day I came
into work, I was an editor

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:54.536
at the time for Marvel
Publishing.

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:56.366
An editor is sort
of like a producer,

00:20:57.226 --> 00:20:59.746
we're selecting the writers
and the artists to work

00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:02.056
on the series, and we're working
with them through every step

00:21:02.056 --> 00:21:04.626
of the way, deciding
what's printed on the cover

00:21:04.626 --> 00:21:06.396
to what's in the word balloons.

00:21:06.396 --> 00:21:07.266
We work on everything.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.136
And we also have access

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:13.216
to an email account
called mheros@marvel.com,

00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:15.126
and people can write in letters.

00:21:15.976 --> 00:21:17.616
Usually they write in and say,

00:21:18.316 --> 00:21:20.406
why can't Peter Parker
marry Jane,

00:21:20.406 --> 00:21:22.306
be happily married ever after?

00:21:22.726 --> 00:21:25.376
Why can't Rogue and
Gambit just be together?

00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:26.926
Why are you so cruel to them?

00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:29.656
Because drama, that's why.

00:21:32.126 --> 00:21:32.636
So, that --

00:21:33.516 --> 00:21:36.716
[ Applause ]

00:21:37.216 --> 00:21:40.166
So, I remember I came
in and our offices

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:42.766
and that email account
were flooded with letters.

00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:45.316
And some of them weren't happy.

00:21:46.316 --> 00:21:49.356
One was from a dad, I'll never
forget it, he wrote and he said,

00:21:49.356 --> 00:21:54.846
when my kids get home from
school I'm going to take them

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:57.006
to the backyard and
I'm going to stack

00:21:57.006 --> 00:21:59.256
up all their Spider-Man comics
and I'm going to burn them.

00:21:59.766 --> 00:22:04.316
He said, why did you make -- why
did you turn Spider Man black?

00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:05.836
Why did you do this?

00:22:05.836 --> 00:22:10.126
Why with your East
Coast liberal views?

00:22:10.806 --> 00:22:13.296
Why are you ruining our hero?

00:22:14.586 --> 00:22:17.126
So, I wrote to him and I
said, Sir, you don't have

00:22:17.126 --> 00:22:21.396
to buy a single additional
issue of this series,

00:22:22.516 --> 00:22:24.176
but just so you know,

00:22:24.836 --> 00:22:27.866
in the regular Marvel Universe
Peter Parker is alive and well.

00:22:28.406 --> 00:22:31.776
But we're offering an
alternative with a Spider-Man

00:22:31.776 --> 00:22:32.706
that looks a bit different.

00:22:33.406 --> 00:22:35.986
So, I said, you don't have
to buy any new issues,

00:22:36.046 --> 00:22:40.156
but please don't burn
your kids' comics.

00:22:41.246 --> 00:22:44.816
It will not have the effect on
them that you think it will.

00:22:45.076 --> 00:22:47.256
It will be far, far worse.

00:22:48.016 --> 00:22:48.726
Now he didn't respond.

00:22:48.726 --> 00:22:49.926
I don't know if he
burned them or not.

00:22:49.926 --> 00:22:51.366
I'd like to hope he didn't.

00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:54.176
Who can say?

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:56.576
But I can say, immediately
after reading

00:22:56.576 --> 00:22:57.596
that I read a great letter.

00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:01.126
A young woman wrote in
and said, thank you.

00:23:01.716 --> 00:23:07.136
She says, now my little brother
has a Spider-Man that looks just

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:10.716
like him, and he feels great.

00:23:11.856 --> 00:23:16.366
He feels he is represented
up here, on this cover.

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:17.946
And that's why we do it.

00:23:18.516 --> 00:23:25.556
[ Applause ]

00:23:26.056 --> 00:23:28.226
Alright, my next
friend -- let's see.

00:23:29.126 --> 00:23:31.116
Oh, he really loved his dad.

00:23:31.926 --> 00:23:35.236
His dad led this --
more than a business --

00:23:35.236 --> 00:23:36.716
like an empire, you could say.

00:23:37.506 --> 00:23:39.686
My friend really -- he
loved him, and he hoped

00:23:39.686 --> 00:23:41.246
to one day take over for him.

00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:46.116
And as fate would have
it, his dad was killed,

00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:51.206
and my friend did have to step
in for him and run the empire.

00:23:51.206 --> 00:23:54.136
And he found it was so much more
challenging than he ever knew,

00:23:54.606 --> 00:23:57.356
and he realized it was
constantly under attack

00:23:57.756 --> 00:23:59.606
by others outside of it.

00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:02.956
And he had to find the
courage within himself to step

00:24:02.956 --> 00:24:06.196
into the boots of his father,
but to become his own person.

00:24:06.616 --> 00:24:10.156
I'm talking about
The Black Panther,

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.746
who many of you may
have been introduced

00:24:12.746 --> 00:24:15.546
to in the latest Captain
America Civil War movie.

00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:18.686
So, Black Panther was
introduced in the pages

00:24:18.686 --> 00:24:21.126
of The Fantastic Four, 1966.

00:24:21.406 --> 00:24:26.506
And it was remarkable because
it was the first black character

00:24:26.506 --> 00:24:29.326
introduced by one of the
major comic book publishers.

00:24:30.346 --> 00:24:34.386
And what's also crazy cool is
that he was no one's sidekick.

00:24:34.876 --> 00:24:36.346
He was no one's servant.

00:24:36.846 --> 00:24:40.136
When the Fantastic Four
answered his invitation to go

00:24:40.136 --> 00:24:43.876
to his nation of Wakanda,
this was a country we made

00:24:43.876 --> 00:24:45.676
up that was in Africa.

00:24:46.136 --> 00:24:51.066
They saw that he was a king,
and he was a king of a nation

00:24:51.066 --> 00:24:53.186
that was the world's
most technologically

00:24:53.186 --> 00:24:54.706
advanced country.

00:24:55.626 --> 00:24:58.766
And so again, I think the
creators, this time Stan Lee

00:24:58.766 --> 00:25:00.466
and Jack Kirby, were
making a statement.

00:25:01.346 --> 00:25:05.206
Were making a statement just in
the choices they were making.

00:25:05.726 --> 00:25:09.596
And people loved Black
Panther right away.

00:25:09.596 --> 00:25:13.956
And they were very smart in
the stories they told with him,

00:25:13.956 --> 00:25:17.356
and I think they told some
very symbolic stories,

00:25:17.356 --> 00:25:18.716
like this next cover.

00:25:19.286 --> 00:25:21.946
So, here we are in
the 70s, and yeah,

00:25:21.946 --> 00:25:23.886
Black Panther is
taking on the Klan.

00:25:25.306 --> 00:25:29.306
He's actually ripping himself
off a cross before they set it

00:25:29.306 --> 00:25:30.226
on fire.

00:25:30.756 --> 00:25:36.286
What an emotional,
powerful, symbolic image.

00:25:36.616 --> 00:25:39.856
One of the things I love about
him is that he's outnumbered.

00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:43.176
I love that they chose, not
to just have one Klan member

00:25:43.176 --> 00:25:44.966
at the bottom, but there's
a whole group of them.

00:25:45.596 --> 00:25:47.966
This always -- this again
speaks to the Marvel message

00:25:47.966 --> 00:25:50.766
of underdogs feeling
outnumbered,

00:25:50.896 --> 00:25:54.616
feeling the world is against
you, but deciding to fight back,

00:25:54.616 --> 00:25:57.766
deciding to do the
right thing anyway.

00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:04.236
My next friend, she
was an orphan too.

00:26:04.236 --> 00:26:06.186
I think I should stop
there and talk about;

00:26:06.446 --> 00:26:10.626
what's up with all the orphans?

00:26:10.726 --> 00:26:14.256
Well, in any sort of art form
you have to make decisions to --

00:26:14.926 --> 00:26:16.936
especially in fiction --
you want to get the audience

00:26:17.136 --> 00:26:20.086
on the side of your character,
and if you have limited time,

00:26:20.156 --> 00:26:24.206
say a limited page count of a
comic book or a limited time

00:26:24.246 --> 00:26:26.016
in a movie or in a video game,

00:26:26.016 --> 00:26:27.776
you have to make
choices right away

00:26:27.776 --> 00:26:30.636
that helps your audience
connect with your character.

00:26:30.636 --> 00:26:33.386
So, that's why you -- it's a
tradition in heroic fiction,

00:26:33.686 --> 00:26:38.006
all these orphans; Luke
Skywalker, Harry Potter,

00:26:38.866 --> 00:26:43.486
every Disney princess,
poor Bambi.

00:26:43.486 --> 00:26:48.696
There goes mama [laughter]
Why do we do this?

00:26:49.856 --> 00:26:50.906
Why do we do this?

00:26:50.906 --> 00:26:52.746
Because again, we're
trying to get the audience

00:26:52.746 --> 00:26:53.866
on the side of the hero.

00:26:53.866 --> 00:26:57.226
And what's the one thing that
everyone can either fear,

00:26:58.306 --> 00:27:00.466
or if it's unfortunate enough
to have gone through it,

00:27:00.466 --> 00:27:03.126
to sympathize with,
losing the parents,

00:27:03.706 --> 00:27:05.076
something everyone can fear.

00:27:05.476 --> 00:27:07.226
So, it gets your audience
on the side of the hero.

00:27:07.226 --> 00:27:09.996
It also literally forces the
character out of the nest.

00:27:10.296 --> 00:27:13.256
Our characters must now
stand on their own two feet

00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:16.236
and again make their choices
about power and responsibility.

00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:19.946
So, that's why you often see
it in super heroes like this.

00:27:19.946 --> 00:27:22.846
So, my next friend;
she was an orphan

00:27:23.106 --> 00:27:24.316
and she felt like a freak.

00:27:25.556 --> 00:27:28.766
She was like this friend,
she was born in Africa,

00:27:29.406 --> 00:27:32.606
and she had silver hair.

00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:36.056
She was black but she had
silver hair and she felt

00:27:36.146 --> 00:27:40.486
like everyone was judging
her and condemning her

00:27:40.486 --> 00:27:42.786
and thinking she was some
sort of witch or a monster.

00:27:43.186 --> 00:27:48.486
And one day this really nice
teacher came up to her and said,

00:27:48.486 --> 00:27:50.196
you're not cursed,
you're blessed.

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:55.636
I want you to come with me
to my school in Westchester

00:27:57.006 --> 00:28:00.446
where everyone looks really
cool and we have these cool jets

00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:03.196
to fly around in, and together
we're going to go around

00:28:03.196 --> 00:28:05.586
and we're going to show
the world that people

00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:07.006
like you are not evil.

00:28:07.276 --> 00:28:08.866
That people like you are good.

00:28:09.096 --> 00:28:12.356
And we can all work together
to create a better world.

00:28:12.656 --> 00:28:14.506
So, can you guess
my next friend?

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.516
Storm! Storm, a mutant.

00:28:17.516 --> 00:28:20.746
In the Marvel universe we
kind of divide the characters

00:28:20.746 --> 00:28:21.836
by how they get their powers.

00:28:22.246 --> 00:28:24.406
So, if you get bitten
by a radioactive spider,

00:28:24.406 --> 00:28:27.106
or if it's cosmic rays,
or if it's gamma rays,

00:28:27.536 --> 00:28:30.896
the creators were really
grappling with the Cold War

00:28:30.896 --> 00:28:32.496
at the time, and the
fear of the bomb.

00:28:32.496 --> 00:28:36.096
That's why there's all this
radiation in our characters.

00:28:36.496 --> 00:28:39.326
But if you're a mutant you
are just born different,

00:28:39.756 --> 00:28:41.196
it's in your genes
from the start,

00:28:41.196 --> 00:28:43.606
and when you hit puberty, ta da!

00:28:43.606 --> 00:28:48.036
You're body starts changing,
and in the case of the mutants,

00:28:48.036 --> 00:28:50.886
you grow wings, lasers
shoot out of your eyes.

00:28:50.886 --> 00:28:51.906
And isn't that what you felt

00:28:51.906 --> 00:28:53.356
like when you were
going through puberty?

00:28:54.146 --> 00:28:56.886
I did. And so the
teacher I was talking

00:28:56.886 --> 00:28:58.386
about is Professor X, right?

00:28:58.386 --> 00:29:00.556
And so he comes up to
the mutants and he says,

00:29:00.556 --> 00:29:03.106
come with me and we're
going to change the world.

00:29:03.106 --> 00:29:05.696
We're going to show the world
that mutants and humans can live

00:29:05.696 --> 00:29:07.506
and work together
to change the world.

00:29:07.506 --> 00:29:09.236
And it's a great message.

00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.266
And another message
was sent by this cover.

00:29:12.296 --> 00:29:14.336
I've mentioned America a
lot in this discussion.

00:29:14.696 --> 00:29:17.866
And super humans are a
uniquely American invention.

00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:20.526
We came up with them and I
think we do them really great,

00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:24.736
and you could say right now
it's one of our greatest gifts

00:29:24.736 --> 00:29:27.266
to the world is the super hero.

00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:29.616
We export the super
hero around the world.

00:29:30.046 --> 00:29:32.976
But this issue was different.

00:29:33.036 --> 00:29:36.596
This issue introduced
international characters.

00:29:37.496 --> 00:29:39.966
So, you have Storm
up there flying.

00:29:40.166 --> 00:29:43.286
The big metal guy is
Colossus, he is Russian.

00:29:44.166 --> 00:29:46.166
And to me, as a kid,
that was huge.

00:29:46.716 --> 00:29:51.196
My mom was Ukrainian, and so I
remember growing up in the 80s,

00:29:51.196 --> 00:29:52.796
you know anyone from
Eastern European,

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:53.896
and anywhere near Russia was,

00:29:54.116 --> 00:29:56.156
you know those were
commies, they're evil.

00:29:56.156 --> 00:29:59.806
But in the comics I saw that,
no, Russians can be good.

00:29:59.866 --> 00:30:01.036
Colossus is a hero.

00:30:01.086 --> 00:30:02.586
It meant a lot to me.

00:30:02.956 --> 00:30:06.136
So, also you see Nightcrawler,
with the blue face, he's German.

00:30:06.376 --> 00:30:09.126
Wolverine, with the
claws, from Canada.

00:30:10.906 --> 00:30:11.566
True story.

00:30:13.286 --> 00:30:14.066
International group.

00:30:14.406 --> 00:30:18.326
Again, I think they were making
a choice deliberately to say,

00:30:18.436 --> 00:30:20.406
again, it doesn't
matter who you are

00:30:20.406 --> 00:30:23.876
or where you come from,
we can all be heroes.

00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:24.816
We can all be heroes.

00:30:25.066 --> 00:30:26.316
And storm was really unique

00:30:26.316 --> 00:30:29.466
because she wasn't only
just really powerful,

00:30:29.686 --> 00:30:31.936
she can control the weather,
she can make it thunder

00:30:31.936 --> 00:30:33.056
and lightning and storm.

00:30:33.446 --> 00:30:37.316
Not only that, but she had
real strength of character.

00:30:37.316 --> 00:30:38.436
I mean look at this next cover.

00:30:38.966 --> 00:30:41.046
That's her rocking
the Grace Jones look,

00:30:41.076 --> 00:30:43.226
with the mohawk and the leather.

00:30:43.476 --> 00:30:45.096
And she was saying to the
world, hey this is me.

00:30:45.446 --> 00:30:47.486
Love me or hate me,
this is who I am.

00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:49.476
Now, this issue was significant

00:30:49.476 --> 00:30:52.836
because she actually challenged
Cyclops for leadership

00:30:52.836 --> 00:30:56.506
of the X-Men, and she did it
at a time when she was zapped

00:30:57.176 --> 00:30:59.756
by a gun and she didn't
even have her mutant powers.

00:31:00.636 --> 00:31:03.596
But she was very smart
and she was crafty,

00:31:03.956 --> 00:31:05.806
and she beat Cyclops.

00:31:07.086 --> 00:31:09.666
So, here I am, this white kid.

00:31:09.666 --> 00:31:12.346
At the time I was living
down south in Tennessee,

00:31:12.736 --> 00:31:16.866
and I read a comic book where a
black woman defeats a white man

00:31:17.106 --> 00:31:21.466
for leadership of Marvel's most
popular and powerful super team.

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:25.546
And you know what I said, and
readers around the world said?

00:31:26.036 --> 00:31:26.796
We said, alright!

00:31:27.496 --> 00:31:29.336
Cool! She's earned it.

00:31:29.766 --> 00:31:32.466
So, I think stories like this,

00:31:32.466 --> 00:31:34.616
and images like this,
they have an impact.

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:38.736
And Storm isn't the only
powerful female that we have.

00:31:38.736 --> 00:31:41.076
We actually have a
tradition of strong women.

00:31:41.276 --> 00:31:44.246
In the movies you've seen Black
Widow and Scarlett, which,

00:31:44.246 --> 00:31:45.316
we announced we're finally going

00:31:45.316 --> 00:31:47.626
to do a female solo
movie, Captain Marvel.

00:31:47.996 --> 00:31:51.506
We have a history of
these strong women and we

00:31:51.506 --> 00:31:53.686
like to celebrate them.

00:31:53.686 --> 00:31:56.346
So, this year we did an
event called Women of Power.

00:31:56.346 --> 00:31:59.126
We were going to -- it
was kind of a salute

00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:01.326
to International
Women's History Day.

00:32:01.326 --> 00:32:03.226
And so we said, let's do a
whole month to celebrate.

00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:05.636
So, up top you see these images.

00:32:06.256 --> 00:32:07.796
We created these covers.

00:32:07.886 --> 00:32:10.576
We created 24 different
variant covers that were going

00:32:10.576 --> 00:32:11.656
to go on our comic books.

00:32:11.656 --> 00:32:14.506
And I knew we were doing
this months in advance.

00:32:14.886 --> 00:32:16.596
So, I called up my
friends in publishing,

00:32:16.596 --> 00:32:19.586
because at this point I'm now --
was over in California working

00:32:19.586 --> 00:32:21.716
for the Marvel Games team
as Creative Director --

00:32:21.716 --> 00:32:23.806
and I said, hey, let's team up.

00:32:23.806 --> 00:32:26.856
I want to do women of
power in our games.

00:32:26.856 --> 00:32:28.136
And they said, well how
are you going to do that?

00:32:28.136 --> 00:32:31.376
I said, I'm going to call all
of our different partners,

00:32:31.806 --> 00:32:35.126
who create all of our mobile
games, and I'm going to ask them

00:32:35.396 --> 00:32:36.396
if they want to participate.

00:32:36.396 --> 00:32:39.116
I'm going to say, hey do you
have any female characters

00:32:39.426 --> 00:32:40.746
that you were going to
introduce in the games?

00:32:40.746 --> 00:32:44.726
Do you want to hold
them until that month?

00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:47.566
And everyone whose logo
you see up there said, yes!

00:32:47.566 --> 00:32:50.426
And so we did the Women
of Power event in games.

00:32:50.746 --> 00:32:52.716
It was covered by
Entertainment Weekly,

00:32:52.716 --> 00:32:54.116
and then Forbes picked it up.

00:32:54.986 --> 00:32:57.756
And it was a way for
us to make a statement

00:32:57.756 --> 00:32:59.296
without even saying anything.

00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:01.646
See, at the time,
you know the story

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:04.116
of Gamer Gate was in the news.

00:33:04.116 --> 00:33:06.066
And people were asking me, what
do you think of Gamer Gate?

00:33:06.066 --> 00:33:07.906
And I said, what do I think?

00:33:07.966 --> 00:33:10.226
I -- we love our female readers.

00:33:10.786 --> 00:33:12.286
We love our female characters.

00:33:12.736 --> 00:33:16.536
We love our -- most of
our staff is female.

00:33:16.886 --> 00:33:20.776
We want to invite
everybody to the party.

00:33:21.876 --> 00:33:24.886
And that's what the Women
of Power event represented.

00:33:24.886 --> 00:33:27.226
And that's what it
said with us having

00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:28.486
to make a statement on it.

00:33:29.256 --> 00:33:29.976
My last-- Yes!

00:33:30.516 --> 00:33:36.096
[ Applause ]

00:33:36.596 --> 00:33:37.736
Let's see, my next friend --

00:33:38.406 --> 00:33:39.746
I lied a bit, it's
actually a group.

00:33:39.746 --> 00:33:40.676
It's a group of friends,

00:33:40.676 --> 00:33:44.176
but they're so united
I think of them as one.

00:33:44.766 --> 00:33:48.546
These friends, like my
other friends, were orphaned

00:33:48.546 --> 00:33:50.816
in some way, and
they felt alone,

00:33:50.816 --> 00:33:52.266
and they felt like misfits.

00:33:52.776 --> 00:33:54.866
But they ran into each
other and they looked around

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:55.916
and they said, you know what?

00:33:55.916 --> 00:33:57.066
You're my kind of misfit.

00:33:57.496 --> 00:33:59.986
And they formed a
new family together,

00:33:59.986 --> 00:34:02.806
and they were all very
different, but they said,

00:34:02.806 --> 00:34:04.866
you know despite our differences
we can stand together

00:34:04.866 --> 00:34:07.236
and we can save,
not only the world,

00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.755
we can save the entire galaxy.

00:34:10.726 --> 00:34:13.386
My next friends, The
Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:34:14.746 --> 00:34:15.775
Now this -- Yeah!

00:34:16.786 --> 00:34:20.096
Yes, that's a talking
raccoon and a walking tree,

00:34:20.096 --> 00:34:21.306
that does deserve applause!

00:34:23.456 --> 00:34:28.536
So, this cover that came out in
2008, I was actually the editor

00:34:28.536 --> 00:34:29.936
of the series at the time.

00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:32.416
I was asked to edit
our Cosmic Books,

00:34:32.676 --> 00:34:34.235
and I wanted to do a team book.

00:34:34.815 --> 00:34:37.255
I had a book that was a
solo hero called Nova.

00:34:37.326 --> 00:34:40.886
And I said, well now I want to
do a team, but I want it to be,

00:34:40.886 --> 00:34:44.376
you know the freaks and geeks
of the Marvel Cosmic Heroes.

00:34:44.376 --> 00:34:46.735
I want it to be a
true Marvel creation.

00:34:47.456 --> 00:34:49.906
And then I got this name,
Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:52.176
There was a team in
the 70s with that name.

00:34:52.176 --> 00:34:54.585
And we hadn't used that
name in a long time.

00:34:54.585 --> 00:34:56.626
And I'm like, I want to use
-- this name is perfect.

00:34:56.626 --> 00:34:59.216
You hear it and you know
instantly what they do;

00:34:59.216 --> 00:35:00.856
they guard the galaxy.

00:35:01.486 --> 00:35:04.836
So, one night I have
my official handbooks

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:07.456
of the Marvel Universe, they're
these encyclopedias, right?

00:35:07.536 --> 00:35:09.066
And they -- with
these bio-entries.

00:35:09.066 --> 00:35:11.766
And I have them open, and
I have them putting --

00:35:11.766 --> 00:35:14.536
and I'm going through and I'm
finding all these characters

00:35:14.536 --> 00:35:16.966
that I remember from
when I was little and --

00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:18.316
but we haven't seen
them in a while.

00:35:18.566 --> 00:35:21.096
So, I'm putting sticky
notes on all these pages,

00:35:21.096 --> 00:35:23.356
and I have them spread
out on the floor.

00:35:23.586 --> 00:35:26.986
And my wife comes in and she
says, Billy, what are you doing?

00:35:26.986 --> 00:35:28.086
You're making a mess!

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:31.746
I said, honey, I'm building
Marvel's next great team,

00:35:32.106 --> 00:35:33.606
and this is going
to be our star.

00:35:34.476 --> 00:35:37.566
And I show her a page and
she says, is that a squirrel?

00:35:37.566 --> 00:35:39.196
And I said, it's a raccoon!

00:35:40.746 --> 00:35:42.706
Back in the 80s there was
a mini-series called Rocket

00:35:42.706 --> 00:35:44.696
Raccoon that I thought
was just awesome.

00:35:45.086 --> 00:35:48.506
I mean it was a raccoon with
a big gun and a jet pack

00:35:48.506 --> 00:35:50.596
and a bad attitude, and
who doesn't love that?

00:35:51.076 --> 00:35:53.806
And I thought if we just
give them the right platform,

00:35:54.066 --> 00:35:55.266
then the world will love him.

00:35:55.506 --> 00:35:57.496
And I just continued
on that role

00:35:57.496 --> 00:35:59.556
and I found all these
crazy characters.

00:35:59.556 --> 00:36:05.356
Groot, a walking tree and Drax,
this weird, big, muscular,

00:36:05.356 --> 00:36:08.816
but not too smart assassin, and
Gamora, the most deadliest woman

00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:12.266
in the galaxy, and that's
Star-Lord there holding the gun.

00:36:12.646 --> 00:36:16.676
And it didn't have a huge
following, but the people

00:36:16.676 --> 00:36:18.386
that read the comic
really loved it.

00:36:18.386 --> 00:36:20.756
And I remember one
day my phone rings.

00:36:21.706 --> 00:36:25.066
Hello. It's a friend over on the
West Coast and he's like, Bill,

00:36:25.826 --> 00:36:27.376
the crew here in Marvel Studios,

00:36:27.846 --> 00:36:30.056
we really like your
Cosmic Books,

00:36:30.056 --> 00:36:31.556
especially Guardians
of the Galaxy.

00:36:31.816 --> 00:36:33.446
I'm like, that's cool.

00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:35.176
Cool bud, I'm glad you like it.

00:36:35.176 --> 00:36:37.906
No, no, we really like it!

00:36:37.906 --> 00:36:39.906
So, what does that mean?

00:36:40.406 --> 00:36:41.056
Can't tell you, bye.

00:36:44.686 --> 00:36:46.166
Click. Well, what do
I see months later?

00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:48.286
The movie poster.

00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:52.786
And I said, that's
our Guardians!

00:36:54.366 --> 00:36:56.366
They made it about our team!

00:36:56.726 --> 00:36:58.756
And it was remarked
about the film --

00:36:58.756 --> 00:37:02.246
and of course it was great,
the script was fantastic,

00:37:02.246 --> 00:37:05.246
and the director, James Gunn,
and the cast, just beautiful,

00:37:05.536 --> 00:37:08.686
it was awesome and --
but what was unique

00:37:08.686 --> 00:37:11.706
about it was the
content was rather new

00:37:11.706 --> 00:37:12.806
for a Marvel Studios movie.

00:37:12.806 --> 00:37:16.036
Usually we look back, if
you think about Iron Man

00:37:16.116 --> 00:37:19.316
and Captain America, we look
back at the original comics back

00:37:19.316 --> 00:37:21.996
in the 60s and even
in Cap's case the 40s,

00:37:21.996 --> 00:37:23.836
and we base the stories on that.

00:37:23.836 --> 00:37:25.406
But they were basing
this content

00:37:25.456 --> 00:37:26.686
from just a few years ago.

00:37:27.116 --> 00:37:30.136
And it was characters that
no one knew about really.

00:37:30.136 --> 00:37:31.426
When you see the
movie you walk in

00:37:31.426 --> 00:37:34.766
and assume these are new created
characters, but they're not.

00:37:34.766 --> 00:37:35.706
They're decades old.

00:37:35.706 --> 00:37:37.336
They're from the 80s and the 70s

00:37:37.536 --> 00:37:39.016
and even the 60s
these characters.

00:37:39.286 --> 00:37:40.046
And they're crazy.

00:37:40.046 --> 00:37:40.916
They're freaky, right?

00:37:40.916 --> 00:37:42.816
They're -- it's like
a raccoon and a tree.

00:37:42.816 --> 00:37:44.706
And people are like,
is this going to be --

00:37:44.706 --> 00:37:45.906
I remember the headlines;
this is going

00:37:45.906 --> 00:37:47.516
to be Marvel's first flop!

00:37:47.516 --> 00:37:48.606
I said, no it's not!

00:37:48.606 --> 00:37:49.686
It's going to be great!

00:37:50.276 --> 00:37:51.746
And the reason it was a hit,

00:37:52.366 --> 00:37:55.206
even though the characters
were crazy, and it took place

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.836
in space, they grounded
it in family.

00:37:57.836 --> 00:38:01.576
It was all about family
from the very first scene

00:38:01.576 --> 00:38:04.086
when Peter Quill is
kidnapped from his parents,

00:38:04.446 --> 00:38:07.806
all through the movie, when you
meet all the characters they

00:38:07.806 --> 00:38:09.736
talk about how they feel
like they're the only one

00:38:09.736 --> 00:38:12.706
of their kind, or in Drax
case he lost his family.

00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:15.916
They were all alone, but they
looked at each other and said,

00:38:16.146 --> 00:38:18.126
we will be each other's
new family.

00:38:18.806 --> 00:38:21.816
Groot goes from I am
Groot, to we are Groot.

00:38:22.236 --> 00:38:23.906
That was the message.

00:38:24.216 --> 00:38:27.656
And I think everyone, in one way
or another, can relate to that.

00:38:27.976 --> 00:38:31.016
As we grow up we often
move away from home.

00:38:31.226 --> 00:38:32.496
We leave our family.

00:38:32.726 --> 00:38:33.846
We go to school.

00:38:33.946 --> 00:38:35.006
We get jobs.

00:38:35.496 --> 00:38:36.116
What do we do?

00:38:36.116 --> 00:38:37.076
We look around.

00:38:37.076 --> 00:38:39.116
We find other misfits
like ourselves,

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:40.916
and we form new families.

00:38:41.296 --> 00:38:43.826
I think that's what is at
the message of it and it was

00:38:43.826 --> 00:38:46.796
in every scene and that's why
it was the hit that it was.

00:38:47.636 --> 00:38:50.956
Alright, I have one more
friend to talk about.

00:38:50.956 --> 00:38:57.156
And he is not on this cover, but
it all begins with this cover.

00:38:57.156 --> 00:39:00.176
Let's see, so there I was,

00:39:00.176 --> 00:39:03.466
at work when I was
still on the East Coast.

00:39:03.736 --> 00:39:06.446
And it was a February
and it was cold and rainy

00:39:06.446 --> 00:39:09.526
and I had walked 20 minutes from
Grand Central and I was soaked.

00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:13.706
And my phone's ringing and I
know I have to go to a meeting

00:39:13.706 --> 00:39:16.016
in 20 minutes and I
turn on my computer

00:39:16.016 --> 00:39:17.176
and I look at my emails.

00:39:17.176 --> 00:39:19.066
And there's a wall,
a wall of emails.

00:39:19.766 --> 00:39:22.316
And some of them were, like
I mentioned, that email,

00:39:22.386 --> 00:39:24.646
mheroes@marvel.com,
letters were coming in.

00:39:25.056 --> 00:39:26.216
And some of them were again,

00:39:26.216 --> 00:39:28.646
saying how they loved some
issues and hated some issues.

00:39:28.916 --> 00:39:31.336
And one subject line
just said, help.

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:35.476
That got my attention
so I opened the email.

00:39:35.986 --> 00:39:38.776
And it was not a letter
complaining about Rogue

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.576
and Gambit or Peter
Parker and Mary Jane.

00:39:40.576 --> 00:39:42.416
No, it was from a
mom named Christina.

00:39:43.866 --> 00:39:45.906
She said, I need your help.

00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:50.616
Said, my little boy Anthony,
who's four years old,

00:39:51.386 --> 00:39:54.166
this morning he did not want
to wear his hearing aid.

00:39:55.116 --> 00:39:57.066
We call it blue ear because
it's made of blue plastic.

00:39:57.396 --> 00:39:59.686
He said, mama, I'm
not wearing blue ear.

00:40:00.466 --> 00:40:01.456
And I said, why not?

00:40:01.656 --> 00:40:05.266
And he said, because super
heroes don't wear blue ears.

00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:10.676
So, Anthony at that age,
four, knew he was different.

00:40:11.846 --> 00:40:14.926
So, Christina tells me
that she says, yes they do.

00:40:14.926 --> 00:40:16.476
Super heroes where hearing aids.

00:40:16.476 --> 00:40:19.826
And he said, you mean
like Marvel Characters?

00:40:20.216 --> 00:40:21.576
And she said, yes of course.

00:40:21.576 --> 00:40:23.926
And he said, well
mama, which ones?

00:40:23.926 --> 00:40:26.586
She said, I'll tell you when
you get back from school.

00:40:26.586 --> 00:40:30.196
She drives Anthony to school.

00:40:30.476 --> 00:40:32.346
Runs back.

00:40:33.036 --> 00:40:34.636
Help! Oh, what am I
going to tell him?

00:40:35.006 --> 00:40:37.066
I don't know if any super
heroes wear hearing aids,

00:40:37.066 --> 00:40:38.986
and he can't know
his mom was lying!

00:40:40.096 --> 00:40:42.306
But I have faith, I think
there are some, right?

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.436
I'm not a liar right?

00:40:43.786 --> 00:40:46.686
So, there I am, and the
phone's ringing, like I said.

00:40:46.686 --> 00:40:47.946
And I go to the meeting.

00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:53.116
And my finger is going to the
delete button, and I stopped

00:40:53.456 --> 00:40:56.096
and I said, what
would Peter Parker do?

00:40:58.156 --> 00:40:59.176
Catholic guilt!

00:40:59.886 --> 00:41:02.206
What would he do?

00:41:03.026 --> 00:41:04.806
But that is seriously
something I would ask myself

00:41:04.806 --> 00:41:05.556
when I was growing up.

00:41:05.556 --> 00:41:06.846
I didn't really want
to be Spider-Man,

00:41:06.846 --> 00:41:07.926
I wanted to be Peter Parker.

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:11.246
Because even though he wasn't
perfect, he always tried

00:41:11.246 --> 00:41:12.896
to do the right thing.

00:41:13.676 --> 00:41:15.686
So, I said, okay, power
and responsibility.

00:41:15.996 --> 00:41:16.586
What can I do?

00:41:16.716 --> 00:41:17.886
Well, I don't have
a lot of power,

00:41:17.886 --> 00:41:20.126
but I have information
on super heroes.

00:41:20.126 --> 00:41:21.856
And I have access to images.

00:41:21.856 --> 00:41:22.306
I have that.

00:41:22.826 --> 00:41:23.846
So, what's my responsibility?

00:41:23.846 --> 00:41:25.156
I've got to use that
to help her.

00:41:25.706 --> 00:41:28.086
So, instead of deleting the
email I sent it throughout

00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:29.306
Marvel Editorial.

00:41:29.306 --> 00:41:30.216
I said, what can we do?

00:41:31.016 --> 00:41:34.216
Do we -- do you remember any
heroes that have hearing aids?

00:41:34.216 --> 00:41:35.906
Or could we even maybe
ask one of our artists

00:41:35.906 --> 00:41:37.986
to draw someone with
a hearing aid?

00:41:38.686 --> 00:41:41.056
And my good friend Tom
Brevoort, who was my boss,

00:41:41.476 --> 00:41:42.766
he reminded me of Hawkeye.

00:41:43.316 --> 00:41:44.636
He said, oh, remember Hawkeye?

00:41:44.846 --> 00:41:45.496
I said, you're right.

00:41:45.496 --> 00:41:48.436
Back in the 80s he was on a
mission where he was trapped

00:41:48.436 --> 00:41:52.236
by rubble and he used a sonic
arrow to get out of the rubble

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:54.116
and it burst his
eardrums and he was deaf.

00:41:54.516 --> 00:41:57.326
And his good friend Tony
Stark, being the cool inventor

00:41:57.326 --> 00:41:59.126
that he is, made
him hearing aids.

00:41:59.506 --> 00:42:02.026
And to this day he's
our deaf hero.

00:42:02.026 --> 00:42:04.486
And we've done stories
about him either wanting

00:42:04.486 --> 00:42:05.676
to wear his hearing aid or not.

00:42:05.676 --> 00:42:09.446
We've done whole issues in
sign language to use him,

00:42:09.446 --> 00:42:12.356
and to use him as a metaphor,
again to say that everyone can

00:42:12.356 --> 00:42:15.756
and should be a hero, no matter
what your challenges may be.

00:42:16.016 --> 00:42:18.796
So, I went through
our digital backlog

00:42:18.796 --> 00:42:20.796
and I grabbed this
cover, because it was one

00:42:20.796 --> 00:42:22.116
of my favorites when
I was growing up.

00:42:22.456 --> 00:42:24.496
And I sent it to Christina
and I said, Christina,

00:42:24.686 --> 00:42:27.846
I want you to show this
cover to Anthony and tell him

00:42:28.156 --> 00:42:30.996
that not only do super heroes
wear hearing aids, but a member

00:42:30.996 --> 00:42:34.296
of the world famous
Avengers wears a hearing aid.

00:42:34.476 --> 00:42:37.456
And if Anthony wears his
hearing aid we will make him an

00:42:37.526 --> 00:42:38.506
honorary Avenger.

00:42:39.546 --> 00:42:47.716
And I thought, [applause] -- And
I thought, okay, good deed done

00:42:47.716 --> 00:42:50.196
for the day, off
to my meeting I go.

00:42:51.896 --> 00:42:58.126
The next Monday I get in my
in-box, this piece of art.

00:42:58.366 --> 00:43:01.206
So, my friend Manny
Mederos, he saw my email,

00:43:01.206 --> 00:43:02.636
he knew I was sharing
the picture of Hawkeye.

00:43:03.146 --> 00:43:05.816
He draws this, on his
own time, for free.

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:06.896
He draws this over the weekend.

00:43:07.406 --> 00:43:09.506
He knew I sent the Hawkeye
cover, so he draws Hawkeye.

00:43:09.936 --> 00:43:12.586
And then he invents Blue Ear

00:43:12.586 --> 00:43:14.856
because that's what they
called the hearing aid.

00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:17.756
And I send that to Christina.

00:43:18.326 --> 00:43:21.066
And we -- I said, hey
man, that was awesome.

00:43:21.356 --> 00:43:22.806
And we said, yeah, okay, cool.

00:43:23.456 --> 00:43:24.876
Good deed done for the day.

00:43:24.916 --> 00:43:25.836
We're done right?

00:43:26.276 --> 00:43:29.986
No. Next day I get
this piece of art

00:43:29.986 --> 00:43:32.956
by Nelson Ribeiro,
Adult Blue Ear!

00:43:33.716 --> 00:43:35.726
With his mighty hearing
aid he's hearing trouble

00:43:35.726 --> 00:43:36.526
and he will go help!

00:43:38.196 --> 00:43:43.166
I send this to Christina and
we think, okay, we did it!

00:43:43.166 --> 00:43:43.706
It's awesome!

00:43:47.056 --> 00:43:51.236
Three weeks later she
writes me back and she says,

00:43:51.236 --> 00:43:55.136
Bill you don't know
what an impact this had

00:43:55.416 --> 00:43:56.386
on Anthony's life.

00:43:57.806 --> 00:44:00.256
I've had to print out these
images multiple times now

00:44:00.676 --> 00:44:02.586
because he keeps
bringing them to school

00:44:03.026 --> 00:44:04.226
and gets them all muddy.

00:44:04.226 --> 00:44:07.116
And now I had to put
them in plastic sleeves.

00:44:07.376 --> 00:44:10.186
And he brings them to school,
and he goes to a school or kids

00:44:10.186 --> 00:44:14.196
with hearing challenges, and
his other classmates see them

00:44:14.796 --> 00:44:20.116
and get so excited, and
they feel acknowledged

00:44:20.946 --> 00:44:23.706
and represented, and they
see themselves up there.

00:44:23.706 --> 00:44:24.936
And the teacher saw --

00:44:25.516 --> 00:44:35.546
[ Applause ]

00:44:36.046 --> 00:44:38.046
The teacher saw how
excited the kids were,

00:44:38.886 --> 00:44:41.826
and the teachers
organized Super Hero Week,

00:44:42.186 --> 00:44:46.196
where all the kids
could dress up.

00:44:46.906 --> 00:44:48.376
And as fate would have it,

00:44:49.226 --> 00:44:51.986
Anthony's grandfather
is a State Senator.

00:44:54.856 --> 00:44:55.686
Plot twist!

00:44:57.606 --> 00:45:00.256
So, one day the Senator is at
work and a reporter comes up

00:45:00.256 --> 00:45:02.746
and says, hey, do you
have any good, juicy,

00:45:02.746 --> 00:45:04.496
negative political
gossip for us?

00:45:04.496 --> 00:45:05.766
And he says, no, I
have a good story.

00:45:06.666 --> 00:45:09.086
These people at this company
took time out of their day

00:45:09.086 --> 00:45:11.896
to draw these pieces of art
and send it to my grandson.

00:45:12.646 --> 00:45:14.606
And it was covered
by the local news.

00:45:14.606 --> 00:45:17.766
And it started getting
picked up by more news sites.

00:45:17.766 --> 00:45:20.076
And then I have the New York
Daily News on the phone wanting

00:45:20.076 --> 00:45:21.836
to ask me about this,
and the New York Post.

00:45:22.626 --> 00:45:25.176
And from that day forward
I kept receiving emails

00:45:25.176 --> 00:45:27.206
from families saying,
I heard about Blue Ear.

00:45:27.206 --> 00:45:28.496
Can you send me the comic book?

00:45:29.786 --> 00:45:33.176
And I had to keep saying,
there is no comic book!

00:45:33.496 --> 00:45:34.776
There's just these
pieces of art.

00:45:34.776 --> 00:45:36.196
But I kept getting these emails.

00:45:36.196 --> 00:45:37.006
Kept getting them.

00:45:37.336 --> 00:45:39.986
And I bugged the hell
out of my bosses.

00:45:39.986 --> 00:45:41.586
And I kept saying, we
need to do a comic.

00:45:42.076 --> 00:45:42.926
We got to do a comic.

00:45:42.926 --> 00:45:44.026
There's a need for this.

00:45:44.026 --> 00:45:45.336
Families need this information.

00:45:45.336 --> 00:45:47.386
Kids need to see
themselves like this.

00:45:48.546 --> 00:45:49.766
So, I kept bugging them.

00:45:49.766 --> 00:45:50.486
I kept bugging them.

00:45:50.486 --> 00:45:51.526
And at the time I was working

00:45:51.526 --> 00:45:53.966
with a division called Custom
Publishing, where we would work

00:45:53.966 --> 00:45:56.736
with clients outside of
Marvel, whether it was Visa

00:45:56.736 --> 00:45:59.376
or Cirque du Soleil, or
Harley-Davidson, you name it.

00:45:59.816 --> 00:46:00.946
We would create things
like those --

00:46:00.996 --> 00:46:03.346
does anyone remember those
old Hostess fruit pie ads

00:46:03.346 --> 00:46:04.456
with our characters?

00:46:04.956 --> 00:46:07.086
Yeah! That was good stuff!

00:46:07.466 --> 00:46:08.576
That's the kind of
stuff we made.

00:46:08.576 --> 00:46:12.146
We would make comics
posters, advertisements,

00:46:12.146 --> 00:46:14.586
using our characters in an
authentically Marvel way,

00:46:15.016 --> 00:46:16.306
to also promote another brand.

00:46:16.366 --> 00:46:20.196
So, finally we partnered with
the Children's Hearing Institute

00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:22.526
and we made a comic book!

00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:25.686
But we decided, hey let's use
Iron Man front and center.

00:46:26.096 --> 00:46:28.426
Why? We want to get
everyone's attention.

00:46:29.016 --> 00:46:31.236
He's one of our most
famous characters now.

00:46:31.456 --> 00:46:33.906
But not only is he
famous, he's a metaphor.

00:46:34.436 --> 00:46:35.776
We used him as a metaphor.

00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:39.456
We said to the kids, hey, if
you have to wear a hearing aid

00:46:39.456 --> 00:46:41.936
like Blue Ear or if you have
to wear a cochlear implant,

00:46:42.686 --> 00:46:44.756
that's Saphira on the
other side, in the pink,

00:46:45.256 --> 00:46:47.126
because this is in the
tradition of Women of Power,

00:46:47.126 --> 00:46:48.866
we wanted to have
a female character

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:50.756
for young women to see.

00:46:51.226 --> 00:46:52.766
So, we said, hey, if you
have to wear a hearing aid

00:46:52.766 --> 00:46:54.816
or cochlear implant,
you're just like Tony Stark.

00:46:55.456 --> 00:46:57.926
He uses his tech to
be the best he can be.

00:46:57.926 --> 00:47:00.706
You can use your tech to
be the best you can be.

00:47:01.486 --> 00:47:04.876
And the comic came out, and the
day it came out I got emails

00:47:04.876 --> 00:47:07.516
from Italy and Australia
saying, thank you and asking

00:47:07.516 --> 00:47:09.496
for copies of the comic book.

00:47:10.496 --> 00:47:13.366
And that created
another wave of press.

00:47:13.366 --> 00:47:14.836
Yes, it did not stop.

00:47:15.186 --> 00:47:20.556
And one day I get a call and
I was asked to go on CNN.

00:47:21.676 --> 00:47:23.586
I'm like, alright.

00:47:24.256 --> 00:47:29.566
So, I'm in the limo
going into Manhattan.

00:47:29.616 --> 00:47:32.256
Mom. Yes Billy?

00:47:32.986 --> 00:47:35.786
Mom, in half hour I
want you to turn on CNN.

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:38.096
I'm going to be on.

00:47:38.096 --> 00:47:39.306
Billy, what did you do?

00:47:40.646 --> 00:47:41.376
No, mom it's good!

00:47:41.376 --> 00:47:41.856
It's Blue Ear.

00:47:41.886 --> 00:47:42.336
It's Blue Ear.

00:47:42.336 --> 00:47:43.936
He's going to be on the show.

00:47:43.936 --> 00:47:45.956
And actually, Christina and
Anthony are going to be there

00:47:45.956 --> 00:47:47.206
and we're going to meet up.

00:47:48.026 --> 00:47:49.646
And they're all going
to be able to meet.

00:47:49.706 --> 00:47:50.586
And then guess what.

00:47:51.336 --> 00:47:52.966
Then we're going into the
Marvel office together.

00:47:53.516 --> 00:48:04.626
[ Applause ]

00:48:05.126 --> 00:48:07.076
So, there's Nelson, who
created the cover piece.

00:48:07.526 --> 00:48:09.196
There's me, grinning
like an idiot.

00:48:09.406 --> 00:48:11.716
And there's Anthony,
and you'll notice he's

00:48:11.716 --> 00:48:13.046
in the whole Blue Ear costume,

00:48:13.046 --> 00:48:16.466
because mom saw how
excited Anthony was.

00:48:16.466 --> 00:48:18.276
And he felt like, I'm
going to be Blue Ear.

00:48:19.076 --> 00:48:19.956
And so he dresses up like this

00:48:19.956 --> 00:48:21.736
and now the town
knows him as Blue Ear.

00:48:21.736 --> 00:48:23.876
And guess who was
the Grand Marshall

00:48:23.876 --> 00:48:28.106
of his town's Halloween parade
last year; Anthony as Blue Ear.

00:48:28.686 --> 00:48:33.866
So, these Marvel characters;
why do we make them?

00:48:34.866 --> 00:48:36.086
Power and responsibility.

00:48:37.146 --> 00:48:38.166
What can we learn from them?

00:48:38.856 --> 00:48:41.256
We have to use our
powers responsibly.

00:48:41.626 --> 00:48:44.246
Now, you may be thinking,
Bill I can't climb a wall.

00:48:44.246 --> 00:48:45.906
I can't leap through the sky.

00:48:45.906 --> 00:48:47.916
I don't have rays
coming out of my eyes.

00:48:47.916 --> 00:48:52.916
No, but everyone in this
room is incredibly smart

00:48:53.446 --> 00:48:55.536
and incredibly gifted
with the skills you need

00:48:55.886 --> 00:48:57.556
to create good things.

00:48:57.916 --> 00:49:01.786
We have to use and realize
what our powers are.

00:49:02.156 --> 00:49:06.556
We need to use them to create
things, to reach out to people

00:49:06.556 --> 00:49:10.006
like Anthony, and kids around
the world of all ages like that.

00:49:10.336 --> 00:49:14.056
We must use our creations to
make the world a better place.

00:49:14.216 --> 00:49:14.936
Thank you very much.
