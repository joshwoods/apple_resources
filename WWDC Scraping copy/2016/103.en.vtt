00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:35.546
[ Music ]

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:37.156
>> Hello, developers.

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:38.806
What a great venue.

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:40.436
This is really great.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:41.956
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:45.236
It's been a long day, but we've
got some really great stuff

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:45.636
for you.

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:47.266
So I want to welcome you

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.896
to the 15th Apple
Design Award Ceremony.

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:54.266
And we've got a ton of
great winners this evening.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:58.146
And we'd like to, of course,
recognize their great work.

00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.136
The Apple Design Awards are all
about recognizing great work

00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:03.636
by people in this community.

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:08.556
And this is the moment when many
of you -- well, many of you --

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.716
some of you get to take home one

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:12.196
of the Apple Design
Award Trophies,

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:15.536
which everyone wants one.

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:18.596
And so we'll see who
gets one tonight.

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.026
But to start things off, I
just want to set a little bit

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:25.086
of context for the apps that
are going to win tonight.

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:29.386
The App Store opened
eight years ago.

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:32.636
In fact, next month it'll
be exactly eight years old.

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:35.126
And it was on July 10th of 2008.

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:39.556
And in those eight
years, apps took off.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:40.496
Right? They've taken off.

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:43.126
And today, we heard 2
million apps on the App Store.

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:45.556
But if we just go
back for a moment

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:48.736
to those first days,
it was pretty crazy.

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:51.366
I mean, it all started off
with the iPhone, right?

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:54.496
And we all remember
the first TV ads.

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:56.706
They were 30-second slots.

00:01:57.446 --> 00:01:59.636
And in those 30-second
slots, you had five

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:01.316
or six apps that were featured.

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:05.436
And so each app had five
seconds to audition with you,

00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:07.766
the customer -- with
you, the audience.

00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:10.446
And to make an impression

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:12.556
in five seconds is
a pretty big deal.

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:18.016
But what happened in those ads
was people would watch the ads

00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:20.286
and they would stop
everything that they were doing

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:22.626
and they would pay attention to
the app that was being shown.

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:23.866
And within five seconds,

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:25.746
they would have decided
whether it mattered to them

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:28.816
and if they were going to go
and download it or buy it.

00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:30.266
And I think that's
pretty impressive.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:34.826
And those apps -- basically, it
was those TV ads and those apps

00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:38.356
that created the phrase,
"There's an app for that."

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:39.796
And that phrase was born.

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:43.086
And it was during
that time way early

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:45.286
on that we saw enormous
creativity.

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:47.646
I mean, we didn't have
this thing before.

00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:48.476
iPhone was out.

00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:49.946
We had this SDK.

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:51.106
We didn't have that before.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:52.856
And we saw enormous creativity.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.996
We saw great games,
really useful

00:02:55.996 --> 00:02:57.806
and very valuable utilities,

00:02:58.086 --> 00:03:00.536
some pretty incredible
augmented reality,

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:03.086
and lots of other great stuff,

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:05.056
much of which was
really groundbreaking.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:11.166
And then, two years later,
the iPad was introduced.

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.376
And it was introduced
not far from here

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.486
at the Yerba Buena
Center of the Arts.

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:16.936
And I remember that day.

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.656
It was an incredible day.

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:22.106
But when the iPad
arrived in 2010,

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:24.606
it brought a whole
new wave of apps.

00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:28.376
And these were apps that
stopped us in our tracks.

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:32.186
I mean these were apps that,
when we first saw them,

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:35.186
they caused us to
pause and to be amazed

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:36.846
at what could be
done on this device.

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:39.816
And then we had universal
apps coming

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:42.576
and bringing functionality
from iPad back to iPhone,

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.816
and the experience of all
of the apps got better.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:50.646
And all of these apps early on
changed the way that we taught.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.936
They changed the way that
people learned with iPad.

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:57.166
They changed the way that we
shared, that we connected,

00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:00.556
that we worked, and that
we spent our day getting

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:01.536
things done.

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:04.336
These were transformational
apps.

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:06.286
And then more recently,

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:10.436
Apple Watch was introduced,
and Apple TV.

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:13.526
And with each of these, we
saw a new wave of apps coming.

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:17.266
And so now, as you've
heard several times today,

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:20.016
we've got four platforms
for you.

00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:21.896
And this is amazing.

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:24.836
I mean, for me, being
at Apple 16 years,

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:26.496
I remember when it
was just the Mac

00:04:26.806 --> 00:04:29.246
and there was some
great work going on.

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:34.776
And then everything took
off, and now the Mac is part

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.416
of that whole ecosystem.

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:39.046
And there's a tremendous
opportunity for you

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:40.746
with these four platforms.

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:43.776
And we're starting to see
some really great work

00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:46.036
from developers on
these four platforms,

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.556
and a few of those will
be honored here tonight.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:53.156
Now, tonight's winners
have created apps that are,

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:57.216
once again, that set a
benchmark for excellence.

00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:01.726
And they set a benchmark
for excellence in usability,

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:11.586
excellence in design, excellent
innovation, and excellence

00:05:11.586 --> 00:05:12.846
in technology adoption.

00:05:13.526 --> 00:05:16.286
And if you've been part of
the Apple Design Awards before

00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:18.036
or ever heard me speak, you know

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:20.816
that that's not all
there is to a great app.

00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:24.006
There's even more that we
look for in winning apps.

00:05:24.446 --> 00:05:27.086
We're always looking for
whether the app is compelling

00:05:27.086 --> 00:05:29.176
and leaves a great
first impression.

00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:32.476
We're always looking for
whether an app is engaging,

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:35.646
meaning it draws you
in and keeps you there,

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:38.096
and then gets you coming
back again and again.

00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:40.166
That's a big challenge for apps.

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:43.576
We look for apps that are
enabling, that allow you

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.866
to do things you
could never do before.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.046
We're looking for
state-of-the-art apps of course.

00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:51.126
We're looking for
accessible apps.

00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:52.976
We're looking for
localized apps.

00:05:52.976 --> 00:05:55.606
Because accessible and
localized apps mean

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.326
that those apps are available
to an even wider audience

00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:02.026
than they were prior to being
accessible and localized.

00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:04.556
And so there's a lot
of stuff that we look

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:07.696
for in winning apps, and these
are just some of the things

00:06:07.856 --> 00:06:09.226
that we watch for
in winning apps.

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:11.346
So let's get started.

00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:15.036
Let's start with apps that
were written by students.

00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:21.526
So you've heard today that we
had 350 scholarship winners this

00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:23.886
year at WWDC, which
is a record number.

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:27.296
And these folks, these
students, had to submit an app.

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:29.226
As part of the scholarship
process,

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:32.506
they had to submit an app that
was either written explicitly

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:35.156
for the scholarship
selection process,

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:37.066
or they could just
tell us about an app

00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.916
that they had already
developed and put on --

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:41.036
that was already
on the App Store.

00:06:41.036 --> 00:06:42.576
And we looked through
all these apps

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:44.436
and we found some
pretty cool stuff.

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:47.906
So tonight we want to
award two student winners.

00:06:48.556 --> 00:06:52.966
And the first is Linum by
Joaquin Vila from Mexico.

00:06:53.516 --> 00:07:11.896
[ Applause ]

00:07:12.396 --> 00:07:12.736
>> Thanks so much.

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:13.316
>> You're welcome.

00:07:14.516 --> 00:07:20.846
[ Music ]

00:07:21.346 --> 00:07:25.526
All right, so Joaquin
started developing this app

00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:29.106
after he had applied for a
job at a local game developer,

00:07:29.106 --> 00:07:30.426
and that hadn't worked out.

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:32.976
And he decided after
that that, like,

00:07:33.466 --> 00:07:35.676
he could just do
this on his own.

00:07:35.796 --> 00:07:37.536
He didn't need to work
for no other developer.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:41.846
So he decided to write his own
app, get it on the App Store.

00:07:42.146 --> 00:07:45.556
And I'd like to show
you this app.

00:07:45.676 --> 00:07:47.546
And before I do, I just wanted

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:52.036
to say Joaquin was a 2015
Scholarship Winner last year

00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:53.746
at WWDC, so probably
learned a lot

00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:56.646
about what you used
in the app last year.

00:07:56.646 --> 00:08:00.726
And he's also super active in
the local developer community

00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:02.146
in many of the meetups
in his hometown.

00:08:02.146 --> 00:08:07.156
All right, so I'm just going to
show you this on this screen.

00:08:07.156 --> 00:08:09.616
So what you're seeing here
is Linum is a puzzle game

00:08:09.796 --> 00:08:12.036
where the goal is
to complete levels

00:08:12.036 --> 00:08:13.606
in the fewest moves possible.

00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:17.566
And what you're trying to do is
take these line nodes and lines

00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:21.086
and pivot them around to connect
with nodes to solve the puzzles.

00:08:21.556 --> 00:08:23.396
And as the number
of nodes increases,

00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:26.246
complex puzzles challenge
even the best players.

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:30.346
And the beauty of Linum
is its simplicity.

00:08:30.346 --> 00:08:33.035
It's got a clean UI and
a simple set of rules.

00:08:33.035 --> 00:08:35.736
And with a smart
implementation of touch

00:08:36.046 --> 00:08:37.986
and approachable
progression system,

00:08:38.356 --> 00:08:41.966
terrific overall presentation
and use of Apple technologies,

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:45.816
Linum is without doubt an
Apple Design Award Winner

00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:46.306
for a student.

00:08:46.306 --> 00:08:46.926
So, congratulations.

00:08:47.516 --> 00:08:56.606
[ Applause ]

00:08:57.106 --> 00:08:57.436
All right.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:09:01.136
And our second student
winner tonight is Dividr

00:09:01.326 --> 00:09:04.976
by Josh Deichmann, Patrick
Pistor, and Erik Lydick.

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:13.686
[ Applause ]

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:14.646
Congratulations.

00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:20.556
[ Music ]

00:09:21.056 --> 00:09:22.556
So I guess just one of
you are here today, yeah?

00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:23.186
>> Yeah.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:24.536
>> No problem.

00:09:24.536 --> 00:09:25.146
There's three guys.

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:29.746
So all three of these guys, one
of whom is here, are students

00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:31.706
at the Rochester
Institute of Technology

00:09:31.706 --> 00:09:32.936
in Northern New York State.

00:09:33.366 --> 00:09:37.676
And at RIT, they went to an iOS
development challenge earlier

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:38.146
this year.

00:09:38.146 --> 00:09:39.106
And it was at that event

00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:41.906
that they started
working on this game.

00:09:41.906 --> 00:09:43.656
And Josh is the programmer.

00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:44.226
Is it Josh?

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:44.516
>> Yeah.

00:09:44.516 --> 00:09:45.656
>> Yeah, Josh is the programmer.

00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:47.276
Patrick is the designer.

00:09:47.276 --> 00:09:50.946
And Erik is the guy who created
the soundtrack for the game

00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.826
but also kind of kept you
guys on track, you know,

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.126
in terms of development.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:10:00.166
So let me just show you
this game for a minute.

00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:05.516
So Dividr is this fun and
addicting 2D arcade game.

00:10:05.516 --> 00:10:09.046
And it makes use of 3D
touch of variant pressure

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:13.856
to move the control
squares in and out depending

00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:15.606
on the pressure that
you apply to the screen.

00:10:15.896 --> 00:10:18.086
So the more pressure you
apply, the further out they go.

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.316
The lighter on you are,
the closer in they go.

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:24.546
And you're basically avoiding
these obstacles on screen.

00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:27.696
It's simple and compelling,
written entirely

00:10:27.696 --> 00:10:29.856
in Swift, supports Game Center.

00:10:30.126 --> 00:10:32.926
And it was, without a
doubt, a great choice

00:10:33.036 --> 00:10:34.846
for an Apple Design
Award this evening.

00:10:35.416 --> 00:10:35.976
Congratulations.

[ Applause ]

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:44.966
All right.

00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:48.176
So those are our 2 winning
apps developed by students.

00:10:49.076 --> 00:10:50.646
Pretty great stuff.

00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:51.476
And there were lots more.

00:10:51.476 --> 00:10:52.916
But, you know, we've got
to draw the line somewhere.

00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:53.926
Not everybody can win.

00:10:54.906 --> 00:10:58.866
All right, now let's move on
to your main winners tonight.

00:10:59.646 --> 00:11:03.386
We have 10 winners this
year, and 10 winners

00:11:03.386 --> 00:11:05.176
which are all super compelling.

00:11:05.976 --> 00:11:08.336
They're all incredibly
well-designed.

00:11:09.316 --> 00:11:12.306
They're all super
state-of-the-art.

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:15.396
And they're all optimized
for the devices

00:11:15.396 --> 00:11:18.386
that they were created
for and for the use cases

00:11:18.556 --> 00:11:20.066
that customers will
face with them.

00:11:21.486 --> 00:11:23.236
And so let's begin.

00:11:23.326 --> 00:11:24.846
The first Apple Design
Award Winner

00:11:24.846 --> 00:11:28.936
for 2016 is Frame.io
by Frame.io, Inc.

00:11:28.936 --> 00:11:29.916
from New York City.

00:11:30.516 --> 00:11:41.516
[ Applause ]

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:49.546
[ Music ]

00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:50.476
Congratulations.

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.996
Great job, guys.

00:11:52.996 --> 00:11:55.636
Great to meet you.

00:11:56.516 --> 00:12:01.746
[ Music ]

00:12:02.246 --> 00:12:05.736
All right, so Frame.io is a
video collaboration platform

00:12:05.736 --> 00:12:08.126
for teens working
together on film or video.

00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:12.886
And it lets these teens easily
share files, give feedback,

00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:17.336
review clips, approve media,
and do a whole ton of stuff

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:19.296
in that creative pro workflow.

00:12:19.296 --> 00:12:23.706
And it turns out that it's
really hard to do this right.

00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:28.116
And Frame.io nails it
by filling a big gap

00:12:28.116 --> 00:12:32.036
in the creator pro workflow by
solving this complicated task.

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:35.186
And to give you a better
idea of how this app works,

00:12:35.486 --> 00:12:37.526
I'd like to ask Michael
to demo it to us now.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:38.746
>> Thank you, John.

00:12:39.296 --> 00:12:42.296
So this is a typical
project in Frame.io.

00:12:42.296 --> 00:12:45.496
Now it's really media-centric,
so you can see all the media

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:47.576
in the lower half of the view.

00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:48.726
Now -- whoops.

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:54.296
So basically what they've
done here is they've made a

00:12:54.296 --> 00:12:57.626
UICollectionViewFlowLayout
with UIKit dynamics,

00:12:57.946 --> 00:13:00.386
and that really makes
this view come alive.

00:13:00.386 --> 00:13:03.816
Now at the top, you can see
all the project participants.

00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:07.086
Now this is a really fun
and interactive animation.

00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:10.286
And that's really cool,
and I can do it slow.

00:13:10.286 --> 00:13:10.716
There we go.

00:13:10.776 --> 00:13:12.696
And that's using core animation

00:13:12.696 --> 00:13:14.076
with custom curves
and key frames.

00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:17.006
That opens up to a table
list view where I can swipe

00:13:17.326 --> 00:13:20.726
to remove someone from a project
or leave the project myself.

00:13:21.956 --> 00:13:25.556
Now the media player is
really key to Frame.io.

00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:28.696
And so what they've done here
is they've implemented 3D touch,

00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:30.956
and they've done this in a
number of different ways.

00:13:31.236 --> 00:13:33.126
The first one is a feature
they call Touch Scrub.

00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:37.986
So on this clip of this mountain
-- all I'm going to do is scrub

00:13:38.126 --> 00:13:40.046
across this clip very lightly.

00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:41.176
And you can see I
get an overview

00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:42.536
of the clip really quickly.

00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:45.036
Now the other thing that they've
done is they've gone deeper

00:13:45.036 --> 00:13:46.246
and implemented peak and pop.

00:13:46.396 --> 00:13:48.636
So on this clip, I'm
going to push gently.

00:13:48.756 --> 00:13:49.486
That peaks in.

00:13:49.936 --> 00:13:50.896
And now watch this.

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:53.766
When I pop, it goes
to the same frame

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:55.546
into a new view --
the Comment View.

00:13:55.546 --> 00:13:56.556
Pretty cool stuff.

00:13:57.416 --> 00:13:59.236
Now the Comment View is

00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:01.666
where all the project
participants come in

00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:02.786
and actually collaborate.

00:14:03.126 --> 00:14:04.976
All these comments
are time-synchronized.

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:07.956
So when I touch something,
it actually goes to the frame

00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:08.956
where the comment was made.

00:14:09.386 --> 00:14:12.326
You'll also notice that all
the commenter's pictures turn

00:14:12.326 --> 00:14:13.026
to a Play button.

00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:15.556
So for example, here you
can see that Play button.

00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:17.696
If I touch the Play
button, it's a feature

00:14:17.696 --> 00:14:20.316
that they call Comment Replay

00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:22.536
where it will start
playing two seconds before

00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:23.766
and two seconds after.

00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:28.016
And then where the comment
is, the comment flashes

00:14:28.016 --> 00:14:29.216
and the phone will vibrate.

00:14:29.256 --> 00:14:29.976
One more time.

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.386
And here's the comment.

00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:32.986
That's where it is.

00:14:33.676 --> 00:14:38.136
So I'm going to let this video
play out just a little bit

00:14:38.136 --> 00:14:39.886
because I know that there's
something wrong in here --

00:14:40.516 --> 00:14:43.146
and there's a lion
in my surf video.

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:45.356
You know, like, really?

00:14:45.496 --> 00:14:50.226
So I'm going to put my
comment in, but I'm also going

00:14:50.226 --> 00:14:53.636
to go ahead and annotate
and send that comment along.

00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:58.496
So this app is incredible.

00:14:58.576 --> 00:14:59.986
It's written entirely in Swift.

00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:01.466
It's using the latest tools.

00:15:01.466 --> 00:15:04.006
It's using multiple storyboards,
storyboard references,

00:15:04.066 --> 00:15:05.646
auto layout, size classes.

00:15:05.706 --> 00:15:07.186
Did I mention it
was done in Swift?

00:15:07.746 --> 00:15:10.776
Did I mention that this
is their first iOS app?

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:11.856
This is a really great app.

00:15:11.856 --> 00:15:12.986
Congratulations to the team.

00:15:12.986 --> 00:15:13.976

Hitting the wrong button here,

00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:32.236
that's why we're
messing up here.

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:33.346
Apologies.

00:15:34.926 --> 00:15:35.576
We love this app.

00:15:35.756 --> 00:15:36.796
Congratulations, guys.

00:15:37.346 --> 00:15:39.926

winner tonight is a game.

And it is Chameleon Run by
Jan Ilavsky and published

00:15:55.716 --> 00:15:57.976
by Noodlecake Studios

watch some of these photos

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.076
to see people's studios.

I mean, we were amazed as we
looked through some of the shots

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:23.546
from the winners tonight.

00:16:23.726 --> 00:16:26.916
The places in which you
work are super creative.

00:16:28.066 --> 00:16:31.246
And we couldn't get
enough of this game.

00:16:31.246 --> 00:16:36.056
With a great soundtrack, fun
sound effects, super intuitive

00:16:36.056 --> 00:16:39.256
and natural controls
and great performance,

Chameleon Run is an
Apple Design Award Winner

00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:43.286
that you are not going
to want to put down.

00:16:43.846 --> 00:16:47.666
And to show you this game, I'd
like to ask Allan and Mark.

00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:51.976
>> Great. So thank you, John.

00:16:52.216 --> 00:16:52.876
Hello, everyone.

00:16:53.176 --> 00:16:56.576
Chameleon Run is
a super fast-paced

00:16:56.576 --> 00:16:58.966
and very challenging auto-runner

00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:02.006
with a twist that's
based on color.

00:17:02.006 --> 00:17:04.566
And it has a really
stunning visual presentation

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:05.776
which we'd like to show you now.

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.026
My colleague, Mark,
is joining us.

00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:10.925
He's going to play while I
tell you about this game.

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:13.846
So the objective of
Chameleon Run is to make it

00:17:13.846 --> 00:17:15.726
through the level in
the best possible time.

00:17:15.726 --> 00:17:18.276
And Mark is jumping from
platform to platform.

00:17:18.445 --> 00:17:21.616
But if you notice, when he lands
on a platform, sometimes he has

00:17:21.925 --> 00:17:24.286
to switch the character's color

00:17:24.566 --> 00:17:26.636
to match the platform
he's landing on.

00:17:26.636 --> 00:17:28.566
And that becomes
very challenging

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:30.696
as you make your way
through this game.

00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:33.226
OK, so that was a
very easy level.

00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:34.896
Let's do it one more time
because I want to point

00:17:34.896 --> 00:17:36.916
out a couple more
things on this level,

00:17:37.066 --> 00:17:39.226
especially the rendering
effects.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:42.306
That was something that we
really loved about this game.

00:17:42.306 --> 00:17:45.176
If you take a look at the
depth of field with the objects

00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:48.516
in the background, the
shock waves coming off

00:17:48.516 --> 00:17:51.016
of the character, and
also the smoke trails

00:17:51.016 --> 00:17:52.726
and just the particle effect.

00:17:52.726 --> 00:17:55.706
We thought that all of that
really added something visually

00:17:55.706 --> 00:17:56.606
to this game.

00:17:57.106 --> 00:17:58.686
But, OK, so we did
very well there.

00:17:58.686 --> 00:17:59.846
That was an easy level.

00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:00.856
And now Mark is going to go

00:18:00.856 --> 00:18:04.006
for something much,
much more difficult.

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.126
Go all the way.

00:18:06.246 --> 00:18:07.616
All right, here we go.

00:18:07.616 --> 00:18:09.146
Level 15, The End is Near.

00:18:09.886 --> 00:18:13.016
And let me tell you a little bit
about why we chose this game.

00:18:13.086 --> 00:18:17.156
So first of all, as I said,
we love the visual style

00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:20.426
and just the vibrancy of
the colors in this game.

00:18:20.426 --> 00:18:24.716
And it was so clear that so
much care and iteration went

00:18:24.716 --> 00:18:27.166
into the construction
of the levels

00:18:27.166 --> 00:18:30.156
and just fine-tuning
this content.

00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:33.296
Then the second thing --
Mark is doing very well.

00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:33.666
All right.

00:18:33.826 --> 00:18:34.256
Nice.

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:41.136
[ Applause ]

00:18:41.636 --> 00:18:42.566
Do it again.

00:18:42.566 --> 00:18:42.936
Go for it.

00:18:43.466 --> 00:18:48.486
So the second thing
is the replayability.

00:18:49.766 --> 00:18:54.756
Yeah, OK, that's me playing
now -- most of the time.

00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:57.576
So the replayability in this
game is just phenomenal.

00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:00.346
Most of these levels have
in effect a high road

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:01.636
and a low road that
you can take.

00:19:01.636 --> 00:19:03.116
You sort of can go up and down

00:19:03.256 --> 00:19:05.666
as you're progressing
through the level.

00:19:05.996 --> 00:19:09.366
But the game really
encourages you to go back

00:19:09.476 --> 00:19:11.716
and play the levels
over and over again.

00:19:11.716 --> 00:19:14.046
Maybe the first time through
you're going for time.

00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:16.846
But then it unlocks
different objectives

00:19:17.226 --> 00:19:20.846
to collect all the crystals or
to go entirely through the level

00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:24.106
without switching your color,
which imagine how difficult

00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:26.576
that would be on a level
like the one we just saw.

00:19:26.716 --> 00:19:30.636
And the third thing about this
game is that this is a game

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.346
that is great on
your iPhone and iPad,

00:19:32.396 --> 00:19:35.446
but it is awesome
on your Apple TV.

00:19:35.656 --> 00:19:38.196
We love how this plays
with the Siri Remote.

00:19:38.196 --> 00:19:39.686
That's what Mark is using now.

00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:42.416
It also plays great
with an MFi controller.

00:19:43.026 --> 00:19:45.776
And it's just one of these
games that is just fantastic

00:19:45.966 --> 00:19:49.576
when you see it on the big
screen in your living room.

00:19:49.876 --> 00:19:51.126
So that's Chameleon Run.

00:19:51.206 --> 00:19:52.466
It supports Game Center.

00:19:52.616 --> 00:19:55.856
It's localized in 8 languages,
and it's a premium title.

00:19:56.336 --> 00:19:57.706
Just pay once and play.

00:19:58.026 --> 00:19:59.276
So, congratulations.

Thanks, Mark.

That's Chameleon Run --
a super engaging game

that you'll be playing
again and again.

00:20:10.116 --> 00:20:14.976
All right, our next winner
is Auxy Music Creation

00:20:14.976 --> 00:20:15.956
by Auxy from Sweden.

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:40.546
[ Music ]

00:20:41.046 --> 00:20:44.216
Auxy Music Creation is an
audio creation app for iPad.

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:46.086
And the Auxy team realized

00:20:46.086 --> 00:20:49.376
that electronic music was going
mainstream, and so they sat down

00:20:49.376 --> 00:20:53.056
and started to develop this app
that allowed electronic fans

00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:56.966
to create some of their own
tracks on an iOS device.

00:20:57.516 --> 00:20:59.586
And this is a super
compelling app

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:02.216
with a clean minimalist style.

00:21:02.716 --> 00:21:07.696
And honestly inside of this
app, it's almost impossible

00:21:07.696 --> 00:21:10.086
to create something that
doesn't sound great.

00:21:10.526 --> 00:21:12.996
No matter what you tap
on, you get great results.

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:17.226
So I'd like to ask Michael
again to show us this app.

00:21:17.946 --> 00:21:18.666
>> Great. Thank you, John.

00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:20.606
So the first thing
that we really loved

00:21:20.606 --> 00:21:24.046
about Auxy was the really subtle
and unobtrusive onboarding.

00:21:24.396 --> 00:21:25.936
Now I'm not locked
out from the app.

00:21:25.936 --> 00:21:27.996
I can go anywhere I want,
but we'll follow the trail

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:28.846
and see where it leads us.

00:21:29.236 --> 00:21:31.176
So I'll double-tap to start
creating my first loops

00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:33.856
and drums.

00:21:33.856 --> 00:21:36.436
I'll start with some bass drum.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.786
That's great.

00:21:38.786 --> 00:21:40.516
So now it told me that
I can move some notes

00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:43.056
around by dragging,
which is really handy

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:45.256
because I just missed that one.

00:21:45.696 --> 00:21:48.556
So we'll do some high hat.

00:21:48.556 --> 00:21:52.396
And notice how quick and
how performant the UI is.

00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:53.046
It's really cool.

00:21:53.196 --> 00:21:56.576
OK, I'm going to add some
tom-toms on the off beats.

00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:00.646
That actually sounds more like
a kettle drum than a tom-tom,

00:22:01.126 --> 00:22:04.426
and that's great because the
onboarding is telling me how

00:22:04.426 --> 00:22:05.176
to change my kit.

00:22:05.326 --> 00:22:06.906
So let's see if I can find
something a little hipper.

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:09.856
Not that. Not that.

00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:12.776
70's disco -- that's
what I'm looking for.

00:22:13.046 --> 00:22:16.626
OK. So now what do we
need for 70's disco?

00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:18.006
We need some disco base, right?

00:22:18.126 --> 00:22:23.346
So let's add another loop.

00:22:23.346 --> 00:22:28.546
Great. So the UI is really
responsive because they built

00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:31.056
on top of UIKit, and that
is built on top of Metal.

00:22:31.176 --> 00:22:32.676
They also went ahead

00:22:32.676 --> 00:22:34.646
and implemented Grand
Central Dispatch.

00:22:34.646 --> 00:22:35.796
That really helps
with the performance.

00:22:35.796 --> 00:22:36.966
I'm going to add
one more loop here.

00:22:37.516 --> 00:22:48.556
[ Music ]

00:22:49.056 --> 00:22:50.376
Now I can do a lot with this.

00:22:50.516 --> 00:22:52.686
But what I'm going to do is
I'm going to open up something

00:22:52.686 --> 00:22:54.946
that I already have created.

00:22:55.516 --> 00:22:59.896
And then now we can hear how
these guys have gone ahead

00:22:59.896 --> 00:23:01.046
and created a really,

00:23:01.096 --> 00:23:05.116
really powerful synth
engine on the iPad.

00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:07.176
So let's listen to the drums.

00:23:07.706 --> 00:23:11.476
OK, the drums really -- they
have a lot of character.

00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:13.206
There's a nice reverb
tail in there.

00:23:13.206 --> 00:23:15.136
Let's add some bass.

00:23:15.236 --> 00:23:17.836
It's a really fat bass.

00:23:19.256 --> 00:23:19.976
Let's add some synth.

00:23:24.846 --> 00:23:26.676
Really rich, analog-sounding
synth.

00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:27.976

synth controls and I'm going

to change the character
of my synth

00:23:48.506 --> 00:23:49.526
and make it more aggressive.

So we're going to turn down
our attack and we're going

00:23:55.276 --> 00:23:56.226
to open up the filter.

what I was looking for.

So trying to form good
habits is difficult.

00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:59.506
The last thing you want is
an app that is complicated

00:25:59.506 --> 00:26:01.996
to set up, uninspiring to use,

00:26:02.216 --> 00:26:05.686
and pretty much itself a
reason for procrastination.

the possible six tasks

And you can see on the top
right "Practice cello".

So I miss playing the
cello professionally,

00:26:18.956 --> 00:26:20.606
but I just haven't
been practicing.

00:26:21.306 --> 00:26:25.526
I'm using Streaks to help get me
back to it, to help me remember

00:26:25.526 --> 00:26:29.116
to practice regularly because
I have a concert coming up.

00:26:29.496 --> 00:26:30.976

that for a few years now.

00:26:33.126 --> 00:26:39.016
So to see how I've been doing,
I can just tap on the Task icon

00:26:39.016 --> 00:26:40.906
for the calendar view here.

00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:43.376
I can also peak and pop onto it.

00:26:43.586 --> 00:26:45.676
And you can see June
was pretty good.

00:26:45.676 --> 00:26:50.136
But if I was to reveal to
you May -- not so good.

00:26:50.366 --> 00:26:52.876
So the crosses is where,
for whatever reason,

00:26:52.876 --> 00:26:54.256
I've decided not to practice.

00:26:55.276 --> 00:26:56.936
Coming back here
and tapping again,

00:26:56.936 --> 00:26:59.486
this is a summary
of how I've done.

00:26:59.486 --> 00:27:01.526
And you can see that
I'm currently

00:27:01.526 --> 00:27:03.416
on a streak of 15 days.

00:27:04.816 --> 00:27:06.176
Now we're back here.

00:27:06.776 --> 00:27:09.956
To mark a task complete,
all I do is to tap and hold.

00:27:09.956 --> 00:27:11.066
And there you go.

00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:13.046
It's like I've just finished
practicing for today.

00:27:14.036 --> 00:27:15.326
Now when I was outside earlier,

00:27:15.326 --> 00:27:21.336
I was reading the iOS 10
API disk documentation.

00:27:21.516 --> 00:27:23.486
So I'm going to go and check

00:27:23.486 --> 00:27:25.486
"Read the book" as
complete as well.

00:27:26.586 --> 00:27:28.966
Now Streaks is also
on Apple Watch.

00:27:29.406 --> 00:27:32.546
And it has Watch complications
right onto your Watch face,

00:27:32.926 --> 00:27:35.226
including one that is
really cleverly designed.

00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:38.756
It's based on a dotted
design which looks just

00:27:38.756 --> 00:27:42.366
like the iPhone app so that
you can tell from just looking

00:27:42.366 --> 00:27:43.636
at how the dots are arranged

00:27:44.006 --> 00:27:46.106
and which ones are
lit how you're doing

00:27:46.106 --> 00:27:47.606
with your task for that day.

00:27:48.806 --> 00:27:53.426
Streaks uses Watch connectivity
extensively, so my Apple Watch

00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:55.276
and iPhone are always in sync.

00:27:55.276 --> 00:28:01.756
Now Streaks is also considerate,
and I'll show you what I mean,

00:28:01.756 --> 00:28:05.316
especially in the way it
handles notifications.

00:28:06.516 --> 00:28:13.096
For instance, when it comes
to automatic time and my cat,

00:28:14.096 --> 00:28:17.766
Auzuki, Streaks knows that
I play with her every day

00:28:17.766 --> 00:28:19.416
when I come home from
work immediately,

00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:21.036
otherwise she gets quite cranky.

00:28:21.036 --> 00:28:22.916
And nobody wants a cranky cat.

00:28:23.606 --> 00:28:27.966
So it knows to remind me
at the same time each day

00:28:27.966 --> 00:28:31.116
but 30 minutes in advance of
that so that I can continue

00:28:31.116 --> 00:28:32.716
that streak and have
a happy cat.

00:28:32.826 --> 00:28:33.536
All right?

00:28:33.986 --> 00:28:37.596
And it also looks at
HealthKit to try and figure

00:28:37.596 --> 00:28:39.866
out when it is I
typically go to bed

00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:44.476
so that it doesn't send me a
reminder too late into my day.

00:28:46.066 --> 00:28:48.076
For when things are
going really well,

00:28:48.496 --> 00:28:50.176
you get encouragement as well.

00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:53.846
And in addition to that, Streaks
will suggest perhaps a higher

00:28:53.846 --> 00:28:56.706
goal so that you achieve
an overall greater result.

00:28:57.426 --> 00:28:59.926
Now, conversely, if you've
been missing a few tasks,

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:02.886
it will suggest an
easier-to-achieve goal

00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:03.976
so you don't end up giving up.

00:29:10.266 --> 00:29:14.026
OK, so Streaks is
a 5-star rated app.

00:29:14.026 --> 00:29:16.346
It's exclusive to iOS and Watch,

00:29:17.136 --> 00:29:19.266
and it was developed
using Swift.

00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:22.896
Bad habits form automatically.

00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:25.766
Streaks helps us come
up with good ones.

00:29:26.146 --> 00:29:27.496
I'm more confident than ever

00:29:27.496 --> 00:29:29.926
that I'll be playing my
cello soon in a concert,

00:29:29.926 --> 00:29:33.196
or to read many books, and
have a really happy cat.

We picked this app as a
winner for its simplicity,

00:29:44.226 --> 00:29:48.156
the great visual design, and
the excellent implementation

00:29:48.156 --> 00:29:48.866
on Apple Watch.

00:29:49.526 --> 00:29:53.056
They're localized into 25
languages and they're exclusive

00:29:53.056 --> 00:29:57.146
to iPhone, Apple Watch, and
Apple TV as TC just mentioned.

00:29:57.886 --> 00:30:01.946
All right, our next
winner is, again, a game.

00:30:03.556 --> 00:30:06.156
Lara Croft by Square Enix.

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:29.246
[ Music ]

00:30:29.746 --> 00:30:32.126
So Lara Croft Go
captures the spirit

00:30:32.126 --> 00:30:37.296
of this classic franchise,
and then reimagines it

00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:42.406
into this classy new app with an
innovative new look and turns it

00:30:42.406 --> 00:30:43.696
into this great adventure game.

00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:48.276
This is a great example of
a large developer working

00:30:48.276 --> 00:30:50.876
with a small studio
within their organization

00:30:51.376 --> 00:30:52.346
to give them the task

00:30:52.346 --> 00:30:55.476
of creating something
that's really well-executed

00:30:55.476 --> 00:30:56.926
down to the smallest detail.

00:30:57.286 --> 00:30:59.066
These guys have done
a tremendous job

00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:00.236
with this huge franchise.

00:31:00.936 --> 00:31:03.066
These folks are based
out of Montreal, Canada.

00:31:03.586 --> 00:31:06.786
Right? And it's great --
you've done a tremendous job.

00:31:06.786 --> 00:31:08.536
Now to show you this game,

00:31:08.536 --> 00:31:11.066
I'd like to ask Allan
to give a demo.

00:31:11.576 --> 00:31:12.526
>> Great. Thank you, John.

00:31:12.826 --> 00:31:17.336
So Lara Croft Go is a turn-based
puzzle adventure game that's set

00:31:17.336 --> 00:31:20.486
in the ruins of an
ancient civilization.

00:31:20.486 --> 00:31:24.246
And what we loved about this
game is how it took so many

00:31:24.246 --> 00:31:26.786
of the elements of the
Lara Croft franchise --

00:31:26.946 --> 00:31:31.316
things like the archeological
exploration, and the adventure,

00:31:31.316 --> 00:31:35.186
and solving puzzles and avoiding
traps, and Lara herself --

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:38.196
and reimagined all those things

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:41.706
into a puzzle game
that's perfect for mobile

00:31:41.706 --> 00:31:44.146
and beautifully designed
for touch.

00:31:44.376 --> 00:31:45.866
So I'd like to show you it here.

00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:49.326
I'm coming into a level
here that's onboarding me

00:31:49.326 --> 00:31:51.016
into a new game mechanic
that has to do

00:31:51.016 --> 00:31:52.566
with these rolling boulders.

00:31:52.936 --> 00:31:54.516
But actually, before
I even do that,

00:31:54.566 --> 00:31:56.556
just take this in for a moment.

00:31:56.556 --> 00:31:59.906
I mean, check out the
stylized rendering.

00:31:59.906 --> 00:32:02.506
I hope you can all hear the
ambient soundtrack here.

00:32:02.506 --> 00:32:03.656
It's just beautiful.

00:32:03.946 --> 00:32:07.076
And we really love
things like the attention

00:32:07.116 --> 00:32:08.596
to detail in the levels.

00:32:08.596 --> 00:32:11.406
And it has a really
unobtrusive UI.

00:32:11.866 --> 00:32:16.046
There's no virtual joypad
here to move Lara around.

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:20.106
To move Lara to the next space,
I just swipe and she moves.

00:32:20.246 --> 00:32:22.976
But, OK, so let's start
looking through this level here.

00:32:23.276 --> 00:32:25.256
Obviously there's this
boulder, and I have a feeling

00:32:25.256 --> 00:32:27.556
that if I step on
the trap -- yeah.

00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:31.936
OK. So, mental note, don't
step under falling boulders.

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:35.696
But we can put that knowledge
to work a little bit later.

00:32:35.826 --> 00:32:38.796
Isn't it cool how she kind
of hangs off the ledge there?

00:32:39.346 --> 00:32:40.866
All right, but I'm going
forward a little further here.

00:32:40.866 --> 00:32:41.696
Here's another one.

00:32:41.746 --> 00:32:45.496
I'm going to get it going,
but then I'll take a step back

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:46.696
and let it roll past me.

00:32:47.566 --> 00:32:48.656
OK, so I'm safe.

00:32:49.336 --> 00:32:51.796
And I come down now into
the next part of the stage.

00:32:52.086 --> 00:32:53.096
All right.

00:32:53.446 --> 00:32:55.636
So now in this part, I'm
going to pick up the spear.

00:32:55.636 --> 00:32:56.806
But I'm not going
to use that yet.

00:32:56.806 --> 00:32:59.466
What I'm going to do --
this lizard has woken up

00:32:59.526 --> 00:33:02.666
and I'm going to step back
and let him step on the trap.

00:33:03.466 --> 00:33:05.606
Bam! OK, no more lizard.

00:33:06.016 --> 00:33:07.376
So now let's go forward.

00:33:07.926 --> 00:33:09.996
And this next one wakes up.

00:33:10.086 --> 00:33:13.506
OK, now the game mechanic here
is that as I move once space,

00:33:13.506 --> 00:33:14.986
the lizard will move one space.

00:33:15.296 --> 00:33:18.696
And it'll follow me through
whatever path I take.

00:33:18.946 --> 00:33:20.676
So I'm going to climb
up the wall here

00:33:21.476 --> 00:33:24.996
and go a particular way to get
him right where I want him.

00:33:25.456 --> 00:33:29.106
Bam! It never gets old.

00:33:29.246 --> 00:33:30.526
All right.

00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:32.606
And I'm going to
dispatch the snake.

00:33:33.776 --> 00:33:35.166
Great. And that finishes

00:33:35.166 --> 00:33:37.926
out this particular
stage of this level.

00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:42.016
And, really, this is just
a taste of this game.

00:33:42.016 --> 00:33:44.596
There's over a hundred
of these different scenes

00:33:45.006 --> 00:33:46.606
with incredible detail.

00:33:47.086 --> 00:33:49.876
And it's just hats off to
you guys for this creation.

00:33:49.876 --> 00:33:50.926
It's really beautiful.

00:33:50.926 --> 00:33:53.896
The game supports
Game Center and iCloud

00:33:53.896 --> 00:33:56.626
to synchronize its progress
across all of your devices.

00:33:56.966 --> 00:33:59.786
It's localized in 11
different languages.

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:03.966
And it's a premium title with
a couple of in-app purchases --

00:34:03.966 --> 00:34:07.866
one to provide you solutions
to puzzles if you get stuck,

00:34:08.206 --> 00:34:10.166
and the other to
customize the character.

00:34:10.496 --> 00:34:12.085
So, again, hats off to you guys.

00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:12.876

00:34:56.576 --> 00:35:00.076
This is a groundbreaking
3D anatomical platform

00:35:00.286 --> 00:35:02.906
for medical students,
medical professionals,

00:35:02.906 --> 00:35:04.206
and lifelong learners.

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:09.156

it's disrupting traditional ways

00:35:09.156 --> 00:35:10.136
of teaching anatomy.

00:35:11.076 --> 00:35:14.026
For example, medical
professionals will use this app

00:35:14.026 --> 00:35:16.446
as a tool to help patients
understand what's going

00:35:16.446 --> 00:35:19.206
on with an injury or
an upcoming procedure.

00:35:19.636 --> 00:35:24.536
And that understanding actually
helps people heal better

00:35:24.536 --> 00:35:25.296
and more quickly.

00:35:25.986 --> 00:35:28.006
And I'd like to ask
my colleague, Chris,

00:35:28.006 --> 00:35:28.976
to show this to you now.

00:35:29.726 --> 00:35:32.726

completely blew us away

00:35:32.726 --> 00:35:35.886
with its attention to detail,
graphics and animations,

00:35:36.036 --> 00:35:38.626
and most importantly what
it allowed users to do.

00:35:38.696 --> 00:35:40.266
We love the iconography
throughout that.

00:35:40.496 --> 00:35:41.806
Check out along the bottom menu.

00:35:42.146 --> 00:35:43.656
The icons are consistent

00:35:43.656 --> 00:35:45.606
and representative
of what they control.

00:35:45.606 --> 00:35:47.306
I'm going to turn
some of these layers

00:35:47.306 --> 00:35:48.806
on so you can get an
idea of what's in here.

00:35:48.806 --> 00:35:53.516
The app has over 6,200
structures, so it's deep

00:35:53.576 --> 00:35:54.726
without being overwhelming.

00:35:55.316 --> 00:35:58.136
The content is progressively
displayed as you need it.

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:01.106
Just a tremendous
amount of content.

00:36:01.106 --> 00:36:03.216
But I'm going to turn
these layers off for now

00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:03.976
and move into the bone.

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:11.216
Notice the incredible
shading and textures.

00:36:12.006 --> 00:36:13.946
They're the result of
high-resolution scans

00:36:13.946 --> 00:36:15.286
and artist interpretations.

00:36:15.956 --> 00:36:19.506
The team has a skeleton on
staff named Hank, a cadaver,

00:36:19.506 --> 00:36:21.316
and a medical team
that they reference

00:36:21.316 --> 00:36:22.336
to get things just right.

00:36:23.226 --> 00:36:25.096
We love it when a team
goes that extra mile

00:36:25.096 --> 00:36:26.736
to make things particularly
beautiful.

00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:30.596
If at any point in the app
you see something that's

00:36:30.596 --> 00:36:32.616
interesting, you can just tap
on it to learn a bit more.

00:36:32.616 --> 00:36:35.476
Are there any Warriors
fans in the audience?

00:36:36.176 --> 00:36:38.176
[ Cheering ]

00:36:38.336 --> 00:36:40.566
This is the ligament that nearly
cost the Warriors their season

00:36:40.566 --> 00:36:43.256
when Steph went out with that
knee injury a couple weeks back.

00:36:44.386 --> 00:36:45.826
Now I'm going to
turn on some muscle

00:36:45.826 --> 00:36:46.966
so we can see some movement.

00:36:47.656 --> 00:36:53.116
I can select on a muscle group
and I can see how that works.

00:36:57.056 --> 00:36:59.336
I can adjust this
motion in real time,

00:36:59.766 --> 00:37:01.986
rotate, and see things in 3D.

00:37:02.336 --> 00:37:05.316
One of the reasons
we chose this app is

00:37:05.316 --> 00:37:07.806
because it leveraged the
performance of iPad Pro.

00:37:07.886 --> 00:37:09.326
With the new CPU and GPU,

00:37:09.326 --> 00:37:12.186
it allowed double the graphics
resolution of previous versions.

00:37:12.616 --> 00:37:14.326
Again, check out the
texture on that muscle.

00:37:14.326 --> 00:37:16.946
Just incredibly realistic.

00:37:17.516 --> 00:37:20.256
Now we could spend hours just
exploring content in this app,

00:37:20.316 --> 00:37:22.266
but 3D4Medical wanted
to allow users

00:37:22.266 --> 00:37:24.126
to create and share content.

00:37:24.606 --> 00:37:26.396
So at any point in the
app, I can start recording.

00:37:26.396 --> 00:37:27.266
So I'm going to do that now.

00:37:27.886 --> 00:37:30.406
So I'm now recording audio
and what's on the screen.

00:37:31.056 --> 00:37:33.946
I can use this --
if I was a teacher,

00:37:33.946 --> 00:37:35.306
I could create a
lesson for a student.

00:37:35.306 --> 00:37:38.906
Or if I was a physician, I
could record a common procedure

00:37:38.906 --> 00:37:40.106
to share with my patients.

00:37:40.596 --> 00:37:44.336
For the baseball fans, what I'm
doing here is I'm using Apple

00:37:44.336 --> 00:37:47.256
Pencil to pull back the
layers of the muscle

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:50.296
to show the ligaments that
were repaired during Tommy

00:37:50.296 --> 00:37:51.186
John's surgery.

00:37:51.796 --> 00:37:53.686
Imagine a physician
sharing something like this

00:37:53.686 --> 00:37:55.896
with a patient before
a procedure.

00:37:56.876 --> 00:37:59.206
I can then save the
recording for my own use.

00:37:59.206 --> 00:38:02.126
Or if I choose, I can share it
with the 3D4Medical Community.

00:38:02.826 --> 00:38:05.166
We love it when a developer
tackles a unique problem

00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:06.226

00:38:06.226 --> 00:38:07.936
This is a team that
looked at human anatomy

and what they could do with iPad

00:38:09.526 --> 00:38:11.706
and created a world-class
education tool.

and the uncluttered UI.

00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:31.786
It's exclusive to
iPad Pro right now,

00:38:31.786 --> 00:38:33.526
but it's coming to
Mac this summer.

00:38:33.956 --> 00:38:35.306
And it's unbelievable.

00:38:35.856 --> 00:38:40.376
All right, our seventh
winner is really beautiful.

00:38:41.096 --> 00:38:44.926
It is INKS by State of
Play Games from London.

00:38:45.516 --> 00:38:57.696
[ Applause ]

00:38:58.196 --> 00:38:58.716
Congratulations.

00:38:58.786 --> 00:38:58.966
>> Thank you.

00:38:59.516 --> 00:39:07.546
[ Music ]

00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:12.436
>> So INKS is from the makers
of Lumino City based in the UK.

00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:15.896
And after extensive research at
their local pub, they decided

00:39:15.896 --> 00:39:17.876
to create a new generation
of pinball.

00:39:18.676 --> 00:39:20.786
And if you think about it, INKS.

00:39:20.786 --> 00:39:23.626
is sort of a cross between
paintball and pinball

00:39:23.626 --> 00:39:24.876
with an artistic flare.

00:39:24.876 --> 00:39:26.816
And you've got to see this.

00:39:27.536 --> 00:39:30.626
So for the demo, I
decided I'd ask Mike,

00:39:30.726 --> 00:39:37.276
the evangelism resident pinball
expert, to show this to you now.

00:39:37.726 --> 00:39:39.496
>> Thanks, John.

00:39:39.496 --> 00:39:41.336
So right from the
Welcome Screen,

00:39:41.336 --> 00:39:45.046
you get to enjoy the
beautifully stunning

00:39:45.046 --> 00:39:46.646
and highly realistic INKS.

00:39:47.266 --> 00:39:51.196
The way they blend together the
colors here are really gorgeous.

00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:53.016
Now as I hit the
pinball through,

00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:56.296
you can see how it traces
those colors one into the other

00:39:56.556 --> 00:39:58.076
and draws it onto the paper.

00:39:58.256 --> 00:39:59.866
It's really pretty awesome.

00:39:59.966 --> 00:40:01.326
All right, let's play a game.

00:40:01.326 --> 00:40:03.956
Now INKS features
five different levels,

00:40:03.956 --> 00:40:07.976
each of which has 24 different
boards, each with its own set

00:40:07.976 --> 00:40:10.966
of obstacles, challenges,
and increasing complexity.

00:40:11.466 --> 00:40:13.736
As John said, I'm kind
of a pinball wizard.

00:40:13.896 --> 00:40:15.646
So I'll start with one of
the more advanced ones,

00:40:15.886 --> 00:40:17.606
but not so advanced
that you guys feel bad

00:40:17.606 --> 00:40:18.616
about your pinball skills.

00:40:20.276 --> 00:40:21.856
Now check out each
of these boards.

00:40:21.926 --> 00:40:26.066
They're each custom designed,
obviously handcrafted

00:40:26.066 --> 00:40:27.936
with a lot of thought and care.

00:40:28.256 --> 00:40:30.076
They're their own
beautiful compositions

00:40:30.396 --> 00:40:32.406
on their own before
you even start to play.

00:40:33.056 --> 00:40:35.736
And check out the gold, and
silver, and bronze pinballs.

00:40:36.026 --> 00:40:38.746
These show you how well you've
done in each of these levels.

00:40:39.196 --> 00:40:40.706
Now bronze is not good enough,

00:40:41.286 --> 00:40:42.836
so let me show you
guys how it's done.

00:40:47.516 --> 00:40:50.006
[ Laughter ]

00:40:50.506 --> 00:40:52.566
There must be a problem
with this iPad.

00:40:53.046 --> 00:40:55.046
[ Laughter ]

00:40:55.076 --> 00:40:55.976
All right, let me redeem myself.

00:40:56.516 --> 00:41:00.026
[ Laughter ]

00:41:00.526 --> 00:41:05.436
Oh, man. OK, this was a
lot easier in rehearsals

00:41:05.436 --> 00:41:07.506
when I didn't have
5,000 people watching.

00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:11.726
All right, so I'm going to go
to one of the easier levels.

00:41:12.066 --> 00:41:14.066
[ Laughter ]

00:41:14.116 --> 00:41:19.356
And just to show you guys
this, too, INKS offers hours

00:41:19.356 --> 00:41:23.966
of gameplay for more beginner
players -- of which I am not.

00:41:25.196 --> 00:41:27.266
All right, let's try this.

00:41:27.626 --> 00:41:30.666
Bam! That's how I do!

00:41:31.516 --> 00:41:33.546
[ Laughter ]

00:41:34.046 --> 00:41:34.886
All right.

00:41:35.386 --> 00:41:37.976
So what I want to show you
guys is some of the levels

00:41:37.976 --> 00:41:40.646
that really demonstrate
the highly realistic INKS

00:41:40.646 --> 00:41:41.896
that I was talking
about earlier.

00:41:42.586 --> 00:41:44.976
So there's that big color
swatch in the center.

00:41:45.096 --> 00:41:49.126
And each time you hit one, it
explodes and reacts to force

00:41:49.126 --> 00:41:50.776
and angle in its own unique way.

00:41:51.036 --> 00:41:53.986
And check out how the
colors continue to blend

00:41:53.986 --> 00:41:56.176
into each other and
darken as they go.

00:41:56.176 --> 00:41:59.506
The team spent a lot of
time studying water colors,

00:41:59.506 --> 00:42:01.976
the physics of it, the
dynamics, how it dries

00:42:02.036 --> 00:42:03.996
into the paper and blends.

00:42:03.996 --> 00:42:05.236
It's really gorgeous.

00:42:05.236 --> 00:42:07.746
And I'll show you just
one more level here

00:42:08.816 --> 00:42:10.796
that just shows off how,

00:42:11.056 --> 00:42:13.836
even though this is a
completely new take on pinball,

00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:17.106
they still respected a lot of
the sound effects, and the feel

00:42:17.106 --> 00:42:19.536
of the bumpers, and habitrails,

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:21.366
and drop targets,
and the flippers.

00:42:21.366 --> 00:42:23.826
I mean, it's really,
really amazing.

00:42:23.826 --> 00:42:26.306
And I'm probably not going to
have time to finish this one.

00:42:26.366 --> 00:42:27.916
I'll just let it go
down the drain there.

00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:31.206
But I think this really
demonstrates how you can take a

00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:33.556
traditional game mechanic
and with enough thought,

00:42:33.836 --> 00:42:36.216
attention to detail and
care, create something

00:42:36.216 --> 00:42:37.936
which is completely
fresh and unique.

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:38.976
Brilliant job.

00:42:38.976 --> 00:42:39.816
Thanks. Back to you.

00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:44.976
[ Applause ]

00:42:45.476 --> 00:42:46.006
>> Thanks, Mike.

00:42:46.616 --> 00:42:49.126
So it's obvious that we picked
this game as a winner tonight

00:42:49.286 --> 00:42:51.396
because it's really
well-designed.

00:42:51.396 --> 00:42:53.236
It's rich and unique.

00:42:53.236 --> 00:42:54.746
It's available in
five languages,

00:42:54.746 --> 00:42:56.326
and it's exclusive to iOS.

00:42:56.486 --> 00:42:59.676
And it's also really
interesting to note that a lot

00:42:59.676 --> 00:43:03.876
of the conceptualization and the
artistry was done on an iPad Pro

00:43:03.876 --> 00:43:06.366
with Apple Pencil by the team.

00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:09.466
So they used some other tools,
too, to come up with this.

00:43:10.266 --> 00:43:11.036
So that's INKS.

00:43:12.366 --> 00:43:15.346
Our eighth winner today
-- a fitness app --

00:43:16.776 --> 00:43:19.806
is Zova Personal Trainer by
ZOVA Group from Australia.

00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:35.546
[ Applause ]

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:37.086
Congrats, guys.

00:43:37.306 --> 00:43:39.146
Congratulations.

00:43:39.146 --> 00:43:40.906
Good job. Well done.

00:43:41.056 --> 00:43:41.436
Good job.

00:43:41.796 --> 00:43:41.976
>> Thanks.

00:43:42.516 --> 00:43:48.866
[ Music ]

00:43:49.366 --> 00:43:50.906
>> So Zova is a fitness
training app

00:43:50.996 --> 00:43:53.456
that helps people stay
active using motivation

00:43:53.456 --> 00:43:56.796
and great HD videos that
look awesome on Apple TV.

00:43:57.356 --> 00:43:59.416
And we loved it because
it's thoughtful,

00:43:59.416 --> 00:44:01.996
and in so many ways
they took little things

00:44:01.996 --> 00:44:03.266
and considered them deeply.

00:44:03.436 --> 00:44:06.146
And it's really great
on Apple TV.

00:44:06.146 --> 00:44:08.526
In fact, we like this app so
much that we took it with us

00:44:08.526 --> 00:44:12.896
on the roadshow this fall --
the Apple TV Tech Talks --

00:44:12.896 --> 00:44:15.256
and we used it as one
of the reference apps

00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:16.556
in our design sessions.

00:44:17.096 --> 00:44:19.726
And we'd like to
show it to you now.

00:44:19.776 --> 00:44:20.016
So, TC?

00:44:20.366 --> 00:44:21.026
>> Thanks again, John.

00:44:22.016 --> 00:44:24.536
Zova is a fitness app
that provides short,

00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:26.466
achievable, daily exercises.

00:44:26.986 --> 00:44:29.306
Now this team here
they've been early adopters

00:44:29.306 --> 00:44:33.526
of Apple technologies from day
1 with their initial release

00:44:33.526 --> 00:44:35.416
of the app and HealthKit
support,

00:44:35.996 --> 00:44:40.506
to then Apple Watch support, and
most recently Apple TV support.

00:44:40.506 --> 00:44:42.936
But they don't just
do it gratuitously.

00:44:43.836 --> 00:44:47.406
They only deliver on
unique experiences conducive

00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:49.826
to each platform
that feels natural

00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:52.866
as if it always meant
to be that.

00:44:53.246 --> 00:44:56.556
And today, we'd like to
talk about the Apple TV app.

00:44:57.116 --> 00:45:01.866
So with Apple TV, they didn't
just upsize the content.

00:45:02.696 --> 00:45:06.046
They took the Apple TV
concept to heart and thought

00:45:06.046 --> 00:45:08.806
about the whole medium of TV.

00:45:09.936 --> 00:45:11.576
TV is a major part of our lives.

00:45:12.086 --> 00:45:16.396
It's when we gather together to
enjoy content and experiences.

00:45:17.666 --> 00:45:21.466
Now workout apps don't have to
be lonesome activities anymore.

00:45:22.006 --> 00:45:25.006
With the communal experiences
afforded by Apple TV,

00:45:25.246 --> 00:45:28.846
Zova had to think about the kind
of content that they can create.

00:45:29.486 --> 00:45:32.416
This collection here called
Move Together is where you team

00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:35.136
up with your friend and
actually workout together

00:45:35.306 --> 00:45:37.206
and get fit together.

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:42.686
But Zova didn't just stop
at rethinking content.

00:45:43.466 --> 00:45:46.156
They also wanted to take full
advantage of the Siri Remote.

00:45:46.786 --> 00:45:49.486
As you will see me
navigating through this, it is,

00:45:49.486 --> 00:45:51.866
as you would expect, very
easy to find content.

00:45:53.576 --> 00:45:56.346
And focusing on elements
is easy, too.

00:45:56.346 --> 00:45:58.616
Let's go into this workout here.

00:45:59.336 --> 00:46:02.146
So, here, you get
a brief description

00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:03.586
of what this workout is about.

00:46:03.586 --> 00:46:06.146
And also, if you have
a look at the bottom,

00:46:06.256 --> 00:46:07.776
these are video previews

00:46:08.026 --> 00:46:10.616
of exactly what the
exercises entail.

00:46:11.526 --> 00:46:14.286
That way, you know what
you're really in for.

00:46:14.286 --> 00:46:16.666
But where the implementation
of Siri Remote really comes

00:46:16.666 --> 00:46:19.486
into its own is when you're
actually inside of a workout.

00:46:19.826 --> 00:46:20.856
So let's try one of these.

00:46:28.436 --> 00:46:31.226
Each workout starts with a
preview, so you're reminded

00:46:31.226 --> 00:46:32.906
of exactly what the exercise is.

00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:43.196
Now I've just pressed the
Pause button, and it responds

00:46:43.196 --> 00:46:45.546
as you would expect because
you will get interrupted

00:46:45.546 --> 00:46:46.556
when you're trying to exercise.

00:46:46.556 --> 00:46:47.486
That's just the way it is.

00:46:48.046 --> 00:46:50.476
When you resume the pause,
it will give you a countdown

00:46:50.476 --> 00:46:52.676
so that you can actually
ready yourself instead

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.216
of just jumping straight
into it.

00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:58.456
But where it gets really
interesting is I'm now pressing

00:46:58.456 --> 00:47:02.026
and holding onto the Pause
button, and instead I'm provided

00:47:02.026 --> 00:47:05.626
with a freeze frame so that
I can look more closely

00:47:05.626 --> 00:47:06.996
at the details on the screen --

00:47:07.266 --> 00:47:10.566
perhaps the exact
posture of the instructor.

00:47:11.116 --> 00:47:14.326
Now this is possible and is
beyond the standard controls

00:47:14.326 --> 00:47:18.046
because Zova has implemented
a custom AVPlayerLayer.

00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:22.396
Similarly, if I was
to swipe left,

00:47:22.626 --> 00:47:25.616
I can restart an
exercise very quickly.

00:47:26.196 --> 00:47:32.376
Or, if I was to swipe
to the right,

00:47:32.376 --> 00:47:33.976
you can see I can easily skip.

00:47:41.046 --> 00:47:43.046
Now you may have noticed
references earlier

00:47:43.046 --> 00:47:43.836
to Apple Watch.

00:47:44.536 --> 00:47:47.216
This is really neat.

00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:49.946
What's happening here is
it's taking my heartrate

00:47:49.946 --> 00:47:50.626
from my Watch.

00:47:50.956 --> 00:47:55.746
And through HealthKit and
my iPhone, it is overlaying

00:47:55.746 --> 00:47:57.846
that onto the live
video stream here.

00:47:57.846 --> 00:47:59.376
So that's my heartrate
you're looking at.

00:48:03.326 --> 00:48:04.246
Let's move along then.

00:48:07.506 --> 00:48:11.586
At the end of each workout, you
have an opportunity to, I guess,

00:48:11.586 --> 00:48:13.816
log your feedback as
to how you've done.

00:48:14.196 --> 00:48:16.346
And this is a really fun
use of the Siri Remote.

00:48:16.346 --> 00:48:19.896
You can either give it a big
thumbs-up for it has gone well,

00:48:20.196 --> 00:48:21.776
or if it's gone less well --

00:48:21.776 --> 00:48:27.406
and in my case, I tend to
quiver my lips a little, too.

00:48:27.406 --> 00:48:27.976
So there you go.

00:48:28.516 --> 00:48:31.646
[ Laughter ]

00:48:32.146 --> 00:48:34.676
We really like Zova's
reimagination of content

00:48:34.906 --> 00:48:38.056
for the lounge and living
room, and the extensive use

00:48:38.056 --> 00:48:40.446
of the features of
the Apple Siri Remote

00:48:40.686 --> 00:48:42.226
so that you have a true

00:48:42.226 --> 00:48:45.536
and unique Apple TV
experience in your lounge room.

00:48:45.536 --> 00:48:52.436
Built using Swift, Zova
is exclusive to iOS,

00:48:52.436 --> 00:48:53.986
Watch OS, and Apple TV.

00:48:54.786 --> 00:48:57.016
Congratulations to
the team at ZOVA.

00:48:57.016 --> 00:48:57.946
And back to you, John.

00:48:58.516 --> 00:49:03.886
[ Applause ]

00:49:04.386 --> 00:49:06.416
>> All right, that's Zova.

00:49:06.876 --> 00:49:10.896
The next winner this
afternoon is Ulysses

00:49:10.996 --> 00:49:12.976
by the Soulmen from Germany.

00:49:13.516 --> 00:49:23.516
[ Applause ]

00:49:24.516 --> 00:49:34.546
[ Music ]

00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:37.646
So Ulysses is a powerful
text editor for writers

00:49:37.646 --> 00:49:40.286
of all kinds -- journalists,
bloggers, you name it.

00:49:40.336 --> 00:49:44.116
And it's designed specifically
to cover all aspects

00:49:44.116 --> 00:49:45.286
of the writing process.

00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:47.376
And we picked it as a winner

00:49:47.376 --> 00:49:49.736
because it's a tool
that's optimized

00:49:49.736 --> 00:49:51.786
for writing without distraction.

00:49:52.106 --> 00:49:54.936
The entire UI of the
operating system goes away

00:49:54.936 --> 00:49:57.116
and you're just working
with your words.

00:49:57.716 --> 00:50:00.336
And the execution of
this app is so great.

00:50:00.336 --> 00:50:03.076
It allows you to work
on any of our devices.

00:50:03.456 --> 00:50:06.436
You can choose to start on
the Mac, then move to iPad,

00:50:06.856 --> 00:50:09.016
then move to iPhone,
and move back.

00:50:09.016 --> 00:50:11.596
And you get that
distraction-free experience

00:50:11.656 --> 00:50:13.356
on any of those devices.

00:50:13.956 --> 00:50:16.626
And to show this app to you, I'd
like to turn it over to Michael.

00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:18.076
>> Thank you, John.

00:50:18.676 --> 00:50:20.586
So Ulysses is a focused

00:50:20.586 --> 00:50:22.806
and distraction-free
writing environment.

00:50:23.396 --> 00:50:26.416
It has the power of
classic word processers

00:50:26.416 --> 00:50:29.176
with flexible organization
and management tools.

00:50:29.176 --> 00:50:32.926
Now it's a super clean writing
experience and it has features

00:50:32.926 --> 00:50:34.316
to help you through the task.

00:50:34.756 --> 00:50:36.066
So the first thing, for example,

00:50:36.476 --> 00:50:38.836
is I can highlight
the current line.

00:50:38.836 --> 00:50:40.596
That should look familiar.

00:50:41.266 --> 00:50:44.136
We can also show
paragraph numbers.

00:50:45.266 --> 00:50:47.616
Now Ulysses is based
on Markdown.

00:50:48.066 --> 00:50:49.236
And what Markdown is --

00:50:49.796 --> 00:50:52.236
it's a markup language
that uses plain text

00:50:52.236 --> 00:50:54.196
and special characters
to set semantics.

00:50:54.476 --> 00:50:57.066
So, for example, here you
can see that in this copy

00:50:57.066 --> 00:50:59.006
of the Apple TV human
interface guidelines

00:50:59.796 --> 00:51:02.186
that navigation has
two hash marks,

00:51:02.186 --> 00:51:03.956
and that is a second-level
header.

00:51:04.406 --> 00:51:08.486
By the way, this tear-off menu
is from their use of AppKit.

00:51:09.156 --> 00:51:13.056
Now Ulysses also presents images
and URLs in a user-friendly

00:51:13.056 --> 00:51:14.996
and vey distraction-free way.

00:51:16.636 --> 00:51:19.536
Now Ulysses is really
customizable.

00:51:19.536 --> 00:51:21.636
For me, for example, I
like working at night.

00:51:21.636 --> 00:51:24.926
I get creative after
dark, so I like Dark Mode.

00:51:25.166 --> 00:51:26.726
If Dark Mode doesn't
work for you,

00:51:27.076 --> 00:51:30.196
there are customizable themes,
or you can download themes

00:51:30.196 --> 00:51:31.686
from the Ulysses User Community.

00:51:32.206 --> 00:51:34.696
Now Markdown is an open
standard, so they also ship

00:51:34.736 --> 00:51:36.656
with a number of different
markdown definitions,

00:51:36.656 --> 00:51:38.196
or you can create your own.

00:51:38.486 --> 00:51:40.046
Both custom markdown definitions

00:51:40.126 --> 00:51:43.926
and custom themes are all
synchronized using iCloud.

00:51:45.256 --> 00:51:51.956
OK. Now this is a modern,
single-window, multicolumn app.

00:51:52.366 --> 00:51:54.066
So if you take a look all
the way on the left side,

00:51:54.066 --> 00:51:55.286
that's my library column.

00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:56.266
And in my library column,

00:51:56.266 --> 00:51:57.946
that's where I manage
all of my writing.

00:51:58.316 --> 00:52:02.196
For example, here I have a
group of public domain books.

00:52:02.196 --> 00:52:04.466
I also have filters.

00:52:04.466 --> 00:52:07.316
Now a filter is sort
of a persistent search.

00:52:07.406 --> 00:52:09.796
So here, for example, I'm
searching for the word "Ishmael"

00:52:09.796 --> 00:52:10.776
or the name "Ishmael".

00:52:11.136 --> 00:52:13.616
And all of the occurrences
come up, most of them

00:52:13.616 --> 00:52:14.646
from the book "Moby Dick".

00:52:14.646 --> 00:52:16.426
And I can also change the icon

00:52:16.426 --> 00:52:17.836
to something a little
bit more appropriate.

00:52:18.696 --> 00:52:20.826
I can also do ad hoc searches.

00:52:21.566 --> 00:52:25.916
So, for example, I know that
there is a single occurrence

00:52:25.916 --> 00:52:27.756
of the word "galleon"
in all of these books.

00:52:27.756 --> 00:52:28.416
And if I take a look

00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:31.266
at the search base using
the statistics feature,

00:52:31.546 --> 00:52:35.006
I can see that I just searched
through about 1.3 million words,

00:52:35.356 --> 00:52:36.946
most of those written
by James Joyce.

00:52:37.326 --> 00:52:39.916
And that's thanks to their
implementation of Spotlight

00:52:39.916 --> 00:52:41.376
and Grand Central Dispatch.

00:52:42.216 --> 00:52:44.336
Okie dokie.

00:52:45.386 --> 00:52:49.416
So let's go back here.

00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:50.686
Let's kill this.

00:52:50.686 --> 00:52:52.236
Let's go back to
our Apple TV HIG.

00:52:53.016 --> 00:52:55.216
All right.

00:52:56.216 --> 00:52:59.616
Now Ulysses is
delivery-agnostic,

00:52:59.666 --> 00:53:01.486
so it doesn't matter where
you're going to deliver from.

00:53:01.486 --> 00:53:03.016
You can preview in a number

00:53:03.016 --> 00:53:05.676
of different formats
powered by TextKit, PDFKit.

00:53:05.676 --> 00:53:08.256
It can even publish
directly to Medium.

00:53:08.256 --> 00:53:10.836
But one of the things

00:53:10.836 --> 00:53:12.376
that they've done is
they've allowed you

00:53:12.376 --> 00:53:14.226
to make your own CSS files

00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:18.166
to style the preview
exactly the way you need it.

00:53:18.166 --> 00:53:20.306
So, for example, here
I have an HTML preview

00:53:20.306 --> 00:53:22.216
and I happen to have
an Apple CSS.

00:53:22.216 --> 00:53:30.566
And I can apply that
to my preview, like so.

00:53:30.566 --> 00:53:34.076
And you can see how the
Apple TV HIG would look

00:53:34.736 --> 00:53:36.646
on an Apple website.

00:53:37.596 --> 00:53:38.336
All right.

00:53:38.806 --> 00:53:43.636
Now as John mentioned, Ulysses
is available on OS X and iOS,

00:53:43.816 --> 00:53:47.506
eventually Mac OS I hope.

00:53:47.506 --> 00:53:49.636
It implements Handoff.

00:53:49.636 --> 00:53:51.296
It's available in 7 languages.

00:53:51.676 --> 00:53:52.786
We love this app.

00:53:52.786 --> 00:53:53.996
We use this app at Apple.

00:53:54.286 --> 00:53:55.486
We're so happy and so proud

00:53:55.486 --> 00:53:58.316
that you guys have created
this and won an ADA.

00:53:58.316 --> 00:53:59.516
So, congratulations.

00:53:59.516 --> 00:53:59.866
Back to you, John.

00:54:00.516 --> 00:54:05.796
[ Applause ]

00:54:06.296 --> 00:54:07.916
>> So, as Michael said
-- thank you, Michael.

00:54:07.946 --> 00:54:10.786
As Michael said, Ulysses is
a great example of an app

00:54:10.846 --> 00:54:16.586
that takes advantage of iOS and
OS X, Handoff, iCloud and more

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:18.536
to deliver an optimized
experience

00:54:18.536 --> 00:54:19.836
on each of these platforms.

00:54:20.216 --> 00:54:22.626
We talked about this new
opportunity of four platforms,

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:24.456
and this is an app
that does a great job

00:54:24.456 --> 00:54:25.936
of heading in that direction.

00:54:26.166 --> 00:54:26.946
Congratulations.

00:54:27.506 --> 00:54:30.546
All right, our last
winner today is an app

00:54:30.546 --> 00:54:32.376
that is incredibly
state-of-the-art

00:54:32.446 --> 00:54:34.506
and incredibly accessible.

00:54:35.216 --> 00:54:38.976
It is djay Pro by
Algoriddim from Germany.

00:54:39.516 --> 00:54:49.576
[ Applause ]

00:54:50.076 --> 00:54:51.656
You've been here before.

00:54:51.656 --> 00:54:52.556
You've been here before, sir.

00:54:53.976 --> 00:54:55.626
Good. Congratulations.

00:54:56.516 --> 00:55:02.596
[ Music ]

00:55:03.096 --> 00:55:04.796
All right, so djay Pro is one

00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:09.206
of the first professional-grade
apps to fully leverage the audio

00:55:09.206 --> 00:55:11.676
and video capabilities
of the new iPad Pro.

00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:15.936
And these guys already won an
Apple Design Award in 2011,

00:55:16.226 --> 00:55:18.416
but they have done
so much since then

00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:20.356
and they continue to innovate.

00:55:20.536 --> 00:55:23.276
And they have consistently
stayed in lockstep

00:55:23.336 --> 00:55:25.976
with us every time
we released a new OS,

00:55:25.976 --> 00:55:28.506
every time there's
some new technology,

00:55:28.736 --> 00:55:32.166
and every time there's
a new device to support.

00:55:32.166 --> 00:55:33.086
Really impressive.

00:55:33.466 --> 00:55:36.586
And we love this app because
it sets new benchmarks

00:55:36.586 --> 00:55:40.616
for performance, for features,
for use of Apple technology,

00:55:40.926 --> 00:55:45.096
for multi-device support,
and for accessibility.

00:55:45.186 --> 00:55:49.186
And I'd like to ask Ryan
to show the app off now.

00:55:50.026 --> 00:55:50.936
>> Hey. Thanks, John.

00:55:51.096 --> 00:55:52.186
My name is Ryan Dour.

00:55:52.186 --> 00:55:54.246
I'm an engineer on the
Accessibility Team here

00:55:54.246 --> 00:55:56.166
at Apple, but I'm also a deejay.

00:55:56.506 --> 00:55:58.376
All of my life, I've
been visually impaired.

00:55:58.376 --> 00:56:00.156
But during high school
and college,

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:02.486
I lost most of my
remaining usable vision.

00:56:03.076 --> 00:56:05.166
I've always deejayed with
CD players and mixers

00:56:05.196 --> 00:56:07.526
because they offer a
hands-on tactile experience.

00:56:08.146 --> 00:56:10.136
However, with the rise
of digital deejaying,

00:56:10.136 --> 00:56:11.646
I was feeling pretty left out.

00:56:12.676 --> 00:56:15.596
About a year ago, I got my
hands on djay Pro for the Mac

00:56:15.596 --> 00:56:17.866
and this external deejay
controller and I got back

00:56:17.866 --> 00:56:19.736
into it, and it's been
a great time since.

00:56:19.736 --> 00:56:25.816
However, djay Pro for iPad
takes accessible deejaying

00:56:25.816 --> 00:56:28.266
to a whole new level, and I'd
love to show it to you now.

00:56:29.026 --> 00:56:33.376
So, over here, I have an
iPad Pro running djay Pro

00:56:33.576 --> 00:56:34.796
and this external mixer.

00:56:34.846 --> 00:56:37.036
I'm going to go ahead and
throw on my headphones now.

00:56:37.906 --> 00:56:41.206
So, here's the thing
that's interesting.

00:56:41.206 --> 00:56:42.746
The external deejay
controller acts

00:56:42.746 --> 00:56:44.516
as an extension of
the onscreen UI.

00:56:45.526 --> 00:56:48.526
And so I can use it
to really create kind

00:56:48.526 --> 00:56:49.856
of a pretty cool performance.

00:56:49.916 --> 00:56:53.226
Also, you're probably wondering
what of this can I see.

00:56:53.226 --> 00:56:56.426
Not much. I pretty much can see
the light coming from the screen

00:56:56.426 --> 00:56:58.406
and some of the, you know,
colorful lights coming

00:56:58.406 --> 00:57:00.926
from the deejay controller,
but that's about it.

00:57:00.926 --> 00:57:03.066
So knowing that, we're
going to use VoiceOver

00:57:03.066 --> 00:57:04.106
to control this interface.

00:57:04.106 --> 00:57:10.006
Let's go ahead and
get the music started.

00:57:10.296 --> 00:57:12.756
OK, so the first thing
I'd like to point out is

00:57:12.756 --> 00:57:13.596
that I have access

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.036
to information I've
never had before.

00:57:15.036 --> 00:57:16.556
For example, the time.

00:57:16.556 --> 00:57:18.266
How much time is
left on this track?

00:57:18.266 --> 00:57:21.146
Let's find out.

00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:21.936
That's perfect.

00:57:21.936 --> 00:57:24.226
OK. So I'm the deejay, I'm
supposed to keep the music going

00:57:24.226 --> 00:57:25.746
and now I have that
kind of information.

00:57:26.056 --> 00:57:27.946
I also can use these
tempo sliders.

00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:33.316
For example, if I touch it
right now -- hold on a second.

00:57:34.256 --> 00:57:36.176
So we hear it's at a
standard playback speed.

00:57:36.176 --> 00:57:38.296
But if I slow it down
using the deejay controller

00:57:38.296 --> 00:57:43.626
and I touch it again,

00:57:44.666 --> 00:57:47.456
we can hear exactly how far
I slowed that track down.

00:57:47.456 --> 00:57:48.206
That's really cool.

00:57:48.686 --> 00:57:51.136
I also can use these
multidimensional effects pads.

00:57:51.196 --> 00:57:52.846
For example, if I touch
it the first time --

00:57:53.736 --> 00:57:55.806
but the second time.

00:58:01.176 --> 00:58:02.176
Really cool stuff, right?

00:58:02.246 --> 00:58:06.016
So between these effects
pads, this external controller

00:58:06.016 --> 00:58:07.266
and all this accessible UI,

00:58:07.266 --> 00:58:08.886
I can do a pretty
cool performance.

00:58:08.886 --> 00:58:10.566
So I'd like to go ahead
and ask the stage here

00:58:10.566 --> 00:58:13.776
to please take VoiceOver
off of the PA systems --

00:58:13.776 --> 00:58:15.566
that it's only available
to me and my headphones.

00:58:17.746 --> 00:58:18.746
Cool. Thank you very much.

00:58:18.746 --> 00:58:19.916
And I'm going to
mix for you now.

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:20.826
Here we go.

00:58:21.516 --> 00:58:44.516

00:58:57.516 --> 00:59:11.756

00:59:12.256 --> 00:59:13.856
So that's djay Pro
from Algoriddim.

00:59:24.216 --> 00:59:25.166
>> Ryan, you're the man.

00:59:25.446 --> 00:59:26.306
>> I've got to tell you --

00:59:26.426 --> 00:59:29.286
this is an incredible
custom user interface.

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:33.196
They did not use UIKit
with this interface at all.

00:59:33.196 --> 00:59:35.456
They didn't get any of their
accessibility for free.

00:59:35.866 --> 00:59:38.566
Considering that,
their implementation

00:59:38.676 --> 00:59:43.046
of our accessibility APIs is
nothing less than spectacular.

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.796
So I want to let everybody know,

00:59:44.796 --> 00:59:46.956
and especially all the
visually-impaired deejays

00:59:46.956 --> 00:59:50.946
out there, this app has
really enriched my life.

00:59:50.946 --> 00:59:53.986
So I absolutely cannot
wait to see what the rest

00:59:53.986 --> 00:59:55.796
of you developers
make accessible next!

00:59:55.796 --> 00:59:57.576
Thank you so much, John!

00:59:58.236 --> 00:59:58.946
>> Yeah. Good job.

00:59:59.516 --> 01:00:04.576
[ Applause ]

01:00:05.076 --> 01:00:08.396
Ryan, you're the man.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:15.126
djay Pro -- a beautiful, fully
accessible, super sophisticated,

01:00:15.246 --> 01:00:18.776
high-performance app
built for iOS and OS X.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:20.346
Congratulations, guys.

01:00:21.566 --> 01:00:26.326
So those are our
winners this year --

01:00:27.806 --> 01:00:31.266
two great student apps
worthy of a Design Award,

01:00:32.586 --> 01:00:34.876
and 10 other incredible apps.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:38.566
10 apps that set the
standard for this coming year.

01:00:39.256 --> 01:00:42.596
Each of these apps has
something very unique.

01:00:43.316 --> 01:00:44.926
They entertain in a new way.

01:00:44.926 --> 01:00:48.016
They allow you to
communicate in a new way.

01:00:48.756 --> 01:00:50.146
They educate in a new way.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.826
They solve real problems
in a clever or new way.

01:00:53.826 --> 01:00:57.986
And they open doors for
people and enable people

01:00:57.986 --> 01:00:59.536
to do things they
couldn't do before.

01:00:59.536 --> 01:01:02.916
And all of them are
incredibly well-designed

01:01:02.916 --> 01:01:08.946
and extremely well-executed
on all four of our platforms.

01:01:08.946 --> 01:01:11.526
Now winners today get to
take home, as you've seen,

01:01:11.526 --> 01:01:13.056
the Apple Design Award Trophy.

01:01:13.056 --> 01:01:14.566
When you tap it,
it lights up just

01:01:14.566 --> 01:01:16.826
like the cover of your laptop.

01:01:16.826 --> 01:01:17.566
It's very cool.

01:01:17.566 --> 01:01:19.476
Go check it out from one
of the winners later on.

01:01:20.086 --> 01:01:22.726
So you get the coveted
Apple Design Award Trophy,

01:01:23.006 --> 01:01:25.306
as well as a prize
package including one

01:01:25.306 --> 01:01:27.556
of almost everything that
we make -- fully loaded.

[ Applause ]

01:01:36.436 --> 01:01:39.786
And you get some
prominent featuring

01:01:39.786 --> 01:01:41.396
on the App Store
beginning tonight.

01:01:42.516 --> 01:01:48.736
[ Applause ]

01:01:49.236 --> 01:01:52.786
All right, we wanted to wrap up
this day with this fun event.

01:01:53.056 --> 01:01:56.296
It's always fun for me to do the
Design Awards, to be involved

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:58.336
with this, to know
so many of you

01:01:58.336 --> 01:02:00.626
and to see your apps
come along and then some

01:02:00.626 --> 01:02:01.806
of them to arrive on stage.

01:02:01.806 --> 01:02:04.006
It's always fun to
give out these awards.

01:02:04.646 --> 01:02:09.256
But before we wrap up tonight,
we just wanted to tell you

01:02:09.256 --> 01:02:11.566
about something else that we've
been working on that's fun.

01:02:11.566 --> 01:02:15.826
And it's a little bit apart
from the Design Awards

01:02:15.826 --> 01:02:21.096
that we've given out so far, but
it's a great way to end our day.

01:02:21.096 --> 01:02:24.546
And it does tie into
building something that's fun,

01:02:24.546 --> 01:02:27.426
and unique, and compelling.

01:02:27.946 --> 01:02:33.106
So to talk about that, I'd like
to invite Ben Wolstenholme,

01:02:33.106 --> 01:02:39.386
Cofounder and CEO of Madefire, a
developer of iOS and TV OS apps,

01:02:39.476 --> 01:02:40.636
to join me here on stage.

01:02:40.636 --> 01:02:40.816
Ben?

01:02:41.516 --> 01:02:50.576
[ Applause ]

01:02:51.076 --> 01:02:51.586
Thanks, John.

01:02:51.696 --> 01:02:52.366
Great to be here.

01:02:52.776 --> 01:02:57.106
So Madefire is all
about storytelling --

01:02:57.576 --> 01:03:00.156
and in particular, comics.

01:03:01.036 --> 01:03:02.906
We love comics because they're

01:03:02.906 --> 01:03:05.276
such a powerful storytelling
format.

01:03:06.226 --> 01:03:07.746
People learn to read
through comics.

01:03:08.396 --> 01:03:10.636
People escape into other
worlds through comics.

01:03:11.576 --> 01:03:15.766
Most of all, comics are
words and pictures perfect

01:03:15.896 --> 01:03:19.276
for the visual world
that we live in.

01:03:19.666 --> 01:03:22.196
We've been working closely with
Apple on something that we'd

01:03:22.196 --> 01:03:23.476
like to share with you tonight.

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:26.076
As you may have seen earlier,

01:03:26.316 --> 01:03:29.476
Apple today launched new
app review guidelines.

01:03:30.486 --> 01:03:31.966
They're very different
to the guidelines

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:34.636
that we're all used to, and
they're much more approachable.

01:03:35.936 --> 01:03:38.806
And after speaking with Apple
about this new approach,

01:03:39.806 --> 01:03:45.476
we collaborated to create --

01:03:46.516 --> 01:03:52.546
[ Applause ]

01:03:53.046 --> 01:03:57.606
Oh, yes! App Review
Guidelines, the Comic Book.

01:03:58.056 --> 01:04:02.396
OK. Apple has put a lot of
thought into reorganizing

01:04:02.396 --> 01:04:04.886
and simplifying the
guidelines into five sections.

01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:08.066
And this gave us a great
opportunity to work

01:04:08.066 --> 01:04:09.316
with different illustrators

01:04:09.686 --> 01:04:14.376
and to develop five totally
different graphic styles.

01:04:14.556 --> 01:04:17.006
Each section is a visual story.

01:04:18.016 --> 01:04:20.076
And we really wanted
the visuals to react

01:04:20.366 --> 01:04:22.696
with the serious content
of the guidelines.

01:04:23.536 --> 01:04:26.226
It's created a pretty
wild outcome,

01:04:27.666 --> 01:04:29.596
and something we hope
will engage people

01:04:30.086 --> 01:04:33.266
around these important
topics even

01:04:33.266 --> 01:04:35.446
if you think you know
the guidelines already.

01:04:36.196 --> 01:04:37.646
It's pretty useful.

01:04:38.596 --> 01:04:41.466
The comic book will be
available for download

01:04:41.466 --> 01:04:42.786
from the developer's site,

01:04:42.786 --> 01:04:45.086
alongside the searchable
text version.

01:04:45.936 --> 01:04:50.736
But you will get to take home
your printed comic book tonight.

01:04:51.516 --> 01:04:58.806
[ Applause ]

01:04:59.306 --> 01:05:02.226
Oh, yes, hard to believe.

01:05:02.426 --> 01:05:04.956
In a world of screens,
a big part of what we do

01:05:04.956 --> 01:05:07.056
at Madefire is enable people

01:05:07.316 --> 01:05:09.996
to turn their stories
into motion books.

01:05:10.966 --> 01:05:14.086
As you can see, motion books
are a reading experience

01:05:14.366 --> 01:05:16.186
with motion, sound, and depth.

01:05:17.316 --> 01:05:21.286
And we're thrilled to be
working on a motion book version

01:05:21.666 --> 01:05:23.276
of the app review guidelines.

01:05:24.746 --> 01:05:27.956
Here's a sneak peek.

01:05:28.516 --> 01:05:58.546
[ Music ]

01:05:59.046 --> 01:06:02.786

Guidelines motion book coming

01:06:02.786 --> 01:06:05.106
soon to an Apple
device near you.

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:08.576
And you can get your
printed comic here tonight.

01:06:08.626 --> 01:06:10.286

It's pretty fun.

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.916
A great way to end a
fun event with that.

01:06:22.956 --> 01:06:26.856
So let's wrap up here right now.

01:06:28.066 --> 01:06:31.306
Congratulations, first of
all, to all of you who've done

01:06:31.366 --> 01:06:35.156
such incredible work over
the past months, years,

01:06:35.156 --> 01:06:37.726
as you worked on these apps
that tonight won an award.

01:06:38.146 --> 01:06:39.276
Hats off to you.

01:06:40.456 --> 01:06:43.626
You've put in just an enormous
amount of work designing

01:06:43.626 --> 01:06:45.906
and developing these apps,
and they've set a new standard

01:06:45.906 --> 01:06:47.806
for the entire community.

01:06:48.536 --> 01:06:52.476
And thanks to you all
here, as well as folks

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:53.656
who are watching online.

01:06:53.656 --> 01:06:56.646
We've got lots of people
dialed in through the WWDC app

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:59.356
and through the online stream
that we've got from this event.

01:06:59.746 --> 01:07:02.746
Thank you for joining us
from around the world.

01:07:03.426 --> 01:07:05.586
We look forward to seeing
what you're going to create

01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:09.626
in this coming year, what you're
going to create based on things

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:13.636
that maybe you saw this evening
that inspired you to move

01:07:13.636 --> 01:07:16.156
to a new level with your app
and with your development

01:07:16.156 --> 01:07:19.136
and with your design, and
inspired by the new things

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:24.026
that you heard today through the
sessions earlier on in this day.

01:07:24.346 --> 01:07:26.536
So we'd like to close.

01:07:26.686 --> 01:07:29.446
Just before we close, I'd
like to ask the winners

01:07:29.526 --> 01:07:30.806
to come back on stage.

01:07:31.126 --> 01:07:33.836
And while they're doing that,
I just want to say thank you,

01:07:34.106 --> 01:07:35.976
