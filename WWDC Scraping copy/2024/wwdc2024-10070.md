Make features discoverable with TipKit

Search this video…Hi,my name is Jakeand I am really excited to share some of the new waysyou can customize TipKitto help people learn about your app's new and undiscovered features.TipKit is a framework that makes it easy to show tips in your app.It can teach someone about a brand-new featureor show a faster way to accomplish a task.TipKit lets you easily create tipsand automatically manages their display states and historyto ensure they are only shown in the right moments.TipKit also lets you control who should see your tips and whenwith eligibility rules and display frequency.And TipKit provides different presentation stylesto best fit your app's UIand it's available on every platform.And now you can do even moreto customize feature discoveryso your tips feel integrated and seamless.In this video, I'll cover how to group tips togetherso features are discovered in the ideal order,show how to make tips reusable with custom tip identifiers,match tips to your app's look and feel with TipViewStyle,and sync the TipKit datastore using CloudKitso tip display states are shared across devices.But first,tip groups.Tip groups allow you to specify multiple tipsand present them one at a time,either in a specific orderor using the first tip eligible for display.We're going to update our appthat helps backcountry hikers discover and navigate new trails.I recently added a compass control to our mapwith two features we're going to let people know about using tips.The first tip we want to create is about tapping the compassto show the current location on the map.So we'll make a new tip structwith a title, message, and image that describe the feature.Our second tip is for a gesture that is a little more hidden;our compass control can also be long pressedto rotate the map back to 0 degrees North,so we're going to add a tip about that feature too.And to display them,we're going to make two calls from the compassto TipKit's popoverTip view modifier.One for the showLocationTip,and another for the rotateMapTip.These popovers work great, but there's just one problem.Right now, we don't have control over the order our tips are presented inand we really want someone to know about the tap compass featurebefore showing a tip about long pressing the compass.So let's update this code to use a TipGroup.To control their display,we're going to add both of our compass tips to a TipGroup.We'll initialize it with an ordered priority.Using an ordered priority ensures that our RotateMapTip won't be displayeduntil the ShowLocationTip has been invalidated,either by the ShowLocationTip view being dismissed,or someone performing the show location tap gesture.And now we just need to update the compass's popoverTip view modifierto use the currentTip propertyto display our group's currently available tip.TipGroup's currentTip property can also be cast as a specific typeto customize where a tip is presented.If we had separate buttons for both of our compass features,we could use currentTip as? ShowLocationTipto ensure that that tip's popoverwill only be presented from the first control.And the RotateMapTip popover will only be presented from the second.Now that we have both of our compass tips appearing in the correct order,there is only one thing left to add.We need to invalidate both of our tipswhen the features they describe are used.Invalidating a tip ensures that it will not be shown to someonethat has already discovered its feature.Additionally, for TipGroups that use an ordered priority,a tip can only be displayed when all of the preceding tipshave been invalidated.TipGroups can be configured with either an ordered or firstAvailable priority.An ordered priority,like the one used for our compassTips,is great for progressively teaching people about related features.The firstAvailable prioritydisplays the first tip that has its display rules satisfied.This is useful if you have a view with multiple unrelated tips,but only want one to appear at a time.And TipGroups also work great with displayFrequency.Our backcountry trails app configures tips with a weekly displayFrequency.This allows trail seekers time to discover our compass's features on their ownbefore showing them tips about it.TipKit's displayFrequency is an excellent wayto avoid overwhelming people with too many tipsthe first time they launch your app.Tip groups are the perfect way to show tips one at a timeand in the exact order you want them to be displayed.By using tip groupsalongside display rules and display frequencyyou can progressively call out functionalitywithout overburdening your app with too many tips.Now let's talk about making tips reusable with custom identifiers.A tip's status and rules are unique based on its identifier.Overriding a tip's default identifierallows you to reuse the same tip struct based on its content.Our backcountry trails app was recently updatedwith support for a new trailthat we'd like to let people know about using tips.We'll start by creating a tip for the newly added Butler Fork trailheadwith a message about where it's located.We're also going to include an action buttonso people can easily navigate to the new trail on our map.And because we only want this tip to appearfor hikers that will find it most useful,we're going to add an event rule so the tip is only displayedif someone has visited the trail's region 3 or more times.And to show the tip,we just need to add an instance of it to our TrailListand display it using a TipView.We're also going to add an action handler,so the new trail can be highlighted when the Go there now button is tapped.But how well will this work if we add supportfor more new trails in the future?Uh-oh!Our TrailList code is going to be mostly tipsif we continue adding new trails to our app.Also multiple tip views could appear at the same time,which would make it difficult for people to access the actual trail list.This approach isn't very scalableso let's update our codeto make a reusable tip with a custom identifier.We'll start by defining a new tipthat is created with a specific trail objectand give it a message based on that trail's name and region.Next, let's add a custom ID for the tip based on the trail used to initialize it.By customizing that ID,each instance of our NewTrailTip will have a unique statusand rules based on the trail they're describing.This will allow our tip to be re-displayed with a new traileven if it has been previously invalidated for a different trail.And to ensure these tips still only appear for hikersinterested in the areas they describe,we're going to update our didVisit display ruleso it's based on the region of the newly added trail.Now we just need to change our TrailList codeto create a new tip based on the latest trail.This allows us to automatically display a tipanytime we add a new trail to our app.And because we're only creating a single instance of our tipwe don't have to worry aboutmultiple NewTrailTips appearing at the same time.Every tip has a persistent record based on its identifier,even if its never displayed.This allows TipKit to make tips eligiblebased on events that happen across multiple launches of your app.That's why when you specify a custom identifierit's important to base it on something concretelike a user ID or a trail name.By default, a tip's identifier will be the type name used to initialize it.Overriding that ID allows your tips to be reused based on their content.Custom identifiers are a great way to have TipKit reusethe same tip model for different tips.Next, let's talk about customizing the appearance of tip views.Tips have a great default presentation,but in some cases you may need deeper customizationto better match your app's UI.For these tips,you can customize their appearance and behavior using TipViewStyle.We have these really beautiful photos for every trail we add to our hiking appand I think we should use the NewTrailTip to showcase them.So let's make a custom TipViewStyleand use each trail's hero image as the backgroundand have the tip's title and message displayed in an overlay.For the title and message, we're going to use the propertiesfrom the makeBody function's configuration argumentinstead of the tip's instance values.This will allow any modifiers we apply to our TipViewto work with the message and title in our custom style.And to apply it, we just need to call the tipViewStyle modifier.Now, our tip displays with the trail's gorgeous photo as its background.But our NewTrailTip also includes an actionfor quickly highlighting the trail on our mapand I don't think we want to put a button on top of that photo.Instead, lets update our custom style to make the entire tip view tappable.We'll start by getting the NewTrailTip's actionfrom the configuration argument.Now we just need to call the action handlerwhen the tip view is tapped.Using the actions property from the configuration argumentensures the handler we created as part of our TipViewwill still be called when the action is performed.When creating a custom TipViewStyle,it's important to favor the properties from its configuration argumentover the tip's instance values whenever possible.This allows the closures and modifiers applied to your TipViewsto still be evaluated when using a custom style.Custom TipViewStyles also work great alongside other tip view modifierslike tipCornerRadius and tipBackground.And for apps that use UIKit or AppKit,there is a viewStyle property that can be setto change the style of TipUI and TipNSViews.By creating a TipViewStyleyou can easily show tips with custom appearances and behaviorswhile still allowing TipKit's rules engine to handle their display and dismissal.And now, let's turn to CloudKit syncing.CloudKit improves your app's user experienceby syncing the display states for tipsand ensuring someone doesn't need to dismiss the same tipon more than one of their devices.Now that we've added some great tips to our backcountry trails appwe should setup CloudKit syncingso our tips's statuses and rules can be shared.We'll start by adding iCloudto the Signing and Capabilities of our Xcode project.From there we'll turn on CloudKit under iCloud Servicesand create a new container for syncing our tips.We also need to add Background Modesand enable its Remote Notifications capability.This will allow TipKit to process remote changes in the backgroundto ensure our app's trail tipsalways have the correct status and display state.For the last step,we just need to update our Tips configuration callto include the cloudKitContainer option and pass in our new container's ID.And that's it.Now our trail tips will stay in sync across devicesso the same tip won't need to be dismissed multiple times.And because TipKit also syncs event and parameter values,the donations that allow our NewTrailTip to appear on one devicewill be shared,allowing it to be displayed on other devices.Tips in your app may only appear a few timesbefore being invalidated.By persisting your tips,TipKit avoids loading their models into memoryuntil they are ready to be displayed.And with CloudKit syncing, a tip's status and rules are sharedso tips are not re-displayed on one device after being dismissed from another.TipKit also syncs events and parameters allowing you to create display rulesbased on event donations across multiple devices.And display count and duration values are also syncedso tips that specify a MaxDisplayCountcan be invalidated based on their total number of shared appearances.In some cases, you may want to use CloudKit syncingbut still have certain tips that are unique on different platforms.For those, you can use UIDevice to create platform specific tip IDsthat allow the same tip to be re-displayed on multiple devices.And for testing,TipKit's resetDatastore function will clear the local datastoreas well as the CloudKit records for all of your tips.TipKit is built on top of the powerful persistence of SwiftData.This lets tip statuses, rules, parameters,and events retain their values across app launches.And with CloudKit syncing it's even easier to share these values between devices.TipKit has powerful tools to ensure your app's tipsare only shown at the perfect timeand to the audience that will find them most useful.Use TipGroup to allow your features to be discovered one at a timeand in the ideal order.Tip groups work great alongside display rules and display frequencyfor customizing feature discovery in your app.And to learn more about creating display rulescheck out last year's WWDC video "Make features discoverable with TipKit".Custom identifiers provide an easy way to make reusable tip modelsso tips can be re-displayed based on their content.TipViewStyle can be used to create custom layoutsand interactions for your tips so they always match your app's UI.And CloudKit can be used to sync TipKit's datastore across devicesso your tips don't get re-displayed unnecessarily.On behalf of the entire TipKit team,I'd like to say thank you so much for joining me todayand we can't wait to see how TipKit can help people discover your apps'great new features!
