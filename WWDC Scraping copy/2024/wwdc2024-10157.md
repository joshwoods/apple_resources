Build a great Lock Screen camera capture experience

Search this video…Hi, my name is Cliff,and I’m an engineer on the System Experience team.Today, we’re going to discuss how you can build controls,a new type of widget in iOS 18.I’ll first cover what a control is and how people use them.Then, I’ll show you how to build a control,have it perform an action and maintain its state,support configuration,and refine its integration with the system.Controls are a new way to extend your app’s functionalityinto system spaces including Control Center, the Lock Screen,and the Action button,and they’re created using WidgetKit.iOS 14 introduced WidgetKit,which allows apps to display visually rich,custom-styled content with detailed information,making a widget the perfect way to display the Weatheror your next Calendar event.iOS 18 extends WidgetKit even further by adding controls.Controls are a great way to provide quick access to actions from your app.They focus on actions and succinct information,making something like turning on the flashlightor deep-linking into the Clock app a great use case for a control.If you know how to build a widget, building a control is similarand uses the same underlying architecture.There are two types of controls: buttons and toggles.Buttons perform discrete actions, which can include launching your app,while toggles change a piece of boolean state,like turning something on or off.Like an interactive widget,a control uses an app intent to perform its action.Fundamentally, controls are actionsthat take the visual form of the system space they’re inusing the information provided by your app.Your app provides a symbol,title, tint color, and additional content to the system.People can then add a control into any of the supported system spaces,and the system space displays the control contextually.In Control Center, it can be displayed at any of three different sizes,so the title and value text won’t always be visible.I love using timers to stay focused during work while also giving myself breaks!Today, I’ll build a productivity timer controlthat will let me chunk my work and breaks into intervals.When the timer is running,a live activity will show the remaining time.I can start the timer from the Lock Screen,stop it in Control Center,and even use the Action button to start and stop it as well.I’ll build this productivity timer control from the ground up,starting with a basic toggleand then taking advantage of the rich feature set of controls.I already have a WidgetBundle for my existing Productivity Widgets,so I’ll start by adding a TimerToggle() entry into this WidgetBundle.I’ll then define the TimerToggle() Control in this same widget extensionby adding a TimerToggle type conforming to ControlWidget.To define a control, I’ll provide the information to display in the controlas well as the action to perform.I’ll start with a StaticControlConfiguration,which means this control is not configurable.I’ll add configuration later on.The control takes a kind as its unique identifierand a definition for the type of control: the ControlWidgetToggle.I’ll then give the control a title and provide its state.I also provide the action to perform when the control is interacted with.Just like with interactive widgets,the control executes actions using an app intent.Lastly, I provide the symbol Image defining the control.Now that it has all the required information,the system is able to display the control.I can place the control in Control Center,where it displays my title, symbol, and the on/off state.This timer control could be made even better by displaying different symbolswhen the timer is running or stopped.To do that, I’ll use the isOn argument to the closureto display the flowing "hourglass" symbolwhen the control is on to indicate that time is counting down.Excellent!Now, the control displays a flowing hourglass symbol only when running.I’d also like to refine the value text for this state,which currently reads on and off.This is the default value text for a toggle,but people typically think of a timer as being running or stoppedrather than on or off.I can customize the control’s value text by changing the Image to a Labelthat includes both the value text and systemImage.Now, the control displays appropriate,relevant value text describing the state it’s ininstead of the default on/off text.Keep in mind that this value text won’t be displayedwhen your control is on the Lock Screenor when the control is in the small size in Control Center,where only the symbol is shown.I’m liking where this control is headedbut, in the on state, the symbol has the default systemBlue tint,which doesn’t follow my productivity app’s branding.To give the control a characteristic color instead of the default systemBlue,provide a tint color.I’ll use the color of my productivity app, purple.Purple for productivity!The tint color will be used to tint the symbol when the toggle is on.Here’s the fully styled control working on the Lock Screenand with the Action button,using the same code that makes it work in Control Center.When the control is on,the symbol and any value text have the specified tint color.Let’s examine how a toggle displays and manages its state.So far, I’ve been providing the current timer stateto my control using a TimerManager class.In this example, my TimerManager looks for datain a shared group container that accesses the same datathat my productivity app does,and the running state is synchronously fetched.Let’s explore how the system reloads your controlwhen its state or content changes.When the system needs to reload your control,it runs the body of the control in your widget extension processto ask for your control’s current value and generate the control’s content.Your control’s value and content are then passed back to the systemand are used to display your control.So, your widget extension provides your control’s current stateand content for that state.There are three kinds of events that cause the system to reload your control:when your control action is performed,when your app requests a reload of the control on-demand,and when a push notification invalidates your control.The first of these events is when your control action is performed.Each time someone interacts with your control,the system automatically reloads itwhen the control’s app intent’s perform() function returns.Make sure to finish all updates before it returns.In my timer control, the action is the ToggleTimerIntent().This intent sets the "Running" state of the timerand starts or stops the LiveActivity.This app intent is a SetValueIntent since it sets the timer’s "Running" stateto the value provided by the system,and it’s a LiveActivityIntent since it modifies the timer LiveActivity.When the perform function completes,the system updates the control with its new state.Interacting with a timer controlisn’t the only way I can change its state, however.I can also open the Productivity app and start or stop the timer from there,and I want the control to stay up-to-date.To do this, when the timer state changes,my app can use the ControlCenter API to refresh the controlby specifying the kind of my timer control as the control to reload.Now, when I start the timer in my app,the control’s state stays up-to-date!If the state or content of your control needs to be refreshed,your app can ask the system to reload your control.The same refresh tools that are available for widgetsand live activities are available for controls.As you are developing your control and refreshing its state frequently,enable WidgetKit Developer Mode in Developer Settingsto remove system policies from your control.Now that my productivity timer is working great on this device,I want to make it work across multiple devicesand have them all access the same timer state on a server.Since my control will reflect statefrom a server that is not available on the device,I’ll need to fetch the timer state asynchronously,and to do this, I can use a ValueProvider.A ControlValueProvider has two requirements:currentValue() and previewValue.currentValue() is asynchronous to allow you to fetch data from where you need to,such as your database or server.In my case, the TimerManager queries the timer statefrom a server asynchronously.You can also throw an errorto tell the system that the state couldn’t be computed,indicating that the control needs to be reloaded at a later date.previewValue is where you choose the value to displaywhen the control is being previewed by someone,before they add the control, such as in the controls gallery,when they customize their Lock Screen, and in Action button settings.The previewValue should be predetermined and very quick to return,and it should be a value that corresponds to your control’s off state.I can use my ValueProviderin a different control initializer that takes a ValueProvider,and the provided value is passed into the closure where I define the toggle.In my case, I then use the value as the isOn state of the control.In this example, I’m using a simple Bool as the value,but I could have the value include a lot more information.I’ll show an example of that later on.When the system reloads a control with a ValueProvider,it first runs the ValueProvider to fetch the current valueand then passes this value to the control closure to generate the content.This all takes place in the widget extension process.Now that my productivity timer’s state lives on a server,it can be changed from different devices.So, when I start or stop the timer from my iPad, for example,I want this off-device state changeto trigger a reload of the control on my other devices.To handle this case, I can use the Push Notification APIto define a push handler for my control,which will configure the control to be reloadedwhen external state-change push notifications are received.The push handling documentation goes into more detail about how to do thisand best practices.Now, when I stop the timer on my iPad,the control on my iPhone stops as well!My productivity timer is working well,but I’d love to have separate timers for work and personal endeavors,like practicing my violin,so that my app tracks them separately.It would be great if I could have different controls for eachand put both of them in Control Center.Since controls are built just like widgets with WidgetKit,I can accomplish this by making the control user-configurable.After adding one of my timer controls to Control Center,I’ll want to be able to choose whether it starts and stops my workor personal timer.This will allow me to have one control for each of my work and personal timersin Control Center.To start, I can update my ValueProvider to conform to a new protocol,AppIntentControlValueProvider,which makes the value dependent on the configuration of an intent.The app intent that determines the configurationis the SelectTimerIntent,which allows someone to choosewhich timer they want the control to interact with.Notice that I now make sure to fetchthe running state of the configuration’s particular timer,and the value I return is now a custom structthat contains both the timer and its running state.I can use the configurable ValueProviderwith an AppIntentControlConfiguration() to make my Control configurable.The value passed to the closure is now my timerState struct,and I use its timer and running state to complete the toggle.Note that I want to display the particular timer’s name as the control’s title,and the toggle timer app intent now acts on that particular timer.Now, when someone is customizing Control Center,my control allows them to choosewhich timer they want the control to interact with.I’ve now got my separate workand personal timer controls side-by-side in Control Center,each controlling a different timer!If your control requires configuration to be functional,you can use the promptsForUserConfiguration() modifierto have the system automatically prompt someoneto configure the control when it is added to a system space.You can refine your control even furtherto provide the most understandable and relevant contentwhen the system’s default values don’t fit your use case.For example, an action hint is displayedwhen someone interacts with the Action buttonbefore the action is performed.My control’s action hints currently are: Hold for Running and Hold for Stopped.Let’s more closely examine why that’s the case.Before I customized the value label of the control with "Running"/"Stopped" text,the system synthesized defaultHold to Turn On, Hold to Turn Off action hints,similarly to how it synthesized the default on/off value text.When I customized the value text, it was also used to form the action hints.The system synthesized Hold for Running and Hold for Stopped action hints.These hints can definitely be improved,so I’ll customize them to fit the use case.I’ll customize the Action button hint text with the controlWidgetActionHint modifierto choose the action hint to display, which should start with a verb.The hint provided is the action to go to a particular state,so the action hint for the timer’s on state is "Start"so that the hint for starting the timer is Hold to Start.With the action hint of "Stop" for the off state,the action hint for stopping the timer is Hold to Stop.This sounds great and feels natural for a timer!Controls can display a momentary status in Control Centerwhen the action is performed using the controlWidgetStatus modifier.If your control has additional information to convey about its action,its state, or the duration of effectiveness of that state,consider adding a status.Status text should be used sparinglyand only to call attention to pertinent informationthat isn’t already conveyed by the control.When adding my control from the controls gallery,right now, it’s called Productivity, which is the name of my app.A control’s app’s name is the default display name for the control.I’ll customize the displayName of my control to be "Productivity Timer".Make sure to choose a displayName for each of your controlsthat is specific to what it does.As a last refinement, I’ll also add a description,which will be shown when the control is being configured.With just a few steps,I’ve created a productivity timer control that I can place in Control Center,the Lock Screen, or the Action button, and syncs across all of my devices.Controls are a powerful capabilitythat you can now build into your apps on iOS and iPadOS 18to provide quick access to your app’s key actions in system spaces.Use the modifiers we discussed todayto tailor your control’s style to the action it performs,and make sure that your controls feature distinctive symbols.If you’re building a control that lets people capture content with the camera,consider building a capture extension, and watch the session"Build a great Lock Screen camera capture experience".Thanks for watching!
