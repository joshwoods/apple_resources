What's new with SKAdNetwork

Search this video…Hello everybody, I’m Nikhil from App Store Engineering.Today, we meet AdAttributionKit.Privacy is a big part of everything we do at Apple.Privacy preserving ad attribution enables advertising attributionwhile preserving user privacy.Privacy preserving ad attribution is built on top of crowd anonymity.At a high level, crowd anonymity will send less data backto ad networks and advertisers,when there are fewer conversions.As the crowd size scales up, more data is sent back.Once the crowd size passes the highest level,the maximum amount of data is returned to ad networks and advertisers.SKAdNetwork was Apple’s first privacy- preserving ad attribution frameworkpowered by crowd anonymity.Today I am happy to introduce AdAttributionKit,our new ad attribution framework for iOS and iPadOSbuilt on top of SKAdNetwork fundamentals.Let’s begin by talking about ad attribution at a high level.Ad networks generate, sign and serve ads to publisher apps.Publisher apps display the ad to the person using them.They install the advertised app,and as they engage with it over time,and after the measurement period has passed,a postback containing conversion information is sent to the ad network.With that flow in mind, here are the topics I will be covering today.We will start with a discussion on fetching adsand the new ad impression format in AdAttributionKit.Then we will look at displaying ads.We’ll follow this with a discussion about postbacks.Then we’ll go into re-engagementand briefly cover testing AdAttributionKit.Let’s talk about fetching ads.Ads are the input to the attribution flow.The publisher app will fetch the ad data from the ad network.This ad data is in compact JWS format.I will now go over the fields.Here is an ad impression in JSON form.I will cover a few important fields.The "advertised-item-identifier" is the app ID of the app being advertised.The "publisher-item-identifier" is the app ID of the app showing the ad.The "source-identifier" is a 4 digit integerused to represent campaign-related information for the ad.This field retains the same behavior from SKAdNetwork 4.0.The fields in the JSON are described in the AdAttributionKit documentationlinked to the session.With that structure in mind let’s move on to ad impressions.AppImpression instances represent ad impressions.These instances are initialized with the ad’s compact JWS representation,which we covered in the previous section.I will now show you how to create an app impression from the compact JWS.First, I fetch the ad’s compact JWS representation.Note that the fetchAdImpressionJWS() method is not shown implementedsince this is entirely up to how I integrate with my ad provideror ad network.I then pass this jwsString to the initializer for AppImpression.I will be using this AppImpression instance in the next sectionto discuss displaying ads.AdAttributionKit supports 3 different methods of displaying ads.Let’s take a look at the ads I want to display for my advertised app.The first ad is a custom creative that is clickable.Tapping a custom click adwill navigate the user to a marketplace where they can install the advertised app.Here is a view-through ad in a different screen.An example of this type of ad content can be a video ad.Another ad type simply recommends the advertised app.For this I can use SKOverlaywhich shows up as a banner within the context of my app.Or I can use SKStoreProductViewControllerwhich has more of a full-screen presentation modelstill within the context of the app.Both SKOverlay and SKStoreProductViewControllershare the iOS design languageand are extremely easy to adopt and plug in to my app.Here is how to implement a custom click ad.First, I create the customAdView.Then I create an instance of UIEventAttributionViewand add it as a subview of my ad view.Note the UIEventAttributionView has to be on top of any viewthat receives user interactions.With the ad view set up, let’s handle taps on it.When the user taps on the ad view, I grab my instance of appImpressionand call the handleTap() method on it.Note that handleTap has to be called within 15 minutesof when the appImpression instance is initialized.Past 15 minutes, create a new appImpression instance.When the click happens and you call the handleTap method,AdAttributionKit navigates the user to a marketplacefrom where the advertised app can be installed.For view-through ads, I previously mentioned the usage of a video ad.However view-through ads can cover any custom ad presentation.I’ll use a simple timelineto help visualize the events and API calls involved.When the ad presentation starts,I call the beginView() API on my appImpression instance,and when the ad presentation finishes,I call the endView() API on my appImpression instance.In my specific case of the video view-through ad,when the video starts playing, I call beginView() on my appImpression instance,and when the video finishes, I call endView() on my appImpression instance.A few things to note about view-through ads.Your custom ad content needs to be displayed for a minimum of 2 seconds -meaning, the time between calling beginView() and endView()should be at least 2 seconds.This matches the industry standard for this type of ad content.beginView and endView need to be called on the same instance of appImpression,and the same ad networkcannot have multiple open view-through ad presentationsfor the same advertised app at the same time.Every call to begin must be balanced by a call to end.Moving on to SKOverlay.Implementing SKOverlay follows the same pattern in AdAttributionKitas it did in SKAdNetwork.We use instances of AppConfiguration to set the SKOverlay up.You will set your instance of appImpressionto the new appImpression property on AppConfiguration.Finally, SKStoreProductViewController.The setup for SKStoreProductViewControlleris similar to how it was setup in SKAdNetwork.The loadProduct method is calledto prepare the product page UI for display.The main difference is the impression parameter on the loadProduct methodto which you will pass your appImpression instance.And now, postbacks.Postbacks are the outputs of the attribution system.They are the conversion signals sent to the ad network.They are also optionally sent to the developer of the advertised app.AdAttributionKit sends postbacks as a combination of a signed compact JWSand a few unsigned fields.Here is the signed portion.Let’s focus on a few important fields.The "conversion-type" field carries information about the type of conversionthat created this postback.The values for this field can be download, redownload, or re-engagement.The "marketplace-identifier" field carries the identifier of the marketplacewhere the conversion occurred.In our examples, because the download is taking place on the Apple App Store,this field has the value "com.apple.AppStore".The "publisher-item-identifier"is the identifier of the app that showed the original ad.For low levels of crowd anonymity, this will not be included in the postback.The "source-identifier" has a minimum of 2 digits and a maximum of 4.Crowd anonymity determines how many digits are included in the postback.Let’s now take a look at the rest of the postback request body.The "jws-string" key holds the JWS compact representationof the JSON we just covered.Note that I am showing a placeholder hereand not the actual string for the sake of brevity.The "ad-interaction-type" key holds informationabout how the user interacted with the ad.The possible values for this are "click" and "view".I will go into detail about this key in a subsequent section.The "conversion-value" key holds the value of the conversionas determined by the advertised app making API calls to AdAttributionKit.Note that "conversion-value" is also a crowd anonymity controlled field,and as such, it is not guaranteed to be present in the postback.If crowd anonymity determines the data allowance to not be high,instead of the "conversion-value",you might receive the "coarse-conversion-value".or you might receive no conversion value at all.Going back to the full postback request body,I want to dive deeper on two topics.The "conversion-value" and the "ad-interaction-type".First, conversion values.Conversion values can be used to measure advertising effectiveness.In other words,how valuable was this ad campaign to my advertising needs?The conversion value can also be used to derive informationabout the return on ad spend or ROAS.This is quite an important heuristicfor determining future ad spend and related optimization.Note that conversion values can be fine or coarse.This is determined by crowd anonymity.I will go over 3 scenarios where I want to measure user engagementand update the "conversion-value" via AdAttributionKit.Let’s look at an account creation scenario first.Assume that we are inside the method handling account creation in the app.I will first create a PostbackUpdate struct,and then I call the updateConversionValue method on the Postback typeto execute the update.Let’s take a closer look at the PostbackUpdate struct’s properties.The first argument is the fineConversionValue.This is a positive integer between 0 and 63 both values included.Note that the values for the fineConversionValueneed to make semantic sense for my advertising campaignand how its effectiveness is being measured.Typically, the schema for conversion values would be determinedafter discussion and planning between me as the advertised app developer,my chosen ad network and any MMPs I might choose to work with.The second argument is for locking postbacks.The lock is a way for me to tell AdAttributionKitthat I am finished measuring and recording conversion valuesfor that particular conversion window.This allows AdAttributionKit to freeze that postbackand immediately schedule it for transmission.Another way to think about this is that,a very high value event happenedthat I want to know about as soon as possible.The time urgency of this eventbeats out measuring anything else in that conversion window.Hence, I call lock, and AdAttributionKit knows to freezeand schedule this postback.Account creation does not have enough value for me to lock the postback,therefore I use false for the lock argument.The final argument is the coarse conversion value,which can be one of three string values: low, medium, or high.As mentioned before, the coarse value is sent in the postbackwhen crowd anonymity determines that the fine value cannot be sent.With the account created, the user watches their first video.I consider this a higher-value eventand so I update the fineConversionValue to 38.The value of the user watching a videois not high enough for me to lock the postbackand so that argument is false.And if my fine value cannot make it through due to crowd anonymity,I set my coarseConversionValue to be medium as a fallback measurement.Finally, the user uploads a video.I consider this a very high-value engagementand so I update my fine value to be 42.Video creation is a very high-value event,and I want to receive my postback as soon as possible.Therefore, I lock the postback via the lockPostback argument in the API.Note that locking the postback does not lead to its instant transmission.This delayed transmission behavior is to further protect user privacy.Again as a fallback, I set my coarseConversionValue to be high.You can use the PostbackUpdate structure to set your conversion valuefor different scenarios in your app.The last thing to cover for postbacks is the ad interaction type.AdAttributionKit distinguishes between the user tapping an adand simply viewing it.This information is crucialfor the selection of the ad that drove the conversion.The ad interaction type in the postback will have the value "click" or "view"depending on the user’s interaction with the ad.Let’s review the value of this field for different presentation methods.For a custom click ad, viewing it does not create an impression.Tapping it results in an ad interaction type of "click".For a view-through ad, viewing it results in an ad interaction type of "view".Tapping it does not create an impression.For SKOverlay, presenting it results in an ad interaction type of "view".Tapping it results in "click".Similarly for SKStoreProductViewController,presenting it leads to ad interaction type "view", tapping it leads to "click".Conversion values and ad interaction typeprovide details about the user engagement with your appand the ad that drove the install.And now, for something even newer - re-engagement.The main purpose of ad attribution is to attribute a conversion eventto an impression event.In our examples thus far I used installation as the conversion event.The initial goal for many ad campaigns is to drive installations for the app.This makes sense since installation is the first stepin the user’s journey with the app.Now, let’s talk about a new type of conversion event -re-engagementFor re-engagement ad campaigns,the goal is to bring users back to the advertised app.Consider the case where the person who installed the advertised appstopped using it.The advertised app wants to recover this user.And so they run an ad showing a limited-time offer.When the user taps on the ad,AdAttributionKit opens the advertised app to the screen with the offer,and the re-engagement begins.Let’s take a look at a re-engagement ad impression.For opting into re-engagement, I will add one more parameter to the payload:"eligible-for-re-engagement".This tells AdAttributionKit that the ad impression is to be consideredfor re-engagement conversions.An ad impression configured with the "eligible-for-re-engagement" property,is considered for re-engagement or installdepending on whether the advertised app is installed or not.For a normal ad impression without re-engagement opt-in,it would only be considered for installs.Here is how to initiate a re-engagement in code.I create the AppImpression instance with the jwsString.Note that this is the JWS impression that has opted in for re-engagement.Then, in the tap handler for my ad view,first I get the universal link that I want the user to be navigated towithin the advertised app.Then, I call the handleTap() method on the appImpression instancepassing in the reengagementURL.This call tells AdAttributionKit to open the advertised app.When the advertised app is opened, the re-engagement URL is passed to it.Note the query parameter appended to the re-engagement URL.AdAttributionKit appends this parameter to the URL during a re-engagement.Advertised apps can check for this parameterto tell if an open was caused by an AdAttributionKit re-engagement.SKOverlay and SKStoreProductViewController are also compatible with re-engagement.The setup for both is very similar to an install.To open a universal link in the advertised app, you can usethe adAttributionReengagementURL property on the SKOverlay.And for SKStoreProductViewController,you can use the reengagementURL parameter on the loadProduct method.Let’s talk about the postbacks sent for re-engagement conversions.The conversion type key in the postback will have the value of re-engagement.Re-engagement conversions can only have the click ad interaction type.View-through re-engagement is not supported by AdAttributionKit.The first call to update the conversion valuemust be made within 48 hours of the conversion.Re-engagement postbacks can be selectively updated,separate from installation postbacks.I will show you how.Let’s bring back the PostbackUpdate struct we saw earlier.Use the conversionTypes parameter to control which postbacks get updated.For updating only the re-engagement postbacks,I use the .reengagement value for conversionTypes.For updating only the install postbacks,I use the .install value for conversionTypes.For updating all postbacks,I use both .install and .reengagement for conversionTypes.AdAttributionKit also updates all postbacksif the conversionTypes parameter is nil.That covers re-engagement,which in addition to install presents a complete pictureof how people are engaging with apps.Testing AdAttributionKit can be difficultdue to the asynchronous design by virtue of necessity and purpose.This asynchronous nature is further compounded by time randomizationperformed in order to strengthen our privacy behavior.To improve the ease of testability,we have a new developer mode for AdAttributionKit.Developer mode removes time randomization from the systemto make it time-deterministic.It shortens the conversion windows, so testing of conversion value updatescan be done in all three windows in a test-friendly timeframe.Developer mode also speeds up postback transmission to help with testing.Let’s look at how to turn on developer mode.In iOS Settings, navigate to the Developer menuand scroll down to the switch for AdAttributionKit Developer Mode.When the switch is turned on,AdAttributionkit begins to function in developer mode.The time durations in the system are shortened to enable faster testing.And that is all I have for you today on AdAttributionKit,Apple’s new privacy-preserving ad attribution frameworkfor iOS and iPadOS.As an ad network,if you are already registered for use with SKAdNetwork,no further enrollment is needed.If not, you start by enrolling your ad network with AdAttributionKit.After enrollment, the next steps would be to serve the new JWS format adsand display them using AdAttributionKit.For advertised apps,adopt the new AdAttributionKit APIs for updating conversion values.On the server side,receive the new JWS format postbacks and parse them for analysis.For all the features discussed here today,note that AdAttributionKit is fully interoperable with SKAdNetwork.And for more information about SKAdNetwork,check out the WWDC22 session "What’s new with SKAdNetwork".And finally,our AdAttributionKit documentation is a fantastic resource as you get startedwith your AdAttributionKit integration.Thank you so much for joining me today!

Hello everybody, I’m Nikhil from App Store Engineering.Today, we meet AdAttributionKit.Privacy is a big part of everything we do at Apple.Privacy preserving ad attribution enables advertising attributionwhile preserving user privacy.

Privacy preserving ad attribution is built on top of crowd anonymity.At a high level, crowd anonymity will send less data backto ad networks and advertisers,when there are fewer conversions.

As the crowd size scales up, more data is sent back.

Once the crowd size passes the highest level,the maximum amount of data is returned to ad networks and advertisers.

SKAdNetwork was Apple’s first privacy- preserving ad attribution frameworkpowered by crowd anonymity.Today I am happy to introduce AdAttributionKit,our new ad attribution framework for iOS and iPadOSbuilt on top of SKAdNetwork fundamentals.Let’s begin by talking about ad attribution at a high level.Ad networks generate, sign and serve ads to publisher apps.

Publisher apps display the ad to the person using them.

They install the advertised app,and as they engage with it over time,and after the measurement period has passed,a postback containing conversion information is sent to the ad network.

With that flow in mind, here are the topics I will be covering today.We will start with a discussion on fetching adsand the new ad impression format in AdAttributionKit.Then we will look at displaying ads.We’ll follow this with a discussion about postbacks.Then we’ll go into re-engagementand briefly cover testing AdAttributionKit.

Let’s talk about fetching ads.Ads are the input to the attribution flow.The publisher app will fetch the ad data from the ad network.This ad data is in compact JWS format.I will now go over the fields.Here is an ad impression in JSON form.

I will cover a few important fields.

The "advertised-item-identifier" is the app ID of the app being advertised.

The "publisher-item-identifier" is the app ID of the app showing the ad.

The "source-identifier" is a 4 digit integerused to represent campaign-related information for the ad.This field retains the same behavior from SKAdNetwork 4.0.

The fields in the JSON are described in the AdAttributionKit documentationlinked to the session.

With that structure in mind let’s move on to ad impressions.AppImpression instances represent ad impressions.These instances are initialized with the ad’s compact JWS representation,which we covered in the previous section.

I will now show you how to create an app impression from the compact JWS.

First, I fetch the ad’s compact JWS representation.Note that the fetchAdImpressionJWS() method is not shown implementedsince this is entirely up to how I integrate with my ad provideror ad network.

I then pass this jwsString to the initializer for AppImpression.I will be using this AppImpression instance in the next sectionto discuss displaying ads.AdAttributionKit supports 3 different methods of displaying ads.Let’s take a look at the ads I want to display for my advertised app.

The first ad is a custom creative that is clickable.Tapping a custom click adwill navigate the user to a marketplace where they can install the advertised app.

Here is a view-through ad in a different screen.An example of this type of ad content can be a video ad.

Another ad type simply recommends the advertised app.For this I can use SKOverlaywhich shows up as a banner within the context of my app.

Or I can use SKStoreProductViewControllerwhich has more of a full-screen presentation modelstill within the context of the app.Both SKOverlay and SKStoreProductViewControllershare the iOS design languageand are extremely easy to adopt and plug in to my app.

Here is how to implement a custom click ad.

First, I create the customAdView.

Then I create an instance of UIEventAttributionViewand add it as a subview of my ad view.

Note the UIEventAttributionView has to be on top of any viewthat receives user interactions.

With the ad view set up, let’s handle taps on it.When the user taps on the ad view, I grab my instance of appImpressionand call the handleTap() method on it.

Note that handleTap has to be called within 15 minutesof when the appImpression instance is initialized.Past 15 minutes, create a new appImpression instance.

When the click happens and you call the handleTap method,AdAttributionKit navigates the user to a marketplacefrom where the advertised app can be installed.

For view-through ads, I previously mentioned the usage of a video ad.However view-through ads can cover any custom ad presentation.

I’ll use a simple timelineto help visualize the events and API calls involved.

When the ad presentation starts,I call the beginView() API on my appImpression instance,and when the ad presentation finishes,I call the endView() API on my appImpression instance.

In my specific case of the video view-through ad,when the video starts playing, I call beginView() on my appImpression instance,and when the video finishes, I call endView() on my appImpression instance.A few things to note about view-through ads.Your custom ad content needs to be displayed for a minimum of 2 seconds -meaning, the time between calling beginView() and endView()should be at least 2 seconds.This matches the industry standard for this type of ad content.

beginView and endView need to be called on the same instance of appImpression,and the same ad networkcannot have multiple open view-through ad presentationsfor the same advertised app at the same time.Every call to begin must be balanced by a call to end.

Moving on to SKOverlay.

Implementing SKOverlay follows the same pattern in AdAttributionKitas it did in SKAdNetwork.We use instances of AppConfiguration to set the SKOverlay up.

You will set your instance of appImpressionto the new appImpression property on AppConfiguration.

Finally, SKStoreProductViewController.The setup for SKStoreProductViewControlleris similar to how it was setup in SKAdNetwork.

The loadProduct method is calledto prepare the product page UI for display.

The main difference is the impression parameter on the loadProduct methodto which you will pass your appImpression instance.

And now, postbacks.

Postbacks are the outputs of the attribution system.They are the conversion signals sent to the ad network.They are also optionally sent to the developer of the advertised app.

AdAttributionKit sends postbacks as a combination of a signed compact JWSand a few unsigned fields.Here is the signed portion.

Let’s focus on a few important fields.

The "conversion-type" field carries information about the type of conversionthat created this postback.The values for this field can be download, redownload, or re-engagement.

The "marketplace-identifier" field carries the identifier of the marketplacewhere the conversion occurred.In our examples, because the download is taking place on the Apple App Store,this field has the value "com.apple.AppStore".

The "publisher-item-identifier"is the identifier of the app that showed the original ad.For low levels of crowd anonymity, this will not be included in the postback.

The "source-identifier" has a minimum of 2 digits and a maximum of 4.Crowd anonymity determines how many digits are included in the postback.

Let’s now take a look at the rest of the postback request body.

The "jws-string" key holds the JWS compact representationof the JSON we just covered.Note that I am showing a placeholder hereand not the actual string for the sake of brevity.

The "ad-interaction-type" key holds informationabout how the user interacted with the ad.The possible values for this are "click" and "view".I will go into detail about this key in a subsequent section.

The "conversion-value" key holds the value of the conversionas determined by the advertised app making API calls to AdAttributionKit.

Note that "conversion-value" is also a crowd anonymity controlled field,and as such, it is not guaranteed to be present in the postback.

If crowd anonymity determines the data allowance to not be high,instead of the "conversion-value",you might receive the "coarse-conversion-value".

or you might receive no conversion value at all.

Going back to the full postback request body,I want to dive deeper on two topics.The "conversion-value" and the "ad-interaction-type".

First, conversion values.Conversion values can be used to measure advertising effectiveness.In other words,how valuable was this ad campaign to my advertising needs?The conversion value can also be used to derive informationabout the return on ad spend or ROAS.This is quite an important heuristicfor determining future ad spend and related optimization.Note that conversion values can be fine or coarse.This is determined by crowd anonymity.I will go over 3 scenarios where I want to measure user engagementand update the "conversion-value" via AdAttributionKit.

Let’s look at an account creation scenario first.Assume that we are inside the method handling account creation in the app.

I will first create a PostbackUpdate struct,and then I call the updateConversionValue method on the Postback typeto execute the update.

Let’s take a closer look at the PostbackUpdate struct’s properties.

The first argument is the fineConversionValue.This is a positive integer between 0 and 63 both values included.Note that the values for the fineConversionValueneed to make semantic sense for my advertising campaignand how its effectiveness is being measured.Typically, the schema for conversion values would be determinedafter discussion and planning between me as the advertised app developer,my chosen ad network and any MMPs I might choose to work with.

The second argument is for locking postbacks.The lock is a way for me to tell AdAttributionKitthat I am finished measuring and recording conversion valuesfor that particular conversion window.This allows AdAttributionKit to freeze that postbackand immediately schedule it for transmission.

Another way to think about this is that,a very high value event happenedthat I want to know about as soon as possible.The time urgency of this eventbeats out measuring anything else in that conversion window.Hence, I call lock, and AdAttributionKit knows to freezeand schedule this postback.

Account creation does not have enough value for me to lock the postback,therefore I use false for the lock argument.

The final argument is the coarse conversion value,which can be one of three string values: low, medium, or high.As mentioned before, the coarse value is sent in the postbackwhen crowd anonymity determines that the fine value cannot be sent.

With the account created, the user watches their first video.I consider this a higher-value eventand so I update the fineConversionValue to 38.

The value of the user watching a videois not high enough for me to lock the postbackand so that argument is false.

And if my fine value cannot make it through due to crowd anonymity,I set my coarseConversionValue to be medium as a fallback measurement.

Finally, the user uploads a video.I consider this a very high-value engagementand so I update my fine value to be 42.

Video creation is a very high-value event,and I want to receive my postback as soon as possible.Therefore, I lock the postback via the lockPostback argument in the API.

Note that locking the postback does not lead to its instant transmission.This delayed transmission behavior is to further protect user privacy.

Again as a fallback, I set my coarseConversionValue to be high.

You can use the PostbackUpdate structure to set your conversion valuefor different scenarios in your app.

The last thing to cover for postbacks is the ad interaction type.AdAttributionKit distinguishes between the user tapping an adand simply viewing it.This information is crucialfor the selection of the ad that drove the conversion.

The ad interaction type in the postback will have the value "click" or "view"depending on the user’s interaction with the ad.Let’s review the value of this field for different presentation methods.

For a custom click ad, viewing it does not create an impression.

Tapping it results in an ad interaction type of "click".

For a view-through ad, viewing it results in an ad interaction type of "view".Tapping it does not create an impression.

For SKOverlay, presenting it results in an ad interaction type of "view".Tapping it results in "click".

Similarly for SKStoreProductViewController,presenting it leads to ad interaction type "view", tapping it leads to "click".

Conversion values and ad interaction typeprovide details about the user engagement with your appand the ad that drove the install.And now, for something even newer - re-engagement.The main purpose of ad attribution is to attribute a conversion eventto an impression event.In our examples thus far I used installation as the conversion event.The initial goal for many ad campaigns is to drive installations for the app.This makes sense since installation is the first stepin the user’s journey with the app.Now, let’s talk about a new type of conversion event -re-engagementFor re-engagement ad campaigns,the goal is to bring users back to the advertised app.

Consider the case where the person who installed the advertised appstopped using it.The advertised app wants to recover this user.

And so they run an ad showing a limited-time offer.When the user taps on the ad,AdAttributionKit opens the advertised app to the screen with the offer,and the re-engagement begins.

Let’s take a look at a re-engagement ad impression.For opting into re-engagement, I will add one more parameter to the payload:"eligible-for-re-engagement".

This tells AdAttributionKit that the ad impression is to be consideredfor re-engagement conversions.

An ad impression configured with the "eligible-for-re-engagement" property,is considered for re-engagement or installdepending on whether the advertised app is installed or not.

For a normal ad impression without re-engagement opt-in,it would only be considered for installs.

Here is how to initiate a re-engagement in code.

I create the AppImpression instance with the jwsString.Note that this is the JWS impression that has opted in for re-engagement.

Then, in the tap handler for my ad view,first I get the universal link that I want the user to be navigated towithin the advertised app.

Then, I call the handleTap() method on the appImpression instancepassing in the reengagementURL.This call tells AdAttributionKit to open the advertised app.

When the advertised app is opened, the re-engagement URL is passed to it.Note the query parameter appended to the re-engagement URL.AdAttributionKit appends this parameter to the URL during a re-engagement.

Advertised apps can check for this parameterto tell if an open was caused by an AdAttributionKit re-engagement.

SKOverlay and SKStoreProductViewController are also compatible with re-engagement.

The setup for both is very similar to an install.

To open a universal link in the advertised app, you can usethe adAttributionReengagementURL property on the SKOverlay.

And for SKStoreProductViewController,you can use the reengagementURL parameter on the loadProduct method.Let’s talk about the postbacks sent for re-engagement conversions.

The conversion type key in the postback will have the value of re-engagement.

Re-engagement conversions can only have the click ad interaction type.View-through re-engagement is not supported by AdAttributionKit.

The first call to update the conversion valuemust be made within 48 hours of the conversion.

Re-engagement postbacks can be selectively updated,separate from installation postbacks.I will show you how.

Let’s bring back the PostbackUpdate struct we saw earlier.

Use the conversionTypes parameter to control which postbacks get updated.

For updating only the re-engagement postbacks,I use the .reengagement value for conversionTypes.

For updating only the install postbacks,I use the .install value for conversionTypes.

For updating all postbacks,I use both .install and .reengagement for conversionTypes.AdAttributionKit also updates all postbacksif the conversionTypes parameter is nil.

That covers re-engagement,which in addition to install presents a complete pictureof how people are engaging with apps.Testing AdAttributionKit can be difficultdue to the asynchronous design by virtue of necessity and purpose.

This asynchronous nature is further compounded by time randomizationperformed in order to strengthen our privacy behavior.To improve the ease of testability,we have a new developer mode for AdAttributionKit.

Developer mode removes time randomization from the systemto make it time-deterministic.It shortens the conversion windows, so testing of conversion value updatescan be done in all three windows in a test-friendly timeframe.

Developer mode also speeds up postback transmission to help with testing.Let’s look at how to turn on developer mode.

In iOS Settings, navigate to the Developer menuand scroll down to the switch for AdAttributionKit Developer Mode.

When the switch is turned on,AdAttributionkit begins to function in developer mode.The time durations in the system are shortened to enable faster testing.

And that is all I have for you today on AdAttributionKit,Apple’s new privacy-preserving ad attribution frameworkfor iOS and iPadOS.

As an ad network,if you are already registered for use with SKAdNetwork,no further enrollment is needed.If not, you start by enrolling your ad network with AdAttributionKit.

After enrollment, the next steps would be to serve the new JWS format adsand display them using AdAttributionKit.

For advertised apps,adopt the new AdAttributionKit APIs for updating conversion values.

On the server side,receive the new JWS format postbacks and parse them for analysis.

For all the features discussed here today,note that AdAttributionKit is fully interoperable with SKAdNetwork.And for more information about SKAdNetwork,check out the WWDC22 session "What’s new with SKAdNetwork".

And finally,our AdAttributionKit documentation is a fantastic resource as you get startedwith your AdAttributionKit integration.Thank you so much for joining me today!
