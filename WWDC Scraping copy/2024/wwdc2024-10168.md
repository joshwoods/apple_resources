Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13

Search this video…Hi and welcome to "Get started with Writing Tools".I’m Liu Dongyuan.I work on text input and internationalization.Writing Tools is a new suite of featuresthat’s available in text views across all kinds of apps.It helps users polish any text they are working on.In this session, I’m going to introduce Writing Tools;then talk about how Writing Tools interacts with native text views;how to control Writing Tools' behavior to better suit your app;how to protect ranges of text such as quotes and code blocks;and finally, how to support Writing Tools for your custom text views.Now, let’s get started with Writing Tools.Writing Tools helps users proofread, rewriteor transform text in text views in iOS, iPadOS and macOS.Suggestions appear right in line,so it’s easy to review and integrate changes quickly and seamlessly.In any native text views,Writing Tools appears on top of the keyboardwhen you select a piece of text.It also appears in the callout bar next to "Cut", "Copy" and "Paste".On macOS, Writing Tools is available in the context menu and the Edit menu.When you hover over selected text in native text views,it shows up as an affordance to open the Writing Tools panel.This is an easy way to invoke Writing Tools right from the text.Let’s take a closer look at what Writing Tools can do.It can proofread your textand show you mistakes like misspellings and grammar errors.You can review the Writing Tools suggestions one by one.Writing Tools can rewrite your textor make the text more friendly, professional and concise.Writing Tools can summarize your text, make text into key pointsand even convert the text into lists or tables.Writing Tools also works with non-editable text.The results will be shown in the panel,and the user can copy or share the results.Now let me show you some of it in action.Let’s say we are throwing a release party for Writing Tools,and there is a rough invitation I wrote.Before sending, I’d like to make sure there are no mistakes.I can invoke Writing Tools in the callout barand select "Proofread".Wow!And once it’s done, I can see all the suggestions right in line.I can tap to review individual changes.It all looks good to me, and I’ll tap "Done" to accept the changes.I also want to send a short message to my friends about the party.I can use Writing Tools to summarize the text to make it shorter.I can copy or share the summary.Lastly, I want to prepare for the release party,and I asked some friends to bring some items.I want to make it a nice table.I’ll select the text, invoke Writing Tools and select "Table".And boom!Notice that all the bold text and the link are still there.Awesome, isn’t it!As you can see, Writing Tools is a powerful toolthat brings more functionality to your text views.Writing Tools automatically appearswhen your app is running in a supported environment.Next up, let’s talk about how Writing Tools works with text viewsand how to get Writing Tools in your app.The good news is,if you are using a UITextView, NSTextView or WKWebView, it just works.Keep in mind that UITextView or NSTextViewhas to use TextKit 2 to support the full Writing Tools experience.If you are using TextKit 1,you will get a limited experience that just shows rewritten results in a panel.For more information on TextKit 2,check out the linked sessions.So, what happens under the hood when you invoke Writing Tools?First, we may expand user’s selection to full sentencesto get better results from the tools.We may also use more text surrounding the selectionto make sure the model is aware of the context of the text.Secondly, Writing Tools fully supports rich text by using attributed strings.The model preserves attributes like styles, links and attachments,as long as the relevant text is still in the rewritten text.Lastly, for list and table transformations,if the text view supports lists and tables,we’ll send NSTextList and NSTextTable to the text storage.You can control if your text view wants to handle tablesby using WritingToolsAllowedInputOptions.We’ll get to that later.As you’ve seen in the demo,when the model is busy processing the text,we show animations when a Writing Tools session is active.During the session, your app may want to pause syncingor avoid accidental editing.We’ve introduced new text view delegate methods for Writing Tools.In textViewWritingToolsWillBegin,you can prepare your app states for Writing Tools.For example, you may want to pause syncingor anything that can directly manipulate the text storage.In textViewWritingToolsDidEnd,you can restore your app states, like resume syncing.We also provide a new isWritingToolsActive property on UITextView.When doing text operations,you may want to be aware if Writing Tools is also interacting with the text view.The new delegate methods and propertyare available for both UITextView and NSTextView.When the text is long,the rewritten text may be delivered to the text view in separate chunks.We apply animations to the text being processedto indicate the model is working.After the model finishes processing,user may tap the "Original" button to switch between original and rewritten text.For proofreading,the suggested changes are applied to the text view automatically.User can review and reject individual suggestions.You may wonder what’s happening to your underlying text storageduring Writing Tools operations.Well, they all actually alter your text storage,which means you should not persist text storage when Writing Tools is active.To allow the user to revert changes after the fact,Writing Tools changes are also pushed to the undo stack.You may want to customize Writing Tools behavior to better suit your app.We have some new text input traits API for you.By default, the system offers Writing Toolswith an in line experience whenever possible,and you don’t need to do anything.If it doesn’t fit your app,you can set the writingToolsBehavior to .limited for a panel experience,or .none to opt-out of Writing Tools completely for a text view.You can also use writingToolsAllowedInputOptionsto specify if your text view supports rich text or tables.If you don’t set it,we assume your text view can render plain text and rich text, but not tables.If your text view only accepts plain text or if it can handle tables,you can specify the options explicitly.Lastly, we have similar APIs for WKWebView.You can specify the same enum via WKWebViewConfiguration.Keep in mind that the default behavior for WKWebViews is .limited.If you want the complete behavior you will need to set that explicitly.You can check or observe the "isWritingToolsActive" propertyto know if a Writing Tools session is active.Now, let’s talk about how to provide ranges for Writing Tools to ignore.Let’s say you are implementing a note-taking appthat can mark certain ranges as code blocksor you have a mail app that can have quoted contents.You may not want Writing Tools to rewrite those ranges.We’ve got you covered!We’ve added a new delegate method in both UITextViewDelegate and NSTextViewDelegate.Simply return the ranges you want to ignore,and Writing Tools will not propose changes within the ranges.For WKWebView, tags like "blockquote" and "pre"will be ignored by Writing Tools automatically.Lastly,what if your app has a custom text view other than UITextView or NSTextView?The good news is, it’s easy to get a basic experience for free.The rewritten text will be shown in the panel,and the user can copy, share or apply the text into the text view.On iOS and iPadOS,as long as your custom text view adopts UITextInteraction,you’ll get Writing Tools in the callout bar or context menu for free.If you can’t use UITextInteraction,you can also adopt UITextSelectionDisplayInteractionwith UIEditMenuInteraction.Under the hood, Writing Tools relies on the UITextInput protocolto read and write the textand to anchor the popover.For more about text interactions,check out some amazing previous WWDC talks.For text views that don’t use text interactions,we’ve added a new optional property isEditable in UITextInput protocol.Adopt that to indicate if your text view supports editing.On the Mac, we’ll show Writing Tools automatically in the context menuand the Edit menu for custom text views.Make sure your text view adopts NSServicesMenuRequestor,which is a protocol to allow the system to read contents from the viewand to write contents back to the view.Override validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)in NSResponder.Then, as long as a context menu is added to the view,the Writing Tools menu item will be there for free.Doing these can also make your appavailable to all kinds of Services and Shortcuts.For that, check out "What’s new in AppKit" in WWDC21.Let me show you all of that in code.I have a simple view here with some textand a menu that provides the copy functionality.To get Writing Tools,you just need to override validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:),and implement at least the writeSelection method in NSServicesMenuRequestor.If your view is an editable text view, implement the readSelection method as wellso that Writing Tools can send the rewritten text back to the text view.In the validRequestor method, you can check sendTypeand determine if your text view wants to handle rich text.As long as all these are done,you will get both Writing Tools and Services in the context menu.That wraps up the session.What’s next?Try out Writing Tools with your app.In most cases you don’t need to do anything - it just works!Adopt the new delegate methods to control your app statesduring a Writing Tools session.If your app has special needs or capabilities,check out Writing Tools' behavior and allowed input options.If you have a custom text view,you can start providing Writing Tools featureswith just a few steps.And lastly, enjoy writing!Thanks for watching!

Keep in mind that UITextView or NSTextViewhas to use TextKit 2 to support the full Writing Tools experience.If you are using TextKit 1,you will get a limited experience that just shows rewritten results in a panel.

For more information on TextKit 2,check out the linked sessions.

So, what happens under the hood when you invoke Writing Tools?First, we may expand user’s selection to full sentencesto get better results from the tools.We may also use more text surrounding the selectionto make sure the model is aware of the context of the text.

Secondly, Writing Tools fully supports rich text by using attributed strings.The model preserves attributes like styles, links and attachments,as long as the relevant text is still in the rewritten text.

In textViewWritingToolsWillBegin,you can prepare your app states for Writing Tools.For example, you may want to pause syncingor anything that can directly manipulate the text storage.

In textViewWritingToolsDidEnd,you can restore your app states, like resume syncing.

We also provide a new isWritingToolsActive property on UITextView.When doing text operations,you may want to be aware if Writing Tools is also interacting with the text view.

The new delegate methods and propertyare available for both UITextView and NSTextView.

When the text is long,the rewritten text may be delivered to the text view in separate chunks.We apply animations to the text being processedto indicate the model is working.

After the model finishes processing,user may tap the "Original" button to switch between original and rewritten text.

For proofreading,the suggested changes are applied to the text view automatically.User can review and reject individual suggestions.

You may wonder what’s happening to your underlying text storageduring Writing Tools operations.Well, they all actually alter your text storage,which means you should not persist text storage when Writing Tools is active.To allow the user to revert changes after the fact,Writing Tools changes are also pushed to the undo stack.You may want to customize Writing Tools behavior to better suit your app.We have some new text input traits API for you.

By default, the system offers Writing Toolswith an in line experience whenever possible,and you don’t need to do anything.If it doesn’t fit your app,you can set the writingToolsBehavior to .limited for a panel experience,or .none to opt-out of Writing Tools completely for a text view.

You can also use writingToolsAllowedInputOptionsto specify if your text view supports rich text or tables.If you don’t set it,we assume your text view can render plain text and rich text, but not tables.If your text view only accepts plain text or if it can handle tables,you can specify the options explicitly.

Lastly, we have similar APIs for WKWebView.You can specify the same enum via WKWebViewConfiguration.Keep in mind that the default behavior for WKWebViews is .limited.If you want the complete behavior you will need to set that explicitly.

You can check or observe the "isWritingToolsActive" propertyto know if a Writing Tools session is active.Now, let’s talk about how to provide ranges for Writing Tools to ignore.

Let’s say you are implementing a note-taking appthat can mark certain ranges as code blocksor you have a mail app that can have quoted contents.You may not want Writing Tools to rewrite those ranges.We’ve got you covered!We’ve added a new delegate method in both UITextViewDelegate and NSTextViewDelegate.Simply return the ranges you want to ignore,and Writing Tools will not propose changes within the ranges.

On iOS and iPadOS,as long as your custom text view adopts UITextInteraction,you’ll get Writing Tools in the callout bar or context menu for free.If you can’t use UITextInteraction,you can also adopt UITextSelectionDisplayInteractionwith UIEditMenuInteraction.Under the hood, Writing Tools relies on the UITextInput protocolto read and write the textand to anchor the popover.

For more about text interactions,check out some amazing previous WWDC talks.

For text views that don’t use text interactions,we’ve added a new optional property isEditable in UITextInput protocol.Adopt that to indicate if your text view supports editing.

On the Mac, we’ll show Writing Tools automatically in the context menuand the Edit menu for custom text views.

Make sure your text view adopts NSServicesMenuRequestor,which is a protocol to allow the system to read contents from the viewand to write contents back to the view.

Override validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:)in NSResponder.Then, as long as a context menu is added to the view,the Writing Tools menu item will be there for free.

Doing these can also make your appavailable to all kinds of Services and Shortcuts.For that, check out "What’s new in AppKit" in WWDC21.

Let me show you all of that in code.I have a simple view here with some textand a menu that provides the copy functionality.To get Writing Tools,you just need to override validRequestor(forSendType:returnType:),and implement at least the writeSelection method in NSServicesMenuRequestor.If your view is an editable text view, implement the readSelection method as wellso that Writing Tools can send the rewritten text back to the text view.
