Introducing enterprise APIs for visionOS

Search this video…Hello! I’m Mike, an engineering manager on the Device Management team.I’m excited to share what’s new this year for managing Apple devices.At Apple, our mission is to create products that enrich people’s lives,and we view our work in education and enterprise as integral to that goal.Apple devices are used in schools and offices across the globeto empower learning and productivity with users of all ages.We want to enable IT administrators to make it easyfor their users to do something great with their devices.In this session we’ll be covering the new features for IT to help themdeploy and manage Apple devices, and how developers can implementthese updates in their MDM and Identity solutions.First, we’ll cover what’s new in Apple Business Managerand Apple School Manager,followed by management updates to Apple platforms.And, finally enhancements to education-specific tools.Let’s begin with Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager.These free web-based portals for IT administrators work in conjunctionwith third-party MDM solutions to easily deploy devices,view inventory, purchase apps in volume, and manage user accounts.Let’s start with Deployment.With Automated Device Enrollment, IT teams can ship devicesdirectly to users, enroll them into MDM, customize the setup experience,and ensure they are ready to be managed,all without having to physically touch devices.Automated Device Enrollment is available for Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV,and, this year we are excited to share that it’s coming to our newest device,Apple Vision Pro!With visionOS 2.0, IT teams will be able to automatically enroll Apple Vision Prointo MDM within the Setup Assistant, just like other Apple devices today.Organizations that have purchased Vision Pro, and associated them with theirApple Customer Number, will have access to themin Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager.The Device Assignment API Collection now includes values for Vision Pro.We’ll cover more details about Vision Pro later in the session.There are other updates to Automated Device Enrollmentthat will continue making it easier for IT teams to deploy Apple devices.Automated Device Enrollment on macOS 15 will now supportWebAuthN for web authentication.Public key cryptography simplifies and secures enrollment customizationwith ASWebAuthenticationSession, providing support for security keysand Passkeys, ideal for organizations in highly regulated industries.Finally, as always, check the documentation for informationon new and expanded Setup Assistant skip keys.For example, the iOS Welcome key now also applies to macOS.Also take note that the SkipSetupItems array in the Setup Assistant payloadis now honored on macOS.Apple Business Manager and Apple School Managerprovide a central place to view all organization-owned devices.Let’s take a look at what’s new in Devices.This screen provides a holistic view of the devices your organizations owns.Here we can see an Apple Vision Pro listed in the device list, and Apple WatchBoth Apple Vision Pro and Apple Watch can be automaticallyadded to an organization at the time of purchase.Apple Watch MDM enrollment takes place during the pairing process,but there are other management features in Apple Business Managerand Apple School Manager available to organization-owned devices,such as ActivationLock.We set out to solve a common issue that we hear from IT teams everywhere.When a device is wiped or locked, Activation Lock can preventunauthorized users from using that device.But in some cases, Activation Lock is left on unintentionally,which means that device cannot be re-provisioned.In Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager, Activation Lockcan now be turned off for organization-owned devices!Administrators can simply select the device, open the menu,and select Turn Off Activation Lock.This will be available for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Vision Pro,as long as the devices are in your organization.And, this will be available for both organization and user Activation Lock.Specifically for the Mac, this means an organization can turn offActivation Lock even if the user enabled Activation Lock using their personalApple Account before the Mac was enrolled in MDM!Those are some great updates for deployment and devicesin Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager,and next, we’ll talk about Identity.Managed Apple Accounts are a special type of Apple Account designed specificallyfor use in an organization, like a business or a school.They allow an organization to own both the account and the data within it,and are a key component for any deployment.Last year we introduced significant updates to Managed Apple Accountsby bringing iCloud support to a wide range of Apple apps and services,including Continuity, Developer, and Passkeys.We believe that all organizations should adopt Managed Apple Accounts,and we are making it even easier to get started by streamliningthe domain capture process, and providing more options to ensure all accountsare using your organization’s domain.Today, when an organization wants to create new Managed Apple Accountson their domain, they need to verify their domain.However, personal Apple Accounts can still use this domain and not be managed,unless connected to an Identity Provider, which allows blocking of new,and capturing of existing, unmanaged accounts on your domain.New this year, IT admins will have the ability to limit new Apple Accountscreated on their domain to only be Managed Apple Accounts.And for organizations that want to ensure they can manage and ownall Apple Accounts using their domain, admins will now be able to captureApple Accounts that use their organization’s domain without needingto connect to an Identity Provider.When an organization initiates the process to capture Apple Accountsusing their domain today, users are asked to choosea different email address.And while this frees up the account name to be reused,we know that many accounts were created just for work,even before Managed Apple Accounts were available.So this year, users will also have the option to convert their existingaccount into a Managed Apple Account.This will automatically add the account to the organizationin Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager.If they don’t take action after 30 days, the account will remaina personal account and will be renamed automatically.Apple Business Manager and Apple School Managerare critical tools for organizations, and these features will make it easierfor IT teams to manage their organization’s devicesand start using Managed Apple Accounts.These same features will also be available to Apple Business Essentials customers.Next, let’s take a look at what’s new for the devices you manage.A common task across all platforms is managing software updates.Keeping devices up to date is an essential componentof managing devices in an organizational environment.Last year, we announced the abilityto enforce updates by a specific date and time.This year we’re introducing a new software update settings configuration,which will replace all legacy MDM software update management commands,profiles, and restrictions.This declaration can be used on supervised devices with iOS and iPadOS 18,and macOS 15, or later, to manage all aspects of software updates,and includes new features.Including a way to change notification behavior to shownotifications only one hour before enforcement timesand the restart countdown,and management of beta updates.It’s now easier than ever to manage public or AppleSeedfor IT beta program participation in an organization.The first step is that a user with the role of administratorin Apple School Manager or Apple Business Managerenrolls into AppleSeed for IT at beta.apple.com/it.Devices can be added to the beta program at any time using an organization token.The user does not need to be signed in to Settings with an Apple Account.Similar to software updates and upgrades, beta releases provided by those programscan be enforced and deferred on supervised devices.And a declarative status report provides increased visibilityand allows organizations to track beta program enrollmentson managed devices.Let's take a look at how a token is generated and retrieved.First, a user with the role of administratorin Apple School Manager or Apple Business Managerenrolls at beta.apple.com/it.Next, a unique token is generated for that organization and seeding period.To retrieve the tokens, the MDM checks the OS beta enrollment tokens endpointto discover available programs.Similar to other service endpoints,MDM solutions must authenticate using OAuth.And finally, the program tokens are returnedto Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager,and then to the MDM.After enrolling a device into management, an MDM solution can use those tokensto offer, enroll, unenroll, and block supervised iPhone and iPad devicesfrom beta programs using the Beta dictionaryin the new software update declaration.Additionally, the beta program can be set during Automated Device Enrollmentin Setup Assistant starting with iOS and iPadOS 17.5 and macOS 14.5.During enrollment, the MDM solution can returnan HTTP response with the 403 status code to enforcea specific beta version, and include a JSON or XML object in the response body.The body of the response can include the RequireBetaProgram dictionary,which must contain the following keys to set the beta program:Description, which is a description of the beta program, and the Token.After the device enrolls in the beta program,subsequent beta updates will be available.Using the available configuration options, an organization can remotely enrolldifferent devices into different beta programs,and combined with the option to defer beta and production releases,can be used to implement a phased testing and rollout approach,starting right with the first beta release.Extensive details are provided for software update managementin the new software update documentation.It can be downloaded from AppleSeed for IT.Next, let’s explore what’s new in Safari management.Safari is the best browser for Apple devices, offering industry-leading speedand long-lasting battery life.And this year we’re making it even easierfor IT professionals to manage what their users do with the app.I’m excited to share that Safari extensions can now be managedon iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.With the new Safari extension configuration, you can:Define which extensions are allowed, giving users the abilityto turn them on or off;Control whether an extension is always on or always off,letting IT admins choose what’s needed for their fleet;Configure extension website access by domain and sub-domain,and, all of this also works with Safari Private Browsing!And, or course, Safari provides users with a visual indicationas to which extensions are managed.Next, let’s take a look at Apple Vision Pro.Vision Pro seamlessly blends digital content withthe physical world, and brings game-changing capabilitiesto enterprise and education.We’re already seeing enterprise use cases emerge acrossEveryday Productivity, Collaborative Design,Simulation and Training, and Guided Work.For developers, check out the "Introducing enterprise APIs for visionOS"session, to learn more about how we are enabling even more use casesfor enterprise customers.To support deployment at scale,we brought MDM to Vision Pro earlier this year with visionOS 1.1For IT teams, it’s best to think of managing Vision Prothe same way they currently manage iPhone and iPad,as it uses the same familiar device managementand infrastructure that IT uses today.visionOS 1.1 supports two types of enrollments:Device Enrollment and User Enrollment.For both enrollment types,users simply sign in with their Managed Apple Account.Within the Settings app, users navigate to General > VPN & Device Management,and select Sign In to Work or School Account.Management functions and capabilities are transparent to the user,showing them what IT has configured for their device.Using either Device Enrollment or User Enrollmentwith a Managed Apple Account also enables data separationin iCloud Drive, Notes, Reminders, and more.Here’s an example of data separation within iCloud Drive.The user’s personal iCloud Driveappears next to their corporate iCloud Drive,which is associated with their Managed Apple Account.Personal data, like text messages and photosalways remain private even on organization-owned devices.And, as we mentioned earlier, visionOS 2.0 adds a third enrollment type.For organization-owned devices,Automated Device Enrollment can now be used for zero-touch deployments.Just like iPhone and iPad, this also enables supervision.During Setup Assistant, the user sees the new Remote Management screen.This screen explains the device is owned by the organization,and prompts the user to complete MDM enrollment.After enrollment, IT teams can configure settings and also deploy apps.The same app deployment process for iPhone and iPadcan be used to deploy apps directly to devicesand ensure they are managed.And for MDM developers,the Apps and Books for Organizations APInow includes information about an app’s compatibility with visionOS.Beyond Automated Device Enrollment,we are greatly expanding management capabilities for Vision Pro this yearwith new configurations and payloads, new MDM commandsand quite a few new restrictions.visionOS 2.0 now supports most configurations and payloads,including the Passcode policy, Domains, and Web Content Filter payloads,plus, many new MDM commands likeDeviceConfigured, DeviceLock, and various Settings sub-commands,and finally, the most popular and relevant restrictions,most of which work similarly to iOS and iPadOS,including Managed Open-In restrictions, Account modification,And allowCamera, which needed a bit of reimagining for a deviceas camera centric as Vision Pro.For example, when a user takes a screenshot, the background is removedand only active windows are captured.With visionOS 2.0, we have extended management for Apple Vision Proto support most of the MDM payloads, configurations, and commands.Managing a Vision Pro is as easy as managing an iPhone or iPad.Next, let’s talk about Mac.Last year we added support for installing service configuration files,such as sudo, PAM, and SSH.And we encouraged the communityto use that facility for their own configuration files.This year we’re adding support for executable filesin service configuration files,giving admins the ability to install IT management toolsand other scripts in a tamper-resistant locationall delivered in the same zip archive format.In addition, launchd configuration filescan now also be installed using the background task services configurationproviding an easy way for IT to create and control background taskswhich also get stored in a secure and tamper resistant location.For regulated industries,we understand being able to control what external data sourcescan be used on Mac computers is critical.And this year we’re excited to introduce a new disk management configurationthat allows IT admins to manage external and network storage.IT admins can choose whether external or network storageis allowed or disallowed all together,or even chose whether to limit mounting to read-only volumes.This new configuration replaces the previously deprecatedmedia management payload, which will be removed in a future release.With Platform Single Sign-on or Platform SSO,developers can build SSO extensions that extend to the macOS login window,allowing users to synchronize local account credentialswith an identity provider or IdP.This year expands on the capabilities of Platform SSOso you can leverage information from your identity provider in even more places.Identity provider authentication can now unlock FileVault.Login policies can now require IdP authenticationacross FileVault, login window, and lock screen.And stronger security options have been added, including HPKE.Let’s take a quick look at an example configuration.Here you can see that the FileVault policyis set for the FileVault login screen to AttemptAuthentication.In this case, IdP authentication is attempted before proceeding.However, if the server is unavailable,and the user-provided credential is correct,the user will still be able to login.For the UnlockPolicy, which controls unlocking from screensaver,RequireAuthentication is set.That makes login from the screensaver more restrictive.A valid IdP authentication is required before proceeding,with a few specified exceptions.Here, AllowOfflineGracePeriod is set, so if the device is offline,the OfflineGracePeriod is used to determinewhether the user may proceed with a valid credential.We also see that AllowTouchIDOrWatchForUnlock is set,which means biometrics and Watch are allowed to unlock the screensaverin lieu of IdP authentication.Finally, just a quick note that the Profiles section has been renamedto Device Management and has been moved under General,bringing more parity with iPhone and iPad.You’ll now also find the Login Items and Extensions section in General as well.Now, let’s take a look at updates for iPhone and iPad.We have various cellular-related improvements.We added two new restrictions that can prevent eSIM deletion.First, force preserve eSIM on erase prevents an eSIMfrom being removed when a device is erased locally by the user.And second, allow eSIM outgoing transferscontrols whether eSIM can be transferred to a newly setup device.Users can now touch and hold a QR code, or click on a link,to set up eSIM on a device they’re setting up,making it easier than ever for users to configure their own devices.If network slicing and per-app VPN are both configured for an app,all traffic coming from the managed appwill be routed to the 5G network slice identified,while still providing the benefits of using VPNAnd iOS and iPadOS 18will support multiple Private Cellular Network payloads,enabling configuration for up to five private 5G or LTE networks.iOS and iPadOS 18 provide new controls that allow users to lock appsby requiring Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode,and allow users to hide apps from the home screen.Organizations will be able to manage user’s ability to use the controlsin two ways:Organizations can restrict locking and hiding for all appson supervised devices,and, locking and hiding can be controlled, on a per-app basis,for managed apps.Note that hiding an app also locks it,so restricting the ability to lock an app will also restrict hiding it.On device enrollments, hidden apps are still visible to MDM.And on user enrollments, hidden managed appsare still visible to MDM.Stolen Device Protectionadds a layer of security when your iPhone is away fromfamiliar locations, such as home or work,by forcing a security delay of one hour to prevent a thieffrom performing critical operations on your iPhone,such as: Enrolling in MDM, manually adding an Exchange account,and manually installing passcode declarations, or Exchange payloads.In iOS 18, we’ve added a special exception that enrolling in MDM,on a newly set up device without any familiar locations,will not cause a security delay for the first 3 hoursafter Stolen Device Protection is enabled.Beginning in iOS and iPadOS 18, installing proprietary,in-house apps using a new team identity will require a restartin addition to trusting the identity in Settings.This requirement only applies to in-house apps installed without the use of MDM.Each new team ID requires a single device restart.Any team identities that were trusted before upgrading to iOSand iPadOS 18 will be migrated, so a restart won’t be requiredif the app using that identity remains installed.We covered a lot, but there are even more platform changes like restrictionsfor iPhone Mirroring, FaceTime Remote Control, and more.So please be sure to check the developer documentation for more information.Now let’s take a look at some enhancements specifically designed for education.With Easy Student Sign-In, teachers signed into an iPadwith their Managed Apple Account can use that device to quickly signstudents into their devices.Now, with iPadOS 17.4 and macOS 14.4,we have introduced a new featurethat allows teachers using Managed Apple Accountsto use Classroom with any nearby iPad and Mac devicesregardless of account status.Both Easy Student Sign-inand Unmanaged Nearby Classes in Classroom,are now available in Access Management in Apple School Manager,so administrators can control these features in their institution.Schoolwork is an iPad app that helps teachers save time,identify trends, view progress, and maximize each student’s potential.Using Schoolwork, teachers can create and send assignments,class announcements, or study reminders.And now, with Schoolwork 3.0,we are introducing new assessment and scoring workflows.With iPadOS 17.5 and later, teachers can now send assessments by scanningor importing their existing documents.This includes Pages, Numbers, Keynotes, Google Suite documents, and PDFs.Teachers will also be able to score documents,and have the ability to analyze student performance per question.These new assessment and scoring featureswill help teachers use analytics, identify trends,and create personalized learning experiences for students.Finally, Assessment Mode allows developers to configure their appsto disable certain hardware and software features at launchto create a secure testing environment.As of iPadOS 17.6, we’re now excited to bring Multi-App Mode for iPad.This includes secondary apps such as note pads, spreadsheets,assistive apps, coding apps, and, of course,the new Calculator app for iPad.To make sure that the new Calculator app can be customized for classroomsand is test-ready for standardized and high-stakes exams,we’ve built in configuration for Assessment Mode and MDM,such as the ability to turn off Scientific mode or Math Notes.Those are just a few education updates,so please be sure to check the developer documentationand open source schema for more information.Now let's wrap-up.We’ve made some big improvements to domain capturein Apple Business Manager and Apple School Managerto make it easier than ever to deploy Managed Apple Accountsin your organization.New Activation Lock features make it easier than everto recover organization devices that have had Activation Lock inadvertently left on,whether enabled by the MDM or the user.Using the new software update controls,you can implement a phased rollout starting right from the very first beta.IT teams now have the ability to manage and enableSafari extensions directly from MDM,so you can customize Safari for your organization right out of the box.And, updates in visionOS 2.0 bring the most important MDM commands, payloads,declarations, and restrictions to Apple Vision Pro.Thank you for watching! And have a great WWDC!

In Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager, Activation Lockcan now be turned off for organization-owned devices!Administrators can simply select the device, open the menu,and select Turn Off Activation Lock.

This will be available for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Vision Pro,as long as the devices are in your organization.

And, this will be available for both organization and user Activation Lock.Specifically for the Mac, this means an organization can turn offActivation Lock even if the user enabled Activation Lock using their personalApple Account before the Mac was enrolled in MDM!Those are some great updates for deployment and devicesin Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager,and next, we’ll talk about Identity.Managed Apple Accounts are a special type of Apple Account designed specificallyfor use in an organization, like a business or a school.They allow an organization to own both the account and the data within it,and are a key component for any deployment.

And a declarative status report provides increased visibilityand allows organizations to track beta program enrollmentson managed devices.

Let's take a look at how a token is generated and retrieved.First, a user with the role of administratorin Apple School Manager or Apple Business Managerenrolls at beta.apple.com/it.Next, a unique token is generated for that organization and seeding period.

For regulated industries,we understand being able to control what external data sourcescan be used on Mac computers is critical.

And this year we’re excited to introduce a new disk management configurationthat allows IT admins to manage external and network storage.IT admins can choose whether external or network storageis allowed or disallowed all together,or even chose whether to limit mounting to read-only volumes.

This new configuration replaces the previously deprecatedmedia management payload, which will be removed in a future release.

With Platform Single Sign-on or Platform SSO,developers can build SSO extensions that extend to the macOS login window,allowing users to synchronize local account credentialswith an identity provider or IdP.

This year expands on the capabilities of Platform SSOso you can leverage information from your identity provider in even more places.Identity provider authentication can now unlock FileVault.Login policies can now require IdP authenticationacross FileVault, login window, and lock screen.And stronger security options have been added, including HPKE.Let’s take a quick look at an example configuration.

Here you can see that the FileVault policyis set for the FileVault login screen to AttemptAuthentication.In this case, IdP authentication is attempted before proceeding.However, if the server is unavailable,and the user-provided credential is correct,the user will still be able to login.For the UnlockPolicy, which controls unlocking from screensaver,RequireAuthentication is set.That makes login from the screensaver more restrictive.A valid IdP authentication is required before proceeding,with a few specified exceptions.

Here, AllowOfflineGracePeriod is set, so if the device is offline,the OfflineGracePeriod is used to determinewhether the user may proceed with a valid credential.

We also see that AllowTouchIDOrWatchForUnlock is set,which means biometrics and Watch are allowed to unlock the screensaverin lieu of IdP authentication.

Finally, just a quick note that the Profiles section has been renamedto Device Management and has been moved under General,bringing more parity with iPhone and iPad.You’ll now also find the Login Items and Extensions section in General as well.Now, let’s take a look at updates for iPhone and iPad.

We have various cellular-related improvements.We added two new restrictions that can prevent eSIM deletion.First, force preserve eSIM on erase prevents an eSIMfrom being removed when a device is erased locally by the user.And second, allow eSIM outgoing transferscontrols whether eSIM can be transferred to a newly setup device.Users can now touch and hold a QR code, or click on a link,to set up eSIM on a device they’re setting up,making it easier than ever for users to configure their own devices.If network slicing and per-app VPN are both configured for an app,all traffic coming from the managed appwill be routed to the 5G network slice identified,while still providing the benefits of using VPNAnd iOS and iPadOS 18will support multiple Private Cellular Network payloads,enabling configuration for up to five private 5G or LTE networks.

iOS and iPadOS 18 provide new controls that allow users to lock appsby requiring Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode,and allow users to hide apps from the home screen.Organizations will be able to manage user’s ability to use the controlsin two ways:Organizations can restrict locking and hiding for all appson supervised devices,and, locking and hiding can be controlled, on a per-app basis,for managed apps.

Note that hiding an app also locks it,so restricting the ability to lock an app will also restrict hiding it.

On device enrollments, hidden apps are still visible to MDM.And on user enrollments, hidden managed appsare still visible to MDM.

Stolen Device Protectionadds a layer of security when your iPhone is away fromfamiliar locations, such as home or work,by forcing a security delay of one hour to prevent a thieffrom performing critical operations on your iPhone,such as: Enrolling in MDM, manually adding an Exchange account,and manually installing passcode declarations, or Exchange payloads.In iOS 18, we’ve added a special exception that enrolling in MDM,on a newly set up device without any familiar locations,will not cause a security delay for the first 3 hoursafter Stolen Device Protection is enabled.

Beginning in iOS and iPadOS 18, installing proprietary,in-house apps using a new team identity will require a restartin addition to trusting the identity in Settings.This requirement only applies to in-house apps installed without the use of MDM.

Each new team ID requires a single device restart.

Any team identities that were trusted before upgrading to iOSand iPadOS 18 will be migrated, so a restart won’t be requiredif the app using that identity remains installed.We covered a lot, but there are even more platform changes like restrictionsfor iPhone Mirroring, FaceTime Remote Control, and more.So please be sure to check the developer documentation for more information.Now let’s take a look at some enhancements specifically designed for education.

With Easy Student Sign-In, teachers signed into an iPadwith their Managed Apple Account can use that device to quickly signstudents into their devices.Now, with iPadOS 17.4 and macOS 14.4,we have introduced a new featurethat allows teachers using Managed Apple Accountsto use Classroom with any nearby iPad and Mac devicesregardless of account status.

Both Easy Student Sign-inand Unmanaged Nearby Classes in Classroom,are now available in Access Management in Apple School Manager,so administrators can control these features in their institution.

Schoolwork is an iPad app that helps teachers save time,identify trends, view progress, and maximize each student’s potential.Using Schoolwork, teachers can create and send assignments,class announcements, or study reminders.And now, with Schoolwork 3.0,we are introducing new assessment and scoring workflows.

With iPadOS 17.5 and later, teachers can now send assessments by scanningor importing their existing documents.This includes Pages, Numbers, Keynotes, Google Suite documents, and PDFs.

Teachers will also be able to score documents,and have the ability to analyze student performance per question.

These new assessment and scoring featureswill help teachers use analytics, identify trends,and create personalized learning experiences for students.

Finally, Assessment Mode allows developers to configure their appsto disable certain hardware and software features at launchto create a secure testing environment.As of iPadOS 17.6, we’re now excited to bring Multi-App Mode for iPad.

This includes secondary apps such as note pads, spreadsheets,assistive apps, coding apps, and, of course,the new Calculator app for iPad.To make sure that the new Calculator app can be customized for classroomsand is test-ready for standardized and high-stakes exams,we’ve built in configuration for Assessment Mode and MDM,such as the ability to turn off Scientific mode or Math Notes.Those are just a few education updates,so please be sure to check the developer documentationand open source schema for more information.

Now let's wrap-up.

We’ve made some big improvements to domain capturein Apple Business Manager and Apple School Managerto make it easier than ever to deploy Managed Apple Accountsin your organization.

New Activation Lock features make it easier than everto recover organization devices that have had Activation Lock inadvertently left on,whether enabled by the MDM or the user.

Using the new software update controls,you can implement a phased rollout starting right from the very first beta.

IT teams now have the ability to manage and enableSafari extensions directly from MDM,so you can customize Safari for your organization right out of the box.

And, updates in visionOS 2.0 bring the most important MDM commands, payloads,declarations, and restrictions to Apple Vision Pro.Thank you for watching! And have a great WWDC!
