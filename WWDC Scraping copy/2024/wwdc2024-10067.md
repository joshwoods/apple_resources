Meet WeatherKit

Search this video…Hello, my name is Sidy.I'm a software engineer on the Weather team.And today, I am here to share with yousome exciting updates coming to WeatherKit this year.WeatherKit is powered by the Apple Weather Service.Its easy-to-use, privacy-first APIs enable youto provide accurate, hyperlocal weather data.And WeatherKit is not just at the core of our own Weather app.Its Swift and REST APIs are used by developers such as:Carrot Weather, (Not Boring) Weather, and DuckDuckGo,to deliver critical weather information to their users.This year,we’re making WeatherKit better than ever, with some great enhancements!First, we’re enriching forecasts with details like precipitation amountsand cloud cover by altitude.Then, we’re introducing the abilityto contextually highlight upcoming weather changes.And finally, we’re adding support for a binary formatthat expedites data transfer.Today, I’ll be walking through each of these,including how you can implement them in your app,starting with richer forecast details.WeatherKit is made up of several great APIs.There’s availability to tell you which datasetsare available for a given location,attribution to give you the data sources to attribute to,and there’s activeAlertto give you details about ongoing severe weather.But the most important of them all is the weather API.It offers some of the most essential weather datalike current conditions, minute by minute precipitation,10 days worth of hourly and daily forecasts, and weather alerts.And this year, we are making it even betterby adding more details to the current, hourly, and daily forecasts.The current conditions provide details about the weather in the moment,like temperature, wind speed, or UV Index.And now, you can add even finer details like cloud cover by altitude.We are bringing these enhancements to the hourly forecast as well.You can now complement hourly cloud cover forecastwith details like how it varies by altitude.Or, offer precipitation amounts by hour, just like the Apple Weather app.And the daily forecast queryis getting the biggest enhancement of them all.You can now easily add more granular daily forecasts to your apps,like high and low humidity,or, you can even split your forecast by day parts, separating day time weatherfrom that of the night.Now, I will show you how you can access hourly precipitation data in your appwith an example in Swift.First, I will quickly add an extension on CLLocation.This makes it easy to refer to New York as our reference location hereand in all our upcoming Swift examples.Fetching precipitation data is easy.First, I need to pass in the location for which I want get the data.Then, what granularity I want for my data.Here, I want hourly so I specify the .hourly query.Finally, I simply access the precipitationAmount propertyon the hourly forecast.And as with everything else on WeatherKit,these properties are available via the REST API.Let me show you how to implement the previous example, in REST.WeatherKit APIs are hosted at weatherkit.apple.com,so I pass that as the RESTful URL path.Next, I append parameters that represent the version of the API.This is version 2 as of this release.I provide the API, in this case, weather,following that, I add a parameter that represents the localefor which I want to fetch the data.Here I use en-US for American English, but I can pick from any localesupported by iOS.And If I pass an unsupported locale,then the response defaults to en-US.I also specify the location coordinates for which I need the data.Here, it’s New York City as in the Swift example.Finally, I specify the datasets to fetch.In this example, it is the hourly forecast.I also have the option of specifying the range of hoursfor which I need the forecast.In this example, and for the sake of simplicity,I restrict it to the current hour.But I can also request up to 240 hours of forecast.Note that WeatherKit defaults to 24 hours, starting with the current hour,if no range is specified.Also note the use of the relative hourly query parameters,which allows the Apple Weather Service to computethe exact start and end time for the forecastbased on the supplied timezone.And as a reminder,you need to produce an authentication bearerin order to access the Apple Weather Service.Now let’s take a look at the result.So, I issued a GET on that URL and it returned an objecthosted under the forecastHourly key.It contains an array of hour forecasts,and each hour forecasthas several properties, including one named precipitationAmount,just like the one in our Swift program.When checking the weather,we are actively looking for changing patternsbecause significant changes in weather can make or break plans.Learning about such changes ahead of time and in context is essentialand as such,we are adding two brand new queries to the Weather API to do just that.So now introducing: Changes and Historical Comparisons.Let’s start with changes.The changes query provides upcoming changes to temperatureand precipitationincluding the time at which they will occurqualifying significant upcoming fluctuations,such as increases, or decreases.The Weather app uses this query todayto highlight upcoming temperature changes to its users.And now, you too can use the Changes query in your app.Let me show you how.Continuing with New York City as my location,I fetch the changes in weather by using the .changes query.This returns a list of changes, from which I filter out allexcept those changes occurring tomorrow.Note that I extended the Date struct to have isTomorrow as a property,so as to conveniently express my use case.For this next step, I map the results to an arraycontaining only low temperature changes.Finally, if there are any changes,and those changes contain a decrease in temperature,I display an appropriate message to the user.To do this in REST, I simply specify the weatherChanges dataset.Note that this product always returns information,even if it’s to tell youthat there are no upcoming significant changes in weather.Let’s take a look at an example output to crystalize our understanding.So I just issued a GET request for weather changes,and got some data back.The weather changes object is behind the weatherChanges keyas you would expect.It's a wrapper object for a list of changestucked under the changes propertyEach change has a start date for the change in forecastand an end date.And finally, the type of change that is expected to occur.For this first change, it means that we expect an increasein the maximum temperature at the time frame specified.Note how the change in condition could also be a decrease,or, if no change is expectedthe field will be populated with the steady marker.Changes in weather are best understood in context.So, we’re also introducing Historical Comparisons.Based on data collected over the past 50+ years,Historical Comparisons lets you compare today’s weather to historical averages,with results ordered by significance of deviationfrom the mean.You can see the historical comparisons query in use todayin the Weather app,where we show the deviation of today’s high temperaturefrom the historical average.This query of the Weather API is convenient to use as well.To show you how, here is another fun code snippet.In Swift, just request weather dataincluding the .historicalComparisons query.Remember that the list is orderedby significance of deviation from the mean.Now that we have our significant trend deviation identified,we can print it and tell the user.If you are using the REST API,just include the historical comparisons dataset.Just like in Swift, you will get a list of comparisons ordered by significanceof deviation from the average.Let’s take a look at the output of that request.The resulting object is stored under the historicalComparisons keyand it contains a list of comparisons.Each comparison has the condition for which the trend is computed.The current value for the condition.The baseline value, which should give you contextas to which direction we have been trending.The type of deviation is also listed.This corresponds to the amplitude of the deviation.In this case, the deviation is within the normal range.Other possible values for this field are: higher, much higher, lower, and much lower.The baseline type represents which statistical method is usedto establish a baseline.In this case, we use the mean,as opposed to something like the median value.This field value could changeif we updated our statistical inference method.And finally, you get the date when we established a baselinefor the computed averages for that condition.As you see, Apple Weather has introduced several enhancements to the Weather API,that will allow you to get richer picture of the current forecast,empowering you in turnto provide various slices of the forecast to your usersas you see fit in your app.At this time, I would like to talk about making senseof the rich weather data that you can get with WeatherKit,in the global historical context.Understanding the weather in the context of the climatehas become essential to any great weather experience.Beyond increasing climate awareness,a general understanding of long-term weather patterns at a locationcan even help with planning events, or vacations far out into the future.To make this easy, we're adding an all new Statistics APIthat is designed to get you broad and narrowhistorical statistics about weather.The Statistics API has two new queries: Historical Averages and Daily Summaries.With Historical Averages, you can fetch long-term averages for temperatureand precipitation based on data recorded since January 1, 1970.These come in hourly, daily and monthly granularities.For instance,the Weather app leverages this API to show monthly precipitation averages,so that users can conveniently avoid the rainy seasonwhen planning their next great vacation.Now, I'm going to show youhow you can fetch statistics data in your app as well.Here, I implemented a Swift example of fetching monthly statistics.Simply invoke the monthly statistics functionon the WeatherService.Include your start and end month.As per the Gregorian calendar, 1 is January and 12 is December.And the type of query that you are interested in.Here, it’s precipitation.Now that I have the results,I group them in a dictionary keyed by the month.When using the REST API, I call the statistics, monthly API.Pass in precipitation as my dataset, then I specify my start and end months.This returns a list of month averages.Let’s take a look at the output next.So we have our monthly weather statistics object,it contains the baseline start date for the computed averages.The list of monthly averages is hosted under the months property.Since we only fetched precipitation, that’s all we have.The precipitation object contains monthly averages dataderived by the Apple Weather Service.Finally, the index of the concerned month is listed,1 through 12.Using the Statistics API,you can also get a summary of the weather for any day in the pastback to August 1, 2021.The summary includes the high and low temperaturesas well as precipitation and snowfall amounts.The Weather app uses thisto show how precipitation has accumulated over the past thirty days,so as to better put today into context.Let’s take a look at how to fetch this data in Swift.Here, I want to fetch the past 30 days’ worth of weather summary datafocusing on precipitation data, in Swift.I specify my date interval which started 30 days ago and ends now,note that thirtyDaysAgois a custom extension that I defined on Date.I include precipitation as my query.And now that I have my data, I use it to inform the user.Note again that I only requested precipitation amountsin this example.If using the REST API, I call the summary daily path.Then, as in the Swift example, I filter for the precipitation data set.Finally, I specify the start and end date for the data that I wish to receive.The results are an array of daily summarieswhich normally contain temperature and precipitation data.Note only precipitation has nonzero values since that’s what we requested.As you can see, the Apple Weather Service has been investing tremendous resourcesbuilding these models that allow us to put today’s weatherin the greater historical context.In this release, we are making the data computed by these models available to you.And we're eager to have you incorporate this wealth of new data into your app.With that said,fetching such large amounts of historical weather can be costly.So, we have also made it easy to receive weather datafrom our most data-intensive APIs.In this release, we are introducing support for FlatBuffersto make fetching weather data via WeatherKit faster than ever.FlatBuffers can yield up to 25% decrease in the payload sizecompared to an equivalent compressed JSON.It can also yield up to a 90% decrease in parse time compared to JSON.If you are using the Swift API, this optimization comes for free.While if you use the REST API, it is optional, and you can activate itby specifying an accept header.So fear not, you can fetch more data than ever,while minimizing the size of the payload.And that was WeatherKit.Let’s do a quick recap of what we've seen in this session.In addition to all the great features already offered,we're adding finer details to the current,hourly, and daily forecasts,details like cloud cover by altitude,richer precipitation data, humidity, and visibility.Introducing changes and historical comparisons queries,an all-new Statistics API,and bringing support for FlatBuffers.We're excited to see how you’ll innovate with these enhancements.If you have already used WeatherKit, think about enriching your forecastswith the additional data points provided by this release.Or, you can keep your users informed about significant weather changes.You also have a wealth of historical data at your fingertips,which you can use to give your users a broader perspective on today’s weather.If you are using the REST API,please consider taking advantage of the new FlatBuffer response.If you have never used WeatherKit, please consider watching"Meet WeatherKit" from WWDC22,then give it a try today.Thank you for watching.
