Framework

# UIKit

Construct and manage a graphical, event-driven user interface for your iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS app.

## Overview

UIKit provides a variety of features for building apps, including components you can use to construct the core infrastructure of your iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS apps. The framework provides the window and view architecture for implementing your UI, the event-handling infrastructure for delivering Multi-Touch and other types of input to your app, and the main run loop for managing interactions between the user, the system, and your app.

UIKit also includes support for animations, documents, drawing and printing, text management and display, search, app extensions, resource management, and getting information about the current device. You can also customize accessibility support, and localize your app’s interface for different languages, countries, or cultural regions.

UIKit works seamlessly with the SwiftUI framework, so you can implement parts of your UIKit app in SwiftUI or mix interface elements between the two frameworks. For example, you can place UIKit views and view controllers inside SwiftUI views, and vice versa.

To build a macOS app, you can use SwiftUI to create an app that works across all of Apple’s platforms, or use AppKit to create an app for Mac only. Alternatively, you can bring your UIKit iPad app to the Mac with Mac Catalyst.

# About App Development with UIKit

Learn about the basic support that UIKit and Xcode provide for your iOS and tvOS apps.

## Overview

The UIKit framework provides the core objects that you need to build apps for iOS and tvOS. You use these objects to display your content onscreen, to interact with that content, and to manage interactions with the system. Apps rely on UIKit for their basic behavior, and UIKit provides many ways for you to customize that behavior to match your specific needs.

Xcode provides template projects as starting points for every app you create. For example, the following image shows the structure of an app created using the single view app template in Xcode. The template projects provide a minimal user interface, so you can build and run your project immediately and see the results on a device or in the simulator.

When you build your app, Xcode compiles your source files and creates an app bundle for your project. An app bundle is a structured directory that contains the code and resources associated with the app. Resources include the image assets, storyboard files, strings files, and app metadata that support your code. The structure of the app bundle is important, but Xcode knows where your resources need to go, so don’t worry about it for now.

### Required Resources

Every UIKit app is required to have the following resources:

- App icons

- Launch screen storyboard

The system displays your app icon on the Home screen, in Settings, and anywhere it needs to differentiate your app from other apps. Because it is used in multiple places, and on multiple devices, you provide multiple versions of your app icon in your Xcode project’s AppIcon image asset. Your app icon should be distinctive to help the user identify your app quickly on the Home screen. However, you may vary the details of your icon to accommodate the different image sizes that you must provide.

The `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file contains your app’s initial user interface, and it can be a splash screen or a simplified version of your actual interface. When the user taps your app’s icon, the system displays your launch screen immediately, letting the user know that your app is now launching. The launch screen also provides cover for your app while it initializes itself. When your app is ready, the system hides the launch screen and reveals your app’s actual interface.

### Required App Metadata

The system derives information about your app’s configuration and capabilities from the information property list ( `Info.plist`) file in your app bundle. Xcode provides a preconfigured version of this file with every new project template, but you will likely need to modify this file at some point. For example, if your app relies on specific hardware, or uses specific system frameworks, you might need to add information related to those features to this file.

One common modification you can make to the `Info.plist` file is to declare your app’s hardware and software requirements. These requirements are how you communicate to the system what your app needs to run. For example, a navigation app might require the presence of GPS hardware to provide turn-by-turn directions. The App Store prevents an app from being installed on a device that does not meet your app’s requirements.

For information about the keys that you can include in your `Info.plist` file, see Information Property List Key Reference.

### Code Structure of a UIKit App

UIKit provides many of your app’s core objects, including those that interact with the system, run the app’s main event loop, and display your content onscreen. You use most of these objects as-is or with only minor modifications. Knowing which objects to modify, and when to modify them, is crucial to implementing your app.

The structure of UIKit apps is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, wherein objects are divided by their purpose. Model objects manage the app’s data and business logic. View objects provide the visual representation of your data. Controller objects act as a bridge between your model and view objects, moving data between them at appropriate times.

The following image represents a fairly typical structure of a UIKit app. You provide the model objects that represent your app’s data structures. UIKit provides most of the view objects, although you can define custom views for your data, as needed. Coordinating the exchange of data between your data objects and the UIKit views are your view controllers and app delegate object.

The UIKit and Foundation frameworks provide many of the basic types that you use to define your app’s model objects. UIKit provides a `UIDocument` object for organizing the data structures that belong in a disk-based file. The Foundation framework defines basic objects representing strings, numbers, arrays, and other data types. The Swift Standard Library provides many of the same types available in the Foundation framework.

UIKit provides most of the objects in the controller and view layers of your app. Specifically, UIKit defines the `UIView` class, which is usually responsible for displaying your content onscreen. (You can also render content directly to the screen using Metal and other system frameworks.) The `UIApplication` object runs your app’s main event loop and manages your app’s overall life cycle.

# Protecting the User’s Privacy

Secure personal data, and respect user preferences for how data is used.

## Overview

Designing for user privacy is important. Most Apple devices contain personal data that the user doesn’t want to expose to apps or to external entities. If your app accesses or uses data inappropriately, the user might stop using your app and even delete it from their device.

Access user or device data only with the user’s informed consent obtained in accordance with applicable law. In addition, take appropriate steps to protect user and device data, and be transparent about how you use it.

### Review Guidelines from Government and Industry Sources

Consult these documents:

- Mobile Privacy Disclosures: Building Trust Through Transparency. The Federal Trade Commission’s report on mobile privacy.

- Opinion 02/2013 on Apps on Smart Devices. The EU Data Protection Commissioners’ opinion on data protection for mobile apps.

- Privacy on the Go: Recommendations for the Mobile Ecosystem. The California State Attorney General’s recommendations for mobile privacy.

- Smartphone Privacy Initiative (2012) in English or Japanese and Smartphone Privacy Initiative II (2013) in English or Japanese. The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications’ Smartphone Privacy Initiatives.

### Request Access Only When Your App Needs the Data

Request access to sensitive user or device data—like location, contacts, and photos—at the time your app needs the data. Supply a purpose string (sometimes called a usage description string) in your app’s `Info.plist` file that the system can present to a user explaining why your app needs access. Provide reasonable fallback behavior in situations where the user doesn’t grant access to the requested data. For more details, see Requesting access to protected resources.

### Be Transparent About How Data Will Be Used

For example, when you submit your app to the App Store, specify a URL for your or statement as part of your App Store Connect metadata. You can also summarize that policy or statement in your app description.

### Give the User Control Over Data and Protect Data You Collect

Respect the user’s preferences, and take reasonable steps to protect the data that you collect in your apps:

- Provide settings that allow the user to disable access to sensitive information. The operating system does this automatically for protected system resources—like location, contacts, and health data—through the Privacy menu of the Settings app. Extend this behavior to any data you cache from these sources or collect directly. For example, if your users build a social media profile containing personal information, offer them a way to delete the data (including any server copies you have).

- When storing files in iOS, use the strongest data protection level that works for your app, as described in Encrypting Your App’s Files. Use App Transport Security when sending user or device data over the network, as described in NSAppTransportSecurity.

- If your app uses the `ASIdentifierManager` class, respect the value of its `isAdvertisingTrackingEnabled` property. If the user sets that property to false, then use the `ASIdentifierManager` class only for limited advertising purposes, like frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging. See the AdSupport framework for additional information.

- If you must identify users persistently, use the `identifierForVendor` property of the `UIDevice` class or the `advertisingIdentifier` property of the `ASIdentifierManager` class.

### Use the Minimum Amount of Data Required

Request and use the minimum amount of user or device data needed to accomplish a given task. Don’t seek access to or collect data for unnecessary or non-obvious reasons, or because you think it might be useful later.

If your app supports audio input, configure your audio session for recording only at the point where you actually plan to begin recording. Don’t configure your audio session for recording at launch time if you don’t plan to record right away. The system alerts users when apps configure their audio session for recording and gives the user the option to disable recording for your app.

# App and environment

Manage life-cycle events and your app’s UI scenes, and get information about traits and the environment in which your app runs.

## Overview

In iOS 13 and later, a person can create and manage multiple instances of your app’s user interface simultaneously, and switch between them using the app switcher. On iPad, a person can also display multiple instances of your app side by side. Each instance of your UI displays different content, or displays the same content in a different way. For example, a person can display one instance of the Calendar app showing a specific day, and another showing an entire month.

UIKit communicates details about the current environment using _trait collections_, which reflect a combination of device settings, interface settings, and user preferences. For example, you use traits to detect whether Dark Mode is active for the current view or view controller. Consult the current trait collection of your `UIView` or `UIViewController` object when you want to customize its contents based on the current environment. Adopt the `UITraitEnvironment` protocol in other objects when you want them to receive trait notification changes.

- Views and controls

API Collection

# Views and controls

Present your content onscreen and define the interactions allowed with that content.

## Overview

Views and controls are the visual building blocks of your app’s user interface. Use them to draw and organize your app’s content onscreen.

Views can host other views. Embedding one view inside another creates a containment relationship between the host view (known as the _superview_) and the embedded view (known as the _subview_). View hierarchies make it easier to manage views.

You can also use views to do any of the following:

- Respond to touches and other events (either directly or in coordination with gesture recognizers).

- Draw custom content using Core Graphics or UIKit classes.

- Support drag and drop interactions.

- Respond to focus changes.

- Animate the size, position, and appearance attributes of the view.

`UIView` is the root class for all views and defines their common behavior. `UIControl` defines additional behaviors that are specific to buttons, switches, and other views designed for user interactions.

For additional information about how to use views and controls, see Human Interface Guidelines. To see examples of UIKit controls, see UIKit Catalog: Creating and customizing views and controls.

# View controllers

Manage your interface using view controllers and facilitate navigation around your app’s content.

## Overview

You use view controllers to manage your UIKit app’s interface. A view controller manages a single root view, which may itself contain any number of subviews. User interactions with that view hierarchy are handled by your view controller, which coordinates with other objects of your app as needed. Every app has at least one view controller whose content fills the main window. If your app has more content than can fit onscreen at once, use multiple view controllers to manage different parts of that content.

A _container view controller_ embeds the content of other view controllers into its own root view. A container view controller may mix custom views with the contents of its child view controllers to facilitate navigation or to create unique interfaces. For example, a `UINavigationController` object manages a navigation bar and a stack of child view controllers (only one of which is visible at a time), and provides an API to add and remove child view controllers from the stack.

UIKit provides several standard view controllers for navigation and managing specific types of content. You define the view controllers containing your app’s custom content. You may also define custom container view controllers to implement new navigation schemes.

# View layout

Use stack views to lay out the views of your interface automatically. Use Auto Layout when you require precise placement of your views.

## Overview

When you design your app’s interface, you position views and other interface elements in your app’s windows and size them appropriately. However, the size and position of those views may need to change at runtime for a variety of reasons:

- The user can resize the window containing your views.

- Variations in the screen sizes of iOS devices (including differences between portrait and landscape orientations) require different layouts for each device and orientation.

- Apps on iPad must adapt to cover different amounts of screen space, ranging from a third of the screen to the entire screen.

- Language changes might require size changes for labels and other text-based views.

- Dynamic Type allows changes to the size of the text, which affects the size of the view.

`UIStackView` objects adjust the position of their contained views automatically when interface dimensions change. Alternatively, Auto Layout constraints let you specify the rules that determine the size and position of the views in your interface.

## Overview

Window objects act as containers for your app’s onscreen content, and screens report the characteristics of the underlying display to your app. Use Scenes to configure and manage your user interface, and review `UIScreen` objects to understand the device’s main screen or connected displays.

A `UIWindow` object provides no visible content of its own. All of the window’s visible content is provided by its root view controller, which you configure in your app’s storyboards. The window’s role is to receive events from UIKit and to forward any relevant events to the root view controller and associated views. UIKit provides an initial window for you to use, and you can create additional windows as needed.

## Overview

If you build your apps using standard UIKit views and controls, UIKit automatically handles touch events (including Multitouch events) for you. However, if you use custom views to display your content, you must handle all touch events that occur in your views. There are two ways to handle touch events yourself.

- Use gesture recognizers to track the touches; see Handling UIKit gestures.

# Drag and drop

Bring drag and drop to your app by using interaction APIs with your views.

## Overview

With drag and drop in iOS, users can drag items from one onscreen location to another using continuous gestures. A drag-and-drop activity can take place in a single app, or it can start in one app and end in another.

The app from which an item is dragged is the _source app_. The app on which an item is dropped is the _destination app_. For drag and drop in a single app, that app plays both roles simultaneously. The complete user action from start to finish — using system-mediated gestures — is a _drag activity_. A _drag session_, by contrast, is an object that’s managed by the system and that manages the items the user is dragging.

When dragging is in progress, the source and destination apps continue to run normally and support user interaction. A user can invoke the Dock,

### Essentials

Understanding a drag item as a promise

Use drag items to convey data representation promises between a source app and a destination app.

Making a view into a drag source

Adopt drag interaction APIs to provide items for dragging.

# Pointer interactions

Support pointer interactions in your custom controls and views.

## Overview

iPadOS 13.4 introduces dynamic pointer effects and behaviors that enhance the experience of using an external input device, like a trackpad or mouse, with iPad. As people use an input device, iPadOS automatically adapts the pointer to the current context, providing rich visual feedback and just the right level of precision needed to enhance productivity and simplify common tasks.

UIKit automatically handles pointer interactions if you’re using `UIButton`, `UIBarButtonItem`, or `UISegmentedControl`. If you use custom views to display your content, you must define pointer effects and styles yourself.

For more information, see Human Interface Guidelines.

### Specify custom pointer styles

To add a custom pointer style effect to a view:

1. Create a `UIPointerInteraction` instance.

2. Specify the pointer interaction’s delegate (an object that conforms to the `UIPointerInteractionDelegate` protocol).

3. Add the interaction to the view’s `interactions` property.

4. Add the `pointerInteraction(_:styleFor:)` delegate method.

5. Return `UIPointerStyle` from that delegate method.

This example uses a custom helper method, which you typically call within a view controller’s `viewDidLoad()` method:

func customPointerInteraction(on view: UIView, pointerInteractionDelegate: UIPointerInteractionDelegate) {
let pointerInteraction = UIPointerInteraction(delegate: pointerInteractionDelegate)
view.addInteraction(pointerInteraction)
}

The `pointerInteraction(_:styleFor:)` delegate method is called when the pointer enters the view’s region. The following example shows an interaction that applies a `UIPointerLiftEffect` effect by returning a `UIPointerStyle` object:

var pointerStyle: UIPointerStyle? = nil

if let interactionView = interaction.view {
let targetedPreview = UITargetedPreview(view: interactionView)
pointerStyle = UIPointerStyle(effect: UIPointerEffect.lift(targetedPreview))
}
return pointerStyle
}

### Add interaction animations

Including animations can be helpful in pointer interactions, especially when views contain elements that interfere with pointer effects. For example, hiding the separator bars in a `UISegmentedControl` when the pointer enters the control allows the active segment effect to appear visually uncluttered.

The following example performs a simple animation to change the alpha value of the view when the pointer enters and exits the region:

func pointerInteraction(_ interaction: UIPointerInteraction, willEnter region: UIPointerRegion, animator: UIPointerInteractionAnimating) {
if let interactionView = interaction.view {
animator.addAnimations {
interactionView.alpha = 0.5
}
}
}

func pointerInteraction(_ interaction: UIPointerInteraction, willExit region: UIPointerRegion, animator: UIPointerInteractionAnimating) {
if let interactionView = interaction.view {
animator.addAnimations {
interactionView.alpha = 1.0
}
}
}

### Distinguish pointing device input events

If you want to distinguish between pointing device touch events and touch events from other sources, like the user’s fingers or Apple Pencil, you can enable the `UIApplicationSupportsIndirectInputEvents` key in the `Info.plist` file. With this key enabled, your app can respond to specific gestures targeted at touches of `UITouch.TouchType.indirectPointer`.

For more information, see `UIApplicationSupportsIndirectInputEvents`.

# Accessibility for UIKit

Make your UIKit apps accessible to everyone who uses iOS and tvOS.

## Overview

Making your app accessible means making it usable by everyone. By designing your app with accessibility in mind, you make it possible for everyone to enjoy your app. For more information, see Accessibility.

UIKit controls and views come with built-in accessibility, providing an accessible user experience by default. Typically, you don’t need to do extra work to enable the standard accessibility features.

In some cases, you might want to modify the default values to better represent your app, to provide additional context, or to modify the user’s flow through the app. UIKit makes these customizations straightforward, involving a few lines of code or Interface Builder adjustments as you define your user interface. For more information about customizing accessibility for UIKit elements, see UIAccessibility.

If your app contains custom user interface elements that don’t inherit from `UIView` or one of the other UIKit classes with built-in accessibility, make those elements accessible by subclassing `UIAccessibilityElement`.

If you build your app with SwiftUI, see Accessibility modifiers.

# TextKit

Manage text storage and perform custom layout of text-based content in your app’s views.

## Overview

TextKit provides several classes to control the layout of text, such as `NSTextContentStorage`, `NSTextLayoutManager`, and `NSTextContainer`.

Additionally, TextKit uses `NSAttributedString` objects extensively. The `NSTextStorage` class is a subclass of `NSMutableAttributedString`, and many of the TextKit classes, for example, the classes listed in `Formatted content`, focus on creating complex `NSAttributedString` instances. Use these classes to specify your text’s format.

Most of the time, you can use TextKit to fine tune the formatting and layout of a `UITextView` by modifying the view’s `textContainer`, `layoutManager`, or `textStorage` properties. If you need more control, you can also use TextKit to build custom text controls.

Framework

# UIKit

Construct and manage a graphical, event-driven user interface for your iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS app.

## Overview

UIKit provides a variety of features for building apps, including components you can use to construct the core infrastructure of your iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS apps. The framework provides the window and view architecture for implementing your UI, the event-handling infrastructure for delivering Multi-Touch and other types of input to your app, and the main run loop for managing interactions between the user, the system, and your app.

UIKit also includes support for animations, documents, drawing and printing, text management and display, search, app extensions, resource management, and getting information about the current device. You can also customize accessibility support, and localize your app’s interface for different languages, countries, or cultural regions.

UIKit works seamlessly with the SwiftUI framework, so you can implement parts of your UIKit app in SwiftUI or mix interface elements between the two frameworks. For example, you can place UIKit views and view controllers inside SwiftUI views, and vice versa.

To build a macOS app, you can use SwiftUI to create an app that works across all of Apple’s platforms, or use AppKit to create an app for Mac only. Alternatively, you can bring your UIKit iPad app to the Mac with Mac Catalyst.

Customizing a document-based app’s launch experience

About App Development with UIKit

## Overview

Apps that make use of `UIDocument` and its underlying architecture get many benefits for their documents:

- Asynchronous reading and writing of data on a background queue, meaning your app’s responsiveness is unaffected while reading and writing operations take place

- Coordinated reading and writing of document files automatically integrated with cloud services

- Support for discovering conflicts between different versions of a document

- Safe-saving of document data by writing data first to a temporary file and then replacing the current document file with it

- Automatic saving of document data at opportune moments and support for dealing with suspend behaviors

In the Model-View-Controller design pattern, a `UIDocument` object is a model object or model-controller object — it manages the data of a document or the aggregate model objects that together constitute the document’s data. You typically pair it with a view controller that manages the view presenting the document’s contents. `UIDocument` provides no direct support for managing document views, but view controllers that subclass `UIDocumentViewController` can present a `UIDocument`, and view controllers that subclass `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` can organize and display `UIDocument` collections.

Document-based apps include those that can generate multiple documents, each with its own file-system location. A document-based app must create a subclass of `UIDocument` for its documents.

The primary attribute of a document in the `UIDocument` architecture is its file URL. When you initialize an instance of your document subclass by calling `init(fileURL:)`, you must pass a file URL locating the document file in the app sandbox. `UIDocument` determines the file type (the Uniform Type Identifier associated with the file extension) and the document name (the filename component) from the file URL. You can override the accessor methods of the `fileType` and `localizedName` properties to supply different values.

The following outlines the life cycle of a typical document:

1. You create a new document or open an existing document.

- To create a new document, allocate and initialize an instance of your subclass and then call `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` on the instance.

- To open an existing document (selected by the user), allocate and initialize an instance of your subclass and then call `open(completionHandler:)` on the instance.
2. The user edits the document. As the user edits, track changes to the document. `UIDocument` periodically notes when there are unsaved changes and writes the document data to its file.

3. The user requests that the document be integrated with cloud services (optional). You must enable the document for cloud storage. You must also resolve any conflicts between different versions of the same document.

4. The user closes the document. Call `close(completionHandler:)` on the document instance. `UIDocument` saves the document if there are any unsaved changes.

A typical document-based app calls `open(completionHandler:)`, `close(completionHandler:)`, and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` on the main thread. When the read or save operation kicked off by these methods concludes, the system executes the completion-handler block on the same dispatch queue as the system used to invoke the method, allowing you to complete any tasks contingent on the read or save operation. If the operation isn’t successful, the system passes `false` to the completion-handler block.

### Implement the NSFilePresenter protocol

The `UIDocument` class adopts the `NSFilePresenter` protocol. When another client attempts to read the document of a `UIDocument`-based app, the system suspends reading until the system provides the `UIDocument` object an opportunity to save any changes made to the document.

Although some implementations do nothing, `UIDocument` implements all `NSFilePresenter` methods. Specifically, `UIDocument`:

- Implements `relinquishPresentedItem(toReader:)` to forward the incoming block to `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)`

- Implements `relinquishPresentedItem(toWriter:)` to check if the file-modification date changed; if the file is newer than before, it calls `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)` with the value of the `fileURL` as the URL parameter

- Implements `presentedItemDidMove(to:)` to update the document’s file URL ( `fileURL`)

In your `UIDocument` subclass, if you override a `NSFilePresenter` method, you can always invoke the superclass implementation ( `super`).

### Create a subclass

Each document-based app must create a subclass of `UIDocument` whose instances represent its documents. The subclassing requirements for most apps are simple:

- For writing operations, implement the `contents(forType:)` method to provide a snapshot of document data. The data must be in the form of an `NSData` object (for flat files) or an `FileWrapper` object (for file packages). Writing operations are usually initiated through the autosave feature.

- For reading operations, implement the `load(fromContents:ofType:)` method to receive an `NSData` or `FileWrapper` object and initialize the app’s data structures with it.

- Implement change tracking to enable the autosaving feature. See Track changes for details.

- When cloud services are enabled for a document, resolve conflicts between different versions of a document. See Resolve conflicts and handle errors for details.

The system typically calls the `contents(forType:)` and `load(fromContents:ofType:)` methods on the main queue. More specifically:

- The system calls the `contents(forType:)` method on the queue that the system called the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method on; writing of data takes place on a background thread.

- The system calls the `load(fromContents:ofType:)` method on the queue that the system called the `open(completionHandler:)` method on.

If you have special requirements for reading and writing document data for which the `contents(forType:)` and `load(fromContents:ofType:)` methods won’t suffice, you can override other methods of the `UIDocument` class. See Override input and output methods for a discussion of these requirements and methods.

#### Track changes

To enable the autosaving feature of `UIDocument`, you must notify it when users make changes to a document. `UIDocument` periodically checks whether the `hasUnsavedChanges` method returns `true`; if it does, it initiates the save operation for the document.

There are two primary ways to implement change tracking in your `UIDocument` subclass:

- Call the methods of the `UndoManager` class to implement undo and redo for the document. You can access the default `UndoManager` object from the `undoManager` property. This is the preferred approach, especially for existing apps that already support undo and redo.

- Call the `updateChangeCount(_:)` method at the appropriate junctures in your code.

#### Resolve conflicts and handle errors

A `UIDocument` object has a specific state at any moment in its life cycle. You can check the current state by querying the `documentState` property, and get notified about changes by observing the `stateChangedNotification` notification.

If the owner enables a document for iCloud, it’s important to check for conflicting versions and to attempt to resolve conflicts. Listen for the `stateChangedNotification` notification and then checking if the document state is `inConflict`. This state indicates that there are conflicting versions of the document, which you can access by calling the `NSFileVersion` class method `unresolvedConflictVersionsOfItem(at:)`, passing in the document’s file URL. If you can resolve a conflict correctly without user interaction, do so. Otherwise, discretely notify the user that a conflict exists and let them choose how to resolve it. Possible approaches include:

- Display the conflicting versions, from which a user can pick one or both versions to keep.

- Display a merged version and giving the user an option to pick it.

- Display the file modification dates and giving the user the option to choose one or both.

Document state, in addition to indicating an inter-file conflict, can indicate errors. For example, `closed` indicates an error in reading, and `savingError` indicates an error in saving or reverting a document. The system notifies your app of reading and writing errors through the `success` parameter passed into the completion handlers of the `open(completionHandler:)`, `close(completionHandler:)`, `revert(toContentsOf:completionHandler:)`, and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` methods.

You can handle errors by calling or implementing the `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)` method; the default implementations of the `open(completionHandler:)` and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` methods call `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)` when a `UIDocument` object encounters a reading or writing error, respectively. You can handle read, save, and reversion errors by informing the user and, if the situation permits, trying to recover from the error.

Be sure to read the description for the `contents(forType:)` method for its guidance on handling errors encountered during document saving.

#### Override input and output methods

If you app has special requirements for reading or writing document data, it can override methods of `UIDocument` other than `load(fromContents:ofType:)` and `contents(forType:)`. These requirements often include the following:

- Incremental reading and writing of large data files

Override the `read(from:)` and `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)` methods, respectively.

- Custom representations of document data (that is, not an `NSData` or `FileWrapper` object)

Override the `read(from:)` method when reading document data and the `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)` method when writing document data.

- Performing actions before or after reading or writing data

Override `open(completionHandler:)` and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`.

- A custom approach to safe-saving

Override the `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)` method.

- Changing the file type of a document before it’s saved

Override the `savingFileType` method to return a file type other than the default ( `fileType`). An example of this is an RTF document which, after a user adds an image to it, should be saved as an RTFD document.

If you override these methods, be aware that all reading and writing of document data must be done on a background queue and must be coordinated with other attempts to read from and write to the same document file. Because of this, you usually call the superclass implementation ( `super`) as part of your override, and if you call other `UIDocument` methods, you usually invoke them in the block passed into a call of the `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` method. Read the method descriptions for details.

#### Access document attributes

If you override any of the document-attribute properties (listed under Accessing document attributes) by overriding the related accessor methods, be aware that the UIKit framework can call these accessor methods on a background thread. Thus your overriding implementation must be thread safe.

### Rename documents

`UIDocument` provides support for changing the document’s title. Security considerations require that clients can’t programmatically rename a file on the file system, and that the system confirms that a person intends to rename their file. To satisfy these restrictions, the system, instead of your app, presents a renaming user interface using a process outside your app. The external process renames the underlying file and reports the new location and handles the rename request internally when a person invokes renaming from the title menu. If you’re using `UIDocumentViewController`, it automatically configures renaming for you. Otherwise, you manually assign the document as the navigation item’s `renameDelegate`.

init(document: MyDocument) {
self.document = document
super.init(nibName:nil, bundle: nil)
self.navigationItem.renameDelegate = document
}

The Rename action appears in the title menu as one of the system-suggested actions. When a person taps the Rename action, the system shows an inline text field for changing the navigation item’s `title`. Upon renaming the item, the system changes the file name in storage as though the person renamed the file in another application.

Prior to iOS 17, to enable the system rename user interface, a client view controller adopts the `UINavigationItemRenameDelegate` protocol and assigns itself as the navigation item’s `renameDelegate`. It’s the client’s responsibility to implement callbacks such as `navigationItem(_:didEndRenamingWith:)` (Swift) or `navigationItem:didEndRenamingWithTitle:` (Objective-C) to explicitly move the file in storage.

class EditorViewController: UIViewController,
UINavigationItemRenameDelegate {

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()
navigationItem.renameDelegate = self
}

func navigationItem(_ navigationItem: UINavigationItem, didEndRenamingWith: title: String) {
// Move the file, update the model, and so on.
}
}

# UIManagedDocument

A managed document object that integrates with Core Data.

@MainActor
class UIManagedDocument

## Overview

`UIManagedDocument` is a concrete subclass of `UIDocument`. When you initialize a managed document, you specify the URL for the document location. The document object then creates a Core Data stack to use to access the document’s persistent store using a managed object model from the app’s main bundle. `UIManagedDocument` performs all the basic setup you need for Core Data, and in some cases you may use instances of the class directly (without a need to subclass). You can supply configuration options for the creation of the coordinator using `persistentStoreOptions`, and for the model using `modelConfiguration`. You can also perform additional customization by creating a subclass of `UIManagedDocument`:

- Override `persistentStoreName` to customize the name of the persistent store file inside the document’s file package.

- Override `managedObjectModel` to customize creation of the managed object model.

You do this if, for example, your app supports multiple document types, each of which uses a different model. You want to ensure that the models aren’t merged for each document class.

- Override `persistentStoreType(forFileType:)` to customize the type of persistent store used by a document.

- Override `configurePersistentStoreCoordinator(for:ofType:modelConfiguration:storeOptions:)` to customize the loading or creation of a persistent store.

### Handling errors

To enable your app to observe and handle errors in saving and validating a managed document, you must subclass the `UIManagedDocument` class and override one or both of the following two inherited methods from the `UIDocument` class:

- `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)`

- `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)`

Overriding is required because otherwise, the only information your app receives on error is the `stateChangedNotification` notification, which doesn’t contain a `userInfo` dictionary and so doesn’t convey specific error information.

# Synchronizing documents in the iCloud environment

Manage documents across multiple devices to create a seamless editing and collaboration experience.

Download

Xcode 12.4+

## Overview

As technology advances, more and more people generate their digital assets from different devices, and expect those assets to synchronize seamlessly. To support such use cases, apps need to discover the assets, as well as their changes, from all the devices, and present the user with a consistent view.

This sample demonstrates how to discover and synchronize documents in the iCloud environment, and manage them to achieve high performance and a low memory footprint. These _documents_ can be the digital assets or any user data.

The sample also demonstrates how to publish an iCloud container to iCloud Drive so that the user can access the container’s `Documents` folder from other apps. Additionally, it shows how to support the Open-in-Place feature, which allows the user to launch an app by tapping a document in Files, and then edit it directly.

### Configure the sample code project

Before building the sample, perform the following steps in Xcode:

1. In the General pane of the `SimpleiCloudDocument` target, update the Bundle Identifier field with a new identifier.

2. In the Signing & Capabilities pane, select the applicable team from the Team drop-down menu to let Xcode automatically manage the provisioning profile. See Assign a project to a team for details.

4. If you prefer to use a different container, select it from the Containers list, specify the container identifier when creating the `MetadataProvider` instance in the `viewDidLoad` method of the `MainViewController` class. An iCloud container identifier is case-sensitive and must begin with “ `iCloud.`”.

5. Find the `NSUbiquitousContainers` entry in the `Info.plist` file, and change the iCloud container identifier there as well.

Before running the sample on a device, configure the device as follows:

1. Log in with an Apple ID. For documents to synchronize across devices, the Apple ID must be the same on all devices.

3. Prepare some pictures in the Photo Library to use in the sample.

### Publish an iCloud container to iCloud Drive

Publishing an iCloud container to iCloud Drive makes the container’s `Documents` folder appear in iCloud Drive so the user can access the folder from other apps. Follow these steps to publish a container:

1. Provide the container’s metadata by adding an `NSUbiquitousContainers` entry to the `Info.plist` file like the example code below demonstrates.

2. Increase the bundle version by changing the Build field in the General pane of the Xcode target, or the `CFBundleVersion` entry in the `Info.plist` file. The new value must be larger than the previous value when using the `compare(_:options:range:)` method with the `NSString.CompareOptions.numeric` option to compare, and must only contain numeric (0 – 9) and period (.) characters. The system only updates an app’s iCloud container metadata when detecting a new version, so perform this step every time the metadata changes.

3. Make sure the `Documents` folder exists in the iCloud container and has at least one document.

The `NSUbiquitousContainers` entry of the sample is as follows:

### Support Open-in-Place

The Open-in-Place feature allows the user to launch an app by tapping a document of the type the app owns. After opening it, the app can change the document directly without copying it to the app’s sandbox container. Follow these steps to implement the feature:

1. Declare and export a document type for the app by adding the `CFBundleDocumentTypes` and `UTExportedTypeDeclarations` `Info.plist` entries. Make sure the type conforms to at least `public.content` and `public.data` in the `UTTypeConformsTo` entry so that the other system components, like `UIActivityViewController`, recognize it.

2. Add the `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` key to the `Info.plist` file, and set the value to `YES`.

3. Implement the `scene(_:openURLContexts:)` method of the `UISceneDelegate` protocol to accept the document.

Apps need to wrap the code that accesses the passed-in URL with the `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource` and `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource` methods if the URL is outside of their sandbox. This sample doesn’t explicitly do that because it accesses the URL via `UIDocument`, which handles security-scoped bookmarks automatically.

### Discover documents in an iCloud container

iOS apps use `NSMetadataQuery` rather than file system APIs to discover documents in an iCloud container. When an app creates an iCloud document on one device, iCloud first synchronizes the document metadata to the other devices to tell them about the existence of the document. Then, depending on the device types, iCloud may or may not continue to synchronize the document data. For iOS devices, iCloud doesn’t synchronize the document data until an app asks (either explicitly or implicitly). When an iOS app receives a notification that a new document exists, the document data may not physically exist on the local file system, so it isn’t discoverable with file system APIs.

To watch the metadata changes in the iCloud container, the sample creates an `NSMetadataQuery` object. It uses the following code to configure and start the query to gather the changes of documents that are in the iCloud container and have an `.sicd` extension name.

metadataQuery.notificationBatchingInterval = 1
metadataQuery.searchScopes = [NSMetadataQueryUbiquitousDataScope, NSMetadataQueryUbiquitousDocumentsScope]
metadataQuery.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "%K LIKE %@", NSMetadataItemFSNameKey, "*." + Document.extensionName)
metadataQuery.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: NSMetadataItemFSNameKey, ascending: true)]
metadataQuery.start()

A query has two phases when gathering the metadata: the initial phase that collects all currently matching results, and a second phase that gathers live updates. It posts an `NSMetadataQueryDidFinishGathering` notification when it finishes the first phase, and an `NSMetadataQueryDidUpdate` notification each time an update occurs. To avoid potential conflicts with the system, disable the query update when accessing the results, and enable it after finishing the access, as the following example shows:

var result = MetadataItem
metadataQuery.disableUpdates()
if let metadatItems = metadataQuery.results as? [NSMetadataItem] {
result = metadataItemList(from: metadatItems)
}
metadataQuery.enableUpdates()
return result
}

### Manage a large data set

Documents in this sample could potentially contain many images, and the images might be large. To load image data only when necessary, and release the data immediately after using it, the `Document` class provides public methods for directly accessing the images in the document package. As an example, the following method retrieves a full image asynchronously:

performAsynchronousFileAccess {
let imageFileURL = self.fileURL.appendingPathComponent(imageName)
let fileCoordinator = NSFileCoordinator(filePresenter: self)
fileCoordinator.coordinate(readingItemAt: imageFileURL, options: .withoutChanges, error: nil) { newURL in
if let imageData = try? Data(contentsOf: newURL), let image = UIImage(data: imageData) {
completionHandler(image)
} else {
completionHandler(nil)
}
}
}
}

When directly manipulating the files in the document package, the sample calls the `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` method to serialize the file access in the background queue, and uses `NSFileCoordinator` to coordinate the reading or writing.

Likewise, to avoid the default implementation that loads image data to `FileWrapper` objects and keeps it in memory, the sample overrides the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method to directly remove or add image files when updating a document.

if saveOperation != .forCreating {
print("\(#function)")
return performAsynchronousFileAccess {
let fileCoordinator = NSFileCoordinator(filePresenter: self)
fileCoordinator.coordinate(writingItemAt: self.fileURL, options: .forMerging, error: nil) { newURL in
let success = self.fulfillUnsavedChanges()
self.fileModificationDate = Date()
if let completionHandler = completionHandler {
DispatchQueue.main.async {
completionHandler(success)
}
}
}
}
}
super.save(to: url, for: saveOperation, completionHandler: completionHandler)
}

### Resolve version conflicts

In the iCloud environment, the user can edit a document from different devices. Depending on networking conditions and the timing of synchronization, that may trigger version conflicts. Apps that provide support for iCloud documents need to resolve these conflicts, and remove the obsolete versions so they don’t consume the user’s iCloud storage.

To create a document conflict with the sample:

1. Run the sample on two iOS devices with Internet connections that use the same Apple ID to log in to iCloud.

2. Create a document with several images on one device, and watch the document synchronize with the other device.

3. Turn on Airplane mode on both devices to disconnect them from the Internet.

4. Change the document on both devices by adding some images on one device, removing some images from the other device, and then saving the changes.

5. Turn off Airplane mode on both devices at the same time to connect them notification, which apps can observe and then implement their conflict resolution strategy.

The sample resolves a conflict by selecting the version that has the most recent `modificationDate` and removing all others. It uses file coordination to assess the version information of an iCloud document to avoid potential conflicts with the system.

DispatchQueue.global().async {
NSFileCoordinator().coordinate(writingItemAt: document.fileURL,
options: .contentIndependentMetadataOnly, error: nil) { newURL in
let shouldRevert = self.pickLatestVersion(for: newURL)
completionHandler?(shouldRevert)
}
}
}

Class

# UIDocumentViewController

A view controller that manages and presents a document stored locally or in the cloud.

@MainActor
class UIDocumentViewController

## Mentioned in

Customizing a document-based app’s launch experience

## Overview

`UIDocumentViewController` presents a view that displays a `document`. It manages opening, saving, and closing the document. You can use `UIDocumentViewController` to present documents from a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`, for instance. When you aren’t presenting documents from a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController`, `UIDocumentViewController` displays a button that, when tapped, presents a picker a person can use to choose the document to display.

The document view controller’s `document` property is an optional `UIDocument`. While the `document` property value is `nil`, the document view controller displays a view depicting an empty state with the message, “No Document”. The empty state provides a prompt that reads “Select a document by tapping the ‘Documents’ button at the top.”

When the `document` property value is not `nil`, the document view controller displays the document. You configure the `view` to display the document in the `documentDidOpen()` callback method.

The navigation item automatically assigns its title menu, its `UIDocumentProperties` object, undo and redo buttons, and `renameDelegate` from information in the document view controller’s `document`.

`UIDocumentViewController` also provides sharing and drag and drop support, and key-commands for common actions such as undo and redo.

### Subclassing notes

`UIDocumentViewController` is an abstract base class that is meant to be subclassed. To create a subclass, you override two methods.

1. The system calls `documentDidOpen()` when someone opens the document associated with the document view controller, or when an object assigns a previously opened document to the document view controller.

2. The system calls `navigationItemDidUpdate()` every time `UIDocumentViewController` makes changes to its navigation item.

#### Open and close documents

When the document view controller opens the document associated with it, or when an object assigns an already opened document to the document view controller, the system calls `documentDidOpen()`. You can populate the view controller’s views to display the content of the document in this method:

override func documentDidOpen() {
configureViewForCurrentDocument()
}

It’s good practice to configure the view in its own method and call that method in both `documentDidOpen()` and `viewDidLoad()`. There is no guarantee of the timing between when the system calls `documentDidOpen()` and when the system loads the view controller’s view, so check that the view loaded and the document opened before configuring your views.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()
configureViewForCurrentDocument()
}

func configureViewForCurrentDocument() {
guard let document = markdownDocument,
!document.documentState.contains(.closed)
&& isViewLoaded else { return }
// Configure views for document
}

#### Customize navigation items

While `UIDocumentViewController` automatically sets the document title and other navigation items using information from the document, you can customize these items by overriding the `navigationItemDidUpdate()` method. The system calls `navigationItemDidUpdate()` every time `UIDocumentViewController` makes changes to the navigation item.

override func navigationItemDidUpdate() {
// Customize the navigation item.
}

#### Add sharing, drag and drop, and undo and redo

`UIDocumentViewController` automatically includes drag and drop, undo and redo, and sharing support. If you want undo and redo buttons to appear in your `UIDocumentViewController`, add a `undoRedoItemGroup` to the navigation bar and ensure that your custom `UIDocument` implements an undo manager. `UIDocumentViewController` sets the `hidden` property of this group, depending on the availability of an undo manager. It automatically enables or disables the buttons inside the group, as necessary.

#### Open a document from outside the class

`UIDocumentViewController` automatically opens and closes its document. However, if you need to access a document from outside the document view controller, you can create a new instance of `UIDocumentViewController` and call its `openDocument(completionHandler:)` method.

In this sample code, a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` presents a document using a `UIDocumentViewController`.

// Open a document.

class BrowserViewController: UIDocumentBrowserViewController {

func presentDocument(_ document: MarkdownDocument) {
let documentController = UIDocumentViewController(document: document)
documentController.openDocument { success in
if success {
self.present(documentController, animated: true)
}
}
}

}

`UIDocumentViewController` makes all the necessary callbacks, such as calling `documentDidOpen()` and, when the document is open, it calls the completion handler you provided.

#### Use the class as a root view controller

`To use a UIDocumentViewController` as the root view controller in an app, you need to declare the key “UIDocumentClass” for the relevant file type in your app’s info.plist. Set the document class to the `UIDocument` subclass you are using in your app.

If there is no browser view controller in the hierarchy, `UIDocumentViewController` displays a document button that opens a document picker in the navigation bar.

Protocol

# UIDataSourceModelAssociation

A set of methods that defines an interface for providing persistent references to data objects in your app.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
protocol UIDataSourceModelAssociation

## Overview

Your data source objects can adopt this protocol to assist a corresponding table or collection view during the state restoration process. Those classes use the methods of this protocol to ensure that the same data objects (and not just the same row indexes) are scrolled into view and selected.

Before you can implement this protocol, your app must be able to identify data objects consistently between app launches. This requires being able to take some identifying marker of the object and convert that marker into a string that can then be saved with the rest of the app state. For example, a Core Data app could convert a managed object’s ID into a URI that it could then convert into a string.

Currently, only the `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` classes support this protocol. You’d implement this protocol in any objects you use as the data source for those classes. If you don’t adopt the protocol in your data source, the views don’t attempt to restore the selected and visible rows.

## Topics

### Locating the data

Returns the string that uniquely identifies the data at the specified location in the view.

**Required**

Returns the current index of the data object with the specified identifier.

### Add a paste button to a text view

The following code displays a paste button and assigns a text view as the recipient of pasteboard contents:

let textView = UITextView(frame: view.bounds)
view.addSubview(textView)

let configuration = UIPasteControl.Configuration()
configuration.baseBackgroundColor = .red
configuration.baseForegroundColor = .magenta
configuration.cornerStyle = .capsule
configuration.displayMode = .iconAndLabel

let pasteButton = UIPasteControl(configuration: configuration)
pasteButton.frame = CGRect(x: view.bounds.width/2.0, y: view.bounds.height/2.0, width: 150, height: 60)
textView.addSubview(pasteButton)

Class

# UIPasteboard

An object that helps a user share data from one place to another within your app, and from your app to other apps.

class UIPasteboard

## Overview

For sharing data with any other app, use the systemwide general pasteboard. For sharing data with another app from your team — that has the same team ID as the app to share from — configure an App Group. For more information about configuring an App Group, see Configuring app groups.

In typical usage, an object in your app writes data to a pasteboard when the user requests a copy, cut, or duplicate operation on a selection in the user interface. Another object in the same or different app then reads that data from the pasteboard and presents it to the user at a new location. This usually happens when the user requests a paste operation.

### The general pasteboard and named pasteboards

The system identifies the systemwide general pasteboard with the `general` pasteboard name, and you can use it for any type of data. Obtain the general pasteboard from the `general` shared system pasteboard object.

You can create named pasteboards with the class methods `init(name:create:)` and `withUniqueName()` for sharing data within your app, and from your app to other apps that have the same Team ID.

### Using pasteboards

The `UIPasteboard` class provides methods for reading and writing individual pasteboard items, as well as methods for reading and writing multiple pasteboard items at once. For more information, see Getting and setting pasteboard items in the topic groups below. The data to write to a pasteboard can be in one of the following forms:

- If the data is an object that conforms to `NSItemProviderWriting`, use `setItemProviders(_:localOnly:expirationDate:)` to write it to the pasteboard.

- If you can represent the data with a common object — such as `NSString`, `NSArray`, `NSDictionary`, `NSDate`, `NSNumber`, `UIImage`, or `NSURL` — you can write it to the pasteboard as a value using a method such as `setValue(_:forPasteboardType:)`.

- If the data is binary, use the `setData(_:forPasteboardType:)` method to write it to the pasteboard.

The `UIPasteboard` class provides convenience methods for writing and reading strings, images, URLs, and colors to and from single or multiple pasteboard items. See Getting and setting pasteboard items of standard data types in the topic groups below.

`UIPasteboard` provides properties for directly checking whether specific data types are present on a pasteboard, see Checking for data types on a pasteboard in the topic groups below. Use these properties, rather than attempting to read pasteboard data, to avoid causing the system to needlessly attempt to fetch data before necessary, or when the data might not be present. For example, use the `hasStrings` property to determine whether to present a string-data paste option in the user interface, using code like the following:

if UIPasteboard.general.hasStrings {
// Enable string-related control...
}

Use the following properties to avoid user notifications and alerts when the system doesn’t establish user intent:

- `numberOfItems`

- `types`, `types(forItemSet:)`

- `itemSet(withPasteboardTypes:)`

- `hasColors`, `hasImages`, `hasStrings`, `hasURLs`

- `canLoadObject(ofClass:)`, `canLoadObject(ofClass:)`

- any of the pattern-detection methods in the Detecting patterns of content in pasteboard items group in the topic groups below

The system notifies the user when you access properties or call methods that pull data from the pasteboard if the system doesn’t determine that the user intends to access that data.

### Pasteboard items and representation types

When you write an object to a pasteboard, the pasteboard stores it as a _pasteboard item_. A pasteboard item consists of one or more key-value pairs in which the key identifies the representation type (sometimes called a _pasteboard type_) of the value.

A uniform type identifier frequently functions as the key for a representation type. For example, you can use the `UTTypeJPEG` uniform type identifier (a constant for `public.jpeg`) as a representation type key for JPEG data.

For a discussion of uniform type identifiers, and a list of common ones, see Uniform Type Identifiers.

Your app can use any string to name a representation type; however, for app-specific data types, it’s best practice to use reverse-DNS notation to ensure the uniqueness of the type (for example, `com.myCompany.myApp.myType`).

You can provide flexibility for data sharing by providing multiple representation types for a pasteboard item during a copy or cut operation. Various contexts within your app or other apps can then make use of an appropriate representation type. For example, when a user copies an image, your app can write multiple representation types, such as in the PNG, JPEG, and GIF data formats, to a pasteboard. If the original image is in PNG format, but the receiving app can handle only GIF images, it can still use the pasteboard data.

For more about representation types, read the discussion for the `types` instance method.

### Sharing pasteboards between devices

When a user signs into iCloud, the general pasteboard automatically transfers its contents to nearby devices that use the same iCloud account. You can control Handoff behavior when writing contents to the general pasteboard, and can set an expiration for items, using the `setItemProviders(_:localOnly:expirationDate:)`, `setObjects(_:localOnly:expirationDate:)`, or `setItems(_:options:)` methods, as follows:

- To exclude a pasteboard from Handoff, specify `false` for the `localOnly` parameter, or call the `setItems(_:options:)` method with the `localOnly` option.

- To indicate an expiration time and date for copied data, provide the `expirationDate` parameter, or call the `setItems(_:options:)` method with the `expirationDate` option. At the time and date that you set, the system removes the pasteboard items from the pasteboard.

### Using pasteboards with other objects

Although the `UIPasteboard` class is central to copy, paste, and duplicate operations, you can employ protocols and instances of other UIKit classes in these operations as well, such as the following:

- `UIEditMenuInteraction` — Displays a menu with edit actions, such as Copy, Cut, Paste, Select, and Select All, above or below the selection.

- `UIActivityItemsConfigurationReading` — Objects implement this protocol to indicate that they support copying and sharing data.

- `UIPasteConfigurationSupporting` — Objects implement this protocol to indicate whether they support pasting with a specific `UIPasteConfiguration`.

- `UIResponder` — Responders implement `canPerformAction(_:withSender:)` to enable or disable commands in the above-mentioned menu based on the current context.

- `UIResponderStandardEditActions` — Responders implement methods that this informal protocol declares to handle the chosen menu commands (for example, `copy:` and `paste:`).

A typical app that implements copy, paste, and duplicate operations also manages and presents related selections in its user interface. In addition, your app needs to coordinate changes in pasteboard content with changes to its data model, as appropriate for your app.

Making a view into a drag source

## Overview

Views are the fundamental building blocks of your app’s user interface, and the `UIView` class defines the behaviors that are common to all views. A view object renders content within its bounds rectangle, and handles any interactions with that content. The `UIView` class is a concrete class that you can instantiate and use to display a fixed background color. You can also subclass it to draw more sophisticated content. To display labels, images, buttons, and other interface elements commonly found in apps, use the view subclasses that the UIKit framework provides rather than trying to define your own.

Because view objects are the main way your application interacts with the user, they have a number of responsibilities. Here are just a few:

- Drawing and animation

- Views draw content in their rectangular area using UIKit or Core Graphics.

- You can animate some view properties to new values.
- Layout and subview management

- Views may contain zero or more subviews.

- Views can adjust the size and position of their subviews.

- Use Auto Layout to define the rules for resizing and repositioning your views in response to changes in the view hierarchy.
- Event handling

- A view is a subclass of `UIResponder` and can respond to touches and other types of events.

- Views can install gesture recognizers to handle common gestures.

Views can nest inside other views to create view hierarchies, which offer a convenient way to organize related content. Nesting a view creates a parent-child relationship between the nested child view (known as the _subview_) and the parent (known as the _superview_). A parent view may contain any number of subviews, but each subview has only one superview. By default, when a subview’s visible area extends outside of the bounds of its superview, no clipping of the subview’s content occurs. Use the `clipsToBounds` property to change that behavior.

The `frame` and `bounds` properties define the geometry of each view. The `frame` property defines the origin and dimensions of the view in the coordinate system of its superview. The `bounds` property defines the internal dimensions of the view as it sees them, and its use is almost exclusive to custom drawing code. The center property provides a convenient way to reposition a view without changing its `frame` or `bounds` properties directly.

For detailed information about how to use the `UIView` class, see View Programming Guide for iOS.

### Create a view

Normally, you create views in your storyboards by dragging them from the library to your canvas. You can also create views programmatically. When creating a view, you typically specify its initial size and position relative to its future superview. For example, the following example creates a view and places its top-left corner at the point (10, 10) in the superview’s coordinate system (once it is added to that superview).

let rect = CGRect(x: 10, y: 10, width: 100, height: 100)
let myView = UIView(frame: rect)

CGRect viewRect = CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 100);
UIView* myView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:viewRect];

To add a subview to another view, call the `addSubview(_:)` method on the superview. You may add any number of subviews to a view, and sibling views may overlap each other without any issues in iOS. Each call to the `addSubview(_:)` method places the new view on top of all other siblings. You can specify the relative z-order of subview by adding it using the `insertSubview(_:aboveSubview:)` and `insertSubview(_:belowSubview:)` methods. You can also exchange the position of already added subviews using the `exchangeSubview(at:withSubviewAt:)` method.

After creating a view, create Auto Layout rules to govern how the size and position of the view change in response to changes in the rest of the view hierarchy. For more information, see Auto Layout Guide.

### Draw views

View drawing occurs on an as-needed basis. When a view is first shown, or when all or part of it becomes visible due to layout changes, the system asks the view to draw its contents. For views that contain custom content using UIKit or Core Graphics, the system calls the view’s `draw(_:)` method. Your implementation of this method is responsible for drawing the view’s content into the current graphics context, which is set up by the system automatically prior to calling this method. This creates a static visual representation of your view’s content that can then be displayed on the screen.

When the actual content of your view changes, it’s your responsibility to notify the system that your view needs to be redrawn. You do this by calling your view’s `setNeedsDisplay()` or `setNeedsDisplay(_:)` method of the view. These methods let the system know that it should update the view during the next drawing cycle. Because it waits until the next drawing cycle to update the view, you can call these methods on multiple views to update them at the same time.

For detailed information about the view drawing cycle and the role your views have in this cycle, see View Programming Guide for iOS.

### Animate views

Changes to several view properties can be animated — that is, changing the property creates an animation starting at the current value and ending at the new value that you specify. The following properties of the `UIView` class are animatable:

- `frame`

- `bounds`

- `center`

- `transform`

- `alpha`

- `backgroundColor`

To animate your changes, create a `UIViewPropertyAnimator` object and use its handler block to change the values of your view’s properties. The `UIViewPropertyAnimator` class lets you specify the duration and timing of your animations, but it performs the actual animations. You can pause a property-based animator that’s currently running to interrupt the animation and drive it interactively. For more information, see `UIViewPropertyAnimator`.

### Threading considerations

Manipulations to your app’s user interface must occur on the main thread. Thus, you should always call the methods of the `UIView` class from code running in the main thread of your app. The only time this may not be strictly necessary is when creating the view object itself, but all other manipulations should occur on the main thread.

### Subclassing notes

The `UIView` class is a key subclassing point for visual content that also requires user interactions. Although there are many good reasons to subclass `UIView`, it is recommended that you do so only when the basic `UIView` class or the standard system views do not provide the capabilities that you need. Subclassing requires more work on your part to implement the view and to tune its performance.

For information about ways to avoid subclassing, see Alternatives to subclassing.

#### Methods to override

When subclassing `UIView`, there are only a handful of methods you should override and many methods that you might override depending on your needs. Because `UIView` is a highly configurable class, there are also many ways to implement sophisticated view behaviors without overriding custom methods, which are discussed in the Alternatives to Subclassing section. In the meantime, the following list includes the methods you might consider overriding in your `UIView` subclasses:

- Initialization:

- `init(frame:)` \- It is recommended that you implement this method. You can also implement custom initialization methods in addition to, or instead of, this method.

- doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/oslog/oslogentry/init(coder:) - Implement this method if you load your view from storyboards or nib files and your view requires custom initialization.

- `layerClass` Use this property only if you want your view to use a different Core Animation layer for its backing store. For example, if your view uses tiling to display a large scrollable area, you might want to set the property to the `CATiledLayer` class.

- Drawing and printing:

- `draw(_:)` \- Implement this method if your view draws custom content. If your view does not do any custom drawing, avoid overriding this method.

- `draw(_:for:)` \- Implement this method only if you want to draw your view’s content differently during printing.

- Layout and Constraints:

- `requiresConstraintBasedLayout` Use this property if your view class requires constraints to work properly.

- `updateConstraints()` \- Implement this method if your view needs to create custom constraints between your subviews.

- `alignmentRect(forFrame:)`, `frame(forAlignmentRect:)` \- Implement these methods to override how your views are aligned to other views.

- `didAddSubview(_:)`, `willRemoveSubview(_:)` \- Implement these methods as needed to track the additions and removals of subviews.

- `willMove(toSuperview:)`, `didMoveToSuperview()` \- Implement these methods as needed to track the movement of the current view in your view hierarchy.

- Event Handling:

- `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin(_:)` \- Implement this method if your view handles touch events directly and might want to prevent attached gesture recognizers from triggering additional actions.

- `touchesBegan(_:with:)`, `touchesMoved(_:with:)`, `touchesEnded(_:with:)`, `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` \- Implement these methods if you need to handle touch events directly. (For gesture-based input, use gesture recognizers.)

#### Alternatives to subclassing

Many view behaviors can be configured without the need for subclassing. Before you start overriding methods, consider whether modifying the following properties or behaviors would provide the behavior you need.

- `addConstraint(_:)` \- Define automatic layout behavior for the view and its subviews.

- `autoresizingMask` \- Provides automatic layout behavior when the superview’s frame changes. These behaviors can be combined with constraints.

- `contentMode` \- Provides layout behavior for the view’s content, as opposed to the `frame` of the view. This property also affects how the content is scaled to fit the view and whether it is cached or redrawn.

- `isHidden` or `alpha` \- Change the transparency of the view as a whole rather than hiding or applying alpha to your view’s rendered content.

- `backgroundColor` \- Set the view’s color rather than drawing that color yourself.

- Subviews - Rather than draw your content using a `draw(_:)` method, embed image and label subviews with the content you want to present.

- Gesture recognizers - Rather than subclass to intercept and handle touch events yourself, you can use gesture recognizers to send an action to a target object.

- Animations - Use the built-in animation support rather than trying to animate changes yourself. The animation support provided by Core Animation is fast and easy to use.

- Image-based backgrounds - For views that display relatively static content, consider using a `UIImageView` object with gesture recognizers instead of subclassing and drawing the image yourself. Alternatively, you can also use a generic `UIView` object and assign your image as the content of the view’s `CALayer` object.

Animations are another way to make visible changes to a view without requiring you to subclass and implement complex drawing code. Many properties of the `UIView` class are animatable, which means changes to those properties can trigger system-generated animations. Starting animations requires as little as one line of code to indicate that any changes that follow should be animated. For more information about animation support for views, see Animate views.

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

Using responders and the responder chain to handle events

Responding to memory warnings

Creating a custom container view controller

## Overview

The `UIViewController` class defines the shared behavior that’s common to all view controllers. You rarely create instances of the `UIViewController` class directly. Instead, you subclass `UIViewController` and add the methods and properties needed to manage the view controller’s view hierarchy.

A view controller’s main responsibilities include the following:

- Updating the contents of the views, usually in response to changes to the underlying data

- Responding to user interactions with views

- Resizing views and managing the layout of the overall interface

- Coordinating with other objects — including other view controllers — in your app

A view controller is tightly bound to the views it manages and takes part in handling events in its view hierarchy. Specifically, view controllers are `UIResponder` objects and are inserted into the responder chain between the view controller’s root view and that view’s superview, which typically belongs to a different view controller. If none of the view controller’s views handle an event, the view controller has the option of handling the event or passing it along to the superview.

View controllers are rarely used in isolation. Instead, you often use multiple view controllers, each of which owns a portion of your app’s user interface. For example, one view controller might display a table of items while a different view controller displays the selected item from that table. Usually, only the views from one view controller are visible at a time. A view controller may present a different view controller to display a new set of views, or it may act as a container for other view controllers’ content and animate views however it wants.

### Subclassing notes

Every app contains at least one custom subclass of `UIViewController`. More often, apps contain many custom view controllers. Custom view controllers define the overall behaviors of your app, including the app’s appearance and how it responds to user interactions. The following sections provide a brief overview of some of the tasks your custom subclass performs. For detailed information about using and implementing view controllers, see View Controller Programming Guide for iOS.

#### Manage views

Each view controller manages a view hierarchy, the root view of which is stored in the `view` property of this class. The root view acts primarily as a container for the rest of the view hierarchy. The size and position of the root view is determined by the object that owns it, which is either a parent view controller or the app’s window. The view controller that’s owned by the window is the app’s root view controller and its view is sized to fill the window.

View controllers load their views lazily. Accessing the `view` property for the first time loads or creates the view controller’s views. There are several ways to specify the views for a view controller:

- Specify the view controller and its views in your app’s storyboard. Storyboards are the preferred way to specify your views. With a storyboard, you specify the views and their connections to the view controller. You also specify the relationships and segues between your view controllers, which makes it easier to see and modify your app’s behavior.

To load a view controller from a storyboard, call the `instantiateViewController(withIdentifier:)` method of the appropriate `UIStoryboard` object. The storyboard object creates the view controller and returns it to your code.

- Specify the views for a view controller using a nib file. A nib file lets you specify the views of a single view controller but doesn’t let you define segues or relationships between view controllers. The nib file also stores only minimal information about the view controller itself.

To initialize a view controller object using a nib file, create your view controller class programmatically and initialize it using the `init(nibName:bundle:)` method. When its views are requested, the view controller loads them from the nib file.

- Specify the views for a view controller using the `loadView()` method. In that method, create your view hierarchy programmatically and assign the root view of that hierarchy to the view controller’s `view` property.

All of these techniques have the same end result, which is to create the appropriate set of views and expose them through the `view` property.

A view controller’s root view is always sized to fit its assigned space. For other views in your view hierarchy, use Interface Builder to specify the Auto Layout constraints that govern how each view is positioned and sized within its superview’s bounds. You can also create constraints programmatically and add them to your views at appropriate times. For more information about how to create constraints, see Auto Layout Guide.

##### Handle view-related notifications

When the visibility of its views changes, a view controller automatically calls its own methods so that subclasses can respond to the change. Use a method like `viewIsAppearing(_:)` to prepare your views to appear onscreen, and use `viewWillDisappear(_:)` to save changes or other state information. Use other methods to make appropriate changes.

The following image shows the possible visible states for a view controller’s views and the state transitions that can occur. Not all `will` callback methods are paired with only a `did` callback method. You need to ensure that if you start a process in a `will` callback method, you end the process in both the corresponding `did` and the opposite `will` callback method.

##### Handle view rotations

As of iOS 8, all rotation-related methods are deprecated. Instead, rotations are treated as a change in the size of the view controller’s view and are therefore reported using the `viewWillTransition(to:with:)` method. When the interface orientation changes, UIKit calls this method on the window’s root view controller. That view controller then notifies its child view controllers, propagating the message throughout the view controller hierarchy.

In iOS 6 and iOS 7, your app supports the interface orientations defined in your app’s `Info.plist` file. A view controller can override the `supportedInterfaceOrientations` method to limit the list of supported orientations. Typically, the system calls this method only on the root view controller of the window or a view controller presented to fill the entire screen; child view controllers use the portion of the window provided for them by their parent view controller and no longer participate directly in decisions about what rotations are supported. The intersection of the app’s orientation mask and the view controller’s orientation mask is used to determine which orientations a view controller can be rotated into.

You can override the `preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation` for a view controller that’s intended to be presented full screen in a specific orientation.

When a rotation occurs for a visible view controller, the `willRotate(to:duration:)`, `willAnimateRotation(to:duration:)`, and `didRotate(from:)` methods are called during the rotation. The `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` method is also called after the view is resized and positioned by its parent. If a view controller isn’t visible when an orientation change occurs, then the rotation methods are never called. However, the `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` method is called when the view becomes visible.

#### Implement a container view controller

A custom `UIViewController` subclass can also act as a container view controller. A container view controller manages the presentation of content of other view controllers it owns, also known as its child view controllers. A child’s view can be presented as-is or in conjunction with views owned by the container view controller.

Your container view controller subclass should declare a public interface to associate its children. The nature of these methods is up to you and depends on the semantics of the container you’re creating. You need to decide how many children can be displayed by your view controller at once, when those children are displayed, and where they appear in your view controller’s view hierarchy. Your view controller class defines what relationships, if any, are shared by the children. By establishing a clean public interface for your container, you ensure that children use its capabilities logically, without accessing too many private details about how your container implements the behavior.

Your container view controller must associate a child view controller with itself before adding the child’s root view to the view hierarchy. This allows iOS to properly route events to child view controllers and the views those controllers manage. Likewise, after it removes a child’s root view from its view hierarchy, it should disconnect that child view controller from itself. To make or break these associations, your container calls specific methods defined by the base class. These methods aren’t intended to be called by clients of your container class; they are to be used only by your container’s implementation to provide the expected containment behavior.

Here are the essential methods you might need to call:

- `addChild(_:)`

- `removeFromParent()`

- `willMove(toParent:)`

- `didMove(toParent:)`

#### Manage memory

Memory is a critical resource in iOS, and view controllers provide built-in support for reducing their memory footprint at critical times. The `UIViewController` class provides some automatic handling of low-memory conditions through its `didReceiveMemoryWarning()` method, which releases unneeded memory.

#### Support state preservation and restoration

If you assign a value to the view controller’s `restorationIdentifier` property, the system may ask the view controller to encode itself when the app transitions to the background. When preserved, a view controller preserves the state of any views in its view hierarchy that also have restoration identifiers. View controllers don’t automatically save any other state. If you’re implementing a custom container view controller, you must encode any child view controllers yourself. Each child you encode must have a unique restoration identifier.

For more information about how the system determines which view controllers to preserve and restore, see App Programming Guide for iOS. To see an example of state preservation and restoration, see Restoring your app’s state.

## Mentioned in

Checking the availability of 3D Touch

## Overview

The iOS interface environment includes traits such as horizontal and vertical size class, display scale, and user interface idiom. To access the trait environment of an object that adopts this protocol, use the `traitCollection` property. The protocol also provides an overridable method that the system calls when the interface environment changes. Implement this method as part of creating an adaptive iOS app.

For more about trait collections, see `UITraitCollection`. For the WWDC 2014 presentation on creating adaptive interfaces in iOS, see Building Adaptive Apps with UIKit.

# Managing your app’s life cycle

Respond to system notifications when your app is in the foreground or background, and handle other significant system-related events.

## Overview

The current state of your app determines what it can and can’t do at any time. For example, a foreground app has someone’s attention, so it has priority over system resources, including the CPU. By contrast, a background app must do as little work as possible, and preferably nothing, because it’s offscreen. As your app changes from state to state, you must adjust its behavior accordingly.

When your app’s state changes, UIKit notifies you by calling methods of the appropriate delegate object:

- In iOS 13 and later, use `UISceneDelegate` objects to respond to life-cycle events.

- In iOS 12 and earlier, use the `UIApplicationDelegate` object to respond to life-cycle events.

### Respond to scene-based life-cycle events

UIKit delivers separate life-cycle events for each scene. A scene represents one instance of your app’s UI running on a device. A person can create multiple scenes for each app, and show and hide them separately. Because each scene has its own life cycle, each can be in a different state of execution. For example, one scene might be in the foreground while others are in the background or are suspended.

The following figure shows the state transitions for scenes. When a person or the system requests a new scene for your app, UIKit creates it and puts it in the unattached state. Person-requested scenes move quickly to the foreground, where they appear onscreen. A system-requested scene typically moves to the background so that it can process an event. For example, the system might launch the scene in the background to process a location event. When someone dismisses your app’s UI, UIKit moves the associated scene to the background state and eventually to the suspended state. UIKit can disconnect a background or suspended scene at any time to reclaim its resources, returning that scene to the unattached state.

Use scene transitions to perform the following tasks:

- When UIKit connects a scene to your app, configure your scene’s initial UI and load the data your scene needs.

- When transitioning to the foreground-active state, configure your UI and prepare to interact with a person. See Preparing your UI to run in the foreground.

- Upon leaving the foreground-active state, save data and quiet your app’s behavior. See Preparing your UI to run in the background.

- Upon entering the background state, finish crucial tasks, free up as much memory as possible, and prepare for your app snapshot. See Preparing your UI to run in the background.

- At scene disconnection, clean up any shared resources associated with the scene.

- In addition to scene-related events, you must also respond to the launch of your app using your `UIApplicationDelegate` object. For information about what to do at app launch, see Responding to the launch of your app.

### Respond to app-based life-cycle events

In iOS 12 and earlier, UIKit delivers all life-cycle events to the `UIApplicationDelegate` object. The app delegate manages all of your app’s windows, including those displayed on separate screens. As a result, app state transitions affect your app’s entire UI, including content on external displays.

The following figure shows the state transitions involving the app delegate object. After launch, the system puts the app in the inactive or background state, depending on whether the UI is about to appear onscreen. When launching to the foreground, the system transitions the app to the active state automatically. After that, the state fluctuates between active and background until the app terminates.

Use app transitions to perform the following tasks:

- At launch, initialize your app’s data structures and UI. See Responding to the launch of your app.

- At activation, finish configuring your UI and prepare to interact with a person. See Preparing your UI to run in the foreground.

- Upon deactivation, save data and quiet your app’s behavior. See Preparing your UI to run in the background.

- At termination, stop all work immediately and release any shared resources. See `applicationWillTerminate(_:)`.

### Respond to other significant events

In addition to handling life-cycle events, apps must also be prepared to handle the events listed in the following table. Use your `UIApplicationDelegate` object to handle most of these events. In some cases, you may also be able to handle them using notifications, allowing you to respond from other parts of your app.

| Event | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Memory warnings | Received when your app’s memory usage is too high. Reduce the amount of memory your app uses; see Responding to memory warnings. |
| Protected data becomes available/unavailable | Received when someone locks or unlocks their device. See `applicationProtectedDataDidBecomeAvailable(_:)` and `applicationProtectedDataWillBecomeUnavailable(_:)`. |
| Handoff tasks | Received when an `NSUserActivity` object needs to be processed. See `application(_:didUpdate:)`. |
| Time changes | Received for several different time changes, such as when the phone carrier sends a time update. See `applicationSignificantTimeChange(_:)`. |
| Open URLs | Received when your app needs to open a resource. See `application(_:open:options:)`. |

# Responding to the launch of your app

Initialize your app’s data structures, prepare your app to run, and respond to any launch-time requests from the system.

## Overview

The system launches your app when the user taps your app’s icon on the Home Screen. If your app requested specific events, the system might also launch your app in the background to handle those events.

All apps have an associated process and at least one scene, which the `UIApplication` and `UIScene` objects represent. Apps also have an _app delegate object_ — an object that conforms to the `UIApplicationDelegate` protocol — which responds to important events happening within that process. Even an app that implements the scene life cycle uses an app delegate to manage fundamental events like launch and termination. At launch time, UIKit automatically creates the `UIApplication` object and your app delegate. It then starts your app’s main event loop before connecting to one or more of your app’s scenes.

### Provide a launch storyboard

When the user first launches your app on a device, the system displays your launch storyboard until your app is ready to display its UI. Displaying the launch storyboard assures the user that your app launched and is doing something. If your app initializes itself and readies its UI quickly, the user may see your launch storyboard only briefly.

Xcode projects automatically include a default launch storyboard for you to customize, and you can add more launch storyboards as necessary. To add new launch storyboards to your project, do the following:

1. Open your project in Xcode.

3. Add a Launch Screen resource to your project.

Add views to your launch storyboard and use Auto Layout constraints to size and position them so that they adapt to the underlying environment. UIKit displays exactly what you provide, using your constraints to fit your views into the available space. For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

### Initialize your app’s data structures

Put your app’s launch-time initialization code in one or both of the following methods:

- `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`

- `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`

UIKit calls these methods at the beginning of your app’s launch cycle. Use them to:

- Initialize data structures that your app uses across scenes.

- Verify that your app has the resources it needs to run.

- Perform any one-time setup when your app launches for the first time. For example, install templates or user-modifiable files in a writable directory. See Performing one-time setup for your app.

- Connect to any critical services that your app uses. For example, connect to the Apple Push Notification service if your app supports remote notifications.

- Check the launch options dictionary for information about why your app launched. See Determine why your app launched.

For apps that haven’t adopted the scene life cycle, UIKit loads your default user interface automatically at launch time. Use the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method to make additional changes to that interface before it appears onscreen. For example, you might install a different view controller to reflect what the user was doing the last time they used the app.

### Move long-running tasks off the main thread

When the user launches your app, make a good impression by launching quickly. Performing long-running tasks in `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`, `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`, or `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` might make your app appear sluggish to the user. Returning quickly is also important when launching to the background because the system limits your app’s background execution time.

Move tasks that aren’t critical to your app’s initialization out of the launch-time sequence. For example:

- Defer the initialization of features that your app doesn’t need immediately.

- Move important, long-running tasks off your app’s main thread. For example, run them asynchronously on a global dispatch queue or in a `Task`.

### Determine why your scene connected

When UIKit connects to a scene in your app, it passes along a `UIScene.ConnectionOptions` object that contains information about why UIKit connected to the scene. For example, this could indicate that the user requested your app to open a `URL`, which you might use to display a screen related to information provided in the `URL`.

The following code shows how you can check for a `URL` that contains information in query items in the scene’s connection options:

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

// Confirm the scene is a window scene in iOS or iPadOS.
guard let _ = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

// Check if the scene connection options include a URL,
// and whether the URL has query items.
guard let linkedUrl = connectionOptions.urlContexts.first?.url,
let linkedComponents = URLComponents(url: linkedUrl, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: false),
let queryItems = linkedComponents.queryItems,
!queryItems.isEmpty else {
return
}

// Check and handle the URL and query items here.
}
// other methods…
}

### Determine why your app launched

When UIKit launches your app, it calls the `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` and `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` methods to indicate when it’s reached these points in your app’s launch process. If your app hasn’t implemented the scene life cycle, UIKit passes along a launch options dictionary to these methods with information about why your app launched. The keys in that dictionary indicate important tasks to perform immediately. For example, they might reflect actions that the user started elsewhere and wants to continue in your app. Always check the contents of the launch options dictionary for keys that you expect, and respond appropriately to their presence.

The following code shows the app delegate method for an app that handles receiving a `URL`. The code checks the launch options for an incoming URL, and whether that `URL` contains query items that you can use to configure your app. If not, the code returns `false` to indicate that your app can’t handle the launch options.

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

// Check if the launch options include a URL,
// and whether the URL has query items.
guard let linkedUrl = launchOptions?[.url] as? URL,
let linkedComponents = URLComponents(url: linkedUrl, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: false),
let queryItems = linkedComponents.queryItems,
!queryItems.isEmpty else {
return false
}

// Check whether your app can handle the URL and query
// items here. Then return `true` if so, otherwise `false`.
// ...

return true
}
// other methods…
}

The system doesn’t include a key unless your app supports the corresponding feature. For example, the system doesn’t include the `remoteNotification` key for an app that doesn’t support remote notifications.

For a list of launch option keys and information about how to handle them, see `UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey`.

## Overview

Every iOS app has exactly one instance of `UIApplication` (or, very rarely, a subclass of `UIApplication`). When an app launches, the system calls the `UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:)` function. Among its other tasks, this function creates a singleton `UIApplication` object that you access using `shared`.

Your app’s application object handles the initial routing of incoming user events. It dispatches action messages forwarded to it by control objects (instances of the `UIControl` class) to appropriate target objects. The application object maintains a list of open windows ( `UIWindow` objects), which it can use to retrieve any of the app’s `UIView` objects.

The `UIApplication` class defines a delegate that conforms to the `UIApplicationDelegate` protocol and must implement some of the protocol’s methods. The application object informs the delegate of significant runtime events—for example, app launch, low-memory warnings, and app termination—giving it an opportunity to respond appropriately.

Apps can cooperatively handle a resource, such as an email or an image file, through the `open(_:options:completionHandler:)` method. For example, an app that calls this method with an email URL causes the Mail app to launch and display the message.

The APIs in this class allow you to manage device-specific behavior. Use your `UIApplication` object to do the following:

- Temporarily suspend incoming touch events ( `beginIgnoringInteractionEvents()`)

- Register for remote notifications ( `registerForRemoteNotifications()`)

- Trigger the undo-redo UI ( `applicationSupportsShakeToEdit`)

- Determine whether there is an installed app registered to handle a URL scheme ( `canOpenURL(_:)`)

- Extend the execution of the app so that it can finish a task in the background ( `beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:)` and `beginBackgroundTask(withName:expirationHandler:)`)

- Schedule and cancel local notifications ( `scheduleLocalNotification(_:)` and `cancelLocalNotification(_:)`)

- Coordinate the reception of remote-control events ( `beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents()` and `endReceivingRemoteControlEvents()`)

- Perform app-level state restoration tasks (methods in the Managing state restoration task group)

### Subclassing notes

Most apps don’t need to subclass `UIApplication`. Instead, use an app delegate to manage interactions between the system and the app.

If your app must handle incoming events before the system does—a very rare situation—you can implement a custom event or action dispatching mechanism. To do this, subclass `UIApplication` and override the `sendEvent(_:)` and/or the `sendAction(_:to:from:for:)` methods. For every event you intercept, after you handle the event, dispatch it

Protocol

# UIApplicationDelegate

A set of methods to manage shared behaviors for your app.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
protocol UIApplicationDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

Your app delegate object manages your app’s shared behaviors. The app delegate is effectively the root object of your app, and it works in conjunction with `UIApplication` to manage some interactions with the system. Like the `UIApplication` object, UIKit creates your app delegate object early in your app’s launch cycle so it’s always present.

Use your app delegate object to handle the following tasks:

- Initializing your app’s central data structures

- Configuring your app’s scenes

- Responding to notifications originating from outside the app, such as low-memory warnings, download completion notifications, and more

- Responding to events that target the app itself, and aren’t specific to your app’s scenes, views, or view controllers

- Registering for any required services at launch time, such as Apple Push Notification service

For more information about how you use the app delegate object to initialize your app at launch time, see Responding to the launch of your app.

### Life-cycle management in iOS 12 and earlier

In iOS 12 and earlier, you use your app delegate to manage major life cycle events in your app. Specifically, you use methods of the app delegate to update the state of your app when it enters the foreground or moves to the background.

- For information on what to do when your app enters the foreground, see Preparing your UI to run in the foreground.

- For information on what to do when your app enters the background, see Preparing your UI to run in the background.

- For general information about the life cycle of your app, see Managing your app’s life cycle.

# Scenes

Manage multiple instances of your app’s UI simultaneously, and direct resources to the appropriate instance of your UI.

## Overview

UIKit manages each instance of your app’s UI using a `UIWindowScene` object. A _scene_ contains the windows and view controllers for presenting one instance of your UI. Each scene also has a corresponding `UIWindowSceneDelegate` object, which you use to coordinate interactions between UIKit and your app. Scenes run concurrently with each other, sharing the same memory and app process space. As a result, a single app may have multiple scenes and scene delegate objects active at the same time.

Manage the configuration of new scenes from your `UIApplicationDelegate` object.

Class

# UIDevice

A representation of the current device.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIDevice

## Overview

Use a `UIDevice` object to get information about the device such as assigned name, device model, and operating-system name and version. You also use the `UIDevice` instance to detect changes in the device’s characteristics, such as physical orientation. You get the current orientation using the `orientation` property or receive change notifications by registering for the `orientationDidChangeNotification` notification. Before using either of these techniques to get orientation data, you must enable data delivery using the `beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications()` method. When you no longer need to track the device orientation, call the `endGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications()` method to disable the delivery of notifications.

Similarly, you can use the `UIDevice` instance to obtain information and notifications about changes to the battery’s charge state (described by the `batteryState` property) and charge level (described by the `batteryLevel` property). The `UIDevice` instance also provides access to the proximity sensor state (described by the `proximityState` property). The proximity sensor detects whether the user is holding the device close to their face. Enable battery monitoring or proximity sensing only when you need it.

You can also use the `playInputClick()` instance method to play keyboard input clicks in custom input and keyboard accessory views.

# Automatic trait tracking

Reduce the need to manually register for trait changes when you use traits within a method or closure that supports automatic trait tracking.

## Overview

Automatic trait tracking is a UIKit feature that eliminates the need to manually register for trait changes when you use traits in a supported method or closure. This feature reduces the amount of code you need to write and maintain, improves performance, and encourages the best practice of using traits within the scope of the supported APIs.

Some properties aren’t appropriate to change during `layoutSubviews()`, for example, properties where setting the value has a side-effect of invalidating the view’s layout. Update these properties in a view’s `updateProperties()` method, or a view controller’s `updateProperties()` method. These methods support automatic trait tracking, and automatic observation tracking on objects that use the `Observable()` macro. Notify an object of other updates to its properties by calling `setNeedsUpdateProperties()` on your view, or `setNeedsUpdateProperties()` on your view controller. Force an object to immediately update its properties by calling `updatePropertiesIfNeeded()` on your view, or `updatePropertiesIfNeeded()` on your view controller.

A complete list of APIs that support automatic trait tracking appears below.

## Topics

### Views

`func layoutSubviews()`

Lays out subviews.

`func updateConstraints()`

Updates constraints for the view.

`func draw(CGRect)`

Draws the view’s image within the passed-in rectangle.

`struct Properties`

### View controllers

View controllers support automatic trait tracking for both the trait collection of the view controller and the trait collection of its view inside any of the following methods.

Override point for subclasses to update properties of this view controller or its view. Never call this method directly; use `setNeedsUpdateProperties` to schedule an update.

Call to manually request a properties update for the view controller. Multiple requests may be coalesced into a single update alongside the next layout pass.

# Responding to changing display modes on Apple TV

Change images and resources dynamically when the screen gamut on your device changes.

## Overview

On Apple TV (5th generation), the assets required for an app depend on the screen gamut of the TV being used, with 4K TVs using the Display P3 gamut, and all other resolutions using the sRGB gamut. Also, the screen gamut of the TV can change at any time, switching between 4K and other resolutions. Your app needs to respond to these changes and present the appropriate assets when required.

### Create and place the image assets

In Xcode, create an image asset in an asset catalog. In the Attributes inspector, configure the asset catalog to handle Display P3 images. In the Devices pane, ensure that Apple TV is selected. From the Gamut menu, select sRGB and Display P3. The following image shows the correct settings.

### Add images to the asset catalog

Place non-4K images in the 1x (sRGB) slot and 4K images in the 2x (Display P3) slot. The correct image is automatically loaded based on the display gamut of the TV. The following image shows assets placed in their correct containers.

### Adapt to screen changes programmatically

Implement the `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` method to respond to changing device traits. If your app performs expensive operations related to image generation based on the current display gamut, it’s important to verify that the display gamut has changed before performing these operations. The following code shows how to test whether the display gamut changed.

override func traitCollectionDidChange(_ previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection?) {
let currentDisplayGamut = self.traitCollection.displayGamut
if (previousTraitCollection?.displayGamut == .SRGB) && (currentDisplayGamut == .SRGB) {
// Resolution didn't change. Your code goes here.
} else if (previousTraitCollection?.displayGamut == .P3) && (currentDisplayGamut == .P3) {
// Resolution didn't change. Your code goes here.
} else {
// Resolution changed. Your code goes here.
}
}

## Mentioned in

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

The `traitCollection` property of the `UITraitEnvironment` protocol contains traits that describe the state of various elements of the iOS user interface, such as size class, display scale, and layout direction. Together, these traits compose the UIKit trait environment.

The following classes adopt `UITraitEnvironment`: `UIScreen`, `UIWindow`, `UIViewController`, `UIPresentationController`, and `UIView`. To create an adaptive interface, write code to adjust your app’s layout according to changes in these traits. You access specific trait values using the `UITraitCollection` `horizontalSizeClass`, `verticalSizeClass`, `displayScale`, and `userInterfaceIdiom` properties. The `UIUserInterfaceSizeClass` enumeration defines the values for the horizontal and vertical size class. The display scale is a floating point number. The `UIUserInterfaceIdiom` enumeration defines the values for the user interface idiom.

To make your view controllers and views responsive to changes in the iOS interface environment, override the `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` method from the trait environment protocol. To customize view controller animations in response to interface environment changes, override the `willTransition(to:with:)` method of the `UIContentContainer` protocol.

The following image shows the horizontal (width) and vertical (height) size classes your app can encounter when running full-screen on various devices.

For information about size classes your app encounters in Slide Over and Split View on iPad, read Slide Over and Split View Quick Start in Adopting Multitasking Enhancements on iPad.

You can create standalone trait collections to assist in matching against specific environments. The `UITraitCollection` class includes four specialized constructors, as well as a constructor that enables you to combine an array of trait collections, `init(traitsFrom:)`.

One important use of standalone trait collections is to enable conditional use of images based on the current iOS interface environment. You can associate a trait collection with a `UIImage` instance by way of a `UIImageAsset` instance, as described in the overview section of `UIImageAsset`. For information on configuring asset catalogs graphically from within the Xcode IDE, see Managing assets with asset catalogs.

You can employ a standalone trait collection to enable a two-column split view in landscape orientation on iPhone. See the `setOverrideTraitCollection(_:forChild:)` method of the `UIViewController` class.

You can also use a standalone trait collection to customize view appearance with the `appearance(for:)` protocol method, as described in `UIAppearance`.

### 3D Touch and trait collections

Starting in iOS 9, you can use this class to check whether the device on which your app is running supports 3D Touch. Read the value of the `forceTouchCapability` property on the trait collection for any object in your app with a trait environment. For information about trait environments, see `UITraitEnvironment`. For the possible values of the force touch capability property, see the `UIForceTouchCapability` enumeration.

Because a user can turn off 3D Touch in Settings, check the value of the `forceTouchCapability` property in your implementation of the `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` method, and adjust your code paths according to the property’s value.

### Custom traits

You can create a custom trait using `UITraitDefinition`. You read custom traits from `UITraitCollection` using subscript syntax. When you define a custom trait, declare a property for the trait in an extension to `UITraitCollection` so that you can access your custom trait using standard property syntax.

The following example defines a property for a custom trait, and reads the trait value from a trait collection.

// ThemeTrait conforms to UITraitDefinition, with a defaultValue type of Theme.
extension UITraitCollection {
var theme: Theme {
self[ThemeTrait.self]
}
}

let viewTheme = view.traitCollection.theme

Mac CatalystvisionOS

@MainActor
protocol UITraitChangeObservable

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

Types that conform to `UITraitChangeObservable` can execute your code in response to changes in their trait collection. When you register for trait changes, the system observes the specified traits, and calls your code when any of the observed traits change value.

Keep your trait registrations focused, and avoid doing work not directly relevant to updated traits. Traits may change more than once before the system updates a view, so avoid expensive work in response to trait changes. For example, use the trait change notification to call `setNeedsDisplay()`, and update your view in `draw(_:)`.

UIKit cleans up registrations at the end of the object lifecycle. Unregister only in the rare situations when you need to dynamically change which traits you observe.

## Topics

### Observing trait changes

Registers a list of traits to observe, and calls a method on the receiving object when one of the observed traits changes.

**Required**

Registers a list of traits to observe and a closure to execute when one of the observed traits changes.

# UIMutableTraits

A mutable container of traits.

Mac CatalystvisionOS

protocol UIMutableTraits

## Overview

The `UIMutableTraits` protocol provides read-write access to get and set trait values on an underlying container. UIKit uses this protocol to facilitate working with instances of `UITraitCollection`, which are immutable and read-only. The `UITraitCollection` initializer `init(mutations:)` uses an instance of `UIMutableTraits`, which enables you to set a batch of trait values in one method call. `UITraitOverrides` conforms to `UIMutableTraits`, making it easy to set trait overrides on trait environments such as views and view controllers.

When you define a custom trait, declare a property for the trait in an extension to `UIMutableTraits` so that you can access your custom trait using standard property syntax.

The following example defines an extension and sets the theme on the `traitOverrides` property:

// ThemeTrait conforms to UITraitDefinition, and has a defaultValue type of Theme
extension UIMutableTraits {
var theme: Theme {
get { self[ThemeTrait.self] }
set { self[ThemeTrait.self] = newValue }
}
}

// Apply an override for the custom theme trait.
view.traitOverrides.theme = .monochrome

# UIContentContainer

A set of methods for adapting the contents of your view controllers to size and trait changes.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
protocol UIContentContainer : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

The methods of this protocol handle size-related transitions that are related to changes in the current trait environment or view controller hierarchy. When the parent view controller changes, or when trait changes occur that affect the size of a view controller, UIKit calls these methods to give the affected objects a chance to respond appropriately.

All `UIViewController` and `UIPresentationController` objects provide default implementations for the methods of this protocol. When creating your own custom view controller or presentation controller, you can override the default implementations to make adjustments to your content. For example, you might use these methods to adjust the size or position of any child view controllers.

When overriding the methods of this protocol, call `super` to let UIKit perform any default behaviors. View controllers and presentation controllers perform their own adjustments when these methods are called. Calling `super` ensures that UIKit is able to continue adjusting other parts of your user interface.

## Topics

### Responding to environment changes

`func viewWillTransition(to: CGSize, with: any UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator)`

typealias UITrait = any UITraitDefinition.Type

## Discussion

The type of a trait serves as a key to uniquely identify a trait in a trait collection. The `subscript(_:)` method of `UITraitCollection` and `registerForTraitChanges(_:handler:)` are two examples that take trait types to identify traits in the collection.

Protocol

# UITraitDefinition

A type representing a trait in a trait collection.

Mac CatalystvisionOS

protocol UITraitDefinition

## Overview

All traits contained in a `UITraitCollection` conform to this protocol. You can create custom traits by defining your own conforming type.

The example below defines a new trait that holds the value of an integer-based enumeration named `Theme`:

enum Theme: Int {
case standard
case monochrome
}

struct ThemeTrait: UITraitDefinition {
static let defaultValue = Theme.standard
}

The protocol defines default implementations for `name` and `identifier` properties. Defining `defaultValue` is the minimum requirement to conform to this protocol. All properties you implement must be constant. `UITraitDefinition` defines the associated type `Value` which is the type of `defaultValue`.

The best candidates for trait values are simple value types, such as `Bool`, `Int`, `Double`, and enumerations with an `Int` raw value. You can also use lightweight structures as trait values. The system frequently tests trait values for equality, so structures need an efficient implementation of `Equatable`. Avoid using Swift classes as trait values.

If you use your custom trait to implement custom dynamic colors, implement `affectsColorAppearance` and return `true`. Returning `true` tells the system to update and redraw views automatically when the trait changes. The system responds to changes to your trait similar to changes in system traits contained in `systemTraitsAffectingColorAppearance`. Changes to traits that affect color appearance are more expensive, so opt in to this behavior only when necessary, and change such traits infrequently.

For each custom trait, define extensions on `UIMutableTraits` and `UITraitCollection` to enable reading and modifying your custom traits with standard property syntax. The example below shows extensions for the example `Theme` trait.

extension UITraitCollection {
var theme: Theme { self[ThemeTrait.self] }
}

extension UIMutableTraits {
var theme: Theme {
get { self[ThemeTrait.self] }
set { self[ThemeTrait.self] = newValue }
}
}

A trait type serves as a unique key, identifying a trait within a trait collection. Methods such as `subscript(_:)` and `UIPresentationController/registerForTraitChanges(_:handler:)` take a trait type to identify the trait in a collection.

Traits defined in Swift aren’t automatically bridged to Objective-C. If you need to access your custom trait from both Swift and Objective-C code, define the trait in both languages. For details, see the Objective-C documentation for `UITraitDefinition`.

# Building a desktop-class iPad app

Optimize your iPad app’s user experience by adopting desktop-class enhancements for multitasking with Stage Manager, document interactions, text editing, search, and more.

## Overview

People can use an iPad with a Magic Keyboard and an external display to achieve desktop-class productivity. Build your app to take advantage of features that help people increase their efficiency, customize their workflows, and complete tasks more quickly. After you create a desktop-class iPad app, bring your app directly over to the Mac with minimal additional effort using Mac Catalyst. Bring your app to Apple Vision Pro using the details in Making your existing app compatible with visionOS.

### Enhance the multitasking experience with Stage Manager

A great iPad app supports productivity by enabling quick, complex workflows across multiple apps with Stage Manager, which people can use to quickly switch to other open apps and windows on the side of the screen. People can also dynamically resize app windows to show many open windows side by side on the iPad or on an external display.

Follow these steps to support a great multitasking experience with Stage Manager:

- Build your UI with scenes. A scene contains the windows and view controllers for presenting one instance of your UI. Adopt scenes as part of your app’s core infrastructure, and use them to adjust your app’s behavior at important times, such as when your scene transitions to the foreground, changes orientation, or moves to an external display. Use scenes, instead of `UIScreen`, to determine which hardware display shows your UI. For more information, see Scenes.

- Support a variety of workflows with multiple app windows. Consider letting people view and interact with more than one app window at a time to enable workflows like viewing multiple documents simultaneously or quickly dragging and dropping content from one part of your app to another. Use scenes to support multiple app windows. For more information, see Supporting multiple windows on iPad.

- Respond to window resizing. Because people who use Stage Manager can dynamically resize their iPad app windows, your app’s UI can transition through a broad range of sizes. Design your UI for flexible layout configurations, and make sure your app adapts to different window sizes quickly and smoothly. Discover your app’s environment with `UITraitCollection`, and adapt to it by using Auto Layout or by registering for trait change notifications in your view controllers or views with `UITraitChangeObservable` in Swift or `UITraitChangeRegistration` in Objective-C.

- Consider the best use of additional space that an external display provides. Support interactive resizable windows through scenes with a `windowApplication` role, or present noninteractive content with a `windowExternalDisplayNonInteractive` scene. For more information, see Presenting content on a connected display.

- Test your UI on different devices, in different environments. Consider the various configurations and sizes your UI can appear in, and make sure to test your app under those conditions. For example, test under the following conditions: full screen, Split View, Slide Over, Picture in Picture (PIP), and dynamic resizing in all dimensions while using Stage Manager with an external display.

### Support powerful document-editing workflows

Navigation-based apps support a specialized editor style that brings important document-editing features to the forefront and supports user customization. Navigation-based apps can also use a title menu to surface document management operations, sharing capabilities, and custom actions.

Follow these steps to support document-editing enhancements on iPad:

- Switch to editor-style navigation for document-editing apps. Navigation-based interfaces can use the `UINavigationItem.ItemStyle.editor` style to bring the content density and flexibility of the Mac toolbar to iPad. This style moves the title to the leading side to open up more space for important controls, so you can provide fast access to common actions with a single tap. Specify important controls using `centerItemGroups`, and enable people to customize the layout of those controls using `customizationIdentifier`.

- Support document interactions through a title menu. Show a menu when a person taps the document’s title using `titleMenuProvider`. Include standard actions like move, duplicate, and export, or implement custom actions. Add a menu header that contains document information and sharing capabilities, like share and drag and drop, using `documentProperties`.

- Support fast document renaming. Implement `renameDelegate` to show Rename in the title menu, and to surface an inline system UI for people to rename their document after tapping on the document’s title.

### Simplify the text-editing process

When people use an iPad with an external keyboard, they expect full support for keyboard input, including familiar keyboard shortcuts and interactions. A smooth text-editing experience takes advantage of standard system capabilities, and tailors itself according to touch or keyboard input. To enable a productive text-editing experience, leverage system enhancements to text-editing menus, as well as Find and Replace.

Follow these steps to provide a great text-editing experience on iPad:

- Create text-editing menus for the current input method. To create an edit menu that adjusts its presentation style according to touch or indirect input for an optimal user experience, see `UIEditMenuInteraction`.

- Integrate the system Find and Replace experience into your text views. For standard system text input views like `UITextView` or `WKWebView`, set `isFindInteractionEnabled` to `true` to allow people to find and replace text using the system Find panel. For custom text view implementations, see `UIFindInteraction`.

### Support inline searches with suggestions

iPadOS includes an inline search UI that opens up more space for the surrounding content. Improve content discovery by taking advantage of search capabilities in your iPad app and providing search suggestions to help people navigate your content even quicker.

Follow these steps to provide a great search experience on iPad:

- Choose the search experience that’s best for your UI. Take advantage of the inline search placement in a navigation bar to open up more space for your content. To control the search placement explicitly, set `preferredSearchBarPlacement` to choose between the inline or traditional stacked search experience.

- Provide helpful search suggestions. Specify `searchSuggestions` on your navigation item’s search controller to help people quickly narrow down their search. Update the search suggestions as people type. If you use a search field independently of a search controller, provide search suggestions using `searchSuggestions`.

### Provide an intuitive multiple-selection experience

People who use iPad with a Magic Keyboard expect to use the trackpad to perform different types of selections and actions in your app. Leverage multiple selection to provide intuitive interactions and elevate the most relevant contextual actions.

Follow these steps to provide a great experience for multiple selection on iPad:

- Enable lightweight multiple selection with indirect input. Allow people using indirect input methods, like a keyboard or trackpad, to select multiple items in a collection view without placing the collection view into editing mode. Opt into this behavior by setting `allowsMultipleSelection`, `allowsFocus`, and `selectionFollowsFocus` to `true`.

- Distinguish between selection and primary action. Primary actions allow you to distinguish between a distinct user action and a change in selection. A primary action occurs when a person selects a single cell without extending an existing selection. Implement `collectionView(_:performPrimaryActionForItemAt:)` to perform actions like navigation or showing another split-view column.

- Specialize context menu options according to the number of selected items. Customize your context menus to surface different capabilities depending on whether the selection contains zero, one, or many items. Implement `collectionView(_:contextMenuConfigurationForItemsAt:point:)` to support context menus for multiple selections in a collection view. If you use `UIContextMenuInteraction` directly, implement `secondaryItemIdentifiers` and the `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate` preview animation methods.

### Bring your iPad app to the Mac with Mac Catalyst

If your iPad app already supports a desktop-class experience, you can bring your app over to the Mac using Mac Catalyst. When you build your iPadOS app with Mac Catalyst, the system bridges certain interactions and UI elements to their counterparts in macOS.

Follow these steps to expedite the process of bringing your iPad app to the Mac with Mac Catalyst:

- Bring your navigation bar customization to the Mac toolbar. By default, `NSToolbar` automatically hosts your navigation bar’s content when its behavioral style is `UIBehavioralStyle.mac`. Use `behavioralStyle` to check your navigation bar’s behavioral style, and `currentNSToolbarSection` to check where the toolbar hosts the navigation bar. You can opt out of `NSToolbar` hosting your navigation bar by setting `preferredBehavioralStyle` to `UIBehavioralStyle.pad`.

- Host custom views directly in the Mac toolbar. If you build your own `NSToolbar` instead of using `UINavigationBar`, host your custom UIKit views in the toolbar by creating a `NSUIViewToolbarItem`. In your custom view, use the `toolbarItemPresentationSize` trait to render your content at an appropriate size depending on the toolbar’s display mode.

# Elevating your iPad app with a tab bar and sidebar

Provide a compact, ergonomic tab bar for quick access to key parts of your app, and a sidebar for in-depth navigation.

## Overview

In iPadOS 18 and later, the position of the tab bar moves from the bottom of the screen to float over your content at the top. This compact appearance gives you more space for your app’s content. Additionally, because it shares space with the navigation bar, it places your tabs closer to your app’s other controls.

iPadOS apps automatically receive the new tab bar appearance when you compile them for iPadOS 18 and later.

### Create a tab bar

iPadOS 18 also introduces new API for creating tab bars. Create a `UITabBarController` and assign an array of `UITab` objects to its `tabs` property. To create a tab, call `init(title:image:identifier:viewControllerProvider:)`. In the closure, return the view controller your app presents when someone selects the tab. If you use SF Symbols for your tab’s image, be sure to select the outline variant. The system automatically selects the correct variant (outline or filled) based on the context. Additionally, you can change a tab’s properties, such as `title` or `image`, at runtime, and the system automatically updates its appearance.

// Create the tab bar controller.
let tabBarController = UITabBarController()

// Assign an array of tabs.
tabBarController.tabs = [\
\
UITab(title: "First",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "1.circle"),\
identifier: "First Tab") { _ in\
// Return the view controller that the tab displays.\
MyFirstViewController()\
},\
\
UITab(title: "Second",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "2.circle"),\
identifier: "Second Tab") { _ in\
// Return the view controller that the tab displays.\
MySecondViewController()\
},\
\
UITab(title: "Third",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "3.circle"),\
identifier: "Third Tab") { _ in\
// Return the view controller that the tab displays.\
MyThirdViewController()\
}\
]

To add a search tab, create a `UISearchTab` instance and add it to the tabs array.

// Create a search tab.
UISearchTab { _ in
// Return the view controller that the tab displays.
UINavigationController(
rootViewController: MySearchViewController()
)
}

The new iPad tab bar supports an unlimited number of items. If there isn’t enough room to display all the tabs, the system collapses any tabs that can’t fit onscreen, and lets people scroll through them. However, consider limiting your tabs to just those that fit in the tab bar. This ensures that people can access key parts of your app with one tap.

### Integrate the tab bar and sidebar

Although both tab bars and sidebars play a similar navigation role in iPadOS apps, they have different strengths. A tab bar is always available and represents the key parts of your app. A sidebar provides a richer collection of possible destinations; however, people typically need to navigate

Use the new `UITab` and `UITabGroup` classes to create a hierarchy of tabs. If the tabs array contains at least one tab group, the system automatically displays the tabs as both a tab bar and a sidebar. Otherwise, it only displays the array as a tab bar. You can also explicitly define how the system displays your tabs by setting the `UITabBarController` object’s `mode` property.

// Enable the sidebar.
tabBarController.mode = .tabSidebar

// Get the sidebar.
let sidebar = tabBarController.sidebar

// Show the sidebar.
sidebar.isHidden = false

By default, the system presents the sidebar in landscape orientation and hides it in portrait orientation; however, people can toggle between the tab bar and sidebar in either orientation. You can also programmatically show and hide the sidebar by setting its `isHidden` property.

### Build a hierarchy of items for the sidebar

You can use `UITabGroup` to define a section of items in the sidebar. Provide an array of tabs for the section’s content and a view controller to display when someone selects the section from the tab bar.

let sectionOne = UITabGroup(
title: "Section 1",
image: UIImage(systemName: "1.square.fill"),
identifier: "Section one",
children:
[\
UITab(\
title: "Subitem A",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "a.circle"),\
identifier: "Section 1, item A"\
) { _ in\
MyFirstSubitemTabViewController()\
},\
\
UITab(\
title: "Subitem B",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "b.circle"),\
identifier: "Section 1, item b"\
) { _ in\
MySecondSubitemTabViewController()\
},\
\
UITab(\
title: "Subitem C",\
image: UIImage(systemName: "c.circle"),\
identifier: "Section 1, item C"\
) { _ in\
MyThirdSubitemTabViewController()\
},\
]) { _ in
// Return a view controller that the system displays when someone selects the section in the tab bar.
MySectionViewController()
}

The tab bar displays a tab group as a single tab item, and the sidebar displays it as a section that contains subitems. The sidebar displays top-level tab items first, followed by the sections.

You can nest a `UITabGroup` inside another `UITabGroup` to create a deeper hierarchy in the sidebar; however, consider limiting your app to two, or at most three, layers. Also, you can dynamically change a tab group’s content at runtime by modifying its `children` property.

### Add actions to the sidebar

You can add actions to the sidebar by setting a tab group’s `sidebarActions` property. These actions function like buttons that you place inside the tab group.

// Create the action.
let refreshAction = UIAction(title: "Refresh", image: UIImage(systemName: "arrow.clockwise")) { _ in
myAction()
}

// Assign the action.
sectionOne.sidebarActions = [refreshAction]

To support swipe actions or context menus, assign a delegate to your sidebar that adopts the `UITabBarController.Sidebar.Delegate` protocol, and implement the following optional methods:

- `tabBarController(_:sidebar:leadingSwipeActionsConfigurationFor:)`

- `tabBarController(_:sidebar:trailingSwipeActionsConfigurationFor:)`

- `tabBarController(_:sidebar:contextMenuConfigurationFor:)`

To support drag-and-drop operations, assign a delegate to your tab bar that adopts the `UITabBarControllerDelegate` protocol, and implement the `tabBarController(_:tab:operationForAcceptingItemsFrom:)` and `tabBarController(_:tab:acceptItemsFrom:)` methods.

### Enable customization

With the new tab bar and sidebar, people can customize the content in both. The system provides a button to put the bars into edit mode. While editing, people can:

- Drag items from the sidebar to the tab bar to add them to the tab bar.

- Drag items from the tab bar to remove them from the tab bar.

- Drag items to reorder them in the tab bar.

- Drag items to reorder them inside their tab group.

- Uncheck items in the sidebar to hide them. This also removes them from the tab bar.

The system automatically persists any customizations that someone makes to the bars. You can implement the `tabBarController(_:displayOrderDidChangeFor:)` and `tabBarController(_:visibilityDidChangeFor:)` delegate methods to receive notifications about the changes.

By default, only the top-level tabs appear in the tab bar. People can add or remove any tab in the sidebar, but can’t hide or reorder the items in it.

To control which items appear in the tab bar, and how people can customize them, set the `UITab` object’s `preferredPlacement` property. Conceptually, you can think of the tab bar as having three different regions:

- Fixed tabs appear on the leading edge of the tab bar.

- Default, optional, and movable tabs appear after the fixed tabs.

- Pinned tabs are always visible on the trailing edge, and only show the tab’s image.

When possible, make tabs customizable so that people can choose which ones to place in the tab bar. If you have any tabs that are central to your app, consider making them fixed tabs, so that people can’t remove or move them. Use pinned tabs for prominent items, like search. Also, because pinned tabs only display the tab icon, be sure to select an image that people recognize and can easily understand.

To create an item that appears in the sidebar, but that people can’t add to the tab bar, set the `preferredPlacement` property to `UITab.Placement.sidebarOnly`. To create an item that people can add to or remove from the sidebar, set its `allowsHiding` property to `true`. If someone removes an item from the sidebar, the system also removes it from the tab bar.

// Create the tab.
var customizeableItem = UITab(
title: "Optional",
image: UIImage(systemName: "questionmark.app"),
identifier: "Optional Item"
) { _ in
MyOptionalViewController()
}

// Let people add and remove this item in the sidebar.
customizeableItem.allowsHiding = true

// Set the item as hidden in the sidebar by default.
customizeableItem.isHiddenByDefault = true

To let people reorganize items within a tab group, set the group’s `allowsReordering` property to `true`.

sectionOne.allowsReordering = true

You can also programmatically set the order of items in a tab group using its `displayOrderIdentifiers` property. By default, the system sets the tab group’s order based on its `children` property.

### Use the tab bar and sidebar on other platforms

The new `UITab` API is also available in iOS 18, Mac Catalyst 18, tvOS 18, and visionOS 2, and later. Consider using this API to create tab bars on all UIKit-based projects.

The new tab bar and sidebar only appear on iPad. On iPhone and Apple TV, the system displays the platform’s regular tab bar. For Mac Catalyst, it displays a tab bar if the tab bar controller’s `mode` property is `UITabBarController.Mode.tabBar`, and a sidebar if it’s `UITabBarController.Mode.tabSidebar`.

In visionOS, the system displays the platform’s regular tabs, but a `UITabGroup` can display a sidebar when it displays the group’s view controller.

Sample Code

# Supporting desktop-class features in your iPad app

Enhance your iPad app by adding desktop-class features and document support.

Download

Xcode 15.0+

## Overview

This sample project shows how to build an app that takes full advantage of the iPad’s desktop-class features like hardware keyboard and trackpad support, Stage Manager, and rich document-editing capabilities. The app is a markup document editor that allows creating, editing, previewing, and saving documents, including features like a title menu with custom actions, document renaming, Find and Replace, and more.

### Choose the appropriate navigation style

Because the app allows focused viewing and editing of individual documents, it uses the `UINavigationItem.ItemStyle.editor` navigation style. This navigation style moves the navigation item’s title to the leading edge and opens up space in the center of the bar for common document actions. To choose the navigation style, the editor view controller assigns the navigation item’s `style` property.

### Add center items for quick access to common actions

Center item groups are groups of controls that appear in the navigation bar to provide quick access to the app’s most important capabilities. A person can customize the navigation bar’s center items by moving, removing, or adding certain groups. To enable user customization, the app assigns a string to the navigation item’s `customizationIdentifier` property.

// Set a `customizationIdentifier` and add center item groups.
navigationItem.customizationIdentifier = "editorViewCustomization"

The editor view controller configures center items and assigns them to the navigation item’s `centerItemGroups` property in `configureCenterItemGroups()`. The editor view controller creates one fixed group that people can’t move or remove from the navigation bar for the Sync Scrolling item using `creatingFixedGroup()`.

UIBarButtonItem(primaryAction: UIAction(title: "Sync Scrolling", image: syncScrollingImage) { [unowned self] action in
syncScrolling.toggle()
if let barButtonItem = action.sender as? UIBarButtonItem {
barButtonItem.image = syncScrollingImage
}
}).creatingFixedGroup(),

Other center item groups are optional, which means people can customize their placement in the navigation bar. Optional groups that have `isInDefaultCustomization` set to `false` don’t appear in the navigation bar by default. They appear in the customization popover that a person can access by choosing the customization option in the overflow menu.

UIBarButtonItem(primaryAction: UIAction(title: "Strikethrough", image: UIImage(systemName: "strikethrough")) { [unowned self] _ in
insertTag(.strikethrough)
}).creatingOptionalGroup(customizationIdentifier: "strikethrough", isInDefaultCustomization: false),

### Add a title menu with system and custom actions

A title menu appears when a person taps the navigation item’s title. This menu can surface actions that are relevant to the current document. To configure a title menu, the editor view controller assigns a closure to the navigation item’s `titleMenuProvider` property.

navigationItem.titleMenuProvider = { suggested in
let custom = [\
UIMenu(title: "Export…", image: UIImage(systemName: "arrow.up.forward.square"), children: [\
UIAction(title: "HTML", image: UIImage(systemName: "safari")) { [unowned self] _ in\
previewView.exportAsWebArchive(named: document.localizedName, presenter: self)\
},\
UIAction(title: "PDF", image: UIImage(systemName: "doc.richtext")) { [unowned self] _ in\
previewView.exportAsPDF(named: document.localizedName, presenter: self)\
}\
])\
]
return UIMenu(children: suggested + custom)
}

The closure returns a menu that combines the suggested system actions and custom actions. The first set of actions in the menu are the `suggested` actions that the system passes in to the closure, including Move and Duplicate. The next set of actions are the `custom` actions that the app defines: exporting the document to HTML and PDF.

### Configure a document header

A document header displays helpful information about the current document, such as its title, file type, and size. It also provides a place from which to share or drag and drop the document. To display a document header at the top of the title menu, the editor view controller assigns a `UIDocumentProperties` object to the navigation item’s `documentProperties` property.

### Enable the system Find and Replace experience

The editor view supports editing the content of the document. Because the editor view is a subclass of `UITextView`, enabling the system Find and Replace experience takes one line of code.

// Enable Find and Replace in editor text view and register as its
// delegate.
editorTextView.isFindInteractionEnabled = true

Setting the `isFindInteractionEnabled` property enables using standard keyboard shortcuts to find text in a document and quickly replace it using the system-provided Find panel.

### Enhance multiple-item selection

The outline view is a collection view that serves as a table of contents for the document, allowing for quick navigation or taking actions on the top-level tags in the document. This view supports an enhanced multiple-selection experience when a person interacts with the app using a keyboard and pointer. The outline view enables lightweight multiple selection of the tags without placing the collection view into editing mode by setting `allowsMultipleSelection`, `allowsFocus`, and `selectionFollowsFocus` to `true`.

// Enable multiple selection.
collectionView.allowsMultipleSelection = true

// Enable keyboard focus.
collectionView.allowsFocus = true

// Allow keyboard focus to drive selection.
collectionView.selectionFollowsFocus = true

A person can use the keyboard and pointer to select tags, and perform a secondary click to open a context menu with relevant actions. The outline view presents a specialized context menu according to the number of tags in the selection by implementing `collectionView(_:contextMenuConfigurationForItemsAt:point:)` to return different configurations when the selection contains one or many tags.

// Action titles for a multiple-item menu.
hideTitle = "Hide Selected"
deleteTitle = "Delete Selected"
} else {
// Action titles for a single-item menu.
hideTitle = "Hide"
deleteTitle = "Delete"
}

### Perform a primary action when tapping a single item

In addition to performing a secondary click on a tag in the outline view, a person can tap a single tag to scroll to its corresponding location in the editor view. To distinguish the explicit user action of tapping one tag to navigate to that location in the document from selecting multiple tags, the outline view implements `collectionView(_:performPrimaryActionForItemAt:)`. The system calls this method when a person taps a single tag without extending a multiple selection of tags.

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, performPrimaryActionForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
// Get the element at the `indexPath`.
if let element = dataSource.itemIdentifier(for: indexPath) {
delegate?.outline(self, didChoose: element)
}

// Wait a short amount of time before deselecting the cell for visual clarity.
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.2) {
collectionView.deselectItem(at: indexPath, animated: true)
}
}

# Multitasking on iPad

Implement multitasking APIs to seamlessly integrate your app with iPadOS.

## Overview

While your app’s scene runs in the foreground on iPad, other apps are likely to be running alongside it. Being aware of the environment your app may be running in and adopting the multitasking APIs are an essential part of integrating your apps with iPadOS.

The first step to creating a great multitasking experience for your users is to ensure your app’s scenes can adapt to different window sizes. Start by reading the Adaptivity and Layout section of the Human Interface Guidelines. Also, consider that your app may not be running full screen, but in a smaller window through Slide Over or Split View. Discover your app’s environment with `UITraitCollection` and adapt to it by using Auto Layout, or by overriding `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` in your view controllers or views.

You can choose to allow multiple scenes in your app’s UI to run concurrently by setting the `UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes` property list key. Implement Scenes and read Managing your app’s life cycle for an overview of how `UISceneDelegate` interacts with the system multitasking events. For information on adopting the scene-based life cycle, see TN3187: Migrating to the UIKit scene-based life cycle.

Design your app’s scenes to display correctly in any interface orientation. In situations where you want to lock the app’s interface to its current orientation, call `setNeedsUpdateOfPrefersInterfaceOrientationLocked()`, then return `true` as the value of `prefersInterfaceOrientationLocked`, or override `childViewControllerForInterfaceOrientationLock` to delegate the decision to a child view controller. Implement `windowScene(_:didUpdateEffectiveGeometry:)` to observe orientation changes, as the system might change the interface orientation even if you signal a preference to lock it. The preference to lock the interface orientation lasts until your app stops presenting the scene, or you call `setNeedsUpdateOfPrefersInterfaceOrientationLocked()` again and return `false` as the value of `prefersInterfaceOrientationLocked`.

Protocol

# UIGuidedAccessRestrictionDelegate

A set of methods you use to add custom restrictions for the Guided Access feature in iOS.

tvOS

@MainActor
protocol UIGuidedAccessRestrictionDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

Custom restrictions are represented by string identifiers provided by the developer in the `guidedAccessRestrictionIdentifiers` method. Each identifier represents an operation in the app that the developer wishes to allow users to restrict using Guided Access. The default for all operations is allow. Users can deny operations using the normal Guided Access user interface. See for a description of how to enable and configure Guided Access on iOS.

Apps describe their custom restrictions by implementing the `textForGuidedAccessRestriction(withIdentifier:)` and `detailTextForGuidedAccessRestriction(withIdentifier:)` methods to return appropriate localized, human-readable strings.

For example, a photo editing app might allow users to disable deleting photos. The app would return an identifier representing this restriction in its `guidedAccessRestrictionIdentifiers` method. It would also implement `textForGuidedAccessRestriction(withIdentifier:)` to provide a human-readable description of the restriction. Finally, the app would implement `guidedAccessRestriction(withIdentifier:didChange:)` to notice when a user indicates that they want to enable the restriction. When the app sees the state change to “deny”, it would configure itself to prevent the deletion of photos by any means. Similarly, when the app sees the state change to “allow”, it would configure itself to allow photo deletion.

Apps can use the `guidedAccessRestrictionState(forIdentifier:)` function to check the state of a restriction at any time.

## Topics

- App and environment
- Updating your app from 32-bit to 64-bit architecture

# Updating your app from 32-bit to 64-bit architecture

Ensure that your app behaves as expected by adapting it to support later versions of the operating system.

## Overview

In iOS 11 and later, all apps use the 64-bit architecture. If your app targets an earlier version of iOS, you must update it to run on later versions.

### Update your app to the latest SDK

Begin by updating your existing app to iOS 11 or later. By updating your app first, you can remove deprecated code paths, address any compiler warnings, and search your code for specific 64-bit issues.

1. Install the latest version of Xcode and open your project. Xcode prompts you to _modernize_ the project. Modernizing adds new warnings and errors that are important when compiling your app for 64-bit architecture.

2. Update your project settings to support the latest version of iOS. You can’t build a 64-bit project if it targets an iOS version earlier than iOS 5.1.

3. Change the Architectures build setting in your project to Standard Architectures.

4. Update your app to support the 64-bit runtime environment. The new compiler warnings and errors help guide you through this process.

5. Test your app on actual 64-bit hardware. Don’t rely on the Simulator app. Although it can be helpful during development, some changes, such as the function-calling conventions, are visible only when your app is running on a device.

6. Tune your app’s memory performance by using Instruments.

### Audit your code

It’s critical that you review your code for proper pointer usage. Assumptions in pointer sizes can lead to erratic behavior and even crashes. Focus on the following areas:

- Updating data structures. Eliminate assumptions about type size and alignment in structures, and use explicit data types.

- Auditing pointer usage. Adhere to proper casting behaviors and review your methods for allocating memory.

- Managing functions and function pointers **.** Use function prototypes for safety, and review the calling of functions that have variable-length argument lists.

With pointer usage addressed, your app should be stable and you can focus on performance and optimize accordingly:

- Optimizing memory performance. Establish performance tests that measure your use of memory in the context of 64-bit runtime.

- Verifying mathematical calculations. Verify signed values in math operations to ensure accurate results, and review your use of bit mask operations.

func UIApplicationMain(
_ argc: Int32,

_ principalClassName: String?,
_ delegateClassName: String?

## Parameters

`argc`

The count of arguments in `argv`; this usually is the corresponding parameter to `main`.

`argv`

A variable list of arguments; this usually is the corresponding parameter to `main`.

`principalClassName`

The name of the `UIApplication` class or subclass. If you specify `nil`, `UIApplication` is assumed.

`delegateClassName`

The name of the class from which the application delegate is instantiated. If `principalClassName` designates a subclass of `UIApplication`, you may designate the subclass as the delegate; the subclass instance receives the application-delegate messages. Specify `nil` if you load the delegate object from your application’s main nib file.

## Return Value

Even though an integer return type is specified, this function never returns. When users exits an iOS app by pressing the Home button, the application moves to the background.

## Mentioned in

About the app launch sequence

## Discussion

This function instantiates the application object from the principal class and instantiates the delegate (if any) from the given class and sets the delegate for the application. It also sets up the main event loop, including the application’s run loop, and begins processing events. If the application’s `Info.plist` file specifies a main nib file to be loaded, by including the `NSMainNibFile` key and a valid nib file name for the value, this function loads that nib file.

Despite the declared return type, this function never returns.

## Overview

The Document Picker View Controller extension can perform _import_ and _export_ operations on its own. If you want to support _open_ and _move_ operations, you must pair it with a File Provider extension.

When creating a Document Picker extension, you must subclass `UIDocumentPickerExtensionViewController` to provide the document picker’s user interface. Your subclass presents a list of available documents and destinations to the user. When the user makes a selection, you trigger the file transfer and pass the selected URL .

## Topics

Configuring open access for a custom keyboard

## Overview

To create a custom keyboard, first subclass the `UIInputViewController` class, then add your keyboard’s user interface to the `inputView` property of your subclass. In Xcode, you can start a custom keyboard by choosing the Custom Keyboard target template.

A custom keyboard can respond to user input events in the following ways:

- Add text in the form of an unattributed `NSString` object at the insertion point in the current text input object, by calling the `insertText(_:)` method on the `textDocumentProxy` property. This property provides that method through its conformance to the `UIKeyInput` protocol

- Delete text in a backward direction, starting at the insertion point, by calling the `deleteBackward()` method on the `textDocumentProxy` property.

- Switch to another keyboard in the set of user-enabled keyboards, by calling the `advanceToNextInputMode()` method.

- Dismiss the keyboard, by calling the `dismissKeyboard()` method.

Obtain textual context around the insertion point by reading the `textDocumentProxy` properties `documentContextBeforeInput` and `documentContextAfterInput`. To find out if the current text input object is empty, call the `hasText` method on the `textDocumentProxy` property. You can employ this textual context by considering it along with user input, to offer context-sensitive output to a document from your keyboard.

An input view controller conforms to the `UITextInputDelegate` protocol, allowing you to respond to changes in document content and position of the insertion point.

To present an appropriate keyboard layout, respond to the current text input object’s `UIKeyboardType` property. For each keyboard type trait you support, change the contents of your primary view accordingly.

For more about creating a custom keyboard, read Custom Keyboard in App Extension Programming Guide.

# Creating a Mac version of your iPad app

Bring your iPad app to macOS with Mac Catalyst.

## Overview

With Xcode 11 and later, you can create a Mac version of your iPad app using Mac Catalyst. Configuring your app for Mac can take just a click in a checkbox, although you may need more steps, depending on the features and frameworks that your app uses.

### Configure your app for Mac

To add support for Mac, open your Xcode project and select the iOS target that you want to configure. In the General tab, under Deployment Info, select the Mac checkbox. (If your app supports iPhone only, the checkbox is unavailable.)

When you enable Mac support, Xcode adds the `App Sandbox Entitlement` to your project. Xcode only includes this entitlement in the Mac version of your app, not the iOS version. Xcode also adds My Mac to the list of destinations. Select this destination to run your Mac app from Xcode.

At this point, you may be able to build and run the Mac version of your app. To give it a try, select My Mac as the destination and run your project.

### Go beyond the checkbox

You may find that the Mac version of your app still doesn’t build because:

- Your project includes incompatible frameworks, libraries, or embedded content.

- Your source code references unsupported APIs.

When you enable Mac support, Xcode automatically excludes incompatible frameworks and embedded content where possible for Mac builds of your project. Still, you may need to manually exclude other frameworks or content.

To manually exclude an item, open Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content under the General tab for your iOS target. Then select iOS as the platform setting for the item. This setting excludes the item from the Mac version of your app.

If you have source code referencing APIs unavailable to the Mac version of your app, enclose the code in a compilation conditional block that uses the `targetEnvironment()` (Swift) or `TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST` (Objective-C) platform condition.

#if !targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)
// Code to exclude from Mac.
#endif

#if !TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST
#endif

You can use these same approaches to include a framework and code that are available only in macOS. For a framework, select macOS for the platform setting, and enclose the code with a `#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)` (Swift) or `#if TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST` (Objective-C) statement.

### Make your app more like a Mac app

After following these steps, you should be able to run your iPad app on Mac. But before you ship your new app to customers, it needs a few more changes to make it more like a Mac app. To learn more, see Optimizing your iPad app for Mac.

- UIKit
- Mac Catalyst
- Choosing a user interface idiom for your Mac app

Article

# Choosing a user interface idiom for your Mac app

Select the iPad or the Mac user interface idiom in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst.

## Overview

A Mac app built with Mac Catalyst can run in either `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.pad` or `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac` user interface idioms. To choose the idiom in which your app runs, select from the following options after you turn on Mac Catalyst in your Xcode project:

Scale Interface to Match iPad

Run your app in the `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.pad` idiom. Select this option to quickly bring your iPad app to the Mac.

Optimize Interface for Mac

Run your app in the `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac` idiom. Select this option to show controls that look and behave like those available in AppKit.

### Start with the iPad idiom

By default, Xcode selects Scale Interface to Match iPad after you turn on Mac Catalyst. This option provides a simplified approach for bringing your iPad app to the Mac. Your Mac app runs in the `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.pad` idiom, which tells macOS to scale the app’s user interface to match the Mac display environment while preserving iPad-like appearance and view metrics.

When testing your app you may find that adopting controls that look and behave like those in AppKit or providing crisper-looking text can enhance the user experience of your app. If this is the case, change to the `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac` by selecting Optimize Interface for Mac. However, selecting this option may require you to make additional changes to your app.

### Update your app to use the Mac idiom

Choosing Optimize Interface for Mac means your Mac app runs in the `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac` user interface idiom, which changes the interface of your app. Some controls change their size and appearance, and interacting with them feels identical to interacting with AppKit controls. For example, `UIButton` appears identical to `NSButton`.

Because the system sets control sizes appropriately when the user interface idiom is `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac`, the system no longer needs to scale your app’s interface to match Mac sizing. Screen points are identical in size to those in AppKit-based apps. However, if your app has hard-coded sizes or uses images sized for iPad, you may need to update your app to accommodate the size differences. You may also need to adjust auto layout constraints.

Some controls provide additional settings that help you achieve a more Mac-like appearance. For instance, `UISwitch` can appear as a checkbox when idiom is `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac` by setting `preferredStyle` to `UISwitch.Style.checkbox`. Then set `title` to the text of the checkbox.

let showFavoritesAtTop = UISwitch()
showFavoritesAtTop.preferredStyle = .checkbox
if traitCollection.userInterfaceIdiom == .mac {
showFavoritesAtTop.title = "Always show favorite recipes at the top"
}

`UIPageControl`, `UIRefreshControl`, and `UIStepper` aren’t available to apps running in the Mac idiom. If you attempt to display these controls in a view, your app throws an exception. Replace these controls with similar functionality when the user interface idiom is `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac`. For example, replace `UIRefreshControl` with a Refresh menu item by creating a `UIKeyCommand` object with the title “Refresh” and the keyboard shortcut Command-R. Then add the command to your app’s menu system. For more information, see Adding menus and shortcuts to the menu bar and user interface.

### Determine the current user interface idiom

To determine if your app is running in the Mac idiom, compare the value of the `userInterfaceIdiom` property with `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac`. When the comparison is `true`, you can tailor the behavior of your app for the Mac; for example, to display a different child view.

let childViewController: UIViewController
if traitCollection.userInterfaceIdiom == .mac {
childViewController = MacOptimizedChildViewController()
} else {
childViewController = ChildViewController()
}
addChild(childViewController)
childViewController.view.frame = view.bounds
view.addSubview(childViewController.view)
childViewController.didMove(toParent: self)

### Set the preferred behavioral style

When adopting the Mac idiom, some controls such as `UIButton` and `UISlider` appear identical to their AppKit counterparts. However, there may be situations where you want to take advantage of the Mac idiom in your app but keep a control’s iPad appearance and behavior. For instance, consider an iPad app that displays a slider with a custom thumb image. By default, the Mac version of the app, built with Mac Catalyst, displays a standard macOS slider when the user interface idiom is `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac`.

To provide a slider with an appearance that’s consistent in both iPad and Mac versions of the app, set the `preferredBehavioralStyle` of the slider to `UIBehavioralStyle.pad`. This behavioral style tells the slider to behave as if the user interface idiom is `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.pad` even though the app is using the Mac idiom.

Remember, macOS doesn’t scale the interface of apps that use the Mac idiom so you may need to update your app to accommodate size differences even when the preferred behavioral style is `UIBehavioralStyle.pad`. For example, a slider with a custom thumb image may need an image of a different size for the Mac app than the one used in the iPad app.

let slider = UISlider()
slider.minimumValue = 0
slider.maximumValue = 1
slider.value = 0.5
slider.preferredBehavioralStyle = .pad

if slider.traitCollection.userInterfaceIdiom == .mac {
slider.setThumbImage(#imageLiteral(resourceName: "customSliderThumbMac"), for: .normal)
} else {
slider.setThumbImage(#imageLiteral(resourceName: "customSliderThumb"), for: .normal)
}

There are some properties and methods of `UIButton` and `UISlider` not supported in the Mac idiom when the behavioral style is `UIBehavioralStyle.mac`, and calling these throws an exception; for example, setting a button’s title or image for any control state other than `normal`, and setting a slider’s thumb image, minimum or maximum track image, tint color, or value image. However, these properties and methods are available for use in the Mac idiom when the control’s behavioral style is `UIBehavioralStyle.pad`.

### Provide a different code path

Even when your Mac app runs in the `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.pad` idiom, you may need to change the appearance or behavior of your Mac app. Use the `targetEnvironment()` compilation conditional to choose a different code path depending on the target environment.

For example, if your iPad app displays a delete item confirmation in a popover next to a delete button but you want to display the confirmation as an alert in your Mac app, add a `targetEnvironment()` conditional to determine the preferred style of the alert controller.

let deleteAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Delete", style: .destructive) { (action) in
if dataStore.delete(recipe) {
self.recipe = nil
}
}

let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel, handler: nil)

#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)
let preferredStyle = UIAlertController.Style.alert
#else
let preferredStyle = UIAlertController.Style.actionSheet
#endif

let alert = UIAlertController(title: "Are you sure you want to delete \(recipe.title)?", message: nil, preferredStyle: preferredStyle)
alert.addAction(deleteAction)
alert.addAction(cancelAction)

if let popoverPresentationController = alert.popoverPresentationController {
popoverPresentationController.barButtonItem = sender as? UIBarButtonItem

# Optimizing your iPad app for Mac

Make your iPad app more like a Mac app by taking advantage of system features in macOS.

## Overview

The Mac version of your iPad app supports many system features found in macOS without requiring any effort from you, including:

- A default menu bar for your app

- Support for trackpad, mouse, and keyboard input

- Support for window resizing and full-screen display

- Mac-style scroll bars

- Copy-and-paste support

- Drag-and-drop support

- Support for system Touch Bar controls

You can, however, extend your app to take advantage of even more system features.

### Add menu bar items

The Mac version of your app comes with a standard menu bar. Customize it by adding and removing menu items using `UIMenuBuilder`. To learn more, see Adding menus and shortcuts to the menu bar and user interface.

### Show a Preferences window

Mac apps typically let users manage app-specific settings by displaying a Preferences window. Users see this window by selecting the app menu followed by the Preferences menu item in the menu bar. If your app has a Settings bundle, the system automatically provides your app with a preferences window. To learn more, see Displaying a Preferences window.

### Apply a translucent background to your primary view controller

iPad apps using a split view controller get a Mac-style vertical split view when running in macOS. But to make your iPad app look more at home on Mac, apply a translucent effect that blurs the desktop into the primary view controller’s background. To do this, set your split view controller’s `primaryBackgroundStyle` to `UISplitViewController.BackgroundStyle.sidebar`, as shown in the following code.

let splitViewController = window!.rootViewController as! UISplitViewController
let navigationController = splitViewController.viewControllers[splitViewController.viewControllers.count-1] as! UINavigationController
navigationController.topViewController!.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = splitViewController.displayModeButtonItem

// Add a translucent background to the primary view controller.
splitViewController.primaryBackgroundStyle = .sidebar

splitViewController.delegate = self

return true
}

### Detect the pointer in a view

Mac users rely on a pointer to interact with apps, whether selecting a text field or moving a window. As the user moves the pointer over UI elements, some elements should change their appearance. For example, a web browser highlights a link as the pointer moves over it.

To detect when the user moves the pointer over a view in your app, add a `UIHoverGestureRecognizer` to that view. This tells your app when the pointer enters or leaves the view, or moves while over it.

class ViewController: UIViewController {

@IBOutlet var button: UIButton!

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

let hover = UIHoverGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(hovering(_:)))
button.addGestureRecognizer(hover)
}

@objc
func hovering(_ recognizer: UIHoverGestureRecognizer) {
switch recognizer.state {
case .began, .changed:
button.titleLabel?.textColor = #colorLiteral(red: 1, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 1)
case .ended:
button.titleLabel?.textColor = UIColor.link
default:
break
}
}
}

# UIKit Catalog: Creating and customizing views and controls

Customize your app’s user interface with views and controls.

Download

Xcode 13.1+

## Overview

This sample guides you through several types of customizations you can make in your iOS app. It is built with Mac Catalyst, which means the sample runs on both iOS and macOS. The sample uses a split-view controller architecture to navigate UIKit views and controls. The primary view controller ( `OutlineViewController`) shows the available views and controls. When you select one, `OutlineViewController` shows the secondary view controller associated with it.

The name of each secondary view controller reflects its target item. For example, the `AlertControllerViewController` class shows how to use a `UIAlertController` object. The only exceptions to this rule are `UISearchBar` and `UIToolbar`; the sample demonstrates these APIs in multiple view controllers to explain how their controls function and how to customize them. To demonstrate how to manage the complexity of your storyboards, the app hosts all view controllers in a separate storyboard and loads each as it’s when needed.

This sample demonstrates the following views and controls; several of which are referenced in the sections below:

- `UIActivityIndicatorView`

- `UIAlertController`

- `UIButton`

- `UIButton.PointerStyleProvider`

- `UIDatePicker`

- `UIPickerView`

- `UIColorPickerViewController`

- `UIColorWell`

- `UIFontPickerViewController`

- `UIImagePickerController`

- `UIImageView`

- UIImageView with SF Symbols

- `UIPageControl`

- `UIProgressView`

- `UISearchBar`

- `UISegmentedControl`

- `UISlider`

- `UIStackView`

- `UIStepper`

- `UISwitch`

- `UITextField`

- `UITextFormattingCoordinator`

- `UITextView`

- `UIToolbar`

- `UIVisualEffect`

- `WKWebView`

### Configure the sample code project

In Xcode, select your development team on the iOS-Mac target’s Signing and Capabilities tab.

### Customize the look of buttons with button configurations

You can customize the appearance and behavior of a UIButton by using `UIButton.Configuration`. This sample uses a `filled()` configuration so that the button draws with a red background color:

var config = UIButton.Configuration.filled()
config.background.backgroundColor = .systemRed
button.configuration = config

### Display a custom alert

`AlertControllerViewController` demonstrates several techniques to display modal alerts and action sheets from an interface. The configuration process is similar for all alerts:

1. Determine the message to display in the alert.

2. Create and configure a `UIAlertController` object.

3. Add handlers for actions the user may take.

4. Present the alert controller.

The `showSimpleAlert` function uses the `NSLocalizedString` function to retrieve the alert messages in the user’s preferred language. The `showSimpleAlert` function uses those strings to create and configure the `UIAlertController` object. Although the button in the alert has the title OK, the sample uses a cancel action to ensure that the alert controller applies the proper styling to the button:

func showSimpleAlert() {
let title = NSLocalizedString("A Short Title is Best", comment: "")
let message = NSLocalizedString("A message needs to be a short, complete sentence.", comment: "")
let cancelButtonTitle = NSLocalizedString("OK", comment: "")

let alertController = UIAlertController(title: title, message: message, preferredStyle: .alert)

// Create the action.
let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: cancelButtonTitle, style: .cancel) { _ in
Swift.debugPrint("The simple alert's cancel action occurred.")
}

// Add the action.
alertController.addAction(cancelAction)

present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

### Customize the appearance of sliders

This sample demonstrates different ways to display a `UISlider`, a control to select a single value from a continuous range of values. Customize the appearance of a slider by assigning stretchable images for left-side tracking, right-side tracking, and the thumb. In this example, the track image is stretchable and is one pixel wide. Make the track images wider to provide rounded corners, but be sure to set these images’ `capInsets` property to allow for the corners.

The `configureCustomSlider` function sets up a custom slider:

@available(iOS 15.0, *)
func configureCustomSlider(slider: UISlider) {
/** To keep the look the same betwen iOS and macOS:
For setMinimumTrackImage, setMaximumTrackImage, setThumbImage to work in Mac Catalyst, use UIBehavioralStyle as ".pad",
Available in macOS 12 or later (Mac Catalyst 15.0 or later).
Use this for controls that need to look the same between iOS and macOS.
*/
if traitCollection.userInterfaceIdiom == .mac {
slider.preferredBehavioralStyle = .pad
}

let leftTrackImage = UIImage(named: "slider_blue_track")
slider.setMinimumTrackImage(leftTrackImage, for: .normal)

let rightTrackImage = UIImage(named: "slider_green_track")
slider.setMaximumTrackImage(rightTrackImage, for: .normal)

// Set the sliding thumb image (normal and highlighted).
//
// For fun, choose a different image symbol configuraton for the thumb's image between macOS and iOS.
var thumbImageConfig: UIImage.SymbolConfiguration
if slider.traitCollection.userInterfaceIdiom == .mac {
thumbImageConfig = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(scale: .large)
} else {
thumbImageConfig = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(pointSize: 30, weight: .heavy, scale: .large)
}
let thumbImage = UIImage(systemName: "circle.fill", withConfiguration: thumbImageConfig)
slider.setThumbImage(thumbImage, for: .normal)

let thumbImageHighlighted = UIImage(systemName: "circle", withConfiguration: thumbImageConfig)
slider.setThumbImage(thumbImageHighlighted, for: .highlighted)

// Set the rest of the slider's attributes.
slider.minimumValue = 0
slider.maximumValue = 100
slider.isContinuous = false
slider.value = 84

slider.addTarget(self, action: #selector(SliderViewController.sliderValueDidChange(_:)), for: .valueChanged)
}

### Add a search bar to an interface

Use a `UISearchBar` to receive search-related information from the user. There are various ways to customize the look of the search bar:

- Add a cancel button.

- Add a bookmark button.

- Set the bookmark image, both normal and highlighted states.

- Change the tint color that applies to key elements in the search bar.

- Set the search bar’s background image.

The `configureSearchBar` function sets up a custom search bar:

func configureSearchBar() {
searchBar.showsCancelButton = true
searchBar.showsBookmarkButton = true

searchBar.tintColor = UIColor.systemPurple

searchBar.backgroundImage = UIImage(named: "search_bar_background")

// Set the bookmark image for both normal and highlighted states.
let bookImage = UIImage(systemName: "bookmark")
searchBar.setImage(bookImage, for: .bookmark, state: .normal)

let bookFillImage = UIImage(systemName: "bookmark.fill")
searchBar.setImage(bookFillImage, for: .bookmark, state: .highlighted)
}

### Customize the appearance of toolbars

This sample shows how to customize a `UIToolbar`, a specialized view that displays one or more buttons along the bottom edge of an interface. Customize a toolbar by determining its bar style (black or default), translucency, tint color, and background color.

The following `viewDidLoad` function in `CustomToolbarViewController` sets up a tinted tool bar:

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

// See the `UIBarStyle` enum for more styles, including `.Default`.
toolbar.barStyle = .black
toolbar.isTranslucent = false

toolbar.tintColor = UIColor.systemGreen
toolbar.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemBlue

let toolbarButtonItems = [\
refreshBarButtonItem,\
flexibleSpaceBarButtonItem,\
actionBarButtonItem\
]
toolbar.setItems(toolbarButtonItems, animated: true)
}

`CustomToolbarViewController` demonstrates further customization by changing the toolbar’s background image:

let toolbarBackgroundImage = UIImage(named: "toolbar_background")
toolbar.setBackgroundImage(toolbarBackgroundImage, forToolbarPosition: .bottom, barMetrics: .default)

let toolbarButtonItems = [\
customImageBarButtonItem,\
flexibleSpaceBarButtonItem,\
customBarButtonItem\
]
toolbar.setItems(toolbarButtonItems, animated: true)
}

### Add a page control interface

Use a `UIPageControl` to structure an app’s user interface. A _page control_ is a specialized control that displays a horizontal series of dots, each of which corresponds to a page in the app’s document or other data-model entity. Customize a page control by setting its tint color for all the page-indicator dots, and for the current page-indicator dot.

The `configurePageControl` function sets up a customized page control:

func configurePageControl() {
// The total number of available pages is based on the number of available colors.
pageControl.numberOfPages = colors.count
pageControl.currentPage = 2

pageControl.pageIndicatorTintColor = UIColor.systemGreen
pageControl.currentPageIndicatorTintColor = UIColor.systemPurple

pageControl.addTarget(self, action: #selector(PageControlViewController.pageControlValueDidChange), for: .valueChanged)
}

### Add menus to controls

Attach menus to controls like `UIButton` and `UIBarButtonItem`. Create menus with the `UIAction` class, and attach a menu to each control by setting the `UIMenu` property.

Attach a menu to a `UIButton` as shown here:

button.menu = UIMenu(children: [\
UIAction(title: String(format: NSLocalizedString("ItemTitle", comment: ""), "1"),\
identifier: UIAction.Identifier(ButtonMenuActionIdentifiers.item1.rawValue),\
handler: menuHandler),\
UIAction(title: String(format: NSLocalizedString("ItemTitle", comment: ""), "2"),\
identifier: UIAction.Identifier(ButtonMenuActionIdentifiers.item2.rawValue),\
handler: menuHandler)\
])

button.showsMenuAsPrimaryAction = true

Create a `UIBarButtonItem` with a menu attached as shown here:

var customTitleBarButtonItem: UIBarButtonItem {
let buttonMenu = UIMenu(title: "",
children: (1...5).map {
UIAction(title: "Option \($0)", handler: menuHandler)
})
return UIBarButtonItem(image: UIImage(systemName: "list.number"), menu: buttonMenu)
}

### Add accessibility support to your views

VoiceOver and other system accessibility technologies use the information provided by views and controls to help all users navigate content. UIKit views include default accessibility support. Improve user experience by providing custom accessibility information.

In this UIKitCatalog sample, several view controllers configure the `accessibilityType` and `accessibilityLabel` properties of their associated view. Picker view columns don’t have labels, so the picker view asks its delegate for the corresponding accessibility information:

switch ColorComponent(rawValue: component)! {
case .red:
return NSLocalizedString("Red color component value", comment: "")

case .green:
return NSLocalizedString("Green color component value", comment: "")

case .blue:
return NSLocalizedString("Blue color component value", comment: "")
}
}

### Support Mac Catalyst

This sample app is built with Mac Catalyst, which means the sample runs on both iOS and Mac. This is achieved by selecting the Mac checkbox in Project Settings. For more about how Mac Catalyst works see Mac Catalyst.

When built for Mac Catalyst, this sample achieves:

- Interface Optimization for Mac. With Optimize Interface For the Mac project setting turned on, the app has full control of every pixel on the screen, and the app can adopt more controls specific to Mac. Building the sample for Mac Catalyst makes the app take advantage of the system features in macOS. The option Show Designed for iPad Run Destination allows this sample, as an iPad app, to run as-is on Apple silicon Macs. This requires macOS 11 and a Mac with Apple silicon.

- Navigation and title bar hiding. The sample app hides these to make the app appear more like a Mac app. It also changes other behaviors by using traitCollection’s `userInterfaceIdiom`.

- Translucent background. By setting the split view controller’s `primaryBackgroundStyle` to `.sidebar`, the primary view controller or side bar shows a blurred desktop behind its view. Setting this property has no effect when running on iOS.

# Displaying a checkbox in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst

Present a switch control as a Mac-style checkbox when your app runs in the Mac user interface idiom.

## Overview

A Mac app built with Mac Catalyst that uses the Mac user interface idiom displays a `UISwitch` as a checkbox when the `preferredStyle` value is `UISwitch.Style.automatic` (the default value) or `UISwitch.Style.checkbox`. If your app doesn’t use the `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.mac` idiom, the switch appears as a slider switch. To learn more, see Choosing a user interface idiom for your Mac app.

### Add text to the checkbox

To display text alongside the checkbox, set the `title` property.

let showFavoritesAtTop = UISwitch()
showFavoritesAtTop.title = "Always show favorite recipes at the top"

### Resize the checkbox

A checkbox-style switch has a default frame size of zero. If you’re not using Auto Layout to determine the size and position of the switch, call `sizeToFit()` to resize it so that it uses the appropriate amount of space needed to display the checkbox and its title.

# Removing the title bar in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst

Display content that fills the entire height of a window by removing the title bar.

## Overview

By default, Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst display a title bar across the top of their windows. A horizontal line separates the title bar from the content of the window.

Some Mac apps such as Messages and Contacts have no title bar in their main window. Instead, the top of the window shows only the Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons with no separator between them and the window’s content. In this UI design, the content area fills the entire height of the window.

The following image illustrates these styles in two windows. The first window displays a title bar, while the second has none.

### Remove the title bar

If you choose to design your window without a title bar, you must remove it from the window. To remove the title bar, set the title bar’s `titleVisibility` property to `UITitlebarTitleVisibility.hidden` and the `toolbar` property to `nil`. The following code shows how to remove the title bar and its separator from the window during the setup of a new scene.

func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)
if let titlebar = windowScene.titlebar {
titlebar.titleVisibility = .hidden
titlebar.toolbar = nil
}
#endif

# Adding menus and shortcuts to the menu bar and user interface

Provide quick access to useful actions by adding menus and keyboard shortcuts to your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst.

Download

Xcode 13.1+

## Overview

This sample project demonstrates how to add menu commands and keyboard shortcuts to the menu bar. The sample app uses its `MenuController` object to insert a `UIMenuSystem` object that adds the following menus:

- New: Appears at the beginning of the File menu and contains the two operations New Date Item and New Text Item, which add items to the table view.

- Cities: Contains a group of UICommand and UIKeyCommand objects.

- Navigation: Contains a group of UIKeyCommand objects for command-key navigation.

- Style: Contains a group of UICommand objects that have checkmark states. This grouping looks like a font-style menu for text formatting.

- Tools: Contains a group of UICommand objects.

The sample project also shows you how to add contextual menus to views, and how to handle menu-command selection using `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate`.

### Configure the sample code project

In Xcode, select your development team on the iOS target’s Signing and Capabilities tab.

### Add menus to the menu bar

Create `UIMenu` objects and use them to construct the menus and submenus. This sample adds menus to the menu bar when it runs on macOS, and key command elements in those menus also appear in the discoverability heads-up display (HUD) on iPad when the user presses the command key.

The Mac version of an iPad app comes with a standard menu bar. Use the `UIMenuSystem` class, an object that represents the main or contextual menu system, to modify the menu bar.

The sample uses `UIMenuSystem` to add menus and key commands to the `main` system menu by implementing `buildMenu(with:)` in `AppDelegate`. This function receives a `UIMenuBuilder` object that the sample then uses to add and remove menus. Because menus can exist with no window or view hierarchy, the system only consults `UIApplication` and `UIApplicationDelegate` to build the app’s menu bar.

Menu commands consist of `UICommand`, `UIKeyCommand`, and `UIAction` objects that are grouped in a `UIMenu` container.

### Add menu commands to the file menu

This sample inserts a `UIKeyCommand` called Command-O into the File Menu and creates a corresponding keyboard shortcut:

let openCommand =
UIKeyCommand(title: NSLocalizedString("OpenTitle", comment: ""),
image: nil,
action: #selector(AppDelegate.openAction),
input: "o",
modifierFlags: .command)
let openMenu =
UIMenu(title: "",
image: nil,
identifier: .openMenu,
options: .displayInline,
children: [openCommand])
return openMenu
}

Notice that the `UIKeyCommand` title is a localized string using the `NSLocalizedString` function, which can display the menu name in multiple languages.

This sample inserts the Open command into the middle of the menu bar’s File menu:

builder.insertChild(MenuController.openMenu(), atStartOfMenu: .file)

Mac apps also typically include a Print menu command in the File menu. This sample includes both Print and Export as PDF menu commands in the File Menu. These menu commands are automatically inserted when the `Info.plist` contains the `UIApplicationSupportsPrintCommand` key whose value is set to `true`. The application responds to these print commands by implementing `UIResponder's` `printContent(_ sender: Any?)` function.

### Contribute to the edit menu

Editing operations, such as cut, copy, paste, and delete, are commonly used in most apps. This sample app provides these operations through the Edit menu, where the user can edit the sample’s left-side content or its primary table-view content. These operations represent the first-responder functions `cut(_ sender: Any?)`, `copy(_ sender: Any?)`, `paste(_ sender: Any?)`, `delete(_ sender: Any?)`.

This sample implements `canPerformAction:withSender:` to determine if these edit operations are supported.

if action == #selector(printContent) {
// Allow for printing if a table view cell is selected.
return tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow != nil
} else if action == #selector(newAction(_:)) {
// User wants to perform a New operation.
return true
} else {
switch (tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow, action) {

// These Edit commands are supported.
case let (_?, action) where action == #selector(cut(_:)) ||
action == #selector(copy(_:)) ||
action == #selector(delete(_:)):
return true
case (_?, _):
// Allow the nextResponder to make the determination.
return super.canPerformAction(action, withSender: sender)

// Paste is supported if the pasteboard has text.
case (.none, action) where action == #selector(paste(_:)):
return (UIPasteboard.general.string != nil) ? true :
// Allow the nextResponder to make the determination.
super.canPerformAction(action, withSender: sender)
case (.none, _):
return false
}
}
}

### Add commands to control the user interface

In the sample, you can change the primary or left-side table view’s selection by using `UIKeyCommand`. These key commands are connected to the up and down arrow keys and are added directly to the table view. The following example shows how to add the down arrow key as a `UIKeyCommand`:

let downArrowCommand =
UIKeyCommand(input: UIKeyCommand.inputDownArrow,
modifierFlags: [],
action: #selector(PrimaryViewController.downArrowAction(_:)))
addKeyCommand(downArrowCommand)

The sample also demonstrates how to add menu commands as command-key equivalents. The following example shows how to create a menu with all four arrow keys as command keys:

let keyCommands = [ UIKeyCommand.inputRightArrow,\
UIKeyCommand.inputLeftArrow,\
UIKeyCommand.inputUpArrow,\
UIKeyCommand.inputDownArrow ]
let arrows = Arrows.allCases

let arrowKeyChildrenCommands = zip(keyCommands, arrows).map { (command, arrow) in
UIKeyCommand(title: arrow.localizedString(),
image: nil,
action: #selector(AppDelegate.navigationMenuAction(_:)),
input: command,
modifierFlags: .command,
propertyList: [CommandPListKeys.ArrowsKeyIdentifier: arrow.rawValue])
}

let arrowKeysGroup = UIMenu(title: "",

children: arrowKeyChildrenCommands)

return UIMenu(title: NSLocalizedString("NavigationTitle", comment: ""),
image: nil,
identifier: .navMenu,
options: [],
children: [arrowKeysGroup])
}

### Display contextual menus

The sample displays a contextual menu through the use of `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate`, an interaction object used to display relevant actions for the content.

For macOS, the user control-clicks or right-clicks the `DetailViewController`. For iPadOS, the user taps and holds the `DetailViewController`. The sample uses `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate` to display Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Rename, and Share commands. This kind of contextual menu is a grouping of `UIAction` objects. `UIAction` is a menu element that performs its action in a closure. In iOS, optionally customize this contextual menu’s highlight preview by using `contextMenuInteraction(_:previewForHighlightingMenuWithConfiguration:)`. This delegate function returns a primary view controller. Override this function to enable menu commands based on the table view state or the state of the pasteboard.

### Adjust the style menu

The sample implements `validate(_:)`, where it can adjust the Style menu as the user selects between one or more font styles: plain, bold, italic, underline.

// The font style menu item check marks used in the Style menu.

// Update the state of a given command by adjusting the Style menu.
// Note: Only command groups that are added will be called to validate.
override func validate(_ command: UICommand) {
// Obtain the plist of the incoming command.

if let fontStyleDict = command.propertyList as? [String: String] {
// Check if the command comes from the Style menu.
if let fontStyle = fontStyleDict[MenuController.CommandPListKeys.StylesIdentifierKey] {
// Update the Style menu command state (checked or unchecked).
command.state = fontMenuStyleStates.contains(fontStyle) ? .on : .off
}
} else {
// Validate the disabled command. This keeps the menu item disabled.
if let commandPlistString = command.propertyList as? String {
if commandPlistString == MenuController.disabledCommand {
command.attributes = .disabled
}
}
}
}

### Add a preferences menu

Mac apps typically display app-specific preferences using a preferences window. The sample adds a preferences window by adding a Settings bundle to the Xcode project’s target. The window automatically becomes available to the user through the Preferences menu command in the Application menu. To learn more about preferences, see Displaying a Preferences window.

# Handling key presses made on a physical keyboard

Detect when someone presses and releases keys on a physical keyboard.

## Overview

In iOS apps and Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst, the system reports key presses that a person makes on a physical keyboard by sending press events to responder objects in the responder chain of the active app.

A responder chain is a linked series of `UIResponder` objects, such as UIViewController and `UIApplication`, that either handle an event or transfer responsibility for handling the event to other responders in the app. To learn more about responders and the responder chain, see Using responders and the responder chain to handle events.

### Detect a key press

To detect a key press that a person makes on a physical keyboard, override `pressesBegan(_:with:)` in a responder object of your app such as the app delegate or main view controller.

To determine what key they pressed, iterate through the set of presses, inspecting the `key` property of each press. Use `charactersIgnoringModifiers` to determine the text value of key, and whether the responder should handle the key press or not. If the responder doesn’t handle the key press, call `pressesBegan(_:with:)` on the superclass to send the press event to the next responder in the active responder chain.

For example, the following code listing handles someone pressing either the left or right arrow.

// Handle someone pressing a key on a physical keyboard.

with event: UIPressesEvent?) {

var didHandleEvent = false

for press in presses {

// Get the pressed key.
guard let key = press.key else { continue }

if key.charactersIgnoringModifiers == UIKeyCommand.inputLeftArrow {
// Someone pressed the left arrow key.
// Respond to the key-press event.
didHandleEvent = true
}
if key.charactersIgnoringModifiers == UIKeyCommand.inputRightArrow {
// Someone pressed the right arrow key.
// Respond to the key-press event.
didHandleEvent = true
}
}

if didHandleEvent == false {
// If someone presses a key that you're not handling,
// pass the event to the next responder.
super.pressesBegan(presses, with: event)
}
}

### Detect a key release

Override the responder’s `pressesEnded(_:with:)` method to detect when someone releases a key. To get information about the key, do the same as you did when detecting a key press; inspect the `key` property of each press in the `presses` set. For example, the following code listing handles someone releasing either the left or right arrow.

// Handle someone releasing a key on a physical keyboard.

// Get the released key.
guard let key = press.key else { continue }

if key.charactersIgnoringModifiers == UIKeyCommand.inputLeftArrow {
// Someone released the left arrow key.
// Respond to the event.
didHandleEvent = true
}
if key.charactersIgnoringModifiers == UIKeyCommand.inputRightArrow {
// Someone released the right arrow key.
// Respond to the event.
didHandleEvent = true
}
}

if didHandleEvent == false {
// If someone releases a key that you're not handling,
// pass the event to the next responder.
super.pressesEnded(presses, with: event)
}
}

A continuous gesture recognizer that interprets pointer movement over a view.

@MainActor
class UIHoverGestureRecognizer

## Mentioned in

Optimizing your iPad app for Mac

## Overview

On macOS and iPadOS devices, a person can move the pointer over user interface elements. For some UI designs, it’s important to know when the pointer moves over an element, with no other user interactions, such as clicking the mouse button. The text for a hyperlink, for instance, may change colors or appear with an underline as the pointer moves over the link. This creates a rollover effect.

To provide this experience in your app, add a hover gesture recognizer that reacts as the pointer moves over the view. Provide the gesture recognizer with a `target` and `action` that the system calls when the pointer enters, exits, and moves across the view. `UIHoverGestureRecognizer` has no effect when your app runs in iOS. The following code changes the button’s default color to red as the pointer moves over the button.

class ViewController: UIViewController {

@IBOutlet var button: UIButton!

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

let hover = UIHoverGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(hovering(_:)))
button.addGestureRecognizer(hover)
}

@objc
func hovering(_ recognizer: UIHoverGestureRecognizer) {
switch recognizer.state {
case .began, .changed:
button.titleLabel?.textColor = #colorLiteral(red: 1, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 1)
case .ended:
button.titleLabel?.textColor = UIColor.link
default:
break
}
}
}

# Displaying a Preferences window

Provide a Preferences window in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst so users can manage app preferences defined in a Settings bundle.

## Overview

Mac apps typically display app-specific preferences using a Preferences window accessible through the standard Preferences menu item under the app menu in the menu bar.

Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst that include a `Settings.bundle` file automatically get the Preferences menu item and a Preferences window. When a user selects the Preferences menu item, the system displays a Mac-friendly Preferences window based on the options provided in your Settings bundle. To learn about Settings bundles, see Implementing an iOS Settings Bundle.

### Add a Preferences window to your app

To include a Preferences window in your Mac app, add a `Settings.bundle` file to your Xcode project by pressing Command-N and selecting the Settings Bundle template from the Resources section under iOS. Then click Next to save the file to your project.

### Add toolbar tabs to the Preferences window

A Settings bundle can include one or more child panes that allow you to organize your preferences hierarchically (see Hierarchical Preferences). In iOS, the Settings app displays a child pane as a preference row. When the user taps the row, the app displays a new view showing the preferences defined in the child pane’s property list file.

In macOS, the Preferences window displays a child pane as a tab on the window’s toolbar. When the user clicks the tab, they see the preferences provided in the child pane’s property list file.

The tab for a child pane displays the pane’s title and a system-provided icon. To customize the icon, add the following key to the child pane’s property list file:

`Icon`

Optional. A string with the name of the image file to display as the toolbar tab icon in the Preferences window.

You must include the image file in the Settings bundle that contains the child pane’s property list file.

### Confirm changes made with a toggle switch

Another element of the Settings bundle is the Toggle Switch Element, which displays an ON/OFF switch that the user can toggle. Your Mac app can prompt the user for a confirmation when they toggle the switch by including the following keys in the toggle switch element:

`TrueConfirmationPrompt`

Optional. A dictionary that defines the prompt to present to users when they attempt to turn on the switch.

`FalseConfirmationPrompt`

Optional. A dictionary that defines the prompt to present to users when they attempt to turn off the switch.

Each dictionary contains the following keys that define the contents of the prompt:

`Type`

Required. Must be set to `PSConfirmationPrompt`.

`Title`

Required. A string with the title of the prompt. The title might not appear on some devices.

`Prompt`

Required. A string with the body text that the prompt displays.

`ConfirmText`

Optional. A string with the text displayed in the prompt’s confirmation button. The toggle switch value changes when the user clicks this button.

`DenyText`

Optional. A string with the text displayed in the prompt’s cancel button. The toggle switch value doesn’t change when the user clicks this button.

### Display subtitles for toggle switches

Some iOS apps show descriptive text in a subtitle below a toggle switch using a group item with footer text. While the Preferences window supports this approach, the appearance on a Mac isn’t ideal. Instead, include the following key in the toggle switch element to show a subtitle:

`Description`

Optional. A longer descriptive string to display under a toggle switch.

Sample Code

# Detecting changes in the preferences window

Listen for and respond to a user’s preference changes in your Mac app built with Mac Catalyst using Combine.

Download

Xcode 11.1+

## Overview

With Combine, your app can listen for changes a user makes to the app’s Preferences window, and respond to those changes. The sample app provides a Preferences window with one setting: background color. When the user selects a color, the background of the main view changes to match their selection.

This sample code project shows how to:

- Add a Preferences window in a Mac app built with Mac Catalyst.

- Register default values for the preferences.

- Retrieve current preference values.

- Listen for and respond to changes the user makes in the Preferences window.

To use the sample app, open the sample code project in Xcode and select My Mac as the destination. Then, build and run the sample project.

### Provide a preferences window in the app

The sample app includes a `Settings.bundle` file that the system uses to automatically add the standard Preferences menu item to the app menu. Selecting the menu item displays a Preferences window that the system generates based on the preference specifiers defined in the Settings bundle. To learn more, see Displaying a Preferences window.

The Settings bundle for the sample app has a preference specifier for setting the background color of the main view. It also has a child pane preference specifier, which displays a second tab of preferences in the Preferences windows. The Settings bundle file `Root.plist` defines these specifiers, while the file `OtherSettings.plist` defines the preference specifiers for the child pane.

### Register default preference values

When the user changes preferences in the Preferences window, the window saves them to the application domain of the user defaults system. To store and retrieve the preference values within the app, the sample app uses `UserDefaults`. However, when you launch the sample app for the first time, the preference values don’t exist in the user defaults system. If the app tries retrieving a value, `UserDefaults` returns `nil`.

To ensure that the app always retrieves a non- `nil` value, the sample app registers the default preference values with the registration domain. However, this domain doesn’t persist these values between app launches, so the sample app registers the default values each time the user launches the app.

// To ensure that the app has a good set of preference values, register
// the default values each time the app launches.
registerDefaultPreferenceValues()

return true
}

The method `registerDefaultPreferenceValues()` retrieves the default values from the Settings bundle by retrieving the preference specifiers from the `Root.plist` file and parsing the specifiers for their default value. After retrieving the values, the method registers the default values.

func registerDefaultPreferenceValues() {
let preferenceSpecifiers = retrieveSettingsBundlePreferenceSpecifiers(from: "Root.plist")
let defaultValuesToRegister = parse(preferenceSpecifiers)

// Register the default values with the registration domain.
UserDefaults.standard.register(defaults: defaultValuesToRegister)
}

To parse the preference specifiers, the `parse()` method loops through the array of specifiers, copying the default values into the dictionary `defaultValuesToRegister`. If the method detects the `PSChildPaneSpecifier` type, it gets the name of the child pane property list file, and merges the default values in the file into the `defaultValuesToRegister` dictionary. After gathering the default values, the method returns the dictionary to the caller.

var defaultValuesToRegister = String: Any

// Parse the preference specifiers, copying the default values
// into the `defaultValuesToRegister` dictionary.
for preferenceItem in preferenceSpecifiers {
if let key = preferenceItem["Key"] as? String,
let defaultValue = preferenceItem["DefaultValue"] {
defaultValuesToRegister[key] = defaultValue
}

// Add child pane preference specifiers.
if let type = preferenceItem["Type"] as? String,
type == "PSChildPaneSpecifier" {
if var file = preferenceItem["File"] as? String {
if file.hasSuffix(".plist") == false {
file += ".plist"
}
let morePreferenceSpecifiers = retrieveSettingsBundlePreferenceSpecifiers(from: file)
let moreDefaultValuesToRegister = parse(morePreferenceSpecifiers)
defaultValuesToRegister.merge(moreDefaultValuesToRegister) { (current, _) in current }
}
}
}

return defaultValuesToRegister
}

### Retrieve preference values

After registering the default values with the registration domain, the app can retrieve a preference value without the possibility of encountering an unavailable value. To simplify access to the background color preference value, the sample app extends `UserDefaults` to include properties for each preference value.

extension UserDefaults {

@objc dynamic var backgroundColorValue: Int {
return integer(forKey: "backgroundColorValue")
}

@objc dynamic var someRandomOption: Bool {
return bool(forKey: "someRandomOption")
}

}

### Handle changes made in the preferences window

As the user changes the background color setting in the Preferences window, the app changes the background color of its main view. To accomplish this, the view controller for the main view creates a subscriber in the `viewDidLoad()` method. When the background color value changes, the subscriber receives the new value, maps it to a `UIColor` object, and assigns the color to the view’s `backgroundColor` property.

var subscriber: AnyCancellable? // Subscriber of preference changes.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

// Set the view's initial background color to the color specified in Preferences.
if let colorSetting = BackgroundColors(rawValue: UserDefaults.standard.backgroundColorValue) {
view.backgroundColor = colorSetting.currentColor()
}

// Listen for changes to the background color preference made in the Preferences window.
subscriber = UserDefaults.standard
.publisher(for: \.backgroundColorValue, options: [.initial, .new])
.map( { BackgroundColors(rawValue: $0)?.currentColor() })
.assign(to: \UIView.backgroundColor, on: self.view)
}

Sample Code

# Showing help tags for views and controls using tooltip interactions

Explain the purpose of interface elements by showing a tooltip when a person positions the pointer over the element.

Download

Xcode 13.0+

## Overview

This sample shows how to display a tooltip (also known as a _help tag_) that explains the purpose of, or provide additional information about, an interface element such as a view or control without shifting a person’s focus away from the primary interface. A tooltip appears when a person positions the pointer over a view or control for a few seconds. The tooltip remains visible for a few seconds or until the pointer moves away from the interface element.

For guidelines on designing the content of your tooltips, see the Help section of the macOS Human Interface Guidelines.

### Configure the sample code project

Tooltips are available in the sample app when running in macOS 12 or later. To build and run the sample app:

### Add a tooltip to a view

To show a tooltip when the pointer hovers over a view, the sample creates a `UIToolTipInteraction` object and passes in the default tooltip text. Then the sample adds the interaction to a `UIView` using the view’s `addInteraction(_:)` method.

lazy var viewWithDefaultTooltip: UIView = {
let view = UIView()
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemGreen
view.addText("Hover the pointer over this view to see its default tooltip.")

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction(defaultToolTip: "The default tooltip for the view.")
view.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

return view
}()

The sample uses the same approach for other types of views too, for instance, to add a tooltip to an instance of `UILabel`:

lazy var labelWithTooltip: UILabel = {
let label = UILabel()
label.text = "Hover the pointer over this label to see its tooltip."
label.numberOfLines = 0

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction(defaultToolTip: "The label's tooltip.")
label.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

return label
}()

### Add a tooltip to a control

For interface elements that derive from `UIControl`, such as `UIButton`, the sample uses the `toolTip` property to set the default text that appears in the tooltip instead of adding an interaction to the control.

lazy var buttonWithTooltip: UIButton = {
var configuration = UIButton.Configuration.filled()
configuration.title = "Buy"
configuration.subtitle = "Only $9.99"
configuration.titleAlignment = .center

let action = UIAction { _ in print("Thank you for your purchase.") }

let button = UIButton(configuration: configuration, primaryAction: action)
button.toolTip = "Click to buy this item. You'll have a chance to change your mind before confirming your purchase."
button.preferredBehavioralStyle = .pad

return button
}()

### Change the tooltip text of a view

Setting the `defaultToolTip` property of a tooltip interaction and setting the `toolTip` property of a control are convenient ways to show tooltip text that don’t change while the app runs. However, there may be times when an app needs to determine the contents of the tooltip based on the state of the app or logic specific to the app. For instance, the sample app looks up the name of a view’s background color and displays the name in a tooltip when the pointer hovers over that view.

To show the background color name in a tooltip, the sample creates an instance of `UIToolTipInteraction` and sets its `delegate` property to an instance of `ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip`, which is a custom view that conforms to the `UIToolTipInteractionDelegate` protocol. Then the sample adds the interaction to the view.

lazy var viewWithBackgroundColorTooltip: UIView = {
let view = ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip()
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemYellow
view.addText("Hover the pointer over this view to see the name of the view's background color.")

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction()
tooltipInteraction.delegate = view
view.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

Next, `ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip` implements the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` method, and returns a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object that contains the name of the background color as the text of the tooltip. If the color name isn’t available, the method returns `nil`, which prevents the tooltip from displaying.

class ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip: UIView, UIToolTipInteractionDelegate {

let configuration: UIToolTipConfiguration?
if let accessibilityName = backgroundColor?.accessibilityName {
configuration = UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "The color is \(accessibilityName).")
} else {
configuration = nil
}

return configuration
}

}

### Change the tooltip text of a control

To change the tooltip text of a control like the sample’s shopping cart button, the sample provides a tooltip interaction delegate as it did with the custom view. But instead of creating a tooltip interaction, it sets the button’s `toolTip` property to the default text. This causes the control to create a `UIToolTipInteraction` object and assign it to the `toolTipInteraction` property. The sample then uses the property to assign a delegate to the interaction.

lazy var shoppingCartButtonWithTooltip: UIButton = {
var configuration = UIButton.Configuration.filled()
configuration.title = "Add to Cart"
configuration.image = UIImage(systemName: "cart.circle")
configuration.imagePlacement = NSDirectionalRectEdge.leading
configuration.imagePadding = 4

let action = UIAction { [unowned self] _ in self.cartItemCount += 1 }

let button = UIButton(configuration: configuration, primaryAction: action)
button.toolTip = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart is empty."
button.toolTipInteraction?.delegate = self

The sample also implements the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` delegate method, which returns a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object that contains the tooltip text describing the purpose of the button and the number of items in the shopping cart.

let text: String
switch cartItemCount {
case 0:
text = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart is empty."
case 1:
text = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart contains \(cartItemCount) item."
default:
text = "Click to add the item to your cart. Your cart contains \(cartItemCount) items."
}

return UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: text)
}

### Specify the hover region

In addition to setting the tooltip text in a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object, a delegate can specify the region of an interface element where the pointer must hover to trigger the display of the tooltip. The sample app, for example, shows a view that displays a tooltip after positioning the pointer over the top or bottom regions of the view, but not when the pointer is over the middle area.

To determine whether the pointer location is in the top or bottom region of the view, the sample uses the `point` value that the method `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` provides. When the pointer is in one of those regions, the delegate method returns a tooltip configuration that contains the tooltip text and the source rectangle, which defines the area of the view that the pointer must hover over to trigger the display of the tooltip.

class ViewWithTooltipRegion: UIView, UIToolTipInteractionDelegate {

var topRect = self.bounds
var bottomRect = self.bounds

let partHeight = self.bounds.size.height / 3
topRect.size.height = partHeight
bottomRect.size.height = partHeight
bottomRect.origin.y = partHeight * 2

// Display the tooltip if the pointer within the top or bottom rects.
if topRect.contains(point) {
return UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "Top area of the view.", in: topRect)
} else if bottomRect.contains(point) {
return UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "Bottom area of the view.", in: bottomRect)
}

// Pointer is in the middle of the view; don't display a tooltip.
return nil
}

In another example, the sample uses the source rectangle of a tooltip configuration to specify the region of selected text in a text view. When hovering the pointer over the selected text, a tooltip appears but it doesn’t appear when the pointer hovers over unselected text.

class TextViewWithTooltip: UITextView, UIToolTipInteractionDelegate {

guard
let selectedTextRange = self.selectedTextRange,
selectedTextRange.isEmpty == false
else {
return nil
}

var unionedRect = firstRect(for: selectedTextRange)
for selectionRect in selectionRects(for: selectedTextRange) {
unionedRect = unionedRect.union(selectionRect.rect)
}

if let selectedText = text(in: selectedTextRange) {
return UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "Selected text: \(selectedText)", in: unionedRect)
}

return nil
}

## Overview

To show a tooltip when the pointer hovers over a view, add a `UIToolTipInteraction` object to the view. For example, the following code listings shows how to add a tooltip to a label:

let label = UILabel()

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction(defaultToolTip: "The label's tooltip.")
label.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

If you want your app to determine the tooltip text at a later time — for instance, to reflect the current state of your app — set the interaction’s `delegate` property to an object that conforms to the `UIToolTipInteractionDelegate` protocol.

To add a tooltip to a control derived from `UIControl`, use the convenience property `toolTip`; for example, to add a tooltip to the button:

let button = UIButton(configuration: configuration, primaryAction: action)
button.toolTip = "Click to buy this item. You'll have a chance to change your mind before confirming your purchase."

Setting the `toolTip` property creates a tooltip interaction for the control, which you can retrieve from the `toolTipInteraction` property.

# UIToolTipInteractionDelegate

An interface that provides tooltip settings to an interaction.

@MainActor
protocol UIToolTipInteractionDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

A tooltip interaction delegate provides configuration information about a tooltip. You can, for instance, use the delegate to change the text of a tooltip.

To change the tooltip text, set a tooltip interaction’s `delegate` property to an object that conforms to the `UIToolTipInteractionDelegate` protocol and implements the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` method. For example, in the following code listing, the code creates a new view and assigns its background color. Then the code creates a `UIToolTipInteraction` object, sets the `delegate` equal to the view, and adds the interaction to the view.

lazy var viewWithBackgroundColorTooltip: UIView = {
let view = ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip()
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.systemYellow

let tooltipInteraction = UIToolTipInteraction()
tooltipInteraction.delegate = view
view.addInteraction(tooltipInteraction)

return view
}()

The delegate’s implementation of the `toolTipInteraction(_:configurationAt:)` method looks up the `accessibilityName` of the view’s background color. If the name is available, the method creates a `UIToolTipConfiguration` object, passing in the name of the color. Then the method returns the configuration. If the name isn’t available, the method returns `nil`, which prevents the display of the tooltip.

class ViewWithBackgroundColorTooltip: UIView, UIToolTipInteractionDelegate {

let configuration: UIToolTipConfiguration?
if let accessibilityName = backgroundColor?.accessibilityName {
configuration = UIToolTipConfiguration(toolTip: "The color is \(accessibilityName).")
} else {
configuration = nil
}

return configuration

Class

# UIActivity

An abstract class that you subclass to implement app-specific services.

class UIActivity

## Mentioned in

Adding custom actions and activities

## Overview

You should subclass `UIActivity` only if you want to provide custom services to people. A service takes data that’s passed to it, does something to that data, and returns the results. For example, a social media service might take whatever text, images, or other content is provided to it and post them to a person’s account. Activity objects are used in conjunction with a `UIActivityViewController` object, which is responsible for presenting services to people.

The system already provides support for many standard services and makes them available through the `UIActivityViewController` object. For example, the standard activity view controller supports emailing data, posting items to one of a person’s social media accounts, and several other options. You don’t have to provide custom services for any of the built-in types.

### Subclassing notes

This class must be subclassed before it can be used. The job of an activity object is to act on the data provided to it and to provide some meta information that iOS can display to people. For more complex services, an activity object can also display a custom user interface and use it to gather additional information from people.

#### Methods to override

When subclassing, you must always override the following methods and use them to provide information about your service:

- `activityType`

- `activityTitle`

- `activityImage`

- `canPerform(withActivityItems:)`

- `prepare(withActivityItems:)`

- `activityCategory`

If your `canPerform(withActivityItems:)` method indicates that your subclass is able to operate on the specified data, the active `UIActivityViewController` object displays your service to people. When a person selects your service, the activity view controller calls the `prepare(withActivityItems:)` method followed by only one of these methods:

- `activityViewController` — Returns a view controller to present to a person. If your service requires additional input from a person, override this method and use it to return the view controller object responsible for presenting your custom UI. (You don’t need to present the view controller yourself.) After your view controller object gathers the needed input, it’s responsible for initiating the task associated with the service.

- `perform()` — Performs the service without displaying any additional UI. If your service doesn’t need additional input from a person, override this method and perform the task associated with the service.

Collaborating and sharing copies of your data

## Overview

The system provides several standard services, such as copying items to the pasteboard, posting content to social media sites, sending items via email or SMS, and more. Apps can also define custom services.

Your app is responsible for configuring, presenting, and dismissing this view controller. Configuration for the view controller involves specifying the data objects on which the view controller should act. (You can also specify the list of custom services your app supports.) When presenting the view controller, you must do so using the appropriate means for the current device. On iPad, you must present the view controller in a popover. On iPhone and iPod touch, you must present it modally.

Protocol

# UIActivityItemSource

A set of methods that an activity view controller uses to retrieve the data items to act on.

tvOS

protocol UIActivityItemSource : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

You can use this protocol in situations where you want to provide the data from one of your app’s existing objects instead of creating a separate `UIActivityItemProvider` object. When implementing this protocol, your object becomes the data provider, providing the view controller with access to the items.

Because the methods of this protocol are executed on your app’s main thread, you should avoid using this protocol in cases where the data objects might take a significant amount of time to create. When creating large data objects, consider using a `UIActivityItemProvider` object instead.

## Topics

### Getting the data items

Returns the placeholder object for the data.

**Required**

Returns the data object to be acted upon.

### Providing information about the data items

For activities that support a subject field, returns the subject for the item.

For items that are provided as data, returns the UTI for the item.

For activities that support a preview image, returns a thumbnail preview image for the item.

### Providing metadata for accelerated previews

Returns metadata to display in the preview header of the share sheet.

class UIActivityItemProvider

## Overview

You can use a provider object in situations where you want to make data available for use by an activity but you want to delay providing that data until it’s actually needed. For example, you might use a provider object to represent a large video file that needs to be processed before it can be shared to a user’s social media account.

When you initialize a `UIActivityViewController` object, you can pass a provider object in addition to any other data objects. When the user selects an activity, the activity view controller adds your provider object (which is also an operation object) to an operation queue so that it can begin to gather or process the needed data.

### Subclassing notes

You must subclass `UIActivityItemProvider` and implement its `item` method, which is called to generate the item data. You implement this method instead of the normal `main()` method you’d implement for an operation object. (The `main()` method calls the `item` method when the operation object is executed.) Your implementation of the `item` method should do whatever work is necessary to create and return the data.

## Topics

### Initializing the provider

`init(placeholderItem: Any)`

Initializes and returns a provider object with the specified placeholder data.

### Accessing the provider attributes

Generates and returns the actual data-bearing object.

`var placeholderItem: Any?`

The placeholder object you specified at initialization time.

`var activityType: UIActivity.ActivityType?`

# Requesting access to protected resources

Provide a purpose string that explains to a person why you need access to protected resources on their device.

## Overview

Modern devices collect and store a wealth of sensitive information about people who use them. Many apps rely on this kind of data, and the device hardware that generates it, to do useful work. For example, a navigation app needs a person’s GPS coordinates to locate the person on a map. But not all apps need access to all data. The same navigation app doesn’t need access to a person’s health history, camera interface, or Bluetooth peripherals.

Ensure your app accesses only what it needs to do its job. To support this principle, Apple’s operating systems restrict access to protected data and resources by default. Apps can request access on a case-by-case basis, providing an explanation for why they need access. The person who uses the app decides whether to grant or deny the request.

### Provide a purpose string

The first time your app attempts to access a protected resource, the system prompts the person using the app for permission. In the following example, an iOS app called FoodDeliveryApp, which provides a food delivery service, generates a prompt requesting access to the person’s location:

If the person grants permission, the system remembers the person’s choice and doesn’t prompt again. If the person denies permission, the access attempt that initiates the prompt, and any further attempts, fail in a resource-specific way. For the particular case of access to location data, the person can choose to allow access for one session only by tapping Allow Once.

The system automatically generates the prompt’s title, which includes the name of your app. You supply a message called a _purpose string_ or a _usage description_ — in this case, “Your location allows you to view restaurants in delivery range of your address.” — to indicate the reason that your app needs the access. Accurately and concisely explaining to the person why your app needs access to sensitive data, typically in one complete sentence, lets the person make an informed decision and improves the chances that they grant access.

You provide a purpose string by setting a string value for a resource-specific key that you add to your app’s `Information Property List` file. The message in the image above, for example, is a string associated with the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key. Modify your `Info.plist` file using the property list editor in Xcode.

Always provide a valid purpose string in the `Info.plist` file if your app uses a protected resource. If you don’t, attempts to access the resource fail, and might even cause your app to crash.

If your app supports multiple locales, in addition to providing a purpose string in the `Info.plist` file, localize it, and place the localized string in the `InfoPlist.strings` files for each locale you want to support.

### Adhere to the requirements for purpose strings

To give people useful, concise information about why you’re requesting access to protected resources, make sure each purpose string you provide is valid by checking the following:

- The purpose string isn’t blank and doesn’t consist solely of whitespace characters.

- The purpose string is shorter than 4,000 bytes. Typical purpose strings are one complete sentence, but you can provide additional information to help a person make the right decision about sharing personal information.

- The purpose string has the proper type that the corresponding key requires, typically a string.

- The purpose string provides a description that’s accurate, meaningful, and specific about why the app needs to access the protected resource.

Adhere to these requirements for every purpose string in the `Info.plist` file and locale-specific `InfoPlist.strings` files.

App Review checks for the use of protected resources, and rejects apps that contain code accessing those resources without a purpose string. For example, an app accessing location might receive the following information from App Review about the requirement that an `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key be present:

ITMS-90683: Missing purpose string in Info.plist.
Your app’s code references one or more APIs that access sensitive user
data, or the app has one or more entitlements that permit such access.
The Info.plist file for the "{app-bundle-path}" bundle should contain a
NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key with a user-facing purpose string
explaining clearly and completely why your app needs the data.
If you’re using external libraries or SDKs, they may reference APIs that
require a purpose string. While your app might not use these APIs, a
purpose string is still required. For details, visit:

To resolve this issue, provide a purpose string that explains why the app needs access to this sensitive information, or remove the code that’s accessing the resource.

### Check for authorization

Many system frameworks that provide access to protected resources have dedicated APIs for checking and requesting authorization to use those resources. This model allows you to adjust your app’s behavior depending on the current access it has. For example, if a person denies your app permission to do something, you can remove related elements from your user interface.

Because a person can change authorization at any time using Settings, always check the authorization status of a feature before accessing it. In cases without a dedicated API, prepare your app to gracefully handle access failures.

### Reset authorization access

When your app attempts to access a protected resource after its first attempt, the system remembers the person’s permission choice and doesn’t prompt again. To prompt the person again, you need to reset access to these resources on your device or system.

$ tccutil reset AppleEvents

This command resets authorization access for all apps using the protected resource. You can similarly specify Camera, Calendar, Reminders, or other services to reset them individually.

# Encrypting Your App’s Files

Protect the user’s data in iOS by encrypting it on disk.

## Overview

Data protection is an iOS feature that you use to secure your app’s files and prevent unauthorized access to them. Data protection is enabled automatically when the user sets an active passcode for the device. You read and write your files normally, but the system encrypts and decrypts your content behind the scenes. The encryption and decryption processes are automatic and hardware accelerated.

You specify the level of data protection that you want to apply to each of your files. There are four levels available, each of which determines when you may access the file. If you do not specify a protection level when creating a file, iOS applies the default protection level automatically.

- **No protection.** The file is always accessible.

- **Complete until first user authentication.** (Default) The file is inaccessible until the first time the user unlocks the device. After the first unlocking of the device, the file remains accessible until the device shuts down or reboots.

- **Complete unless open.** You can open existing files only when the device is unlocked. If you have a file already open, you may continue to access that file even after the user locks the device. You can also create new files and access them while the device is locked or unlocked.

- **Complete.** The file is accessible only when the device is unlocked.

To create and encrypt a new file in one step, construct a data object with the file’s contents and call the `write(to:options:)` method. When calling the method, specify the data protection option that you want applied to the file. The following code shows an example of how to write out the contents of a `Data` instance to a file and encrypt it using the complete protection level.

do {
try data.write(to: fileURL, options: .completeFileProtection)
}
catch {
// Handle errors.
}

To change the data protection level of an existing file, use the `setResourceValue(_:forKey:)` method of `NSURL`. When calling this method, assign the new data protection option to the `fileProtectionKey` resource key. The following code shows an example that adds this key to an existing file.

do {
try (fileURL as NSURL).setResourceValue(
URLFileProtection.complete,
forKey: .fileProtectionKey)
}
catch {
// Handle errors.
}

### Manage Your Access to Encrypted Files

Depending on a file’s protection level, attempts to read or write its contents could fail when the user subsequently locks the device. To ensure that your app is able to access files, do the following:

- Choose the right data protection level for your needs.

- Use the app delegate’s `applicationProtectedDataWillBecomeUnavailable(_:)` and `applicationProtectedDataDidBecomeAvailable(_:)` methods to close and reopen files with the `completeFileProtection` level.

Assign the complete protection level to files that your app accesses only when it is in the foreground. If your app supports background capabilities, such as handling location updates, assign a different protection level for files that you might access while in the background. For example, a fitness app might use the complete unless open protection level on a file that it uses to log location events in the background.

Files containing personal information about the user, or files created directly by the user, always warrant the strongest level of protection. Assign the complete protection level to user data files and manage access to those files using the app delegate methods. The app delegate methods give you time to close the files before they become inaccessible to your app.

Instance Property

# identifierForVendor

An alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies a device to the app’s vendor.

tvOS

@MainActor
var identifierForVendor: UUID? { get }

## Discussion

The value of this property is the same for apps that come from the same vendor running on the same device. A different value is returned for apps on the same device that come from different vendors, and for apps on different devices regardless of vendor.

Normally, the vendor is determined by data provided by the App Store. If the app wasn’t installed from the app store (such as enterprise apps and apps still in development), then a vendor identifier is calculated based on the app’s bundle ID. The bundle ID is assumed to be in reverse-DNS format.

- In iOS 6, the first two components of the bundle ID are used to generate the vendor ID. If the bundle ID only has a single component, then the entire bundle ID is used.

- In IOS 7, all components of the bundle except for the last component are used to generate the vendor ID. If the bundle ID only has a single component, then the entire bundle ID is used.

The following table shows a collection of bundle IDs and which portions of the bundle ID the system uses to calculate the vendor ID.

| Bundle ID | iOS 6.x | iOS 7.x |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Com.example.app1 | **Com.example**.app1 | **Com.example**.app1 |
| Com.example.app2 | **Com.example**.app2 | **Com.example**.app2 |
| Com.example.app.app1 | **Com.example**.app.app1 | **Com.example.app**.app1 |
| Com.example.app.app2 | **Com.example**.app.app2 | **Com.example.app**.app2 |
| Example | **Example** | **Example** |

For example, `com.example.app1` and `com.example.app2` would appear to have the same vendor ID.

If the value is `nil`, wait and get the value again later. This happens, for example, after the device has been restarted but before the user has unlocked the device.

The value in this property remains the same while the app (or another app from the same vendor) is installed on the iOS device. The value changes when the user deletes all of that vendor’s apps from the device and subsequently reinstalls one or more of them. The value can also change when installing test builds using Xcode or when installing an app on a device using ad-hoc distribution. Therefore, if your app stores the value of this property anywhere, you should gracefully handle situations where the identifier changes.

# Customizing the behavior of segue-based presentations

Pass data between view controllers during a segue, and programmatically control when segues occur.

## Overview

When the user triggers a segue, UIKit presents the view controller using the options found in your storyboard. UIKit also provides opportunities for you to modify the segue process dynamically, either by preventing the segue from occurring or by doing extra work when a segue occurs.

For information on how to create a segue, see Specify presentations visually in your storyboard file.

### Configure the presentation style of the transition

The segue’s type determines what kind of animations UIKit uses when presenting and dismissing the segue, as the table below shows. You specify the type when you create the segue, but you can also change it in the attributes inspector later.

| Segue type | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Show (Push) | Displays the view controller modally unless a parent view controller implements the `show(_:sender:)` action method, in which case that view controller defines the presentation behavior. For example, a `UINavigationController` pushes the new view controller onto its navigation stack. |
| Show Detail (Replace) | Displays the view controller modally unless a parent view controller implements the `showDetailViewController(_:sender:)` action method, in which case that view controller defines the presentation behavior. For example, a `UISplitViewController` replaces its second child view controller (the detail controller) with the new view controller. |
| Present Modally | Displays the view controller modally using the specified presentation and transition styles. |
| Present as Popover | In a horizontally regular environment, UIKit presents the view controller in a popover. In a horizontally compact environment, UIKit presents the view controller modally. |

For more information about how UIKit performs segues involving the Show and Show Detail presentation styles, see Let the current context define the presentation technique.

### Prevent a segue based on dynamic conditions

When you don’t want the user to leave the current view controller, tell UIKit not to perform a segue by returning false from the `shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)` method of the source view controller. Use that method to perform any checks you need to determine whether the segue can proceed. For example, return `false` if the view controller’s content is invalid and requires corrective user actions. Returning true lets the segue continue, but returning `false` causes the segue to fail silently.

### Pass data to the presented view controller

Because UIKit creates and presents the view controller automatically during a segue, use the `prepare(for:sender:)` method to pass any data to that view controller before the segue occurs. Implement the method on the view controller containing the object that initiated the segue. Fetch the new view controller from the provided `UIStoryboardSegue` object, along with information about which segue was triggered.

In the following code example, the current view controller fetches the image associated with the selected table row and passes that image to the new view controller.

override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
// Get the new view controller.
if let imageVC = segue.destination as? ImageViewController {

// Fetch the image for the selected row.
let image = getImageForSelectedRow()
imageVC.currentImage = image
}
}

Use the delegate design pattern to pass data from a presented view controller ) method.

### Understand the sequence of events during a segue

Although UIKit handles segues automatically, there are many places where you can perform work related to displaying the new view controller. The following figure shows the flow of events that happens from the time the user triggers a segue until the process is complete. The main place to perform perform segue-related actions is the current view controller’s `prepare(for:sender:)` method, but you also may perform tasks during the creation of the new view controller.

# Dismissing a view controller with an unwind segue

Configure an unwind segue in your storyboard file that dynamically chooses the most appropriate view controller to display next.

## Overview

To handle the dismissal of a view controller, create an unwind segue. Unlike the segues that you use to present view controllers, an unwind segue promises the dismissal of the current view controller without promising a specific target for the resulting transition. Instead, UIKit determines the target of an unwind segue programmatically at runtime.

UIKit determines the target of an unwind segue at runtime, so you aren’t restricted in how you set up your view controller hierarchies. Consider a scenario where two view controllers present the same child view controller, as shown in the following figure. You could add complicated logic to determine which view controller to display next, but such a solution wouldn’t scale well. Instead, UIKit provides a simple programmatic solution that scales to any number of view controllers with minimal effort.

### Define an unwind action on a parent view controller

The presence of an unwind segue action method tells UIKit that a view controller is a potential destination for an unwind segue. Before configuring any unwind segues in your storyboard, you must add this action method to least one of your view controllers. If no view controller has an unwind action, Xcode prevents you from creating unwind segues. This action method has the following format:

@IBAction func myUnwindAction(unwindSegue: UIStoryboardSegue)

- (IBAction) myUnwindAction:(UIStoryboardSegue*)unwindSegue

You don’t need to do anything in your unwind segue action methods. The presence of the method is enough to dismiss the current view controller. However, you can use the method to perform relevant tasks during the dismissal process. For example, you might pass data from the dismissed view controller object to retrieve the starting and ending view controllers.

### Connect a triggering object to the exit control

In your storyboard, create an unwind segue by right-clicking a triggering object and dragging to the Exit control at the top of your view controller’s scene. You may trigger the segue from any object that supports the target-action design pattern, such as a control or gesture recognizer attached to your view controller.

When you connect an object to the Exit control, UIKit presents a list of known action methods. Select one of the action methods to complete the unwind segue. You only select the action method, not a specific view controller. To be displayed after the dismissal, a parent view controller must implement the method you select.

When the user triggers the dismiss action, UIKit searches the current view controller hierarchy for a view controller that implements the designated action method. It looks for the closest view controller, starting with the immediate parent, and walks up the view controller hierarchy until it finds an appropriate target. If it can’t find a view controller that implements the method, the unwind segue fails silently and the current view controller remains onscreen.

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

## Overview

A `UIStoryboard` object manages archived versions of your app’s view controllers. At design time, you configure the content of your view controllers visually, and Xcode saves the data needed to recreate that interface in a storyboard file in your app’s bundle. When you want to create a new view controller programmatically, first create a `UIStoryboard` object and specify the appropriate name and bundle information. Then use that object to instantiate the specific view controller that you want.

During the instantiation process, `UIStoryboard` creates your view controller programmatically using its doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/oslog/oslogentry/init(coder:) method. The storyboard passes the view controller’s data archive to that method, which then uses the data to recreate the state of the view controller and its views. If you have a custom initialization method for your view controller, you can ask the storyboard to instantiate your view controller using a block you provide. You can use this block to call your custom initialization method, passing any extra data your view controller needs.

For visionOS apps, you can load existing storyboards, but you can’t add content specific to the platform. Migrate your interface code to SwiftUI as soon as possible.

Customizing the behavior of segue-based presentations

Dismissing a view controller with an unwind segue

## Overview

The `UIStoryboardSegue` class supports the standard visual transitions available in UIKit. You can also subclass to define custom transitions between the view controllers in your storyboard file.

Segue objects contain information about the view controllers involved in a transition. When a segue is triggered, but before the visual transition occurs, the storyboard runtime calls the current view controller’s `prepare(for:sender:)` method so that it can pass any needed data to the view controller that’s about to be displayed.

You don’t create segue objects directly. Instead, the storyboard runtime creates them when it must perform a segue between two view controllers. You can still initiate a segue programmatically using the `performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)` method of `UIViewController` if you want. You might do so to initiate a segue from a source that was added programmatically and therefore not available in Interface Builder.

### Subclassing notes

You can subclass `UIStoryboardSegue` in situations where you want to provide a custom transition between view controllers in your application. To use your custom segue, create a segue line between the appropriate view controllers in Interface Builder and set its type to Custom in the inspector; you must also specify the class name of the segue to use in the inspector.

When the storyboard runtime detects a custom segue, it creates a new instance of your class, configures it with the view controller objects, asks the view controller source to prepare for the segue, and then performs the segue.

#### Methods to override

For custom segues, the main method you need to override is the `perform()` method. The storyboard runtime calls this method when it’s time to perform the visual transition from the view controller in `source` to the view controller in `destination`. If you need to initialize any variables in your custom segue subclass, you can also override the `init(identifier:source:destination:)` method and initialize them in your custom implementation.

#### Alternatives to subclassing

If your segue doesn’t need to store additional information or provide anything other than a `perform()` method, consider using the `init(identifier:source:destination:performHandler:)` method instead.

Class

# UIImageAsset

A container for a collection of images that represent multiple ways of describing a single piece of artwork.

tvOS

class UIImageAsset

## Overview

A common use case for `UIImageAsset` is the grouping of multiple images of the same item at different display scales. Image asset objects aren’t assigned to instances of `UIImage` rather; `UIImage` provides an asset when multiple representations of an image are available. Images retrieved from image asset catalogs using the `init(named:)` or `init(named:in:compatibleWith:)` methods automatically have an image asset object that allows access to other images from the catalog.

### Register an image

When you register an image with an image asset, you associate a `UITraitCollection` object with the image. The trait collection must contain the `displayScale` and `userInterfaceIdiom` trait properties. If you don’t define these traits in the trait collection, the following defaults are assigned:

- `displayScale` = `1.0`

- `userInterfaceIdiom` = `UIUserInterfaceIdiom.unspecified`

For example, if you create a trait collection that only contains a horizontal size class, the default display scale and idiom are added when the image is registered.

### Retrieve an image

When you retrieve or unregister an image from an image asset, you do so using the trait collection that was used to register the image. To ensure the correct image is retrieved, the trait collection used must contain the `displayScale` and `userInterfaceIdiom` traits. If these traits aren’t defined in the trait collection, the following defaults are assigned:

- `displayScale` = scale of the current device

- `userInterfaceIdiom` = the type of interface used on the current device

For example, if you create a trait collection that only contains a horizontal size class, the default display scale and idiom of the current device are added when searching the `UIImageAsset` for an image.

`UIImageView` automatically retrieves the correct image when `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)` is called on it.

## Topics

### Initializing an image asset

`init()`

Creates a new image asset object.

`init?(coder: NSCoder)`

An object from a data set type stored in an asset catalog.

class NSDataAsset

## Overview

The object’s content is stored as a set of one or more files with associated device attributes. These sets can also be tagged for use as on-demand resources.

### Initialize data assets

Data assets are initialized from a named data set in an asset catalog. You create data sets during app development. Each data set contains one or more data files. Each file has associated attributes for features of the device, including the minimum amount of memory and the version of Metal. When you initialize the data asset, the system selects the data file that best matches the current device.

For more information on the data set type in an asset catalog, see Data Set Type in Asset Catalog Format Reference. For information on asset catalogs, see Managing assets with asset catalogs.

### Access the data

You access the data file by using the `data` property. Because the property is of type `NSData` it provides methods for accessing the raw data only as bytes and ranges of bytes.

To access structured data, convert the bytes into the appropriate format. The system can convert some data types for you. One example is XML data using the `init(data:)` method of `XMLParser`. Other data types require code for parsing and converting the raw data. You may need to convert larger data files incrementally.

## Topics

### Initializing the data asset

`convenience init?(name: NSDataAssetName)`

Initializes and returns an object with a reference to the named data asset in an asset catalog.

`init?(name: NSDataAssetName, bundle: Bundle)`

# UINib

An object that contains Interface Builder nib files.

tvOSvisionOS 1.0–1.0Deprecated

@MainActor
class UINib

## Overview

A `UINib` object caches the contents of a nib file in memory, ready for unarchiving and instantiation. When your app needs to instantiate the contents of the nib file, it can do so without having to load the data from the nib file first, which improves performance. The `UINib` object can automatically release this cached nib data to free up memory for your app under low-memory conditions, reloading that data the next time your app instantiates the nib.

Your app should use `UINib` objects whenever it needs to repeatedly instantiate the same nib data. For example, if your table view uses a nib file to instantiate table view cells, caching the nib in a `UINib` object can improve performance.

When you create a `UINib` object using the contents of a nib file, the object loads the object graph in the referenced nib file, but it doesn’t unarchive it yet. To unarchive all of the nib data and instantiate the nib, your app calls the `instantiate(withOwner:options:)` method. For more information about the steps that the `UINib` object follows to instantiate the nib’s object graph, see Resource Programming Guide.

## Topics

### Creating a nib object

`init(nibName: String, bundle: Bundle?)`

Returns a nib object from the nib file in the specified bundle.

`init(data: Data, bundle: Bundle?)`

### Retrieving objects from the nib file

Unarchives and instantiates the in-memory contents of the nib object’s nib file, creating a distinct object tree and set of top-level objects.

Options that specify how to unarchive and instantiate the nib.

# UIControl

The base class for controls, which are visual elements that convey a specific action or intention in response to user interactions.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIControl

## Mentioned in

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

## Overview

Controls implement elements such as buttons and sliders, which your app can use to facilitate navigation, gather user input, or manipulate content. Controls use the target-action mechanism to report user interactions to your app.

You don’t create instances of this class directly. The `UIControl` class is a subclassing point that you extend to implement custom controls. You can also subclass existing control classes to extend or modify their behaviors. For example, you might override the methods of this class to track touch events yourself or to determine when the state of the control changes.

A control’s state determines its appearance and its ability to support user interactions. Controls can be in one of several states, which the `UIControl.State` type defines. You can change the state of a control programmatically according to your app’s needs. For example, you might disable a control to prevent the user from interacting with it. User interactions can also change the state of a control.

### Respond to user interaction

The target-action mechanism simplifies the code that you write to use controls in your app. Instead of writing code to track touch events, you write action methods to respond to control-specific events. For example, you might write an action method that responds to changes in the value of a slider. The control handles all the work of tracking incoming touch events and determining when to call your methods.

When adding an action method to a control, you specify both the action method and an object that defines that method to the `addTarget(_:action:for:)` method. (You can also configure the target and action of a control in Interface Builder.) The target object can be any object, but it’s typically the view controller’s root view that contains the control. If you specify `nil` for the target object, the control searches the responder chain for an object that defines the specified action method.

The signature of an action method takes one of three forms. The `sender` parameter corresponds to the control that calls the action method, and the `event` parameter corresponds to the `UIEvent` object that triggered the control-related event.

@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIButton)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIButton, forEvent event: UIEvent)

- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent*)event;

The system calls action methods when the user interacts with the control in specific ways. The `UIControl.Event` type defines the types of user interactions that a control can report and those interactions mostly correlate to specific touch events within the control. When configuring a control, you must specify which events trigger the calling of your method. For a button control, you might use the `touchDown` or `touchUpInside` event to trigger calls to your action method. For a slider, you might care only about changes to the slider’s value, so you might choose to attach your action method to `valueChanged` events.

When a control-specific event occurs, the control calls any associated action methods immediately. The current `UIApplication` object dispatches action methods and finds an appropriate object to handle the message, following the responder chain, if necessary. For more information about responders and the responder chain, see Event Handling Guide for UIKit Apps.

### Configure control attributes in Interface Builder

The following table lists the attributes for instances of the `UIControl` class.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Alignment | The horizontal and vertical alignment of a control’s content. For controls that contain text or images, such as buttons and text fields, use these attributes to configure the position of that content within the control’s bounds. ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) These alignment options apply to the content of a control and not to the control itself. For information about how to align controls with respect to other controls and views, see Auto Layout Guide. |
| Content | The initial state of the control. Use the checkboxes to configure whether the control is in an enabled, selected, or highlighted state initially. |

### Support localization

Because `UIControl` is an abstract class, you don’t internationalize it specifically. However, you do internationalize the content of subclasses like `UIButton`. For information about internationalizing a specific control, see the reference for that control.

### Make controls accessible

Controls are accessible by default. To be useful, an accessible user interface element must provide accurate and helpful information about its screen position, name, behavior, value, and type. This is the information VoiceOver speaks to users. Users who are blind or have low vision can rely on VoiceOver to help them use their devices.

Controls support the following accessibility attributes:

- **Label.** A short, localized word or phrase that succinctly describes the control or view, but doesn’t identify the element’s type. Examples are _Add_ and _Play_.

- **Traits.** A combination of one or more individual traits, each of which describes a single aspect of an element’s state, behavior, or usage. For example, you might use a combination of the Keyboard Key and the Selected traits to describe an element that behaves like a keyboard key and that’s in a selected state.

- **Hint.** A brief, localized phrase that describes the results of an action on an element. Examples are _Adds a title_ and _Opens the shopping list_.

- **Frame.** The frame of the element in screen coordinates, which the `CGRect` structure specifies for an element’s screen location and size.

- **Value.** The current value of an element when the label doesn’t represent the value. For example, the label for a slider might be _Speed_, but its current value might be _50%_.

The `UIControl` class provides default content for the value and frame attributes. Many controls automatically enable additional specific traits as well. You can configure other accessibility attributes programmatically or with the Identity inspector in Interface Builder.

For more information about accessibility attributes, see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.

### Subclassing notes

Subclassing `UIControl` gives you access to the built-in target-action mechanism and simplified event-handling support. You can subclass existing controls and modify their behavior in one of two ways:

- Override the `sendAction(_:to:for:)` method of an existing subclass to observe or modify the dispatching of action methods to the control’s associated targets. You might use this method to modify the dispatch behavior for the specified object, selector, or event.

- Override the `beginTracking(_:with:)`, `continueTracking(_:with:)`, `endTracking(_:with:)`, and `cancelTracking(with:)` methods to track touch events occurring in the control. You can use the tracking information to perform additional actions. Always use these methods to track touch events instead of the methods that the `UIResponder` class defines.

If you subclass `UIControl` directly, your subclass is responsible for setting up and managing your control’s visual appearance. Use the methods for tracking events to update your control’s state and to send an action when the control’s value changes.

@MainActor
class UIStackView

## Overview

Stack views let you leverage the power of Auto Layout, creating user interfaces that can dynamically adapt to the device’s orientation, screen size, and any changes in the available space. The stack view manages the layout of all the views in its `arrangedSubviews` property. These views are arranged along the stack view’s axis, based on their order in the `arrangedSubviews` array. The exact layout varies depending on the stack view’s `axis`, `distribution`, `alignment`, `spacing`, and other properties.

To use a stack view, open the Storyboard you wish to edit. Drag either a Horizontal Stack View or a Vertical Stack View out from the Object library, and position the stack view where desired. Next, drag out the stack’s content, dropping the view or control into the stack. You can continue to add views and controls to your stack, as needed. Interface Builder resizes the stack based on its content. You can also adjust the appearance of the stack’s content by modifying the Stack View’s properties in the Attributes inspector.

### Stack view and Auto Layout

The stack view uses Auto Layout to position and size its arranged views. The stack view aligns the first and last arranged view with its edges along the stack’s axis. In a horizontal stack, this means the first arranged view’s leading edge is pinned to the stack’s leading edge, and the last arranged view’s trailing edge is pinned to the stack’s trailing edge. In vertical stacks, the top and bottom edges are pinned to the stack’s top and bottom edges, respectively. If you set the stack view’s `isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement` property to `true`, the stack view pins its content to the relevant margin instead of its edge.

For all distributions except the `UIStackView.Distribution.fillEqually` distribution, the stack view uses each arranged view’s `intrinsicContentSize` property when calculating its size along the stack’s axis. `UIStackView.Distribution.fillEqually` resizes all the arranged views so they’re the same size, filling the stack view along its axis. If possible, the stack view stretches all the arranged views to match the view with the longest intrinsic size along the stack’s axis.

For all alignments except the `UIStackView.Alignment.fill` alignment, the stack view uses each arranged view’s `intrinsicContentSize` property when calculating its size perpendicular to the stack’s axis. `UIStackView.Alignment.fill` resizes all the arranged views so that they fill the stack view perpendicularly to its axis. If possible, the stack view stretches all the arranged views to match the view with the largest intrinsic size perpendicular to the stack’s axis.

#### Position and size the stack view

Although a stack view allows you to lay out its contents without using Auto Layout directly, you still need to use Auto Layout to position the stack view itself. In general, this means pinning at least two adjacent edges of the stack view to define its position. Without additional constraints, the system calculates the size of the stack view based on its contents.

- Along the stack view’s axis, its fitting size is equal to the sum of the sizes of all the arranged views plus the space between views.

- Perpendicular to the stack view’s axis, its fitting size is equal to the size of the largest arranged view.

- If the stack view’s `isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement` property is set to `true`, the stack view’s fitting size is increased to include space for the margins.

You can provide additional constraints to specify the stack view’s height, width, or both. In these cases, the stack view adjusts the layout and size of its arranged views to fill the specified area. The exact layout varies based on the stack view’s properties. See the `UIStackView.Distribution` and `UIStackView.Alignment` enumerations for a complete description on how the stack view handles having either extra space or insufficient space for its content.

You can also position a stack view based on its first or last baseline, instead of using the top, bottom, or center Y position. Like the stack view’s fitting size, these baselines are calculated based on the stack view’s content.

- A horizontal stack view returns its tallest view for both the `forFirstBaselineLayout` and `forLastBaselineLayout` methods. If the tallest view is also a stack view, it returns the result of calling `forFirstBaselineLayout` or `forLastBaselineLayout` on the nested stack view.

- A vertical stack view returns its first arranged view for `forFirstBaselineLayout` and its last arranged view for `forLastBaselineLayout`. If either of these views are also stack views, then it returns the result of calling `forFirstBaselineLayout` or `forLastBaselineLayout` on the nested stack view.

#### Define common stack view layouts

Common approaches for laying out content using stack views:

**Define the position only.** You can define the stack view’s position by pinning two of its adjacent edges to its superview. In this case, the stack view’s size grows freely in both dimensions, based on its arranged views. This approach is particularly useful when you want the stack view’s content to appear at its intrinsic content size, and you want to arrange other user-interface elements relative to the stack view.

The following image shows a stack view with its leading and top edges pinned to its superview. The labels are first baseline aligned, with an 8-point space between them, left-aligning the stack view’s content in its superview.

**Define the stack’s size along its axis.** In this case, pin both edges of the stack along its axis to its superview, defining the stack view’s size in that dimension. You also need to pin one of the other edges to define the stack view’s position. The stack view sizes and positions its content along its axis to fill the defined space; however, the unpinned edge moves freely, based on the size of the largest arranged view.

The following image shows a stack view with the leading, top, and trailing edges pinned to its superview. Using the fill distribution causes the content to resize to fill the view’s width, and because the text field has a lower content-hugging priority than the label, it’s stretched as necessary.

**Define the stack’s size perpendicular to its axis.** This approach is similar to the previous example, but you pin the two edges perpendicular to the stack view’s axis and only one edge along the axis. This lets the stack view grow and shrink along its axis as you add and remove arranged views. Unless you use a `UIStackView.Distribution.fillEqually` distribution, the arranged views are sized according to their intrinsic content size. Perpendicular to the axis, the views are laid out in the defined space based on the stack view’s alignment.

The following image shows a vertical stack containing four labels and a button. The stack uses 8-point spacing and the center alignment. The stack view’s height grows and shrinks as items are added to or removed from the stack.

**Define the size and position of the stack view.** In this case, you pin all four edges of the stack view, causing the stack view to lay out its content within the provided space.

The following image shows a vertical stack view with all four edges pinned to its superview. By using the center alignment and fill distribution, the stack view ensures that its content is centered horizontally and vertically fills the screen. However, getting the desired layout with this approach requires a couple of additional steps. By default, the stack view vertically stretches the label and not the image view. To resize the image view, lower its content-hugging priority below the label’s content-hugging priority. Additionally, to maintain the image view’s aspect ratio as it resizes, set its Mode to Aspect Fit. Adding an equal width constraint between the image view and the stack view helps ensure the image is sized to fill the available space.

### Manage the stack view’s appearance

A stack view manages the position and size of its arranged views. There are a number of properties that define how the stack view lays out its content.

- The `axis` property determines the stack’s orientation, either vertically or horizontally.

- The `distribution` property determines the layout of the arranged views along the stack’s axis.

- The `alignment` property determines the layout of the arranged views perpendicular to the stack’s axis.

- The `spacing` property determines the minimum spacing between arranged views.

- The `isBaselineRelativeArrangement` property determines whether the vertical spacing between views is measured from the baselines.

- The `isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement` property determines whether the stack view lays out its arranged views relative to its layout margins.

Typically, you use a single stack view to lay out a small number of items. You can build more complex view hierarchies by nesting stack views inside other stack views. For example, the following image shows a vertical stack view containing two horizontal stack views. Each of the horizontal stack views contains a label and a text field.

You can also fine-tune an arranged view’s appearance by adding additional constraints to the arranged view. For example, you can use constraints to set a minimum or maximum height or width for the view. Or you can define an aspect ratio for the view. The stack view uses these constraints when laying out its content.

### Maintain consistency between the arranged views and subviews

The stack view ensures that its `arrangedSubviews` property is always a subset of its `subviews` property. Specifically, the stack view enforces the following rules:

- When the stack view adds a view to its `arrangedSubviews` array, it also adds that view as a subview, if it isn’t already.

- When a subview is removed from the stack view, the stack view also removes it from the `arrangedSubviews` array.

- Removing a view from the `arrangedSubviews` array doesn’t remove it as a subview. The stack view no longer manages the view’s size and position, but the view is still part of the view hierarchy, and is rendered on screen if it’s visible.

Although the `arrangedSubviews` array always contains a subset of the `subviews` array, the order of these arrays remain independent.

- The order of the `arrangedSubviews` array defines the order in which views appear in the stack. For horizontal stacks, the views are laid out in reading order, with the lower index views appearing before the higher index views. In English, for example, the views are laid out in order from left to right. For vertical stacks, the views are laid out from top to bottom, with the lower index views above the higher index views.

- The order of the subviews array defines the Z-order of the subviews. If the views overlap, subviews with a lower index appear behind subviews with a higher index.

### Change the stack view’s content dynamically

The stack view automatically updates its layout whenever views are added, removed, or inserted into the `arrangedSubviews` array, or whenever one of the arranged subviews’s `isHidden` property changes.

// Appears to remove the first arranged view from the stack.
// The view is still inside the stack, it's just no longer visible, and no longer contributes to the layout.
let firstView = stackView.arrangedSubviews[0]
firstView.isHidden = true

// Appears to remove the first arranged view from the stack.
// The view is still inside the stack, it's just no longer visible, and no longer contributes to the layout.
UIView * firstView = self.stackView.arrangedSubviews[0];
firstView.hidden = YES;

The stack view also automatically responds to changes to any of its properties. For example, you can dynamically change the stack’s orientation, by updating the stack view’s `axis` property.

// Toggle between a vertical and horizontal stack.
if stackView.axis == .horizontal {
stackView.axis = .vertical
}
else {
stackView.axis = .horizontal
}

// Toggle between a vertical and horizontal stack.
if (self.stackView.axis == UILayoutConstraintAxisHorizontal) {
self.stackView.axis = UILayoutConstraintAxisVertical;
}
else {
self.stackView.axis = UILayoutConstraintAxisHorizontal;
}

You can animate both changes to the arranged subview’s `isHidden` property and changes to the stack view’s properties by placing these changes inside an animation block.

// Animates removing the first item in the stack.

let firstView = stackView.arrangedSubviews[0]
firstView.isHidden = true
}

// Animates removing the first item in the stack.
[UIView animateWithDuration:0.25 animations:^{\
UIView * firstView = self.stackView.arrangedSubviews[0];\
firstView.hidden = YES;\
}];

Finally, you can define size-class specific values for many of the stack view’s properties directly in Interface Builder. The system automatically animates these changes whenever the stack view’s size class changes.

# UIScrollView

A view that allows the scrolling and zooming of its contained views.

@MainActor
class UIScrollView

## Overview

`UIScrollView` is the superclass of several UIKit classes, including `UITableView` and `UITextView`.

A scroll view is a view with an origin that’s adjustable over the content view. It clips the content to its frame, which generally (but not necessarily) coincides with that of the app’s main window. A scroll view tracks the movements of fingers, and adjusts the origin accordingly. The view that shows its content through the scroll view draws that portion of itself according to the new origin, which is pinned to an offset in the content view. The scroll view itself does no drawing except for displaying vertical and horizontal scroll indicators. The scroll view must know the size of the content view so it knows when to stop scrolling. By default, it _bounces_ back when scrolling exceeds the bounds of the content.

The object that manages the drawing of content that displays in a scroll view needs to tile the content’s subviews so that no view exceeds the size of the screen. As users scroll in the scroll view, this object adds and removes subviews as necessary.

Because a scroll view has no scroll bars, it must know whether a touch signals an intent to scroll versus an intent to track a subview in the content. To make this determination, it temporarily intercepts a touch-down event by starting a timer and, before the timer fires, seeing if the touching finger makes any movement. If the timer fires without a significant change in position, the scroll view sends tracking events to the touched subview of the content view. If the user then drags their finger far enough before the timer elapses, the scroll view cancels any tracking in the subview and performs the scrolling itself. Subclasses can override the `touchesShouldBegin(_:with:in:)`, `isPagingEnabled`, and `touchesShouldCancel(in:)` methods (which the scroll view calls) to affect how the scroll view handles scrolling gestures.

A scroll view also handles zooming and panning of content. As the user makes a pinch-in or pinch-out gesture, the scroll view adjusts the offset and the scale of the content. When the gesture ends, the object managing the content view updates subviews of the content as necessary. (Note that the gesture can end and a finger might still be down.) While the gesture is in progress, the scroll view doesn’t send any tracking calls to the subview.

The `UIScrollView` class can have a delegate that must adopt the `UIScrollViewDelegate` protocol. For zooming and panning to work, the delegate must implement both `viewForZooming(in:)` and `scrollViewDidEndZooming(_:with:atScale:)`. In addition, the `maximumZoomScale` and `minimumZoomScale` zoom scales must be different.

### State preservation

If you assign a value to this view’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it attempts to preserve its scrolling-related information between app launches. Specifically, the values of the `zoomScale`, `contentInset`, and `contentOffset` properties are preserved. During restoration, the scroll view restores these values so that the content appears scrolled to the same position as before. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

Class

# UICalendarView

A view that displays a calendar with date-specific decorations, and provides for user selection of a single date or multiple dates.

@MainActor
class UICalendarView

## Overview

Use a calendar view to show users specific dates that have additional information (for example, scheduled events) using decorations that you customize. You can also use a calendar view for users to select one specific date, multiple dates, or no date.

To add a calendar view to your interface:

- Configure the Calendar and Locale for your calendar view to display.

- Set a date for the calendar view to initially make visible.

- Create a delegate to provide decorations on specific dates, if desired.

- Set a selection method and delegate to handle date selection.

- Set up Auto Layout to position the calendar view in your interface.

You use a calendar view only for the display and selection of dates. If you want to handle date and time selection, use `UIDatePicker`.

### Configure a calendar view

Configure your calendar view to display the type of calendar appropriate to the user’s location and cultural preference, in the user’s preferred language. By default, a calendar view selects the user’s current `Calendar` and `Locale`. If users can select a different calendar or locale in your app, configure the calendar view to use those selections.

// Create the calendar view.
let calendarView = UICalendarView()

// Create an instance of the Gregorian calendar.
let gregorianCalendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)

// Set the calendar displayed by the view.
calendarView.calendar = gregorianCalendar

// Set the calendar view's locale.
calendarView.locale = Locale(identifier: "zh_TW")

// Set the font design to the rounded system font.
calendarView.fontDesign = .rounded

Then, set the calendar view’s initial display to a starting date that’s appropriate for your use case.

// Set the date to display.
calendarView.visibleDateComponents = DateComponents(
calendar: gregorianCalendar,
year: 2024,
month: 2,
day: 1
)

If you want to restrict the earliest or latest dates a user can view or select in your calendar view, set the `availableDateRange`.

// Specify the starting date.
let fromDateComponents = DateComponents(
calendar: gregorianCalendar,
year: 2024,
month: 1,
day: 1
)

// Specify the ending date.
let toDateComponents = DateComponents(
calendar: gregorianCalendar,
year: 2024,
month: 12,
day: 31
)

// Verify that you have valid start and end dates.
guard let fromDate = fromDateComponents.date, let toDate = toDateComponents.date else {
// Handle the error here.
fatalError("Invalid date components: \(fromDateComponents) and \(toDateComponents)")
}

// Set the range of dates that people can view.
let calendarViewDateRange = DateInterval(start: fromDate, end: toDate)
calendarView.availableDateRange = calendarViewDateRange

### Display decorations for specific dates

Use decorations to show users which specific dates have additional information. Add meaning or emphasis to the decorations by setting the color, size, image, or custom view that you display for a specific date. To display decorations in your calendar view, create a custom `UICalendarViewDelegate` object, implement `calendarView(_:decorationFor:)`, and set your custom object as the calendar view’s delegate.

// Define a calendar view delegate.
class CalendarViewDelegate: NSObject, UICalendarViewDelegate {

var calendarView: UICalendarView? = nil
var decorations: [Date?: UICalendarView.Decoration]

override init() {
// Create the date components for Valentine's day that
// contain the calendar, year, month, and day.
let valentinesDay = DateComponents(
calendar: Calendar(identifier: .gregorian),
year: 2024,
month: 2,
day: 14
)

// Create a calendar decoration for Valentine's day.
let heart = UICalendarView.Decoration.image(
UIImage(systemName: "heart.fill"),
color: UIColor.red,
size: .large
)

decorations = [valentinesDay.date: heart]
}

// Return a decoration (if any) for the specified day.

// Get a copy of the date components that only contain
// the calendar, year, month, and day.
let day = DateComponents(
calendar: dateComponents.calendar,
year: dateComponents.year,
month: dateComponents.month,
day: dateComponents.day
)

// Return any decoration saved for that date.
return decorations[day.date]
}
}

In your implementation, you can decide which type of `UICalendarView.Decoration` best illustrates your user’s events:

- The default decoration, which displays a filled circle you can customize with a color and relative size

- An image decoration, which you can customize with a system symbol or image, color, and relative size

- A custom decoration, which you can customize with a closure that returns your custom view

When your data changes, tell the calendar view to reload decoration views.

// Add a decoration to the specified date.
func add(decoration: UICalendarView.Decoration, on date: Date) {
// Get the calendar, year, month, and day date components for
// the specified date.
let dateComponents = Calendar.current.dateComponents(
[.calendar, .year, .month, .day ],
from: date
)

// Add the decoration to the decorations dictionary.
decorations[dateComponents.date] = decoration

// Reload the calendar view's decorations.
if let calendarView {
calendarView.reloadDecorations(
forDateComponents: [dateComponents],
animated: true
)
}
}

### Handle date selection

Let users select a single date, multiple dates, or no date with your calendar view. First, decide which type of date selection you want. Then create a selection object and delegate for that type, and assign it to the calendar view’s `selectionBehavior`.

let dateSelection = UICalendarSelectionSingleDate(delegate: self)
calendarView.selectionBehavior = dateSelection

The user can then select a date from the calendar view. You can set a selected date programmatically as the following example shows:

let date = DateComponents(
calendar: Calendar(identifier: .gregorian),
year: 2024,
month: 2,
day: 14
)

// Programmatically set the selected date.
dateSelection.selectedDate = date

Next, implement the delegate methods for the selection method to customize your date selection handling.

// Control whether a person can select a given date.
func dateSelection(
_ selection: UICalendarSelectionSingleDate,
canSelectDate dateComponents: DateComponents?

// Allow all dates by returning true if the selection parameter contains
// a date component instance. Prevent someone from clearing the selection
// by returning false if the selection parameter is nil.
return dateComponents != nil
}

// Respond when someone selects or deselects a date. If they selected
// a date, the dateComponent parameter contains the selected date. If they
// cleared the selection, the parameter is nil.
func dateSelection(_ selection: UICalendarSelectionSingleDate, didSelectDate dateComponents: DateComponents?) {
// Update your app.
}

# UIImageView

A view that displays a single image or a sequence of animated images in your interface.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIImageView

## Overview

Image views let you efficiently draw any image that can be specified using a `UIImage` object. For example, you can use the `UIImageView` class to display the contents of many standard image files, such as JPEG and PNG files. You can configure image views programmatically or in your storyboard file and change the images they display at runtime. For animated images, you can also use the methods of this class to start and stop the animation and specify other animation parameters.

### Understand how images are scaled

An image view uses its `contentMode` property and the configuration of the image itself to determine how to display the image. It’s best to specify images whose dimensions match the dimensions of the image view exactly, but image views can scale your images to fit all or some of the available space. If the size of the image view itself changes, it automatically scales the image as needed.

For an image without cap insets, the presentation of the image is determined solely by the image view’s `contentMode` property. The `UIView.ContentMode.scaleAspectFit` and `UIView.ContentMode.scaleAspectFill` modes scale the image to fit or fill the space while maintaining the image’s original aspect ratio. The `UIView.ContentMode.scaleToFill` value scales the image without regard to the original aspect ratio, which can cause the image to appear distorted. Other content modes place the image at the appropriate location in the image view’s bounds without scaling it.

For a resizable image with cap insets, those insets affect the final appearance of the image. Specifically, cap insets define which parts of the image may be scaled and in which directions. You can create a resizable image that stretches using the `resizableImage(withCapInsets:resizingMode:)` method of `UIImage`. When using an image of this type, you typically set the image view’s content mode to `UIView.ContentMode.scaleToFill` so that the image stretches in the appropriate places and fills the image view’s bounds.

For tips on how to prepare images, see Debug issues with your image view. For more information on creating resizable images with cap insets, see `UIImage`.

### Determine the final transparency of the image

Images are composited onto the image view’s background and are then composited into the rest of the window. Any transparency in the image allows the image view’s background to show through. Similarly, any further transparency in the background of the image is dependent on the transparency of the image view and the transparency of the `UIImage` object it displays. When the image view and its image both have transparency, the image view uses alpha blending to combine the two.

- The image is composited onto the image view’s background.

- If the image view’s `isOpaque` property is `true`, the image’s pixels are composited on top of the image view’s background color and the `alpha` property of the image view is ignored.

- If the image view’s `isOpaque` property is `false`, the alpha value of each pixel is multiplied by the image view’s `alpha` value, with the resulting value becoming the actual transparency value for that pixel. If the image doesn’t have an alpha channel, the alpha value of each pixel is assumed to be `1.0`.

### Animate a sequence of images

An image view can store an animated image sequence and play all or part of that sequence. You specify an image sequence as an array of `UIImage` objects and assign them to the `animationImages` property. Once assigned, you can use the methods and properties of this class to configure the animation timing and to start and stop the animation.

Consider the following tips when displaying a sequence of animated images:

- **All images in the sequence should have the same size.** When scaling is required, the image view scales each image in the sequence separately. If the images are different sizes, scaling may not yield the results you want.

- **All images in the sequence should use the same content scale factor.** Make sure the `scale` property of each image contains the same value.

### Respond to touch events

Image views ignore user events by default. Normally, you use image views only to present visual content in your interface. If you want an image view to handle user interactions as well, change the value of its `isUserInteractionEnabled` property to `true`. After doing that, you can attach gesture recognizers or use any other event handling techniques to respond to touch events or other user-initiated events.

For more information about handling events, see Event Handling Guide for UIKit Apps.

### Improve performance

Image scaling and alpha blending are two relatively expensive operations that can impact your app’s performance. To maximize performance of your image view code, consider the following tips:

- **Cache scaled versions of frequently used images.** If you expect certain large images to be displayed frequently in a scaled-down thumbnail view, consider creating the scaled-down images in advance and storing them in a thumbnail cache. Doing so alleviates the need for each image view to scale them separately.

- **Use images whose size is close to the size of the image view.** Rather than assigning a large image to an image view, created a scaled version that matches the current size of the image view. You can also create a resizable image object using the `UIImage.ResizingMode.tile` option, which tiles the image instead of scaling it.

- **Make your image view opaque whenever possible.** Unless you’re intentionally working with images that contain transparency (drawing UI elements, for example), make sure the `isOpaque` property of your image view is set to `true`. For more information about how transparency is determined, see Determine the final transparency of the image.

### Debug issues with your image view

If your image view isn’t displaying what you expected, use the following tips to help diagnose the problem:

- **Load images using the correct method.** Use the `init(named:in:compatibleWith:)` method of `UIImage` to load images from asset catalogs or your app’s bundle. For images outside of your app’s bundle, use the `imageWithContentsOfFile:` method.

- **Don’t use image views for custom drawing.** The `UIImageView` class doesn’t draw its content using the `draw(_:)` method. Use image views only to present images. To do custom drawing involving images, subclass `UIView` directly and draw your image there.

### Interface Builder attributes

The following table lists the attributes that you configure for image views in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Discussion |
| --- | --- |
| Image | The image to display. You can specify any image in your Xcode project, including standalone images and those in image assets. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `image` or `animationImages` property. |
| Highlighted | The image to display when the image view is highlighted. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `highlightedImage` or `highlightedAnimationImages` property. |
| State | The initial state of the image. Use this attribute to mark the image as highlighted. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `isHighlighted` property. |

### Internationalization

Internationalization of image views is automatic if your view displays only static images loaded from your app bundle. If you’re loading images programmatically, you’re at least partially responsible for loading the correct image.

- For resources in your app bundle, you do this by specifying the name in the attributes inspector or by calling the `init(named:)` class method on `UIImage` to obtain the localized version of each image.

- For images that aren’t in your app bundle, your code must do the following:

1. Determine which image to load in a manner specific to your app, such as providing a localized string that contains the URL.

2. Load that image by passing the URL or data for the correct image to an appropriate `UIImage` class method, such as `imageWithData:` or `imageWithContentsOfFile:`.

For more information, see Localization.

### Accessibility

Image views are accessible by default. The default accessibility traits for an image view are Image and User Interaction Enabled.

For more information about making iOS controls accessible, see the accessibility information in `UIControl`. For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility for UIKit.

### State preservation

When you assign a value to an image view’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it attempts to preserve the frame of the displayed image. Specifically, the class preserves the values of the `bounds`, `center`, and `transform` properties of the view and the `anchorPoint` property of the underlying layer. During restoration, the image view restores these values so that the image appears exactly as before. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see Restoring your app’s state.

@MainActor
class UIPickerView

## Overview

A picker view displays one or more wheels that the user manipulates to select items. Each wheel — known as a _component_ — has a series of indexed rows representing the selectable items. Each row displays a string or view so that the user can identify the item on that row. Users select items by rotating the wheels to the desired values, which align with a selection indicator.

You provide the data to display in your picker view using a picker data source (an object that adopts the `UIPickerViewDataSource` protocol). Use your picker view delegate (an object that adopts the `UIPickerViewDelegate` protocol) to provide views for displaying your data and responding to user selections.

## Topics

iOS 2.0–12.0DeprecatediPadOS 2.0–12.0Deprecated

@MainActor
class UIWebView

## Overview

Use the `loadHTMLString(_:baseURL:)` method to begin loading local HTML files or the `loadRequest(_:)` method to begin loading web content. Use the `stopLoading()` method to stop loading, and the `isLoading` property to find out if a web view is in the process of loading.

If you allow the user to move back and forward through the webpage history, then you can use the `goBack()` and `goForward()` methods as actions for buttons. Use the `canGoBack` and `canGoForward` properties to disable the buttons when the user can’t move in a direction.

By default, a web view automatically converts telephone numbers that appear in web content to Phone links. When a Phone link is tapped, the Phone app launches and dials the number. To turn off this default behavior, set the `dataDetectorTypes` property with a `UIDataDetectorTypes` bitfield that doesn’t contain the `phoneNumber` flag.

You can also use the `scalesPageToFit` property to programmatically set the scale of web content the first time it’s displayed in a web view. Thereafter, the user can change the scale using gestures.

Set the `delegate` property to an object conforming to the `UIWebViewDelegate` protocol if you want to track the loading of web content.

You can debug the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript contained inside a `UIWebView` with Web Inspector. Read Debugging Web Content on iOS to learn how to configure Web Inspector for iOS. Read the rest of Safari Web Content Guide to learn how to create web content that’s optimized for Safari on iPhone and iPad.

For information about basic view behaviors, see View Programming Guide for iOS.

### Supported file formats

In addition to HTML content, `UIWebView` objects can be used to display other content types, such as Keynote, PDF, and Pages documents. For the best rendering of plain and rich text in your app, however, you should use `UITextView` instead.

### State preservation

In iOS 6 and later, if you assign a value to this view’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it attempts to preserve its URL history, the scaling and scrolling positions for each page, and information about which page is currently being viewed. During restoration, the view restores these values so that the web content appears just as it did before. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

# Responding to control-based events using target-action

Handle user input by connecting buttons, sliders, and other controls to your app’s code using the target-action design pattern.

## Overview

User interactions generate thousands of events for your app. Every swipe of the finger or button click, for instance, results in numerous events your app has to process.

`Target-action` is a design pattern to help you handle these user interactions efficiently. By only registering actions against specific events on your controls, you simplify your event processing, while making your code more maintainable and easier to read.

Use `target-action` to connect events directly from controls in your UI to methods in your code.

### Designate an object to handle control-related events

When a person interacts with your control, the control needs to know where to send the event. The destination for the event is the _target_. View controllers make good targets because they’re adept at handling user interactions, as well as hosting UI controls.

### Define the action methods you use to respond to events

With a control assigned to the target, provide a function to call on that target when the event occurs. This is the _action_ method.

Action methods have a distinct signature:

// UIKit.
@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: Any)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: Any, forEvent event: UIEvent)

// AppKit.
@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: Any)

// UIKit.
- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender forControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)controlEvents;

// AppKit.
- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;

Xcode uses the `@IBAction` keyword to connect controls in Interface Builder to functions in your code. The keyword also bridges the Swift and Objective-C runtimes, enabling Swift code to call into Objective-C, which is where the target-action functionality lives.

The `sender` parameter defines where the event comes from; for example, a button. Use the generic type `Any` to allow any control to call the action method, or specify the `sender` type when you need more information about the control for event processing. For example, set the `sender` type to `UISlider` to read the slider thumb value when someone moves the slider left or right.

// UIKit.
@IBAction func adjustVolume(sender: UISlider) {
print(sender.value)
}

// AppKit.
@IBAction func adjustVolume(sender: NSSlider) {
NSLog("%@", sender.stringValue)
}

// UIKit.
- (IBAction)adjustVolume:(UISlider *)sender {
NSLog(@"%f", sender.value);
}

// AppKit.
- (IBAction)adjustVolume:(NSSlider *)sender {
NSLog(@"%@", [sender stringValue]);
}

UIKit also supports coupling action methods to specific event types (see `UIControl.Event`). For example, to set up target-action for a user dragging their finger inside the bounds of a control, register for the event type `touchDragInside`.

### Connect controls to the action methods in Interface Builder

With the `target` and `action` methods defined, you’re ready to connect them visually to the controls in Interface Builder.

1. Select the control (the `target`) you want to connect to the code (the `action`).

2. Control-drag the control to the view controller in the document outline.

3. Select the action method that the control connects to.

You can verify that the control and action are connected by moving the pointer over the circular dot to the left of the action method. When you do, Xcode highlights the control.

Another way to connect is to Control-drag the control from Interface Builder into the view controller.

Enter the name of the `action` method you’d like the control to call and then click Connect.

The following table lists the parameters available for configuration.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Connection | The type of connection to make. Select Action to establish a target-action relationship between the control and the target. |
| Object | The `target` or object your control is connecting to. |
| Name | The name of the function, or `action`, your control calls when the event occurs. |
| Type | The type of the control sending the event. Choose `Any` if you don’t require any further information regarding the control’s state. Specify the control type if you require more information from the control for event processing. |
| Event | The `UIEvent` associated with the action. This feature is only available in UIKit. |
| Arguments | The arguments to include in the signature or your target-action method. Choose None to include no arguments. Choose Sender to pass in the control type as the sender. Choose Sender and Event to pass in both the control type and the event that caused the action. This feature is available only in UIKit. |

Connecting the target-action this way ensures the method signature and parameters are correct as Xcode generates the action method for you.

### Connect a control to your code programmatically

In UIKit, use the `addTarget(_:action:for:)` method to set up target-action programmatically on a control:

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
let signInButton = UIButton(type: .system)

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

signInButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
signInButton.setTitle("Sign in", for: .normal)

// Target-action.
signInButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(buttonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)

view.addSubview(signInButton)
signInButton.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor).isActive = true
signInButton.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor).isActive = true

#import "ViewController.h"

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
[super viewDidLoad];

UIButton *signInButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeSystem];
[signInButton setTitle:@"Sign in" forState:UIControlStateNormal];

signInButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false;

// Target-action.
[signInButton addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonTapped:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];

[signInButton.centerYAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerYAnchor].active = true;
}

- (void)buttonTapped:(UIButton *)sender {
NSLog(@"Sign in successful 🎉");
}
@end

In AppKit, use the control’s `target` and `action` properties to set target-action programmatically:

import Cocoa

class ViewController: NSViewController {
let signInButton = NSButton()

signInButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
signInButton.title = "Sign in"

// Target-action.
signInButton.target = self
signInButton.action = #selector(buttonTapped(sender:))

@IBAction func buttonTapped(sender: NSButton) {
print("Sign in successful 🎉")
}
}

#import "ViewController.h"

NSButton *signInButton = [[NSButton alloc] initWithFrame: NSMakeRect(20, 20, 100, 80)];
signInButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
signInButton.title = @"Sign in";
signInButton.bezelStyle = NSBezelStyleRounded;

// Target-action.
signInButton.target = self;
signInButton.action = @selector(buttonTapped:);

[self.view addSubview:signInButton];
[signInButton.centerXAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerXAnchor].active = YES;
[signInButton.centerYAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.view.centerYAnchor].active = YES;
}

- (void)buttonTapped:(NSButton *)sender {
NSLog(@"Sign in successful 🎉");
}

@end

### Enable other objects to respond to control-related events

When the object hosting the control isn’t the one you want handling the event, invoke the responder chain by passing in `nil` as the target. This causes the control to search the responder chain for the specified action method and invoke it when found. For more information, see Using responders and the responder chain to handle events.

## Overview

When you tap a button, or select a button that has focus, the button performs any actions attached to it. You communicate the purpose of a button using a text label, an image, or both. The appearance of buttons is configurable, so you can tint buttons or format titles to match the design of your app. You can add buttons to your interface programmatically or using Interface Builder.

When adding a button to your interface, perform the following steps:

- Set the type of the button at creation time.

- Supply a title string or image; size the button appropriately for your content.

- Connect one or more action methods to the button.

- Set up Auto Layout rules to govern the size and position of the button in your interface.

- Provide accessibility information and localized strings.

### Respond to button taps

Buttons use the target-action design pattern to notify your app when the user taps the button. Rather than handle touch events directly, you assign action methods to the button and designate which events trigger calls to your methods. At runtime, the button handles all incoming touch events and calls your methods in response.

You connect a button to your action method using the `addTarget(_:action:for:)` method or by creating a connection in Interface Builder. The signature of an action method takes one of three forms, as shown in the following code. Choose the form that provides the information that you need to respond to the button tap.

@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIButton)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIButton, forEvent event: UIEvent)

- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent*)event;

### Configure a button’s appearance

A button’s type defines its basic appearance and behavior. You specify the type of a button at creation time using the `init(type:)` method or in your storyboard file. After creating a button, you can’t change its type. The most commonly used button types are the Custom and System types, but use the other types when appropriate.

#### Configure button states

Buttons have five states that define their appearance: default, highlighted, focused, selected, and disabled. When you add a button to your interface, it’s in the default state initially, which means the button is enabled and the user isn’t interacting with it. As the user interacts with the button, its state changes to the other values. For example, when the user taps a button with a title, the button moves to the highlighted state.

When configuring a button either programmatically or in Interface Builder, you specify attributes for each state separately. In Interface Builder, use the State Config control in the Attributes inspector to choose the appropriate state and then configure the other attributes. If you don’t specify attributes for a particular state, the `UIButton` class provides a reasonable default behavior. For example, a disabled button is normally dimmed and doesn’t display a highlight when tapped. Other properties of this class, such as the `adjustsImageWhenHighlighted` and `adjustsImageWhenDisabled` properties, let you alter the default behavior in specific cases.

#### Provide content

The content of a button consists of a title string or image that you specify. The content you specify is used to configure the `UILabel` and `UIImageView` object managed by the button itself. You can access these objects using the `titleLabel` or `imageView` properties and modify their values directly. The methods of this class also provide a convenient shortcut for configuring the appearance of your string or image.

Normally, you configure a button using either a title or an image and size the button accordingly. Buttons can also have a background image, which is positioned behind the content you specify. It’s possible to specify both an image and a title for buttons, which results in the appearance shown in the following image. You can access the current content of a button using the indicated properties.

When setting the content of a button, you must specify the title, image, and appearance attributes for each state separately. If you don’t customize the content for a particular state, the button uses the values associated with the Default state and adds any appropriate customizations. For example, in the highlighted state, an image-based button draws a highlight on top of the default image if no custom image is provided.

#### Customize tint color

You can specify a custom button tint using the `tintColor` property. This property sets the color of the button image and text. If you don’t explicitly set a tint color, the button uses its superview’s tint color.

#### Specify edge insets

Use insets to add or remove space around the content in your custom or system buttons. You can specify separate insets for your button’s title ( `titleEdgeInsets`), image ( `imageEdgeInsets`), and both the title and image together ( `contentEdgeInsets`). When applied, insets affect the corresponding content rectangle of the button, which the Auto Layout engine uses to determine the button’s position.

There should be no reason for you to adjust the edge insets for info, contact, or disclosure buttons.

### Configure button attributes in Interface Builder

The following table lists the core attributes that you configure for buttons in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Type | The button type. This attribute determines the default settings for many other button attributes. The value of this attribute can’t be changed at runtime, but you can access it using the `buttonType` property. |
| State Config | The state selector. After selecting a value in this control, changes to the button’s attributes apply to the specified state. |
| Title | The button’s title. You can specify a button’s title as a plain string or attributed string. |
| (Title Font and Attributes) | The font and other attributes to apply to the button’s title string. The specific configuration options depends on whether you specified a plain string or attributed string for the button’s title. For a plain string, you can customize the font, text color, and shadow color. For an attributed string, you can specify alignment, text direction, indentation, hyphenation, and many other options. |
| Image | The button’s foreground image. Typically, you use template images for a button’s foreground, but you may specify any image in your Xcode project. |
| Background | The button’s background image. The background image is displayed behind its title and foreground image. |

The following table lists attributes that affect the button’s appearance.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Shadow Offset | The offsets and behavior of the button’s shadow. Shadows affect title strings only. Enable the Reverses on Highlight option to change the highlighting of the shadow when the button state changes to or from the highlighted state. ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) Configure the offsets programmatically using the `shadowOffset` property of the button’s `titleLabel` object. Configure the highlighting behavior using the `reversesTitleShadowWhenHighlighted` property. |
| Drawing | The drawing behavior of the button. ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) When the Shows Touch On Highlight ( `showsTouchWhenHighlighted`) option is enabled, the button adds a white glow to the part of a button that the user touches. ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) When the Highlighted Adjusts Image ( `adjustsImageWhenHighlighted`) option is enabled, button images get darker when it’s in the highlighted state. ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) When the Disabled Adjusts Image ( `adjustsImageWhenDisabled`) option is enabled, the image is dimmed when the button is disabled. |
| Line Break | The line breaking options for the button’s text. Use this attribute to define how the button’s title is modified to fit the available space. |

The following table lists the edge inset attributes for buttons. Use edge inset buttons to alter the rectangle for the button’s content.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Edge | The edge insets to configure. You can specify separate edge insets for the button’s overall content, its title, and its image. |
| Inset | The inset values. Positive values shrink the corresponding edge, moving it closer to the center of the button. Negative values expand the edge, moving it away from the center of the button. Access these values at runtime using the `contentEdgeInsets`, `titleEdgeInsets`, and `imageEdgeInsets` properties. |

For information about the button’s inherited Interface Builder attributes, see `UIControl` and `UIView`.

### Support localization

To internationalize a button, specify a localized string for the button’s title text. (You may also localize a button’s image as appropriate.)

When using storyboards to build your interface, use Xcode’s base internationalization feature to configure the localizations your project supports. When you add a localization, Xcode creates a strings file for that localization. When configuring your interface programmatically, use the system’s built-in support for loading localized strings and resources. For more information about internationalizing your interface, see Internationalization and Localization Guide.

### Make buttons accessible

Buttons are accessible by default. The default accessibility traits for a button are Button and User Interaction Enabled.

The accessibility label, traits, and hint are spoken . For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.

class UIDatePicker

## Overview

You can use a date picker to allow a user to enter either a point in time (calendar date, time value, or both) or a time interval (for example, for a timer). The date picker reports interactions to its associated target object.

To add a date picker to your interface:

- Set the date picker mode at creation time.

- Supply additional configuration options such as minimum and maximum dates if required.

- Connect an action method to the date picker.

- Set up Auto Layout rules to govern the position of the date picker in your interface.

You use a date picker only for handling the selection of times and dates. If you want to handle the selection of arbitrary items from a list, use a `UIPickerView` object.

### Configure a date picker

The `datePickerMode` property determines the configuration of a date picker. You can set the `datePickerMode` value programmatically or in Interface Builder. For modes that include date or time values, you can also configure the locale, calendar, and time zone information. The date picker uses that information when formatting date and time values for the current user, and defaults to the device’s locale, calendar, and time zone. The `date` property represents the currently selected date in the form of an `NSDate` object, which is calendar and time zone agnostic.

To limit the range of dates that the user can select, assign values to the `minimumDate` and `maximumDate` properties. You can also use the `minuteInterval` property to allow only specific time increments.

Setting the `datePickerMode` property to `UIDatePicker.Mode.countDownTimer` allows the user to choose a duration in hours and minutes. When in this mode, the `countDownDuration` property represents the displayed duration, measured in seconds as an `TimeInterval`. Note that even though you set this property in seconds, the date picker can only show values in minutes.

The figure below shows a date picker configured with the `datePickerMode` property set to `UIDatePicker.Mode.countDownTimer` and the `minuteInterval` property set to `5`. The value of `countDownDuration` is currently `4500`.

### Respond to user interaction

Date pickers use the target-action design pattern to notify your app when the user changes the selected date. To be notified when the date picker’s value changes, register your action method with the `valueChanged` event. At runtime the date picker calls your methods in response to the user selecting a date or time.

You connect a date picker to your action method using the `addTarget(_:action:for:)` method or by creating a connection in Interface Builder. The signature of an action method takes one of three forms, as shown in the following code. Choose the form that provides the information that you need to respond to the value change in the date picker.

@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIDatePicker)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIDatePicker, forEvent event: UIEvent)

- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent*)event;

### Debug date pickers

When debugging issues with date pickers, watch for these common pitfalls:

- **The minimum date must be earlier than the maximum date.** Check the bounds of your `minimumDate` and `maximumDate` properties. If the maximum date is less than the minimum date, both properties are ignored, and the date picker allows the selection of any date value. The minimum and maximum dates are ignored in the countdown-timer mode ( `UIDatePicker.Mode.countDownTimer`).

- **The minute interval must be a divisor of 60.** Check that the `minuteInterval` value can be evenly divided into 60; otherwise, the default value is used ( `1`).

### Configure date picker attributes in Interface Builder

The following table lists the core attributes that you configure for date pickers in Attributes Inspector within Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Style | The date picker style. Determines the appearance of the date picker. Access this value at runtime with the `datePickerStyle` property. |
| Mode | The date picker mode. Determines whether the date picker should display a time, a date, a time and date, or a countdown interval. Access this value at runtime with the `datePickerMode` property. |
| Locale | The locale associated with the date picker. This property allows you to override the system default with a specific locale. You can access this attribute programmatically with the `locale` property. |
| Interval | The granularity of the minutes spinner, if it is shown in the current mode. The default value is 1, and the maximum value is 30. The value you choose must be a divisor of 60 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30). Access this value at runtime with the `minuteInterval` property. |

The following table lists the attributes that control the display of date and time in a date picker.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Date | The initial date that the date picker displays. Defaults to the current date, but you can set a custom value. This attribute is equivalent to setting the `date` property programmatically. |
| Constraints | The range of selectable dates displayed by the date picker. To use a dynamic range, configure the `minimumDate` and `maximumDate` properties programmatically. The date picker ignores these options when the Mode attribute is set to Count Down Timer. |
| Timer | The initial value of the date picker when used in countdown timer mode. The value is measured in seconds, but the display is in minutes. |

For information about the date picker’s inherited Interface Builder attributes, see `UIControl` and `UIView`.

### Change the appearance

You can change the appearance of `UIDatePicker` by setting `preferredDatePickerStyle`. For a list of appearance styles, see `UIDatePickerStyle`.

You should integrate date pickers in your layout using Auto Layout. Although date pickers can be resized, they should be used at their intrinsic content size.

### Specify a locale

Date pickers handle their own internationalization; the only thing you need to do is specify the appropriate locale. You can choose a specific locale for your date picker to appear in by setting the Locale ( `locale`) field in Attributes Inspector. Setting the locale changes the language that the date picker uses for display, but also the format of the date and time (for example, certain locales present days before month names, or prefer a 24-hour clock over a 12-hour clock). The width of the date picker automatically accommodates for the length of the localization. To use the system language, leave this property set to default.

For more information, see Internationalization and Localization Guide.

### Support accessibility and VoiceOver

Date pickers are accessible by default. Each time component in the date picker is its own accessibility element and has the Adjustable ( `adjustable`) trait.

"2 o'clock. Picker item. Adjustable. Swipe up or down with one finger to adjust the value."

For further information about making iOS controls accessible, see the Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.

## Overview

For an example of a page control, see the Weather app when it’s configured to display information for more than one location.

When a user taps a page control to move to the next or previous page, the control sends the `valueChanged` event for handling by the delegate. The delegate can then evaluate the `currentPage` property to determine the page to display. The page control advances only one page in either direction. The currently viewed page is indicated by a white dot. Depending on the device, a certain number of dots are displayed on the screen before they’re clipped.

# UISegmentedControl

A horizontal control that consists of multiple segments, each segment functioning as a discrete button.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UISegmentedControl

## Mentioned in

Attaching gesture recognizers to UIKit controls

## Overview

A segmented control can display a title (an `NSString` object) or an image ( `UIImage` object). The `UISegmentedControl` object automatically resizes segments to fit proportionally within their superview unless they have a specific width set. When you add and remove segments, you can request that the action be animated with sliding and fading effects.

You register the target-action methods for a segmented control using the `valueChanged` constant as shown below.

segmentedControl.addTarget(self, action: "action:", forControlEvents: .valueChanged)

[segmentedControl addTarget:self\
action:@selector(action:)\
forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];

How you configure a segmented control can affect its display behavior:

- If you set a segmented control to have a momentary style, a segment doesn’t show itself as selected (blue background) when the user touches it. The disclosure button is always momentary and doesn’t affect the actual selection.

- In versions of iOS prior to 3.0, if a segmented control has only two segments, then it behaves like a switch — tapping the currently-selected segment causes the other segment to be selected. In iOS 3.0 and later, tapping the currently-selected segment doesn’t cause the other segment to be selected.

### Customize appearance

You can customize the appearance of segmented controls using the methods listed in Customizing appearance. You can customize the appearance of all segmented controls using the appearance proxy (for example, `[UISegmentedControl appearance]`), or just of a single control.

When customizing appearance, in general, you should specify a value for the normal state of a property to be used by other states which don’t have a custom value set. Similarly, when a property is dependent on the bar metrics (on the iPhone in landscape orientation, bars have a different height from standard), you should make sure you specify a value for `UIBarMetrics.default`.

In the case of the segmented control, appearance properties for `landscapePhone` are only respected for segmented controls in the smaller navigation and toolbars that are used in landscape orientation on the iPhone.

To provide complete customization, you need to provide divider images for different state combinations, using `setDividerImage(_:forLeftSegmentState:rightSegmentState:barMetrics:)`:

// Image between two unselected segments.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal,
rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)

// Image between segment selected on the left and unselected on the right.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Selected,
rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)

// Image between segment selected on the right and unselected on the left.
mySegmentedControl.setDividerImage(myImage, forLeftSegmentState: UIControlState.Normal,
rightSegmentState: UIControlState.Selected, barMetrics: UIBarMetrics.Default)

// Image between two unselected segments.
[mySegmentedControl setDividerImage:image1 forLeftSegmentState:UIControlStateNormal\
rightSegmentState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:barMetrics];
// Image between segment selected on the left and unselected on the right.
[mySegmentedControl setDividerImage:image1 forLeftSegmentState:UIControlStateSelected\
rightSegmentState:UIControlStateNormal barMetrics:barMetrics];
// Image between segment selected on the right and unselected on the right.
[mySegmentedControl setDividerImage:image1 forLeftSegmentState:UIControlStateNormal\
rightSegmentState:UIControlStateSelected barMetrics:barMetrics];

Attaching gesture recognizers to UIKit controls

Responding to control-based events using target-action

## Overview

As you move the _thumb_ of a slider, it passes its updated value to any actions attached to it. The appearance of sliders is configurable; you can tint the track and the thumb, and provide images to appear at the ends of the slider. You can add sliders to your interface programmatically or by using Interface Builder.

The following image shows the terms used to describe the constituent parts of a `UISlider` object in a left-to-right configuration.

To add a slider to your interface:

- Specify the range of values the slider represents.

- Optionally, configure the appearance of the slider with appropriate tint colors, and limit images.

- Connect one or more action methods to the slider.

- Set up Auto Layout rules to govern the size and position of the slider in your interface.

### Respond to user interaction

Sliders use the target-action design pattern to notify your app when the user moves the slider. To be notified when the slider’s value changes, register your action method with the `valueChanged` event. At runtime, the slider calls your method in response to the user changing the slider’s value.

By default, the slider sends value-changed events continuously as the user moves the slider’s thumb control. Setting the `isContinuous` property to `false` causes the slider to send an event only when the user releases the slider’s thumb control, setting the final value.

You connect a slider to your action method by using the `addTarget(_:action:for:)` method or by creating a connection in Interface Builder. The signature of an action method takes one of three forms, as shown in the following code. Choose the form that provides the information that you need to respond to the value change in the slider.

@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UISlider)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UISlider, forEvent event: UIEvent)

- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender forEvent:(UIEvent*)event;

### Debug sliders

When debugging issues with sliders, follow these tips to avoid common pitfalls:

- **Use either a custom tint color or a custom image, but not both.** When customizing slider appearance with images or tint, use one option or the other, but not both. Conflicting settings for track and thumb appearance are resolved in favor of the most recently set value. For example, setting a new minimum track image for any state clears any custom tint color you may have provided for minimum track images. Similarly, setting the thumb tint color removes any custom thumb images associated with the slider.

- **The current value must be between the minimum and maximum values.** If you try to programmatically set a slider’s current value to be below the minimum or above the maximum, it’s set to the minimum or maximum instead. However, if you set the value beyond the range of the minimum or maximum in Interface Builder, the minimum or minimum values are updated instead.

- **Set custom images for all control states.** If you use custom track and thumb images for your slider, remember to set an image for every possible `UIControl.State`. Any control state that doesn’t have a corresponding custom image assigned to it displays the standard image instead. If you set one custom image, be sure to set them all.

### Configure slider attributes in Interface Builder

The following table lists the core attributes that you configure for sliders in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Value Minimum / Maximum | Specifies the values attached to the endpoints of the slider, the minimum representing the leading end of the slider and the maximum representing the trailing end. Access these values at runtime using the `minimumValue` and `maximumValue` properties. |
| Value Current | Represents the initial value of the slider. The value must be between the minimum and maximum values. Access this value at runtime with the `value` property. |

The following table lists the attributes that control the appearance of a slider.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Min Image | Specifies the image displayed at the leading end of the slider. If blank, no image is displayed. Access this value at runtime with the `minimumValueImage` property. |
| Max Image | Specifies the image displayed at the trailing end of the slider. If blank, no image is displayed. Access this value at runtime with the `maximumValueImage` property. |
| Min Track Tint | Specifies the tint color of the track to the leading side of the slider’s thumb. The value defaults to the slider’s inherited tint color. Access this value at runtime with the `minimumTrackTintColor` property. |
| Max Track Tint | Specifies the tint color of the track to the trailing side of the slider’s thumb. Access this value at runtime with the `maximumTrackTintColor` property. |
| Thumb Tint | Controls the tint color of the slider’s thumb. Access this value at runtime with the `thumbTintColor` property. |

The following table lists the attributes that configure the events associated with a slider.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Events: Continuous Updates | Controls when attached actions are triggered: when checked, action events are called whenever the thumb is moved during user interaction. When not checked, attached actions are triggered only on completion of user interaction. Access this value at runtime with the `isContinuous` property. |

For information about the sliders’s inherited Interface Builder attributes, see `UIControl` and `UIView`.

### Customize the slider’s appearance

Use Auto Layout to specify the position and width of a slider. The intrinsic height is determined by the intrinsic heights of the minimum and maximum images, if present. The width of the track automatically adjusts to accommodate the minimum and maximum images.

The most common way to customize the slider’s appearance is to provide custom minimum and maximum value images. These images sit at either end of the slider control and indicate which value that end of the slider represents. Set the values of the `minimumValueImage` and `maximumValueImage` properties to appropriate `UIImage` objects to display images at the ends of the slider. The following image shows a slider configured with minimum and maximum images that imply volume adjustment.

To set custom tint colors for both the track and the thumb of a slider, use the `minimumTrackTintColor`, `maximumTrackTintColor`, and `thumbTintColor` properties, as shown in the following image.

By default, the minimum track tint color defers to the tint color of the slider control.

To completely change the appearance of the slider, you can specify images for the thumb and the track. Provide images for each of the control states (normal, highlighted, and so on) with the `setMinimumTrackImage(_:for:)`, `setMaximumTrackImage(_:for:)`, and `setThumbImage(_:for:)` methods. Set the `capInsets` property for the track images to facilitate horizontal stretching. To access the images used in the current control state, use the `currentMinimumTrackImage`, `currentMaximumTrackImage`, and `currentThumbImage` properties, as shown in the following image.

### Provide localized strings

Sliders have no special properties related to internationalization. However, if you use a slider with a label, make sure you provide localized strings for the label.

Sliders automatically adjust to the appropriate interface direction, ensuring that the minimum end of the slider is always at the leading end and the maximum end at the trailing end. If you override `minimumValueImageRect(forBounds:)` or `maximumValueImageRect(forBounds:)` in a subclass of `UISlider`, be sure to take the user interface layout direction into account.

For more information, see Internationalization and Localization Guide.

### Make sliders accessible

Sliders are accessible by default. The default accessibility traits for a slider are User Interaction Enabled and Adjustable.

"Sound volume: 13 percent. Adjustable. Swipe up or down with one finger to adjust the value."

For more information about making iOS controls accessible, see the accessibility information in `UIControl`. For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.

Attaching gesture recognizers to UIKit controls

## Overview

By default, pressing and holding a stepper’s button increments or decrements the stepper’s value repeatedly. The rate of change depends on how long the user continues pressing the control. To turn off this behavior, set the `autorepeat` property to `false`.

The maximum value must be greater than or equal to the minimum value. If you set a maximum or minimum value that would break this invariant, both values are set to the new value. For example, if the minimum value is 200 and you set a maximum value of 100, then both the minimum and maximum become 200.

Supporting VoiceOver in your app

Adding a Custom Font to Your App

## Overview

You can configure the overall appearance of a label’s text, and use attributed strings to customize the appearance of substrings within the text. Add and customize labels in your interface programmatically, or with the Attributes inspector in Interface Builder.

Follow these steps to add a label to your interface:

- Supply either a string or an attributed string that represents the content.

- If you’re using a nonattributed string, configure the appearance of the label.

- Set up Auto Layout rules to govern the size and position of the label in your interface.

- Provide accessibility information and localized strings.

### Customize the label’s appearance

You provide the content for a label by assigning either a `NSString` object to the `text` property, or an `NSAttributedString` object to the `attributedText` property. The label displays the property set most recently.

The `attributedText` property allows you to control the appearance of individual characters and groups of characters, using the `NSAttributedString` API. The following image shows a label displaying an `NSAttributedString` that includes attributes to customize the font, color, and alignment of the string.

If you want to format the label’s text in a uniform fashion, set the `text` property to an `NSString` object containing the content, and configure the `font`, `textColor`, `textAlignment`, and `lineBreakMode` properties. The following image shows a label displaying an `NSString` with a custom font, color, and alignment.

If you set these appearance properties on a label that displays the content of the `attributedText` property, the label overrides the appropriate attributes and displays the attributed string with a uniform appearance. The following image shows the label from the first image with the `textColor` property set to green.

Specify the maximum number of lines for the label to use when laying out the text with the `numberOfLines` property. Setting a value of `0` allows the label to use as many lines as necessary to lay out the text within the label’s width. Use the `lineBreakMode` property to control how the label splits the text into multiple lines, and the truncation behavior associated with the final line.

Use Auto Layout to position and optionally size the label. The intrinsic content size for a label defaults to the size that displays the entirety of the content on a single line. If you provide Auto Layout constraints that define the width of the label but not the height, the label’s intrinsic content size adjusts the height to display the text completely.

When the label has its size completely defined externally, you can specify how it handles the situation when its content doesn’t fit within the bounds. To reduce the font size, set the `adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth` property to `true` and set the `minimumScaleFactor` property to a value between `0` and `1`. The latter of these properties represents how much smaller than the requested font size the label scales the text. Setting the `allowsDefaultTighteningForTruncation` property to `true` instructs the label to reduce the spacing between characters before truncating the string. The following image shows a label that uses `minimumScaleFactor` and `adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth` to display the content of an entire string that would otherwise have overflowed.

### Design labels for a wide audience

Labels provide valuable information to your users. To make sure that information reaches a wide audience, internationalize text and support accessibility in your labels. For information about how to implement internationalization and localization, see Internationalization. Labels are accessible to VoiceOver by default. The default accessibility traits for a label are Static Text and User Interaction Enabled. For more information, see Supporting VoiceOver in your app. To learn about using text styles to support Dynamic Type, see Scaling Fonts Automatically.

Adding user-focusable elements to a tvOS app

Adopting system selection UI in custom text views

Customizing Writing Tools behavior for UIKit views

## Overview

You use text fields to gather text-based input from the user using the onscreen keyboard. The keyboard is configurable for many different types of input such as plain text, emails, numbers, and so on. Text fields use the target-action mechanism and a delegate object to report changes made during the course of editing.

In addition to its basic text-editing behavior, you can add overlay views to a text field to display additional information and provide additional tappable controls. You might add custom overlay views for elements such as a bookmarks button or search icon. Text fields provide a built-in overlay view to clear the current text. The use of custom overlay views is optional.

After adding a text field to your interface, you configure it for use in your app. Configuration involves performing some or all of the following tasks:

- Configure one or more targets and actions for the text field.

- Configure the keyboard-related attributes of the text field.

- Assign a delegate object to handle important tasks, such as:

- Determining whether the user should be allowed to edit the text field’s contents.

- Validating the text entered by the user.

- Responding to taps in the keyboard’s return button.

- Forwarding the user-entered text to other parts of your app.

- Store a reference to the text field in one of your controller objects.

For information about the methods of the text field’s delegate object, see `UITextFieldDelegate`.

### Show and hide the keyboard

When a text field becomes first responder, the system automatically shows the keyboard and binds its input to the text field. A text field becomes the first responder automatically when the user taps it. You can also force a text field to become the first responder by calling its `becomeFirstResponder()` method. You might force a text field to become first responder when you require the user to enter some information.

You can ask the system to dismiss the keyboard by calling the `resignFirstResponder()` method of your text field. Usually, you dismiss the keyboard in response to specific interactions. For example, you might dismiss the keyboard when the user taps the keyboard’s return key. The system can also dismiss the keyboard in response to user actions. Specifically, the system dismisses the keyboard when the user taps a new control that doesn’t support keyboard input.

The appearance and dismissal of the keyboard affect the editing state of the text field. When the keyboard appears, the text field enters the editing state and sends the appropriate notifications to its delegate. Similarly, when the text field resigns the first responder status, it leaves the editing state and notifies its delegate. For more information about the sequence of events that occur during editing, see Validate text and manage the editing process.

#### Configure the keyboard’s appearance

You customize your text field’s keyboard using the properties of the `UITextInputTraits` protocol, which the `UITextField` class adopts. UIKit supports standard keyboards for the user’s current language and also supports specialized keyboards for entering numbers, URLs, email addresses, and other specific types of information. You use the properties of this protocol to adjust keyboard traits such as the following:

- The type of keyboard to display

- The autocapitalization behavior of the keyboard

- The autocorrection behavior of the keyboard

- The type of return key to display

#### Respond to keyboard-related notifications

Because the system manages the showing and hiding of the keyboard in response to responder changes, it posts the following notifications for tracking the keyboard-related changes:

- `keyboardWillShowNotification`

- `keyboardDidShowNotification`

- `keyboardWillHideNotification`

- `keyboardDidHideNotification`

- `keyboardWillChangeFrameNotification`

- `keyboardDidChangeFrameNotification`

Each notification contains a `userInfo` dictionary that includes the size of the keyboard. Because the keyboard can hide portions of your interface, you should use the size information to reposition your content on the screen. For content embedded in a scroll view, you can scroll the text field into view, as illustrated in the following image. In other cases, you can resize your main content view so that it isn’t covered by the keyboard.

For more information about managing keyboard interactions, see Text Programming Guide for iOS.

### Format the text in a text field

There are two types of formatting you can do to a text field’s text:

- You can change the font, color, and style of the text using properties of this class. Alternatively, you can specify an `NSAttributedString` for the text field’s content.

- You can format the content of a text field using an `Formatter` object.

The `font`, `textColor`, and `textAlignment` properties, among others, affect the appearance of the text field’s string. Modifying these properties applies the specified characteristic to the entire string. To specify more granular formatting, specify the text field’s text using an `NSAttributedString` object.

The `UITextField` class doesn’t provide built-in support for formatting its string using an `Formatter` object, but you can use the text field’s delegate to format the content yourself. To do so, use the text field’s delegate methods to validate text and to format it appropriately. For example, use the `textField(_:shouldChangeCharactersIn:replacementString:)` method to validate and format text while the user is typing. For information about how to use formatter objects, see Data Formatting Guide.

### Use overlay views to edit content

Overlay views are small views displayed on the left and right sides of the text view’s editable area. Typically, overlay views are image-based buttons that you set up as additional editing controls. For example, you might use an overlay view to implement a bookmarks button. To configure a button as an overlay view, specify an image for the button’s content and configure the target and action of the button to respond to taps.

The following code shows how to add a button as the left overlay of a text field. In this case, the code creates a button and configure its size and contents. The `leftViewMode` property specifies when your button is displayed. When the user taps the button, the button calls the configured action method, which in this case is a custom `displayBookmarks:` method.

let overlayButton = UIButton(type: .custom)
let bookmarkImage = UIImage(systemName: "bookmark")
overlayButton.setImage(bookmarkImage, for: .normal)
overlayButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(displayBookmarks),
for: .touchUpInside)
overlayButton.sizeToFit()

// Assign the overlay button to the text field
textField.leftView = overlayButton
textField.leftViewMode = .always

UIButton *overlayButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
UIImage *bookmarkImage = [UIImage systemImageNamed:@"bookmark"];
[overlayButton setImage:bookmarkImage forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[overlayButton addTarget:self action:@selector(displayBookmarks)\
forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
[overlayButton sizeToFit];

// Assign the overlay button to the text field
self.textField.leftView = overlayButton;
self.textField.leftViewMode = UITextFieldViewModeAlways;

When configuring overlay views, consider whether you want your text field to display the built-in clear button. The clear button provides the user with a convenient way to delete all of the text field’s text. This button is displayed in the right overlay position, but if you provide a custom right overlay view, use the `rightViewMode` and `clearButtonMode` properties to define when your custom overlay should be displayed and when the clear button should be displayed.

### Validate text and manage the editing process

A text field manages the editing of its text with the help of its delegate object. As the user interacts with a text field, the text field notifies its delegate and gives it a chance to control what is happening. You can use the delegate methods to prevent the user from starting or stopping the editing process or to validate text as it’s typed. You can also use the delegate methods to perform related tasks, such as updating other parts of your interface based on the information typed by the user.

For more information about using the text field’s delegate to manage editing interactions, see `UITextFieldDelegate`.

### Interface Builder attributes

The following table lists the attributes that you configure for text fields in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Text | The initial text displayed by the text field. You can specify the text as a plain string or as an attributed string. If you specify an attributed string, Interface Builder provides different options for editing the font, color, and formatting of the string. |
| Color | The color of the text field’s text. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `textColor` property. |
| Font | The font of the text field’s text. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `font` property. |
| Alignment | The alignment of the text field’s text inside the editing area. This option is available only when formatting plain strings. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `textAlignment` property. |
| Placeholder | The placeholder text displayed by the text field. When the text field’s string is empty, the text field displays this string instead, formatting the string so as to indicate that it isn’t the actual text. Typing any text into the text field hides this string. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `placeholder` property. |
| Background | The background image to display when the text field is enabled. This image is displayed behind the rest of the text field’s content. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `background` property. |
| Disabled | The background image to display when the text field is disabled. This image is displayed behind the rest of the text field’s content. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `disabledBackground` property. |
| Border Style | The visual style for the text field’s border. This attribute defines the visual border, if any, drawn around the editable text region. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `borderStyle` property. |
| Clear Button | The behavior of the clear button. The clear button is a built-in overlay view that the user taps to delete all of the text in a text field. Use this attribute to define when the clear button appears. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `clearButtonMode` property. |
| Min Font Size | The minimum font size for the text field’s text. When the Adjust to Fit option is enabled, the text field automatically varies the font size to ensure maximum legibility of the text. You can use this attribute to specify the smallest font size that your consider appropriate for your text. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `minimumFontSize` property. |

The following table lists the keyboard-related attributes that you configure for text fields. This attributes correspond to properties of the `UITextInputTraits` protocol that the `UITextField` class adopts.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Capitalization | The automatic capitalization style to apply to typed text. This attribute determines at what time the Shift key is automatically pressed. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `autocapitalizationType` property. |
| Correction | The autocorrection behavior of the text field. This attribute determines whether autocorrection is enabled or disabled during typing. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `autocorrectionType` property. |
| Spell Checking | The spell checking behavior of the text field. This attribute determines whether spell checking is enabled or disabled during typing. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `spellCheckingType` property. |
| Keyboard Type | The style of the text field’s keyboard. This property specifies the type of keyboard displayed when the text field is active. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `keyboardType` property. |
| Appearance | The visual style applied to the text field’s keyboard. Use this property to specify a dark or light keyboard. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `keyboardAppearance` property. |
| Return Key | The type of return key to display on the keyboard. Use this property to configure the text and visual style applied to the keyboard’s return key. You can access the value of this attribute programmatically using the text field’s `returnKeyType` property. ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) The return key is disabled by default and becomes enabled only when the user types some text into the text field. To respond to taps in the Return key, implement the `textFieldShouldReturn(_:)` method in the delegate you assign to the text field. |

For information about additional attributes you can configure for a text view, see `UIControl`.

### Internationalization

The default language of the device affects the keyboard that pops up with the text field (including the return key). You don’t need to do anything to enable this functionality; it’s enabled by default. However, your text field should be able to handle input that comes from any language.

When using storyboards to build your interface, use Xcode’s base internationalization feature to configure the localizations your project supports. When you add a localization, Xcode creates a strings file for that localization. When configuring your interface programmatically, use the system’s built-in support for loading localized strings and resources. For more information about internationalizing your interface, see Localization.

### Accessibility

Text fields are accessible by default. The default accessibility trait for a text field is User Interaction Enabled.

For more information about making iOS controls accessible, see the accessibility information in `UIControl`. For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility for UIKit.

### State preservation

When you assign a value to a text field’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it preserves the selected range of text, if any. During the next launch cycle, the text field attempts to restore that selection. If the selection range can’t be applied to the current text, no selection is made. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

Adopting system selection UI in custom text views

## Overview

`UITextView` supports the display of text using custom style information and also supports text editing. You typically use a text view to display multiple lines of text, such as when displaying the body of a large text document.

This class supports multiple text styles through use of the `attributedText` property. (Styled text isn’t supported in versions of iOS earlier than iOS 6.) Setting a value for this property causes the text view to use the style information provided in the attributed string. You can still use the `font`, `textColor`, and `textAlignment` properties to set style attributes, but those properties apply to all of the text in the text view. It’s recommended that you use a text view—and not a `UIWebView` object—to display both plain and rich text in your app.

### Manage the keyboard

When the user taps in an editable text view, that text view becomes the first responder and automatically asks the system to display the associated keyboard. Because the appearance of the keyboard has the potential to obscure portions of your user interface, it’s up to you to make sure that doesn’t happen by repositioning any views that might be obscured. Some system views, like table views, help you by scrolling the first responder into view automatically. If the first responder is at the bottom of the scrolling region, however, you may still need to resize or reposition the scroll view itself to ensure the first responder is visible.

It’s your application’s responsibility to dismiss the keyboard at the time of your choosing. You might dismiss the keyboard in response to a specific user action, such as the user tapping a particular button in your user interface. To dismiss the keyboard, send the `resignFirstResponder()` message to the text view that’s currently the first responder. Doing so causes the text view object to end the current editing session (with the delegate object’s consent) and hide the keyboard.

The appearance of the keyboard itself can be customized using the properties provided by the `UITextInputTraits` protocol. Text view objects implement this protocol and support the properties it defines. You can use these properties to specify the type of keyboard (ASCII, Numbers, URL, Email, and others) to display. You can also configure the basic text entry behavior of the keyboard, such as whether it supports automatic capitalization and correction of the text.

### Keyboard notifications

When the system shows or hides the keyboard, it posts several keyboard notifications. These notifications contain information about the keyboard, including its size, which you can use for calculations that involve repositioning or resizing views. Registering for these notifications is the only way to get some types of information about the keyboard. The system delivers the following notifications for keyboard-related events:

- `keyboardWillShowNotification`

- `keyboardDidShowNotification`

- `keyboardWillHideNotification`

- `keyboardDidHideNotification`

For more information about these notifications, see their descriptions in `UIWindow`.

### State preservation

In iOS 6 and later, if you assign a value to this view’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it preserves the following information:

- The selected range of text, as reported by the `selectedRange` property.

- The editing state of the text view, as reported by the `isEditable` property.

During the next launch cycle, the view attempts to restore these properties to their saved values. If the selection range can’t be applied to the text in the restored view, no text is selected. For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

# Drag and drop customization

Extend the standard drag and drop support for text views to include custom types of content.

## Overview

The `UITextField` and `UITextView` classes provide built-in support for dragging and dropping text and images. You can extend this support to your own custom data types by adding a text drag delegate or text drop delegate to your views. Your text drag delegate adopts the `UITextDragDelegate` protocol and is responsible for providing the items to be dragged. Your text drop delegate adopts the `UITextDropDelegate` protocol and handles drops containing items with your custom data types.

# UISearchTextField

A view for displaying and editing text and search tokens.

@MainActor
class UISearchTextField

## Overview

Use a search text field to display search criteria represented as text and tokens, and allow the user to edit that criteria. Tokens are discrete representations of nontextual content that your app can create and use to represent filters that limit the search results. Tokens always occur contiguously before any text in the search field.

`UISearchBar` hosts a search text field, but you may also use a search text field in other roles, such as the title view of a `UINavigationItem`.

Tokens can be programmatically selected by including their position in a range assigned to the `selectedTextRange` property.

## Topics

## Overview

Use search tokens to help users understand and edit complex search queries in a `UISearchTextField`. A token acts like a single character in standard text interactions such as deleting, selecting, or dragging. A search token should always have text and may also have an icon.

Assign a `representedObject` to each search token that’s meaningful to your app. By attaching this extra data to the token you can reconstruct the full search query using information available in the search field when, for example, your app starts from state restoration or the user starts a search.

See Using suggested searches with a search controller to learn how to use search tokens.

Class

# UIVisualEffectView

An object that implements some complex visual effects.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIVisualEffectView

## Overview

Depending on the desired effect, the effect may affect content layered behind the view or content added to the visual effect view’s `contentView`. Apply a visual effect view to an existing view and then apply a `UIBlurEffect` or `UIVibrancyEffect` object to apply a blur or vibrancy effect to the existing view. After you add the visual effect view to the view hierarchy, add any subviews to the `contentView` property of the visual effect view. Don’t add subviews directly to the visual effect view itself.

### Set the correct alpha value

When using the `UIVisualEffectView` class, avoid alpha values that are less than 1. Creating views that are partially transparent causes the system to combine the view and all the associated subviews during an offscreen render pass. `UIVisualEffectView` objects need to be combined as part of the content they’re layered on top of in order to look correct. Setting the alpha to less than 1 on the visual effect view or any of its superviews causes many effects to look incorrect or not show up at all.

### Use masks with a visual effect view

Masks directly applied to a `UIVisualEffectView` are forwarded to the internal views that provide the visual effect, including the `contentView` itself. You can also apply masks directly to the `contentView`. Applying a mask to a superview of a `UIVisualEffectView` object causes the effect to fail, and an exception is thrown.

Any mask provided to `UIVisualEffectView` isn’t the view that actually performs the mask. UIKit makes a copy of the view and applies it to each subview. To reflect a size change to the mask, you must apply the change to the original mask and reset it on the effect view.

### Capture a snapshot of a visual effect view

Many effects require support from the window that hosts the `UIVisualEffectView`. Attempting to take a snapshot of only the `UIVisualEffectView` results in a snapshot that doesn’t contain the effect. To take a snapshot of a view hierarchy that contains a `UIVisualEffectView`, you must take a snapshot of the entire `UIWindow` or `UIScreen` that contains it.

## Overview

A vibrancy effect is intended to be used as a subview of or layered on top of a `UIVisualEffectView` that has been configured with a `UIBlurEffect`. The use of a vibrancy effect can help the content placed inside the `contentView` become more vivid.

The vibrancy effect is color-dependent. Any subviews that you add to the `contentView` must implement the `tintColorDidChange()` method and update themselves accordingly. `UIImageView` objects with images that have a rendering mode of `UIImage.RenderingMode.alwaysTemplate` as well as `UILabel` objects update automatically.

You can customize the image to represent the item, and the position of the image, using `image` and `imageInsets` respectively.

You can also specify a custom image and position to use in landscape orientation when using the iPhone appearance idiom using `landscapeImagePhone` and `landscapeImagePhoneInsets` respectively. In addition, you can customize the title’s text attributes using `setTitleTextAttributes(_:for:)`, either for a single item, or for all items by using the appearance proxy (for example, `[UIBarItem appearance]`).

## Overview

You typically use Interface Builder to create and configure bar button items. However, you can customize the appearance of buttons by sending the setter messages to `UIBarButtonItemAppearance` to customize all buttons, or to a specific `UIBarButtonItem` instance. You can use customized buttons in standard places in a `UINavigationItem` object or a `UIToolbar` instance.

In general, specify a value for the normal state so that other states without a custom value set can use it. Similarly, when a property depends on the bar metrics (for instance, on the iPhone in landscape orientation, bars have a different height from the standard), specify a value of `UIBarMetrics.default`.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibarbuttonitemgroup

- UIKit
- UIBarButtonItemGroup

Class

# UIBarButtonItemGroup

A group of one or more bar button items for placement on a navigation bar or shortcuts bar.

@MainActor
class UIBarButtonItemGroup

## Overview

A group contains one or more bar button items and an optional representative item that’s displayed instead of the individual items under space constraints. You can create any number of groups and configure each group with any number of items.

When creating a group with more than one bar button item, it’s recommended that you also provide a representative item to display. The representative item must be a completely separate bar button item; it must not be one of the items already in the group. UIKit displays the representative item when there isn’t enough room to display all of the group’s items in the bar. Taps in the representative item call that item’s action method. When you don’t specify an action method, UIKit automatically displays the items in the group using a standard interface. To present your own interface, provide a custom action method and use it to display the interface you want.

### Support the shortcuts bar

After configuring a group, assign it to the `UITextInputAssistantItem` object associated with one of your app’s responder objects. Your custom items are displayed only in conjunction with the system keyboard. When the keyboard is displayed, UIKit retrieves your custom groups from the text input assistant item and adds the corresponding items to the shortcuts bar. You may specify more than one group before and after the typing suggestions. UIKit tries to display as many items as possible on the shortcuts bar, falling

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

A `UINavigationBar` object is a bar, typically displayed at the top of the window, containing buttons for navigating within a hierarchy of screens. The primary components are a left (back) button, a center title, and an optional right button. You can use a navigation bar as a standalone object or in conjunction with a navigation controller object.

A navigation bar is most commonly used within a navigation controller. The `UINavigationController` object creates, displays, and manages its associated navigation bar, and uses attributes of the view controllers you add to control the content displayed in the navigation bar.

To control a navigation bar when using a navigation controller, the following steps are required:

- Create a navigation controller in Interface Builder or in the code.

- Configure the appearance of the navigation bar using the `navigationBar` property on the `UINavigationController` object.

- Control the content of the navigation bar by setting the `title` and `navigationItem` properties on each `UIViewController` you push onto the navigation controller’s stack.

You can also use a standalone navigation bar, without using a navigation controller. To add a navigation bar to your interface, the following steps are required:

- Set up Auto Layout rules to govern the position of the navigation bar in your interface.

- Create a root navigation item to supply the initial title.

- Configure a delegate object to handle user interactions with the navigation bar.

- Customize the appearance of the navigation bar.

- Configure your app to push and pop relevant navigation items as the user navigates through the hierarchical screens.

### Use a navigation bar with a navigation controller

If you use a navigation controller to manage the navigation between different screens of content, the navigation controller creates a navigation bar automatically and pushes and pops navigation items when appropriate.

A navigation controller uses the `navigationItem` property on `UIViewController` to provide the model objects to its navigation bar when navigating a stack of view controllers. The default navigation item uses the view controller’s title, but you can override the `navigationItem` on a `UIViewController` subclass to gain complete control of the navigation bar’s content.

A navigation controller automatically assigns itself as the delegate of its navigation bar object. Therefore, when using a navigation controller, don’t assign a custom delegate object to the corresponding navigation bar.

To access the navigation bar associated with a navigation controller, use the `navigationBar` property on `UINavigationController`. See Customize the appearance of a navigation bar for details on how to customize the appearance of a navigation bar.

For information about navigation controllers, see `UINavigationController`.

### Add content to a standalone navigation bar

In the vast majority of scenarios you use a navigation bar as part of a navigation controller. However, there are situations for which you might want to use the navigation bar UI and implement your own approach to content navigation. In these situations, you can use a standalone navigation bar.

When you use a navigation bar as a standalone object, you’re responsible for providing its content. Unlike other types of views, you don’t add subviews to a navigation bar directly. Instead, you use a navigation item (an instance of the `UINavigationItem` class) to specify what buttons or custom views you want displayed. A navigation item has properties for specifying views on the left, right, and center of the navigation bar and for specifying a custom prompt string.

A navigation bar manages a stack of `UINavigationItem` objects. Although the stack is there mostly to support navigation controllers, you can use it to implement your own custom navigation interface. The topmost item in the stack represents the navigation item whose contents are currently displayed by the navigation bar. You push new navigation items onto the stack using the `pushItem(_:animated:)` method and pop items off the stack using the `popItem(animated:)` method. Both of these changes can be animated for the benefit of the user.

In addition to pushing and popping items, you can also set the contents of the stack directly using either the `items` property or the `setItems(_:animated:)` method. You might use this method at launch time to restore your interface to its previous state or to push or pop more than one navigation item at a time. The following figure shows the part of the `UINavigationBar` API responsible for managing the stack of navigation items.

If you’re using a navigation bar as a standalone object, assign a custom delegate object to the `delegate` property and use that object to intercept messages coming from the navigation bar. Delegate objects must conform to the `UINavigationBarDelegate` protocol. The delegate notifications let you track when navigation items are pushed or popped from the stack. You use these notifications to update the rest of your app’s user interface.

For more information about creating navigation items, see `UINavigationItem`. For more information about implementing a delegate object, see `UINavigationBarDelegate`.

### Customize the appearance of a navigation bar

Navigation bars have two standard appearance styles: white with dark text or black with light text. Use the `barStyle` property to select the style. Any changes you make to other navigation bar appearance properties override those inferred from the bar style.

Navigation bars are translucent by default; their background color is semitransparent. You can make the navigation bar opaque by setting the `isTranslucent` property to `false`.

You can specify a custom tint color for a navigation bar background using the `barTintColor` property. Setting this property overrides the default color inferred from the bar style. As with all `UIView` subclasses, you can control the color of the interactive elements within navigation bars, including button images and titles, using the `tintColor` property.

The `titleTextAttributes` property specifies the attributes for displaying the bar’s title text. You can specify the font, text color, text shadow color, and text shadow offset for the title in the text attributes dictionary using the `font`, `foregroundColor`, and `shadow` keys in Swift and the `NSFontAttributeName`, `NSForegroundColorAttributeName`, and `NSShadowAttributeName` keys in Objective-C, respectively. For more information about string-formatting attributes, see `Character Attributes`.

Use the `setTitleVerticalPositionAdjustment(_:for:)` method to adjust the vertical position of the title. This method allows you to specify the adjustment dependent on the bar height, which is represented by the `UIBarMetrics` enum. The following figure shows a navigation bar with custom tint color, title text attributes, and bar tint color.

To allow complete customization over the appearance of navigation bars, you can additionally provide custom background and shadow images. To provide a custom background image, use the `setBackgroundImage(_:for:barMetrics:)` method, providing a `UIImage` object for the appropriate bar position and metrics values. Use a `UIBarPosition` value for the bar position argument to specify whether to use the supplied image at the bottom or the top of the window, and if it appears at the top, whether to extend it upward under the status bar. Similarly, you can specify that the image should be used for either compact or default bar metrics, with or without a prompt, by providing a `UIBarMetrics` value to the bar metrics argument.

To add a shadow, provide a resizable `UIImage` to the `shadowImage` property. To use the custom shadow image, you need to have specified a custom background image. The following figure shows a navigation bar with a custom background image, supplied using `setBackgroundImage(_:for:barMetrics:)` with a bar position value of `UIBarPosition.topAttached` and a bar metrics value of `UIBarMetrics.default`. A custom image has also been provided to the `shadowImage` property.

To see examples of customizing a navigation bar, see Customizing your app’s navigation bar.

### Customize a navigation bar with Interface Builder

The following table lists the core attributes that you configure for navigations bars in the Attributes Inspector within Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Style | Specifies the UI bar style to apply to the navigation bar. The bar style controls the title color and the bar tint color, but you can override it by providing values for those attributes. Select Translucent to make the navigation bar semitransparent. Access these values at runtime with the `barStyle` and `isTranslucent` properties. |
| Bar Tint | Controls the tint color of the navigation bar. This overrides the value implied by the Style attribute. If the Translucent attribute is selected, the Bar Tint color is automatically made semitransparent. Access this value at runtime with the `barTintColor` property. |
| Shadow Image | Represents the image used as a shadow beneath the navigation bar. This image is stretched horizontally to match the width of the bar. Access this value at runtime with the `shadowImage` property. |
| Back Image | Specifies the image that appears at the leading edge of the back button. This attribute must be used in combination with the Back Mask attribute. Access this value at runtime with the `backIndicatorImage` property. |
| Back Mask | Specifies the mask associated with the Back Image attribute. This is used to control the appearance of the Back button during animated transitions, and therefore must be used in conjunction with the Back Image attribute. Access this value at runtime with the `backIndicatorTransitionMaskImage` property. |

The following table lists the Interface Builder attributes that affect the appearance of the navigation bar’s title.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Title Font | The font used to render the title in the center of the navigation bar. Access this value at runtime with the value stored against the `font` key in Swift or the `NSFontAttributeName` key in Objective-C in the dictionary in the `titleTextAttributes` property. |
| Title Color | The color used to render the navigation bar title. Access this value at runtime using the `foregroundColor` key in Swift or the `NSForegroundColorAttributeName` key in Objective-C in the dictionary in the `titleTextAttributes` property. |
| Title Shadow | Specifies the color and offset of the shadow used when rendering the navigation bar’s title. Access these values at runtime with the dictionary in the \ [`titleTextAttributes`\] property, using the `shadow` key in Swift or the `NSShadowAttributeName` key in Objective-C. |

### Internationalize a navigation bar

To internationalize navigation bars, specify a localized string for each of the displayed string properties of the navigation item model objects.

For more information about internationalizing your interface, see Internationalization and Localization Guide.

### Make a navigation bar accessible

Navigation bars are accessible by default. The default accessibility trait for a navigation bar is User Interaction Enabled.

With VoiceOver enabled on an iOS device, after the user navigates to a new view in the hierarchy, VoiceOver reads the navigation bar’s title, followed by the name of the left bar button item. When the user taps an element in a navigation bar, VoiceOver reads the name and the type of the element; for example, “General back button,” “Keyboard heading,” and “Edit button.”

For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.

# UISearchBar

A specialized view for receiving search-related information from the user.

@MainActor
class UISearchBar

## Overview

`UISearchBar` provides a text field for entering text, a search button, a bookmark button, and a cancel button. A search bar doesn’t actually perform any searches. You use a delegate, an object conforming to the `UISearchBarDelegate` protocol, to implement the actions when the user enters text or clicks buttons. For details about interacting with the text field, accessing its content, and using tokens, see `UISearchTextField` and `UISearchToken`.

### Customize appearance

You can customize the appearance of search bars one at a time, or you can use the appearance proxy ( `[UISearchBar appearance]`) to customize the appearance of all search bars in an app.

In general, you should specify a value for the normal state to be used by other states which don’t have a custom value set. Similarly, when a property is dependent on the bar metrics (on iPhone, in landscape orientation bars have a different height from standard), you should specify a value for `UIBarMetricsDefault`.

- UIToolbar

Class

# UIToolbar

A control that displays one or more buttons along the bottom edge of your interface.

@MainActor
class UIToolbar

## Overview

To create toolbar items, use the `UIBarButtonItem` class. To add toolbar items to a toolbar, use the `setItems(_:animated:)` method.

Toolbar images that represent normal and highlighted states of an item derive from the image you set using the inherited `image` property from the `UIBarItem` class. The toolbar’s `tintColor` colors the image.

If you need radio button style controls, use the `UITabBar` class instead of `UIToolbar`.

### Customize appearance

You use the methods listed in Customizing appearance to customize the appearance of toolbars. You send the setter messages to the appearance proxy ( `[UIToolbar appearance]`) to customize all toolbars, or to a specific `UIToolbar` instance. When a property is dependent on the bar metrics, you should typically specify a value for `UIBarMetrics.default` as well as for `landscapePhone`.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UITabBar

## Overview

Typically, you use tab bars in conjunction with a `UITabBarController` object, but you can also use them as standalone controls in your app. Tab bars always appear across the bottom edge of the screen and display the contents of one or more `UITabBarItem` objects. A tab bar’s appearance can be customized with a background image or tint color to suit the needs of your interface. Tapping an item selects and highlights that item, and you use the selection of the item to enable the corresponding mode for your app.

You can configure tab bars programmatically or in Interface Builder. A `UITabBarController` object provides its own tab bar object and you must configure the object provided to you. When creating a tab bar programmatically, use the `init(frame:)` method or another view initializer method to set its initial configuration. Use the methods of this class to configure the appearance of the tab bar. For tab bars you create yourself, you also use the methods of this class to specify the items displayed by the tab bar.

A tab bar reports selections and user customizations to its delegate object. For tab bars you create yourself, use the delegate to respond to selections or to the addition, removal, or reordering of items in the tab bar. (A `UITabBarController` object acts as the delegate for the tab bar it manages.) For more information on implementing a tab bar delegate, see `UITabBarDelegate`.

### Configure the tab bar items

You can configure tab bar items using Interface Builder or create and configure them programmatically in your code. Tab bars in Interface Builder come preconfigured with some initial items and you can add, remove, or reorder items as needed. How you configure items at design time depends on whether your tab bar is associated with a `UITabBarController` object:

- Configuring your tab bar in Interface Builder:

- When a `UITabBarController` object is present, add or remove view controllers to your scene and create relationship segues between the tab bar controller and each new view controller. Creating a relationship segue automatically adds a new item to the tab bar, and deleting an existing relationship segue removes the corresponding tab bar item.

- When a tab bar controller isn’t present, drag tab bar items from the library onto your tab bar.

- Configuring your tab bar programmatically:

- To configure the tab bar associated with a `UITabBarController` object, configure the view controllers associated with the tab bar controller. The tab bar automatically obtains its items from the `tabBarItem` property of each view controller associated with the tab bar controller.

- To configure tab bar items directly, use the `setItems(_:animated:)` method of the tab bar itself.

A tab bar displays all of its tabs onscreen at once, using the `itemPositioning` property to determine how to position items in the available space. If you have more items than can fit in the available space, display only a subset of them and let the user select which tabs are displayed. The `beginCustomizingItems(_:)` method displays an interface for selecting which tab bar items to display.

The contents of each item are stored in a `UITabBarItem` object. Each item contains a title and an image to display in the tab. You can also use tab bar items to add a badge to the corresponding tab. For more information about creating and configuring items, see `UITabBarItem`.

### Respond to tab selections

For tab bars with an associated tab bar controller, the tab bar controller automatically manages selections and displays the appropriate view controller. The only time you have to manage selections yourself is when you create the tab bar without a tab bar controller. The tab bar reports selections to the `tabBar(_:didSelect:)` method of its `delegate` object, which you can use to respond to selection changes. For more information about implementing the delegate object, see `UITabBarDelegate`.

### Configure a tab bar with Interface Builder

The following table lists the attributes that you configure for tab bars in Interface Builder.

| Attribute | Discussion |
| --- | --- |
| Background | The background image to display for the bar. If you specify a stretchable image, the image is stretched to fit the available space; otherwise, the image is tiled. When you configure a background image, the tab bar ignores the tint color information. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `backgroundImage` property. |
| Shadow | The custom shadow image for the tab bar. This attribute is ignored if the tab bar does not also have a custom background image. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `shadowImage` property. |
| Selection | The image to use for the selected tab. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `selectionIndicatorImage` property. |
| Image Tint | The tint color to apply to the selected item. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `tintColor` property. |
| Style | The basic style to apply to the bar. You can configure a tab bar with a dark or light style and the bar can be opaque or translucent. To set the style programmatically, use the `barStyle` and `isTranslucent` properties. |
| Bar Tint | The tint color to apply to the bar. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `barTintColor` property. |
| Item Positioning | The positioning scheme to apply to items. Use this attribute to configure how items are spaced across the length of the tab bar. To set this attribute programmatically, use the `itemPositioning` property. |

### Internationalize a tab bar

To internationalize a tab bar, you must provide localized strings for the tab bar item titles.

For more information, see `Localization`.

### Make a tab bar accessible

Tab bars are accessible by default.

With VoiceOver enabled on an iOS device, when a user touches a tab in a tab bar, VoiceOver reads the title of the tab, its position in the bar, and whether it’s selected. For example in the iTunes app on iPad, you might hear “Selected, Audiobooks, four of seven” or “Genius, six of seven.”

For general information about making your interface accessible, see Accessibility for UIKit.

For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines.

@MainActor
class UITabBarItem

## Overview

A tab bar item is a segment of a tab bar that represents a specific section of your app. A tab bar displays one or more items that allow the user to switch between the different sections. The user can select one item at a time.

The most common approach for displaying a tab bar is to use a tab bar controller. The controller’s tab bar displays an item for each view controller you provide when you set the `viewControllers` property or call the `setViewControllers(_:animated:)` method. You’re responsible for supplying the tab bar items. Do this by setting each view controller’s `tabBarItem` property. When the user selects an item, the tab bar controller displays its view controller. For more information, see `UITabBarController`.

You can also use a tab bar independent of a tab bar controller. After creating a tab bar, add it to your view hierarchy. Provide the items by setting the tab bar’s `items` property or by using the `setItems(_:animated:)` method. In this configuration, you’re responsible for updating the view hierarchy to display the correct content. Use `UITabBarDelegate` to know when the selection changes. For more information, see `UITabBar`.

The system provides several tab bar items for common use cases. If you need a custom item, create one with a title and an image. You can further customize the item by providing an alternate image that appears when the user selects it. By default, the item doesn’t display the images you provide. Instead, it generates new images from the alpha values of your images and tints them. To prevent this, provide images that use the `UIImage.RenderingMode.alwaysOriginal` rendering mode.

An item can adjust its appearance when in certain conditions. For example, you can specify different appearances for inline and compact inline layouts or for when the item’s state changes. To do this, set the item’s `standardAppearance` property. If you don’t want this behavior, you can set the individual properties on the item instead.

A tab bar item can display a supplementary value in a badge that provides extra information to the user. For example, the Phone app uses a badge’s value to display the number of missed calls. You can customize the badge’s appearance, including its background color and text attributes.

protocol UIBarPositioning : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

Bars can be positioned at the bottom of their enclosing view, at the top of their enclosing view, or at both the top of their enclosing view and also the top of the screen. In this last case, the bar will abut the status bar displayed by the system. Bars in this position need to have their background extend above their own frame to the top of the screen. This allows the background to show through the status bar.

The classes that implement bars have paired methods to set a background for a given position and set of metrics. These are named similar to the following: `backgroundImage(for:barMetrics:)` and `setBackgroundImage(_:for:barMetrics:)`. Use these methods to set an appropriate background image for the different possible bar positions and metrics.

The `UINavigationBarDelegate`, `UISearchBarDelegate`, and `UIToolbarDelegate` protocols extend this protocol to allow for the positioning of those bars on the screen.

# UILargeContentViewerInteraction

An interaction that enables a gesture to present the large content viewer for cases when supporting the largest dynamic type sizes isn’t appropriate.

@MainActor
class UILargeContentViewerInteraction

## Overview

Don’t use the large content viewer as a replacement for proper Dynamic Type support. For example, Dynamic Type allows items in a list to grow or shrink vertically to accommodate the user’s preferred font size. Rely on the large content viewer only in situations where items must remain small due to unavoidable design constraints. For example, buttons in a tab bar remain small to leave more room for the main app content.

For more information about allowing your app’s content to adjust to varying font sizes, see Add Dynamic Type support and the Human Interface Guidelines.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uieventattributionview

- UIKit
- UIEventAttributionView

Class

# UIEventAttributionView

An overlay view that verifies user interaction for Web AdAttributionKit.

@MainActor
class UIEventAttributionView

## Overview

Web AdAttributionKit (formerly known as Private Click Measurement, or PCM) is a proposed web standard that allows external websites to measure when external links, such as ads, result in a _conversion_. The external website decides what constitutes a conversion, but it’s often the result of the user making a purchase or signing up for a service. Web AdAttributionKit doesn’t send any user-identifiable information to the remote server, so it protects user privacy, while providing websites the ability to measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns.

Apps running in iOS 17.4 or later can use AdAttributionKit to record click-through impressions on custom rendered ad content using a `UIEventAttributionView`. For more information about click-through in AdAttributionKit, see Presenting ads in your app.

Apps running in iOS 14.5 or later can take advantage of Web AdAttributionKit by sending event attribution data to the browser when opening an external link. If the linked website reports a conversion within 7 days, the browser forwards your appʼs Web AdAttributionKit data to a specified remote server sometime between 24 and 48 hours after the reported conversion.

You can’t subclass `UIEventAttributionView`.

For more information on the proposed Web AdAttributionKit web standard, see Introducing Private Click Measurement and Private Click Measurement Draft Community Group Report.

### Verify user interaction

Event attribution views overlay other UIKit controls to ensure that either handling a tap with `AdAttributionKit` or opening an external link with Web AdAttributionKit data only happens as the result of a user tap. The system doesn’t handle the tap or send event attribution data to the browser unless a `UIEventAttributionView` exists above the tapped control.

### Create an event attribution view

Place an event attribution view above any view that launches external links with event attribution data and make sure there are no other overlapping views above the event attribution view that might intercept taps. `UIEventAttributionView` doesn’t consume tap events, so the behavior of any control below one in the view hierarchy isn’t affected.

If multiple views or controls in your app can launch an external link using Web AdAttributionKit, use a separate `UIEventAttributionView` to overlay each control. While you can use a single `UIEventAttributionView` to validate more than one control, attribution views that cover large portions of the screen may impact performance because the system must validate all user interactions that pass through the attribution view.

Here’s how to add an event attribution view to an in-app advertisement:

// Create an event attribution view.
let eventAttributionView = UIEventAttributionView()

// Place it over the ad view.
eventAttributionView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
adView.addSubview(eventAttributionView)
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([\
adView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: eventAttributionView.topAnchor),\
adView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: eventAttributionView.leadingAnchor),\
adView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: eventAttributionView.trailingAnchor),\
adView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: eventAttributionView.bottomAnchor)\
])

// Create an event attribution view.
UIEventAttributionView *eventAttributionView = [[UIEventAttributionView alloc] init];

// Place it over the ad view.
eventAttributionView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
[adView addSubview:eventAttributionView];
[NSLayoutConstraint activateConstraints: @[\
[adView.topAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:eventAttributionView.topAnchor],\
[adView.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:eventAttributionView.leadingAnchor],\
[adView.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:eventAttributionView.trailingAnchor],\
[adView.bottomAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:eventAttributionView.bottomAnchor]\
]];

Class

# UIEventAttribution

An object that contains event attribution information for Web AdAttributionKit.

@MainActor
class UIEventAttribution

## Overview

Apps use event attribution objects to send data to the browser when opening an external website that supports Web AdAttributionKit (formerly known as Private Click Measurement, or PCM). For more information on the proposed PCM web standard, see Introducing Private Click Measurement and Private Click Measurement Draft Community Group Report.

You can’t subclass `UIEventAttribution`.

### Define an endpoint

In order to use Web AdAttributionKit, your app defines an `Info.plist` key called `NSAdvertisingAttributionReportEndpoint` that contains the URL to which the browser sends event attribution data. When an externally linked website reports that a conversion has occurred, the browser forwards your app’s event attribution data to the endpoint specified in the `Info.plist`. If your app’s `Info.plist` doesn’t contain this key, the browser won’t be able to forward the Web AdAttributionKit data when a conversion occurs.

Send event attribution data to the browser only when your app opens an external link as a result of a user tapping a control that sits below a `UIEventAttributionView` in the app’s view hierarchy. The event attribution view verifies that the user tapped a control. If that control doesn’t sit below an event attribution view, the system won’t send the Web AdAttributionKit data to the browser when opening the external link.

### Create an event attribution data object

Here’s how you create a `UIEventAttribution` object:

let adURL = URL(string: "https://shop.example/tabletStandDeluxe.html")!
let eventAttribution =
UIEventAttribution(sourceIdentifier: 4,
destinationURL: adURL,
sourceDescription: "Banner ad for Tablet Stand Deluxe.",
purchaser: "Shop Example, Inc.")

NSURL *adURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://shop.example/tabletStandDeluxe.html"];
UIEventAttribution *eventAttribution = [[UIEventAttribution alloc]\
initWithSourceIdentifier:4\
destinationURL:adURL\
sourceDescription:@"Banner ad for Tablet Stand Deluxe."\
purchaser:@"Shop Example, Inc."];

### Send event attribution data to the browser

Once you create a `UIEventAttribution` object, send it to the browser when your app opens a URL as the result of a user tap. If the external website reports a conversion within 7 days, the browser forwards the data from the `UIEventAttribution` object to the specified remote server sometime between 24 and 48 hours after the conversion.

There are two different ways to send event attribution data when your app opens an external link, depending on whether your app uses `UIScene` or `UIApplication` for life cycle management. For more information on application life cycle management, see Managing your app’s life cycle.

If your app uses `UIScene`-based life cycle management, create a `UIScene.OpenExternalURLOptions` object, assign the event attribution object you created to its `eventAttribution` property, and call `open(_:options:completionHandler:)`:

let sceneOpenURLOptions = UIScene.OpenExternalURLOptions()
sceneOpenURLOptions.eventAttribution = eventAttribution

self.view.window?.windowScene?.open(adURL,
options: sceneOpenURLOptions,
completionHandler: nil)

UISceneOpenExternalURLOptions *sceneOpenURLOptions = [[UISceneOpenExternalURLOptions alloc] init];
sceneOpenURLOptions.eventAttribution = eventAttribution;
[self.view.window.windowScene openURL:adURL\
options:sceneOpenURLOptions\
completionHandler:^(BOOL success) {\
if (success == NO) {\
// Handle error\
}\
}];

If your app uses `UIApplication`-based life cycle management, create a dictionary that contains the `eventAttribution` key with the `UIEventAttribution` object you created as its value, and call `open(_:options:completionHandler:)`, passing the dictionary using the `options` parameter.

let appOpenURLOptions: [UIApplication.OpenExternalURLOptionsKey : Any] = [\
.eventAttribution: eventAttribution\
]
UIApplication.shared.open(adURL,
options: appOpenURLOptions,
completionHandler: nil)

[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:adURL\
options:appOpenURLOptions\
completionHandler:^(BOOL success) {\
if (success == NO) {\
// Handle error\
}\
}];

### Send event attribution data to SFSafariViewController

If your app displays a web page in `SFSafariViewController` after a person taps an ad, add a `UIEventAttributionView` subview to the ad view or control in order to measure taps. When a person taps the ad, follow these steps:

1. Create an `SFSafariViewController.Configuration` object.

2. Assign the `UIEventAttribution` object you created to the `eventAttribution` property of the `SFSafariViewController.Configuration` object.

3. Initialize an `SFSafariViewController` instance with the configuration object, and present it. `SFSafariViewController` validates that a tap on a `UIEventAttributionView` initiated the navigation to the webpage. If not, it discards the attribution data.

`init(sourceIdentifier: UInt8, destinationURL: URL, sourceDescription: String, purchaser: String)`

Initializes a new event attribution object.

### Setting attribution details

`var destinationURL: URL`

The destination URL to attribute.

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

## Overview

A navigation controller is a container view controller that manages one or more child view controllers in a navigation interface. In this type of interface, only one child view controller is visible at a time. Selecting an item in the view controller pushes a new view controller onscreen using an animation, hiding the previous view controller. Tapping the back button in the navigation bar at the top of the interface removes the top view controller, thereby revealing the view controller underneath.

Use a navigation interface to mimic the organization of hierarchical data managed by your app. At each level of the hierarchy, you provide an appropriate screen (managed by a custom view controller) to display the content at that level. The following image shows an example of the navigation interface presented by the Settings application in iOS Simulator. The first screen presents the user with the list of applications that contain preferences. Selecting an application reveals individual settings and groups of settings for that application. Selecting a group yields more settings and so on. For all but the root view, the navigation controller provides a back button to allow the user to move back up the hierarchy.

A navigation controller object manages its child view controllers using an ordered array, known as the _navigation stack_. The first view controller in the array is the root view controller and represents the bottom of the stack. The last view controller in the array is the topmost item on the stack, and represents the view controller currently being displayed. You add and remove view controllers from the stack using segues or using the methods of this class. The user can also remove the topmost view controller using the back button in the navigation bar or using a left-edge swipe gesture.

The navigation controller manages the navigation bar at the top of the interface and an optional toolbar at the bottom of the interface. The navigation bar is always present and is managed by the navigation controller itself, which updates the navigation bar using the content provided by its child view controllers. When the `isToolbarHidden` property is `false`, the navigation controller similarly updates the toolbar with contents provided by the topmost view controller.

A navigation controller coordinates its behavior with its `delegate` object. The delegate object can override the pushing or popping of view controllers, provide custom animation transitions, and specify the preferred orientation for the navigation interface. The delegate object you provide must conform to the `UINavigationControllerDelegate` protocol.

The following image shows the relationships between the navigation controller and the objects it manages. Use the specified properties of the navigation controller to access these objects.

### Navigation controller views

A navigation controller is a container view controller — that is, it embeds the content of other view controllers inside of itself. You access a navigation controller’s view from its `view` property. This view incorporates the navigation bar, an optional toolbar, and the content view corresponding to the topmost view controller. The following image shows how these views are assembled to present the overall navigation interface. (In this figure, the navigation interface is further embedded inside a tab bar interface.) Although the content of the navigation bar and toolbar views changes, the views themselves don’t. The only view that actually changes is the custom content view provided by the topmost view controller on the navigation stack.

The navigation controller manages the creation, configuration, and display of the navigation bar and optional navigation toolbar. It’s permissible to customize the navigation bar’s appearance-related properties but you must never change its `frame`, `bounds`, or `alpha` values directly. If you subclass `UINavigationBar`, you must initialize your navigation controller using the `init(navigationBarClass:toolbarClass:)` method. To hide or show the navigation bar, use the `isNavigationBarHidden` property or `setNavigationBarHidden(_:animated:)` method.

A navigation controller builds the contents of the navigation bar dynamically using the navigation item objects (instances of the `UINavigationItem` class) associated with the view controllers on the navigation stack. To customize the overall appearance of a navigation bar, use `UIAppearance` APIs. To change the contents of the navigation bar, you must therefore configure the navigation items of your custom view controllers. For more information about navigation items, see `UINavigationItem`.

### Updating the navigation bar

Each time the top-level view controller changes, the navigation controller updates the navigation bar accordingly. Specifically, the navigation controller updates the bar button items displayed in each of the three navigation bar positions: left, middle, and right. Bar button items are instances of the `UIBarButtonItem` class. You can create items with custom content or create standard system items depending on your needs.

Tinting of the navigation bar is controlled by properties of the navigation bar itself. Use the `tintColor` property to change the tint color of items in the bar and use the `barTintColor` property to change the tint color of the bar itself. Navigation bars don’t inherit their tint color from the currently displayed view controller.

For more information about the navigation bar, see `UINavigationBar`. For more information about how to create bar button items, see `UIBarButtonItem`.

#### The left item

For all but the root view controller on the navigation stack, the item on the left side of the navigation bar provides navigation property of the view controller’s navigation item.

- If the top-level view controller doesn’t have a custom left bar button item, but the navigation item of the previous view controller has an object in its `backBarButtonItem` property, the navigation bar displays that item.

- If a custom bar button item isn’t specified by either of the view controllers, a default back button is used and its title is set to the value of the `title` property of the previous view controller — that is, the view controller one level down on the stack. (If there’s only one view controller on the navigation stack, no back button is displayed.)

#### The middle item

The navigation controller updates the middle of the navigation bar as follows:

- If the new top-level view controller has a custom title view, the navigation bar displays that view in place of the default title view. To specify a custom title view, set the `titleView` property of the view controller’s navigation item.

- If no custom title view is set, the navigation bar displays a label containing the view controller’s default title. The string for this label is usually obtained from the `title` property of the view controller itself. If you want to display a different title than the one associated with the view controller, set the `title` property of the view controller’s navigation item instead.

#### The right item

The navigation controller updates the right side of the navigation bar as follows:

- If the new top-level view controller has a custom right bar button item, that item is displayed. To specify a custom right bar button item, set the `rightBarButtonItem` property of the view controller’s navigation item.

- If no custom right bar button item is specified, the navigation bar displays nothing on the right side of the bar.

### Displaying a toolbar

A navigation controller object manages an optional toolbar in its view hierarchy. When displayed, this toolbar obtains its current set of items from the `toolbarItems` property of the active view controller. When the active view controller changes, the navigation controller updates the toolbar items to match the new view controller, animating the new items into position when appropriate.

The navigation toolbar is hidden by default but you can show it for your navigation interface by calling the `setToolbarHidden(_:animated:)` method of your navigation controller object. If not all of your view controllers support toolbar items, your delegate object can call this method to toggle the visibility of the toolbar during subsequent push and pop operations. To use a custom `UIToolbar` subclass, initialize the navigation controller using the `init(navigationBarClass:toolbarClass:)` method. If you use custom toolbar and navigation bar subclasses to create a navigation controller, note that you’re responsible for pushing and setting view controllers before presenting the navigation controller onscreen.

### Adapting to different environments

The navigation interface remains the same in both horizontally compact and horizontally regular environments. When toggling between the two environments, only the size of the navigation controller’s view changes. The navigation controller doesn’t change its view hierarchy or the layout of its views.

When configuring segues between view controllers on a navigation stack, the standard Show and Show Detail segues behave as follows:

Show segue

The navigation controller pushes the specified view controller onto its navigation stack.

Show Detail segue

The navigation controller presents the specified view controller modally.

The behaviors of other segue types are unchanged.

### Interface behaviors

A navigation controller supports the following behaviors for its interface:

Supported interface orientations

A navigation controller object doesn’t consult the view controllers on its navigation stack when determining the supported interface orientations. On iPhone, a navigation controller supports all orientations except portrait upside-down. On iPad, a navigation controller supports all orientations. If the navigation controller has a delegate object, the delegate can specify a different set of supported orientations using the `navigationControllerSupportedInterfaceOrientations(_:)` method.

Presentation context

A navigation controller defines the presentation context for modally presented view controllers. When the modal transition style is `UIModalPresentationStyle.currentContext` or `UIModalPresentationStyle.overCurrentContext`, modal presentations from the view controllers in the navigation stack cover the entire navigation interface.

### State preservation

When you assign a value to a navigation controller’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it attempts to preserve itself and the child view controllers on its navigation stack. The navigation controller starts at the bottom of the stack and moves upward, encoding each view controller that also has a valid restoration identifier string. During the next launch cycle, the navigation controller restores the preserved view controllers to the navigation stack in the same order that they were preserved.

The child view controllers you push onto the navigation stack may use the same restoration identifiers. The navigation controller automatically stores additional information to ensure that each child’s restoration path is unique.

For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see Preserving your app’s UI across launches.

# Managing content in your app’s windows

Build your app’s user interface from view controllers, and change the currently visible view controller when you want to display new content.

## Overview

Each scene in your app’s UI contains a window object and one or more view objects. The window serves as an invisible container for the rest of your UI, acts as a top-level container for your views, and routes events to them. The views provide the actual content that users see onscreen, drawing text, images, and other types of custom content. Windows are long-lived objects, and you dismiss them only when tearing down your scene’s entire UI. By contrast, you might change the views in that window frequently, particularly when you want to display new content or information.

To manage your views effectively and to make it easy to add and remove them from a window, UIKit provides view controllers. A view controller manages a single set of views for your app, and it keeps the information in those views up-to-date. Each window has a root view controller, which you use to specify the window’s initial set of views. When you want to change that set of views, you tell UIKit to present or dismiss additional view controllers. UIKit handles the transition from one set of views to another, and manages your app’s entire interface through your view controller objects. As a result, view controllers play an important role in implementing your UI.

### Define view controllers for each unique page of content

When designing the UI for a new app, first divide that UI into distinct pages of content. Each page represents a unique way to display your app’s custom information. For example, one page might display rows of data in a table, another might display images in a grid, and another might display a set of text fields for capturing data. Only the structure and overall appearance of each page is important; the specific data you display from each page isn’t. In fact, many apps use the same type of page in multiple places, filling each copy with different sets of data.

For each distinct page, define a view controller to represent that page and manage its corresponding views. Defining a view controller always involves subclassing and adding custom behavior. Every view controller needs to do the following:

- Fill its views with data, and update those views when data changes.

- Report data changes .

### Choose the navigation model for your content

Simple apps might display only one screen’s worth of content, but most apps have multiple screen’s worth of content to display. To make navigating between those view controllers easy, UIKit provides container view controllers that implement common navigation models.

A container view controller is a special type of view controller that manages other view controllers, which are known as its child view controllers. The container’s job is to position the root view of each child view controller within the bounds of its own view. Containers may present only one child at a time, or multiple children simultaneously. Containers may also animate their children’s views on and off screen, to provide visual feedback about the type of navigation in effect.

Always use the UIKit container view controllers to implement the common navigation models:

- `UINavigationController` manages a stack of child view controllers in a _navigation interface_. Pushing a new view controller onto the stack replaces the previous view controller. Popping a view controller reveals the view controller underneath.

- `UISplitViewController` manages two child view controllers side-by-side (when space is available) in a _split-view interface_. (When space is constrained, the system displays those view controllers in a navigation interface.) This type of interface is also known as a primary-detail interface.

- `UITabBarController` displays a row of buttons along the bottom of a _tab-bar interface_. Selecting a button displays the child view controller associated with that button.

- `UIPageViewController` manages an ordered sequence of child view controllers, presenting only one or two at a time, in a _paged interface_. The user navigates between those view controllers by swiping or tapping.

You can combine multiple UIKit container view controllers to create new navigation models. For example, it’s common to place a `UINavigationController` in the left pane (or primary pane) of a split-view interface. You can also create new container view controllers of your own, allowing you to create entirely new navigation models that are unique to your app.

In addition to container view controllers, you can replace the contents of the current view controller with a new view controller at any time. Presenting a new view controller covers the previous view controller wholly or partially. Typically, you present new view controllers only as a temporary interruption to the current flow or when your app’s UI is very simple. Don’t use them for more complex navigation schemes.

For information about how to create your own container view controllers, see Creating a custom container view controller.

### Assign a root view controller to each window

The root view controller defines the initial navigation model of your window. If you use storyboards, the root view controller is the initial view controller of your scene’s storyboard file. If you create your windows programmatically, assign a value to the `rootViewController` property of the window before showing the window.

When the root view controller is a container, you must also configure any child view controllers displayed by that container. Most container view controllers provide minimal UI of their own; the children provide the rest of the content. For example, the only visible content provided by a `UISplitViewController` is the separator line between its left and right child view controllers.

# Displaying and managing views with a view controller

Build a view controller in storyboards, configure it with custom views, and fill those views with your app’s data.

## Overview

In the model-view-controller design paradigm, a view controller fits between the view objects that present information onscreen and the data objects that store your app’s content. Specifically, a view controller manages a view hierarchy and the state information needed to keep those views up-to-date. Every UIKit app relies heavily on view controllers to present content, and you frequently define custom view controllers to manage your views and UI-related logic.

Most custom view controllers you create are _content view controllers_ — that is, the view controller owns all of its views and manages interactions with those views. Use content view controllers to present your app’s custom content onscreen, and use your view controller object to manage the transfer of data to and from your custom views.

To define a content view controller, start by subclassing `UIViewController`. If your interface includes a table view or collection view, subclass `UITableViewController` or `UICollectionViewController` instead. New Xcode projects include one or more content view controller classes for you to modify, and you can add more.

### Add views to your view controller

`UIViewController` contains a content view, accessible from the `view` property, which serves as the root view of its view hierarchy. To that root view, you add the custom views you need to present your interface. In storyboards, you add views by dragging them onto the view controller scene. For example, the following figure shows a view controller with an image view and button on an iPhone.

After adding views to a view controller, always add Auto Layout constraints to set the size and position of those views. Constraints are rules that specify how to size and position each view relative to its parent or sibling view, and they ensure that your views automatically adapt to different environments and devices. For more information, see View layout.

### Store references to important views

At runtime, you may need to access views from your view controller’s code. For example, you might want to fetch the text in a text view or change the image in an image view. For that, you need a reference to the view in your view hierarchy. You create those references using outlets.

An outlet is a property in your view controller that includes the `IBOutlet` keyword. The presence of that keyword tells Xcode to expose that property in your storyboard. The following example code shows the definitions for two outlets. In Swift, include the `weak` keyword to prevent your view controller from holding a second strong reference to the view—the first originates from the view hierarchy itself.

@IBOutlet weak var imageView : UIImageView?
@IBOutlet weak var button : UIButton?

@property IBOutlet UIImageView* imageView;
@property IBOutlet UIButton* button;

In your storyboard, connect each outlet to the corresponding view, as described in Add an outlet connection to send a message to a UI object. You don’t need to store references to all views in your view hierarchy; store references only to the views you modify later.

When you instantiate a view controller, UIKit reconnects any outlets that you configured in your storyboard. UIKit reestablishes these connections before calling your view controller’s `viewDidLoad()` method, so you can access the objects in those properties from that method. If you create any views programmatically, you must explicitly assign those views to the appropriate properties of your view controller.

### Handle events occurring in views and controls

Controls use the target-action design pattern to report user interactions, and some views post notifications or call delegate methods in response to changes. A view controller needs to know about many of these interactions so it can update its views, and you have several ways to make that happen:

- Implement delegate and action methods in your view controller. This option is simple and easy to implement, but it offers less flexibility and makes it harder to test and validate your code.

- Implement delegate and action methods in a class extension on your view controller. This option separates your event-handling code from the rest of your view controller, making it easier to test and validate that code.

- Implement delegate and action methods in dedicated objects that then forward relevant information to your view controller. This option offers the most flexibility and reusability. The separation of responsibilities also makes it easier to write unit tests.

To respond to user interactions with controls, define an action method with one of the signatures shown in the following code listing. In your method definition, you may replace the generic reference to `UIControl` with a more specific control class.

@IBAction func doSomething()
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIControl)
@IBAction func doSomething(sender: UIControl, forEvent event: UIEvent)

- (IBAction)doSomething;
- (IBAction)doSomething:(UIControl*)sender;

### Prepare your views to appear onscreen

UIKit gives you several opportunities to configure your view controller and views before displaying them onscreen. When you instantiate your view controller from a storyboard, UIKit creates that object using its doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/oslog/oslogentry/init(coder:) method.

When you present a view controller onscreen, UIKit needs to first load and configure the corresponding views, which it does using the following sequence of steps:

1. Creates each view using the view’s doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/oslog/oslogentry/init(coder:) method

2. Connects views to the corresponding actions and outlets in the view controller

3. Calls the `awakeFromNib()` method of each view and the view controller

4. Assigns the view hierarchy to the view controller’s `view` property

5. Calls the view controller’s `viewDidLoad()` method

At load time, perform only the one-time configuration steps you need to prepare the view controller for use. Use load time to create and configure any additional views that aren’t part of your storyboard. Don’t perform tasks that need to happen each time your view controller appears onscreen. For example, don’t start animations or update the values of views.

Perform any final view-related tasks as your views first appear onscreen. UIKit notifies the owning view controller when its views are appearing onscreen, and updates the layout of those views to fit the current environment in the following manner:

01. Calls `viewWillAppear(_:)` at the start of the transition

02. Adds the view to the hierarchy

03. Updates the trait collections of the view controller and its view

04. Updates the geometry of the view, including its size and position in its superview. Updates layout margins and the safe area, and calls `viewLayoutMarginsDidChange()` and `viewSafeAreaInsetsDidChange()`, if needed

05. Calls the `viewIsAppearing(_:)` method to let you know the view controller’s view is appearing onscreen

06. Calls the `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` method

07. Updates the layout of the view hierarchy

08. Calls the `viewDidLayoutSubviews()` method

09. Displays the views onscreen

10. Calls the view controller’s `viewDidAppear(_:)` method after any animations complete

Update the content of your views in the `viewIsAppearing(_:)` method of your view controller. When the system calls this method, it has already added the view to the view hierarchy and defined the frame, bounds, margins, and insets. Content that the system adds in `viewIsAppearing(_:)` displays when the view is first visible on the screen.

The system calls the `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` and `viewDidLayoutSubviews()` methods, whenever the view performs layout, which can happen at any time while the view is visible. Because the system calls `viewIsAppearing(_:)` only once as part of each appearance transition, changes you make in this method don’t repeat each time the view performs layout.

When the system calls `viewIsAppearing(_:),` the trait collections of the view controller and its view are up to date. You may use the view controller’s `traitCollection` property to access information about the current environment, such as the display scale or the vertical and horizontal size classes. For more information about the available traits, see `UITraitCollection`.

# Showing and hiding view controllers

Display view controllers using different techniques, and pass data between them during transitions.

## Overview

You change your app’s interface by presenting and dismissing view controllers. Every window has a root view controller, which provides the initial content for your window. Presenting a new view controller changes that content by installing a new set of views in the window. When you no longer need the view controller, dismissing it removes its views from the window. You present view controllers in one of these ways:

- Configure presentations visually in your storyboard.

- Embed them in a container view controller.

- Call methods of `UIViewController` directly.

Each technique gives you different amounts of control over the presentation and dismissal process.

### Specify presentations visually in your storyboard file

Using segues in your storyboard is the recommended way to present and dismiss view controllers. A segue is a visual representation of a transition from one view controller to another. A segue starts with an action such as a button tap or table-row selection in the initial view controller. When that action occurs, UIKit creates the view controller at the other end of the segue and presents it automatically. Because you create and configure segues in your storyboard, you can change them very quickly.

Start a segue from any object that implements an action method, such as a control or gesture recognizer. You may also start segues from table rows and collection view cells.

1. Right-click the control or object in your current view controller.

2. Drag the cursor to the view controller you want to present.

3. Select the kind of segue you want from the list that Xcode provides.

The storyboard shows segues as an arrow between two view controllers. Selecting the segue displays information about it, including the kind of presentation you want UIKit to perform. You can modify the presentation type or configure additional details, such as a segue identifier. You use this information at runtime to customize the segue further, as described in Customizing the behavior of segue-based presentations.

For information about how to dismiss a view controller in your storyboards, see Dismissing a view controller with an unwind segue.

### Let the current context define the presentation technique

Reusing the same view controller in multiple places creates a potential problem: presenting it in different ways based on the current context. For example, you might want to embed it in a navigation controller in one instance, but present it modally in another. UIKit solves this problem with the `show(_:sender:)` and `showDetailViewController(_:sender:)` methods of `UIViewController`, which present the view controller in the most appropriate way for the current context.

When you call the `show(_:sender:)` or `showDetailViewController(_:sender:)` method, UIKit determines the most appropriate context for the presentation. Specifically, it calls the `targetViewController(forAction:sender:)` method to search for a parent view controller that implements the corresponding `show` method. If a parent implements the method and wants to handle the presentation, UIKit calls the parent’s implementation. A `UINavigationController` object’s implementation of the `show(_:sender:)` method pushes the new view controller onto its navigation stack. If no view controller handles the presentation, UIKit presents the view controller modally.

The following code example creates a view controller and shows it using the `show(_:sender:)` method. The code is equivalent to creating a segue with the kind set to Show.

@IBAction func showSecondViewController() {
let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
let secondVC = storyboard.instantiateViewController(identifier: "SecondViewController")

show(secondVC, sender: self)
}

After showing a view controller, use the current context to determine how to dismiss it. Calling the `dismiss(animated:completion:)` method might not always be the most appropriate option. For example, don’t call that method if a navigation controller added the view controller to its navigation stack. Instead, use the `presentingViewController`, `splitViewController`, `navigationController`, and `tabBarController` properties to determine the current context, and to take appropriate actions in response. That response might also include modifying your view controller’s UI to hide a Done button or other controls for dismissing the UI.

### Embed a view controller inside a container view controller

A container view controller embeds content from one or more child view controllers, and presents the combined interface onscreen. Embedding a child view controller presents it using a container-specific approach. For example, a navigation controller initially positions the child view controller offscreen and then animates it into position onscreen.

The standard UIKit container view controllers work with segues and the `show(_:sender:)` and `showDetailViewController(_:sender:)` methods to embed view controllers as children. They also define additional API for adding and removing child view controllers programmatically. Use segues and the show methods to handle most transitions. Use the methods in the following table to perform one-time configuration of your view controller, for example when restoring your app’s UI to a previous state.

| Container | Presentation options |
| --- | --- |
| UISplitViewController | Replace the two initial view controllers using the `viewControllers` property. The first (primary) view controller appears in the leading pane and the second (detail) view controller appears in the trailing pane. |
| UINavigationController | Replace the contents of the navigation stack using the `viewControllers` property. Add or remove a subset of view controllers simultaneously using the `setViewControllers(_:animated:)` method. |
| UITabBarController | Replace the initial tabs using the `viewControllers` property. Change the current tabs dynamically using the `setViewControllers(_:animated:)` method. |
| UIPageViewController | Provide all child view controllers using a `UIPageViewControllerDataSource` object. |

Always use the container view controller’s API to remove or replace a presented view controller.

### Present a view controller modally

Use modal presentations to create temporary interruptions in your app’s workflow, such as prompting the user for important information. A modal presentation covers the current view controller wholly or partially, depending on the presentation style you use. Full-screen presentations always replace the previous content, but sheet-style presentations may leave some of the underlying content visible. The actual appearance of each presentation style depends on the current trait environment.

To configure a modal presentation, create the new view controller and call the `present(_:animated:completion:)` method. That method animates the new view controller into position using the `UIModalPresentationStyle.automatic` style and the `UIModalTransitionStyle.coverVertical` transition animation. To change the styles, modify the `modalPresentationStyle` and `modalTransitionStyle` properties of the view controller you present. The following code example changes both of these styles to create a full-screen presentation using a cross-dissolve animation.

@IBAction func presentSecondViewController() {
let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
let secondVC = storyboard.instantiateViewController(identifier: "SecondViewController")

secondVC.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
secondVC.modalTransitionStyle = .crossDissolve

present(secondVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

To dismiss a modally presented view controller, call the view controller’s `dismiss(animated:completion:)` method.

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

Handling row selection in a table view

## Overview

Subclass `UITableViewController` when your interface consists of a table view and little or no other content. Table view controllers already adopt the protocols you need to manage your table view’s content and respond to changes. In addition, `UITableViewController` implements the following behaviors:

- Automatically loads the table view archived in a storyboard or nib file, which you can access using the `tableView` property

- Sets the data source and the delegate of the table view to `self`

- Implements the `viewWillAppear(_:)` method, automatically reloads the data for its table view on first appearance, and clears its selection (with or without animation, depending on the request) every time the table view appears (disable this last behavior by changing the value of `clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear`)

- Implements the `viewDidAppear(_:)` method and automatically flashes the table view’s scroll indicators when it first appears

- Implements the `setEditing(_:animated:)` method and automatically toggles the edit mode of the table when the user taps an Edit\|Done button in the navigation bar

- Automatically resizes its table view to accommodate the appearance or disappearance of the onscreen keyboard

Create a custom subclass of `UITableViewController` for each table view that you manage. When you initialize the table view controller, you must specify the style of the table view (plain or grouped). You must also override the data source and delegate methods required to fill your table with data. You may override `loadView()` or any other superclass method, but if you do, be sure to invoke the superclass implementation of the method, usually as the first method call.

Displaying and managing views with a view controller

## Overview

A view controller implements the following behavior:

- If the collection view controller has an assigned nib file or was loaded from a storyboard, it loads its view from the corresponding nib file or storyboard. If you create the collection view controller programmatically, it automatically creates a new unconfigured collection view object, which you can access using the `collectionView` property.

- When loading a collection view from a storyboard or nib file, the data source and delegate objects for the collection view are obtained from the nib file. If a data source or delegate is not specified, the collection view controller assigns itself to the unspecified role.

- When the collection view is about to appear for the first time, the collection view controller reloads the collection view data. It also clears the current selection every time the view is displayed. You can change this behavior by setting the value of the `clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear` property to `false`.

You create a custom subclass of `UICollectionViewController` for each collection view that you want to manage. When you initialize the controller, using the `init(collectionViewLayout:)` method, you specify the layout the collection view should have. Because the initially created collection view is without dimensions or content, the collection view’s data source and delegate—typically the collection view controller itself—must provide this information.

You may override the `loadView()` method or any other superclass method, but if you do, be sure to call `super` in the implementation of your method. If you do not, the collection view controller may not be able to perform all of the tasks needed to maintain the integrity of the collection view.

# Creating a custom container view controller

Create a composite interface by combining content from one or more view controllers with other custom views.

## Overview

Container view controllers promote better encapsulation by separating out your content from how you display that content onscreen. Unlike a content view controller that displays your app’s data, a container view controller displays other view controllers, arranging them onscreen and handling navigation between them.

A container view controller is still a view controller, so you display it in a window or present it like any other view controller. A container view controller also manages a composite interface, incorporating the views from one or more child view controllers into its own view hierarchy. Each child continues to manage its own view hierarchy, but the container manages the position and size of that child’s root view.

Many container view controllers facilitate navigation between different parts of your app’s content. Examples include `UINavigationController`, `UITabBarController`, and `UIPageViewController`, which help users navigate between different view controllers. You can also use container view controllers to organize the content you have more efficiently. For example, `UISplitViewController` displays two view controllers side-by-side on iPad. The only difference between navigation and organization is that navigation requires custom API to change the child view controllers; otherwise, the implementations are identical.

### Add a child view controller programmatically to your content

If your container view controller changes its child view controllers dynamically, it’s easier to add those children programmatically. Custom navigation interfaces facilitate navigation by changing their child view controllers, and you might also change child view controllers as part of configuring your interface.

For each new child view controller you add to your interface, perform the following steps in order:

1. Call the `addChild(_:)` method of your container view controller to configure the containment relationship.

2. Add the child’s root view to your container’s view hierarchy.

3. Add constraints to set the size and position of the child’s root view.

4. Call the `didMove(toParent:)` method of the child view controller to notify it that the transition is complete.

The following example code instantiates a new child view controller from a storyboard and embeds it as a child of the current view controller. After calling `addChild(_:)`, the code adds the child’s view to the view hierarchy and sets up some layout constraints to size and position it. At the end of the process, it notifies the child.

// Create a child view controller and add it to the current view controller.
let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: .main)
if let viewController = storyboard.instantiateViewController(identifier: "imageViewController")
as? ImageViewController {
// Add the view controller to the container.
addChild(viewController)
view.addSubview(viewController.view)

// Create and activate the constraints for the child’s view.
onscreenConstraints = configureConstraintsForContainedView(containedView: viewController.view,
stage: .onscreen)
NSLayoutConstraint.activate(onscreenConstraints)

// Notify the child view controller that the move is complete.
viewController.didMove(toParent: self)
}

Establishing a container-child relationship between view controllers prevents UIKit from interfering with your interface unintentionally. UIKit normally routes information to each of your app’s view controllers independently. When a container-child relationship exists, UIKit routes many requests through the container view controller first, giving it a chance to alter the behavior for any child view controllers. For example, a container view controller may override the traits of its children, forcing them to adopt a specific appearance or behavior.

### Remove a child view controller from your content

To remove a child view controller from your container, perform the following steps in order:

1. Call the child’s `willMove(toParent:)` method with the value `nil`.

2. Deactivate or remove any constraints for the child’s root view.

3. Call `removeFromSuperview()` on the child’s root view to remove it from the view hierarchy.

4. Call the child’s `removeFromParent()` method to finalize the end of the container-child relationship.

Breaking a container-child relationship tells UIKit that your container view controller is no longer displaying the child’s content. You can still maintain other references to the child view controller. For example, `UINavigationController` manages a stack of child view controllers, but it maintains a container-child relationship with only one or two of those children at any given time.

### Embed a child view controller in your storyboard UI

If your container view controller organizes content, and doesn’t change that content later, configure your UI using container views. A container view is a proxy view that stands in for the content of a child view controller. When you add one to your interface, it looks like a normal view, but it has an attached view controller.

Size and position a container view the same way you would other views in your interface. Add constraints to specify the size and position of the view for different devices and in different configurations. However, don’t add any subviews to the container view itself. Instead, add them to the view of the attached view controller.

When you instantiate a view controller that contains one or more container views, UIKit also instantiates the associated child view controllers. After creating the new view controllers, UIKit adds them as children of the original view controller you requested. You don’t need to call `addChild(_:)` yourself.

### Support additional container behaviors

Consider implementing the following additional behaviors in your custom container view controllers:

- Override `show(_:sender:)`, and use it to present a new child view controller.

- Override `showDetailViewController(_:sender:)`, as needed, to present a secondary child view controller.

- Update `additionalSafeAreaInsets` to account for decoration views that might obscure the content of your children.

- Call `setOverrideTraitCollection(_:forChild:)` to change the traits of your child view controllers. For example, you might designate a child view controller as always horizontally or vertically compact.

- Override `childForScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures` or `childForHomeIndicatorAutoHidden` to let a child view controller determine the behavior for system gestures.

- Override `allowedChildrenForUnwinding(from:)` to limit the set of child view controllers that are targets of an unwind segue action.

For more information, see the descriptions in `UIViewController`.

Managing content in your app’s windows

Creating a custom container view controller

Customizing the behavior of segue-based presentations

## Overview

A split view controller is a container view controller that manages child view controllers in a hierarchical interface. In this type of interface, changes in one view controller drive changes in the content of another.

Split view interfaces are most suitable for filterable content or navigating content hierarchies, like traversing the folders and notes within the Notes app to view each note. In the Notes app, selecting a folder in the primary sidebar shows the list of notes in that folder, and selecting a note from the list shows the contents of that specific note in the secondary view.

When you build your app’s user interface, the split view controller is typically the root view controller of your app’s window. The split view controller has no significant appearance of its own. Most of its appearance is defined by the child view controllers you install.

### Split view styles

In iOS 14 and later, `UISplitViewController` supports column-style layouts. A column-style split view controller lets you create an interface with two or three columns by using `init(style:)` with the appropriate `style`:

- Use the `UISplitViewController.Style.doubleColumn` style to create a split view interface with a two-column layout. This style of split view controller manages two child view controllers, placed in the primary and secondary columns.

- Use the `UISplitViewController.Style.tripleColumn` style to create a split view interface with a three-column layout. This style of split view controller manages three child view controllers, placed in the primary, supplementary, and secondary columns.

Before iOS 14, `UISplitViewController` supported just one split view interface style with a primary view controller and a secondary view controller. This classic interface style applies to split view controllers created using any other approach than `init(style:)`. Split view controllers with the classic interface have a `style` of `UISplitViewController.Style.unspecified` and they don’t respond to any of the column-style APIs introduced in iOS 14 and later.

### Child view controllers

In a column-style split view interface, use the `setViewController(_:for:)` and `viewController(for:)` methods to set and get view controllers for each column. The split view controller wraps all of its child view controllers in navigation controllers. If you set a child view controller that’s not a navigation controller, the split view controller creates a navigation controller for it. The split view controller returns your original view controller through `viewController(for:)`, but its `children` property contains the navigation controller it used to wrap your view controller. After you assign view controllers to specific columns, you can show and hide those columns using `show(_:)` or `hide(_:)`.

In a classic split view interface, you can configure the child view controllers using Interface Builder or programmatically by assigning the view controllers to the `viewControllers` property. In cases where you need to change either the primary or secondary view controller, it’s recommended that you do so using the `show(_:sender:)` and `showDetailViewController(_:sender:)` methods. Using these methods (instead of modifying the `viewControllers` property directly) lets the split view controller present the specified view controller in a way that’s most appropriate for the current display mode and size class.

### Interface transitions

The split view controller performs collapse and expand transitions in response to certain changes in its interface. For example, transitions occur when the interface’s size class toggles between horizontally regular and horizontally compact, when a user interaction hides or shows a column, or when you hide or show columns programmatically. The split view controller works with its `delegate` object to perform collapse and expand transitions. The delegate is an object you provide that adopts the `UISplitViewControllerDelegate` protocol.

In a column-style split view interface, when the interface is collapsed, you can show a different view controller than your primary, supplementary, or secondary. Set the desired view controller for the `UISplitViewController.Column.compact` column using `setViewController(_:for:)`. If you want to further customize transitions for collapsing and expanding the interface, see Column-style split views.

For information about managing transitions in classic split view interfaces, see Classic split views.

### Display mode

A split view controller’s current display mode represents the visual arrangement of its child view controllers. It determines how many of its child view controllers are shown, and how they’re positioned in relation to each other. For example, you can arrange the child view controllers so that they appear side-by-side, so that only one at a time is visible, or so that one is partially obscured by the others.

You don’t set the display mode directly; instead, you set a preferred display mode by using the `preferredDisplayMode` property. The split view controller makes every effort to respect the display mode you specify, but it may not be able to accommodate that mode visually because of space constraints. For example, the split view controller can’t display its child view controllers side-by-side in a horizontally compact environment. For possible configurations, see `UISplitViewController.DisplayMode`.

After you set the preferred display mode, the split view controller updates itself and reflects the actual display mode in the `displayMode` property. If you just want to change which columns are shown, try using `show(_:)` or `hide(_:)`. The split view controller will determine how to update the display mode to display the desired columns.

### Gesture and button support

There are several ways for user interaction to change the current display mode.

The split view controller installs a built-in gesture recognizer that lets the user change the display mode using a swipe. You can suppress this gesture recognizer by setting the `presentsWithGesture` property to `false`. For example, you might set this property to `false` if you want your primary view controller to always be visible.

If `presentsWithGesture` is `true`, the split view controller also presents a special bar button item for changing the display mode. The split view controller manages the behavior, appearance, and positioning of this item. It appears as a sidebar toggle icon for `UISplitViewController.SplitBehavior.tile` and as a back-chevron icon for `UISplitViewController.SplitBehavior.overlay` and `UISplitViewController.SplitBehavior.displace`. Tapping this button transitions to a new display mode based on the current display mode and split behavior.

For three-column split view interfaces—those with a `style` of `UISplitViewController.Style.tripleColumn`—another property that affects display mode is `showsSecondaryOnlyButton`. When this property is `true`, the split view controller presents another bar button item for toggling the display mode to and from `UISplitViewController.DisplayMode.secondaryOnly`. The split view controller manages the behavior, appearance, and positioning of this item. It appears as a double-arrow icon. When a user taps this button, it toggles the display mode to or from `UISplitViewController.DisplayMode.secondaryOnly`.

### Split behavior

A split view controller’s split behavior controls how its secondary view controller appears in relation to the others. You can configure this behavior so that the secondary view controller always appears side-by-side with the others, so that it’s partially obscured by the others, or so that it’s displaced offscreen opposite the others to make space for them.

You don’t set the split behavior directly; instead, you set a preferred split behavior by using the `preferredSplitBehavior` property. This change takes effect after the next layout occurs. The split view controller reflects the actual split behavior in the `splitBehavior` property. The value of the `splitBehavior` property affects which display modes are available for the split view controller. For possible configurations, see `UISplitViewController.SplitBehavior`.

### Column-width customization

You can specify custom widths for the primary and supplementary columns of the split view interface by adjusting `preferredPrimaryColumnWidthFraction` and `preferredSupplementaryColumnWidthFraction`. If you don’t specify values for these properties, they default to `automaticDimension`, and the system determines the appropriate behavior based on the available space.

### Message forwarding

A split view controller interposes itself between the app’s window and its child view controllers. As a result, all messages to the child view controllers must flow through the split view controller. Messages are forwarded as appropriate. For example, view appearance and disappearance messages are sent only when the corresponding child view controller actually appears onscreen.

### State preservation

If you assign a value to the split view controller’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it preserves any child view controllers that have their own valid restoration identifier. During the next launch cycle, the split view controller restores the preserved view controllers to their previous state. The child view controllers of a split view controller may use the same restoration identifiers. The split view controller automatically stores additional information to ensure that each child’s restoration path is unique.

Class

# UINavigationItem

The items that a navigation bar displays when the associated view controller is visible.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UINavigationItem

## Overview

When building a navigation interface, each view controller that you push onto the navigation stack must have a `UINavigationItem` object that contains the buttons and views you want to display in the navigation bar. The managing `UINavigationController` object uses the navigation items of the topmost two view controllers to populate the navigation bar with content.

A navigation item always reflects information about its associated view controller. The navigation item must provide a title to display when the view controller is topmost on the navigation stack. The item can also contain additional buttons to display on the right (or trailing) side of the navigation bar. You can specify buttons and views to display on the left (or leading) side of the toolbar using the `leftBarButtonItems` property, but the navigation controller displays those buttons only when space is available.

To convey additional information about the view that a navigation item represents, use the `subtitle` property. For example, in a view controller that displays a list of messages, you could use the `subtitle` to indicate the number of unread messages or the last time the app fetched messages. To apply text styles to a navigation item’s title or subtitle, use the `attributedTitle`, `attributedSubtitle`, and `largeAttributedSubtitle` properties.

The `backBarButtonItem` property of a navigation item reflects the Back button you want to display when the current view controller is just below the topmost view controller. The Back button doesn’t appear when the current view controller is topmost.

When specifying buttons for a navigation item, you must use `UIBarButtonItem` objects. If you want to display custom views in the navigation bar, you must wrap those views inside a `UIBarButtonItem` object before adding them to the navigation item.

Creating a custom container view controller

## Overview

The tab bar interface displays tabs at the bottom of the window for selecting between the different modes and for displaying the views for that mode. This class is generally used as-is, but may also be subclassed.

Each tab of a tab bar controller interface is associated with a custom view controller. When the user selects a specific tab, the tab bar controller displays the root view of the corresponding view controller, replacing any previous views. (User taps always display the root view of the tab, regardless of which tab was previously selected. This is true even if the tab was already selected.) Because selecting a tab replaces the contents of the interface, the type of interface managed in each tab need not be similar in any way. In fact, tab bar interfaces are commonly used either to present different types of information or to present the same information using a completely different style of interface. The following image shows the tab bar interface presented by the Clock app, each tab of which presents a type of time based information.

You should never access the tab bar view of a tab bar controller directly. To configure the tabs of a tab bar controller, you assign the view controllers that provide the root view for each tab to the `viewControllers` property. The order in which you specify the view controllers determines the order in which they appear in the tab bar. When setting this property, you should also assign a value to the `selectedViewController` property to indicate which view controller is selected initially. (You can also select view controllers by array index using the `selectedIndex` property.) When you embed the tab bar controller’s view (obtained using the inherited `view` property) in your app window, the tab bar controller automatically selects that view controller and displays its contents, resizing them as needed to fit the tab bar interface.

Tab bar items are configured through their corresponding view controller. To associate a tab bar item with a view controller, create a new instance of the `UITabBarItem` class, configure it appropriately for the view controller, and assign it to the view controller’s `tabBarItem` property. If you don’t provide a custom tab bar item for your view controller, the view controller creates a default item containing no image and the text from the view controller’s `title` property.

As the user interacts with a tab bar interface, the tab bar controller object sends notifications about the interactions to its delegate. The delegate can be any object you specify but must conform to the `UITabBarControllerDelegate` protocol. You can use the delegate to prevent specific tab bar items from being selected and to perform additional tasks when tabs are selected. You can also use the delegate to monitor changes to the tab bar that are made by the More navigation controller, which is described in more detail in The More navigation controller.

### The views of a tab bar controller

Because the `UITabBarController` class inherits from the `UIViewController` class, tab bar controllers have their own view that’s accessible through the `view` property. The view for a tab bar controller is just a container for a tab bar view and the view containing your custom content. The tab bar view provides the selection controls for the user and consists of one or more tab bar items. The following image shows how these views are assembled to present the overall tab bar interface. Although the items in the tab bar and toolbar views can change, the views that manage them don’t. Only the custom content view changes to reflect the view controller for the currently selected tab.

You can use navigation controllers or custom view controllers as the root view controller for a tab. If the root view controller is a navigation controller, the tab bar controller makes further adjustments to the size of the displayed navigation content so that it doesn’t overlap the tab bar. Any views you display in a tab bar interface should therefore have their `autoresizingMask` property set to resize the view appropriately under any conditions.

### The More navigation controller

The tab bar has limited space for displaying your custom items. If you add six or more custom view controllers to a tab bar controller, the tab bar controller displays only the first four items plus the standard More item on the tab bar. Tapping the More item brings up a standard interface for selecting the remaining items.

The interface for the standard More item includes an Edit button that allows the user to reconfigure the tab bar. By default, the user is allowed to rearrange all items on the tab bar. If you do not want the user to modify some items, though, you can remove the appropriate view controllers from the array in the `customizableViewControllers` property.

### State preservation

When you assign a value to this view controller’s `restorationIdentifier` property, it preserves a reference to the view controller in the selected tab. At restore time, it uses the reference to select the tab with the same view controller.

When preserving a tab bar controller, assign unique restoration identifiers to the child view controllers you want to preserve. Omitting a restoration identifier from a child view controller causes that tab to property, the save order is actually irrelevant. Your code is responsible for providing the new tab bar controller during the next launch cycle, so your code can adjust the order of the tabs as needed. The state preservation system restores the contents of each tab based on the assigned restoration identifier, not based on the position of the tab.

For more information about how state preservation and restoration works, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

### Differences between iOS and tvOS

Tab bar controllers serve the same purpose in tvOS as in iOS, but provide slightly different user interface features:

- In tvOS, the tab bar interface appears at the top of the window. When focus leaves the tab bar, the tab bar remains fixed at the top of the screen by default. To create an interface where the tab bar doesn’t remain fixed, but instead scrolls with the content, set the `tabBarObservedScrollView` property to the appropriate scroll view. In iOS, the tab bar always stays pinned at the bottom of the screen.

- In tvOS, swiping down from the tab bar moves focus into the content view; specifically, to the first focusable view that’s visually below the selected tab. Swiping down behaves like a normal focus-changing gesture — that is, focus moves in the direction the user swiped. If nothing is focusable immediately below the selected tab, the closest focusable view is focused instead. In iOS, the tab bar always remains in focus at the bottom of the screen.

- In tvOS, pressing the Select button while a tab is focused moves focus into the content view. Because there’s no direction associated with this change, focus moves to the most appropriate view specified in the content view’s `preferredFocusEnvironments` property. In iOS, there’s no notion of focusing between views.

- Tab bar controllers in tvOS don’t support customization. A tab bar controller displays only the number of view controllers from its `viewControllers` array that fit on the screen, and doesn’t provide the More interface seen in iOS.

Managing content in your app’s windows

Creating a custom container view controller

## Overview

Page view controller–navigation can be controlled programmatically by your app or directly by the user using gestures. When navigating from page to page, the page view controller uses the transition that you specify to animate the change.

When defining a page view controller interface, you can provide the content view controllers one at a time (or two at a time, depending upon the spine position and double-sided state) or as-needed using a data source. When providing content view controllers one at a time, you use the `setViewControllers(_:direction:animated:completion:)` method to set the current content view controllers. To support gesture-based navigation, you must provide your view controllers using a data source object.

The data source for a page view controller is responsible for providing the content view controllers on demand and must conform to the `UIPageViewControllerDataSource` protocol. The delegate object—an object that conforms to the `UIPageViewControllerDelegate` protocol—provides some appearance-related information and receives notifications about gesture-initiated transitions.

This class is generally used as-is, but can also be subclassed.

## Topics

### Creating a page view controller

The `UIPageViewControllerDataSource` protocol is adopted by an object that provides view controllers to the page view controller on an as-needed basis, in response to navigation gestures.

### Customizing the Page View Behavior

`var delegate: (any UIPageViewControllerDelegate)?`

The delegate object.

`protocol UIPageViewControllerDelegate`

The delegate of a page view controller must adopt the `UIPageViewControllerDelegate` protocol. These methods allow the delegate to receive a notification when the device orientation changes and when the user navigates to a new page. For page-curl style transitions, the delegate can provide a different spine location in response to a change in the interface orientation.

Sample Code

# Disabling the pull-down gesture for a sheet

Ensure a positive user experience when presenting a view controller as a sheet.

Download

Xcode 12.3+

## Overview

By default, a user can use a pull-down gesture to dismiss a view controller that presents as a sheet. UIKit allows you to disable the pull-down gesture in situations where using it might cause the user to lose data or recent changes. It’s also possible to explain why the user is unable to dismiss the view controller presentation by presenting an instance of `UIAlertController`.

### Disable the ability to dismiss a presentation

To disable dismissal of a view controller presentation, set `isModalInPresentation` to `true`.

// If there are unsaved changes, enable the Save button and disable the ability to
// dismiss using the pull-down gesture.
saveButton.isEnabled = hasChanges
isModalInPresentation = hasChanges

It’s also possible to return `false` from the presentation delegate’s `presentationControllerShouldDismiss(_:)` method. However, the system doesn’t call this method if `isModalInPresentation` is `true` or when dismissing the presentation programmatically.

### Explain why the user can’t dismiss a presentation

To perform an action when the user attempts to dismiss a presentation that has a disabled dismissal, set the presentation’s delegate as the code below shows:

// Set the editViewController to be the delegate of the presentationController for this presentation.
// editViewController can then respond to attempted dismissals.
navigationController.presentationController?.delegate = editViewController

After setting the delegate, implement `presentationControllerDidAttemptToDismiss(_:)` and perform the action. The example below shows the presentation of an instance of `UIAlertController`:

func presentationControllerDidAttemptToDismiss(_ presentationController: UIPresentationController) {
// The system calls this delegate method whenever the user attempts to pull
// down to dismiss and `isModalInPresentation` is false.
// Clarify the user's intent by asking whether they want to cancel or save.
confirmCancel(showingSave: true)
}

// MARK: - Cancellation Confirmation

func confirmCancel(showingSave: Bool) {
// Present a UIAlertController as an action sheet to have the user confirm losing any
// recent changes.
let alert = UIAlertController(title: nil, message: nil, preferredStyle: .actionSheet)

// Only ask if the user wants to save if they attempt to pull to dismiss, not if they tap Cancel.
if showingSave {
alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Save", style: .default) { _ in
self.delegate?.editViewControllerDidFinish(self)
})
}

alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Discard Changes", style: .destructive) { _ in
self.delegate?.editViewControllerDidCancel(self)
})

alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel, handler: nil))

// If presenting the alert controller as a popover, point the popover at the Cancel button.
alert.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem = cancelButton

present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

## Mentioned in

Choosing a specific interface style for your iOS app

## Overview

From the time a view controller is presented until the time it’s dismissed, UIKit uses a presentation controller to manage various aspects of the presentation process for that view controller. The presentation controller can add its own animations on top of those provided by animator objects, it can respond to size changes, and it can manage other aspects of how the view controller is presented onscreen.

When you present a view controller using the `present(_:animated:completion:)` method, UIKit always manages the presentation process. Part of that process involves creating the presentation controller that’s appropriate for the given presentation style. For the built-in styles (such as the `UIModalPresentationStyle.pageSheet` style), UIKit defines and creates the needed presentation controller object. The only time your app can provide a custom presentation controller is when you set the `modalPresentationStyle` property of your view controller `UIModalPresentationStyle.custom`. You might provide a custom presentation controller when you want to add a shadow view or decoration views underneath the view controller being presented or when you want to modify the presentation behavior in other ways.

You vend your custom presentation controller object through your view controller’s transitioning delegate. UIKit maintains a reference to your presentation controller object while the presented view controller is onscreen. For information about the transitioning delegate and the objects it provides, see `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`.

### Understand the presentation process

The presentation process managed by a presentation controller is divided into three phases:

- The _presentation phase_ involves moving the new view controller onscreen through a series of transition animations.

- The _management phase_ involves responding to environment changes (such as device rotations) while the new view controller is onscreen.

- The _dismissal phase_ involves moving the new view controller off screen through a series of transition animations

The presentation controller’s role during all of these phases is to manage its own custom views and state information. During the presentation and dismissal phases, the presentation controller adds its custom views (if any) to the view hierarchy and creates any appropriate transition animations for those views. The animation of the view controller’s view onto the screen is still managed by an animator object — that is, an object that adopts the `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` protocol. UIKit calls separate presentation controller methods at the beginning and end of the presentation and dismissal phases so that the presentation controller can perform any needed cleanup.

### Add custom views to a presentation

The `UIPresentationController` class defines specific entry points for manipulating the view hierarchy when presenting a view controller. When a view controller is about to be presented, UIKit calls the presentation controller’s `presentationTransitionWillBegin()` method. You can use that method to add views to the view hierarchy and set up any animations related to those views. At the end of the presentation phase, UIKit calls the `presentationTransitionDidEnd(_:)` method to let you know that the transition finished.

The following code shows a sample implementation of the `presentationTransitionWillBegin()` and `presentationTransitionDidEnd(_:)` methods for a custom presentation controller. In this example, the view controller adds a dimming view as a backdrop to the presented view controller. (The `_dimmingView` variable refers to a custom `UIView` object that you would provide.) When presenting the view controller, the `presentationTransitionWillBegin()` method adds the dimming view first and embeds the view controller content inside that dimming view. It then configures a fade-in animation to run alongside the other transition animations. If the user aborts the presentation process, perhaps through an interactive gesture, the `presentationTransitionDidEnd(_:)` removes the dimming view. If the presentation succeeds, both the dimming view and the presented view controller remain onscreen until they’re dismissed.

- (void)presentationTransitionWillBegin {
// Add a custom dimming view behind the presented view controller's view.
[[self containerView] addSubview:_dimmingView];
[_dimmingView addSubview:[[self presentedViewController] view]];

// Use the transition coordinator to set up the animations.

[[self presentingViewController] transitionCoordinator];

// Fade in the dimming view during the transition.
[_dimmingView setAlpha:0.0];
[transitionCoordinator animateAlongsideTransition:\

[_dimmingView setAlpha:1.0];\
} completion:nil];
}

- (void)presentationTransitionDidEnd:(BOOL)completed {
// Remove the dimming view if the presentation is terminated.
if (!completed) {
[_dimmingView removeFromSuperview];
}
}

When dismissing the view controller, use the `dismissalTransitionWillBegin()` method to configure any animations and use the `dismissalTransitionDidEnd(_:)` method to remove any custom views from the view hierarchy.

### Adapt to size class changes

Size class changes signal large-scale changes to how your app should present its content. Presentation controllers manage size class changes by adjusting the presentation style (as needed) for their presented view controller. Adjustments are made only when the current presentation style doesn’t make sense in the new environment. For example, a popover becomes a full-screen presentation when the size class changes from horizontally regular to horizontally compact. For presentation styles that already make sense in the new environment, such as a full-screen presentation style, no adaptive change is made.

When the size class of the presented view controller changes from horizontally regular to horizontally compact, the presentation controller calls its `adaptivePresentationStyle` method to determine which new style (if any) to apply. When a new style is needed, the presentation controller initiates a transition to the new style, which may also involve replacing the current presentation controller object with a new object. Because the presentation controller object may change, always retrieve the presentation controller from `presentationController` property of the presented view controller.

When the presentation style changes, the presentation controller also gives you the opportunity to specify a new presented view controller. Before initiating the transition, the presentation controller calls the `presentationController(_:viewControllerForAdaptivePresentationStyle:)` method of its delegate object. If you implement that method, you can use it to make major or minor adjustments to the presented content. A major adjustment would be to replace the current view controller with an entirely new view controller that was designed specifically for the given size class. A minor adjustment would be to install the current view controller inside a navigation controller to facilitate navigation in the new size class.

### Respond to size changes

Size changes represent small changes to the width or height of a view controller’s view. Typically, these changes happen when the device rotates between portrait and landscape orientations. When a size change occurs, UIKit calls the presentation controller’s `viewWillTransition(to:with:)` method. In a custom presentation, use that method to modify your presentation controller’s custom views or make changes to the view hierarchy. For example, you might swap out custom decoration views with ones that fit the new size better.

After notifying your presentation controller of an impending size change, UIKit begins the normal view layout process. Apps that use auto layout shouldn’t need to do anything because the auto layout mechanism resizes views as needed. But if a custom presentation controller needs to make layout-specific changes, it can do so in its `containerViewWillLayoutSubviews()` and `containerViewDidLayoutSubviews()` methods. These methods are equivalent to the `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` and `viewDidLayoutSubviews()` methods of the `UIViewController` class and used in the same way. UIKit calls them before and after it calls the `layoutSubviews()` methods of the views in the view hierarchy.

### Subclassing notes

For custom presentation styles, you should subclass `UIPresentationController` and override at least some of its methods to implement your custom presentation behaviors. Use your custom presentation controller to customize the presentation process.

For custom presentation controllers, you must call the `init(presentedViewController:presenting:)` method during initialization. That method is the designated initializer of the class. UIKit uses it to perform required initialization for all presentation controller objects.

#### Methods to override

If your `UIPresentationController` subclasses manages one or more custom views, you should consider overriding the following methods:

- Use the `presentationTransitionWillBegin()` method to add your custom views to the view hierarchy and to animate the appearance of those views. If the view controller can’t be presented, you can remove those views in the `presentationTransitionDidEnd(_:)` method as needed.

- Use the `dismissalTransitionWillBegin()` method to perform animations related to the dismissal of the presented view controller. Don’t remove your custom views from the view hierarchy until the `dismissalTransitionDidEnd(_:)` method is called.

- Use the `viewWillTransition(to:with:)` method to make any size-related changes to your custom views.

Subclasses may override other methods of this class as needed to provide custom behavior. For example, you might override the `shouldPresentInFullscreen` or `frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView` methods and return different values than those provided by the default implementations.

# UISheetPresentationController

A presentation controller that manages the appearance and behavior of a sheet.

@MainActor
class UISheetPresentationController

## Overview

`UISheetPresentationController` lets you present your view controller as a sheet. Before you present your view controller, configure the sheet presentation controller in its `sheetPresentationController` property with the behavior and appearance you want for your sheet.

// In a subclass of UIViewController, customize and present the sheet.
func showMyViewControllerInACustomizedSheet() {
let viewControllerToPresent = MyViewController()
if let sheet = viewControllerToPresent.sheetPresentationController {
sheet.detents = [.medium(), .large()]
sheet.largestUndimmedDetentIdentifier = .medium
sheet.prefersScrollingExpandsWhenScrolledToEdge = false
sheet.prefersEdgeAttachedInCompactHeight = true
sheet.widthFollowsPreferredContentSizeWhenEdgeAttached = true
}
present(viewControllerToPresent, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

Sheet presentation controllers specify a sheet’s size based on a _detent_, a height where a sheet naturally rests. Detents allow a sheet to resize from one edge of its fully expanded frame while the other three edges remain fixed. You specify the detents that a sheet supports using `detents`, and monitor its most recently selected detent using `selectedDetentIdentifier`.

## Topics

## Overview

In tvOS, rather than push a `UISearchController` onto a navigation controller’s stack or use one as a child of another container view controller, embed an instance of this class and let it manage the presentation of the search controller’s content.

`UISearchContainerViewController` presents its `UISearchController`, instead of containing it. So implement view appearance methods, such as `viewWillAppear(_:)` and `didMove(toParent:)` on both view controllers.

# UISearchController

A view controller that manages the display of search results based on interactions with a search bar.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UISearchController

## Overview

Use a search controller to provide a standard search experience of the contents of another view controller. When the user interacts with a `UISearchBar`, the search controller coordinates with a search results controller to display the search results.

In iOS, incorporate the search controller’s `searchBar` into your own view controller’s interface. Display your view controller in whatever way is appropriate for your app. See Displaying searchable content by using a search controller and Using suggested searches with a search controller to learn how to implement a search controller in your app.

In tvOS, start with a `UISearchContainerViewController` to manage the presentation of the search controller. See UIKit Catalog (tvOS): Creating and Customizing UIKit Controls to learn how to implement a search controller embedded inside a `UISearchContainerViewController` object.

### Display search results

Specify a second view controller for displaying search results when you call `init(searchResultsController:)`. When the user interacts with the search bar, the search controller automatically displays the results controller with the results you specify. If your results view is full-screen in tvOS, set the `searchControllerObservedScrollView` to the results controller as well, so the search bar scrolls with your content view.

Provide a `UISearchResultsUpdating` object to the search controller’s `searchResultsUpdater` property. Typically, the view controller with your searchable content also acts as the search results updater object, but you can use another object if you prefer. When the user interacts with the search bar, the search controller calls the appropriate `UISearchResultsUpdating` method, giving your object the opportunity to perform the search and update the contents of your search results view.

### Customize transitions

To customize the presentation or dismissal of the search results controller, set the search controller’s `delegate` property to an object that conforms to the `UISearchControllerDelegate` protocol. Then implement delegate methods in this object to receive presentation and dismissal events from the search controller.

# Displaying searchable content by using a search controller

Create a user interface with searchable content in a table view.

Download

Xcode 13.0+

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to create a table view controller and search controller to manage the display of searchable content. It creates another custom table view controller to display the search results. This table view controller also acts as the presenter or provides context for the search results so they’re presented within their own context.

This sample includes the optional—but recommended— `UIStateRestoring` protocol. You adopt this protocol from the view controller class to save the search bar’s active state, first responder status, and search bar text and restore them when the app is relaunched.

### Create a search controller

Use `MainTableViewController`, a subclass of `UITableViewController`, to create a search controller. The search controller searches and filters a set of `Product` objects and displays them in a table called `ResultsTableController`. This table controller is displayed as the user enters a search string and is dismissed when the search is complete.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

let nib = UINib(nibName: "TableCell", bundle: nil)
tableView.register(nib, forCellReuseIdentifier: tableViewCellIdentifier)

resultsTableController =
self.storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "ResultsTableController") as? ResultsTableController
// This view controller is interested in table view row selections.
resultsTableController.tableView.delegate = self

searchController = UISearchController(searchResultsController: resultsTableController)
searchController.delegate = self
searchController.searchResultsUpdater = self
searchController.searchBar.autocapitalizationType = .none
searchController.searchBar.delegate = self // Monitor when the search button is tapped.

searchController.searchBar.scopeButtonTitles = [Product.productTypeName(forType: .all),\
Product.productTypeName(forType: .birthdays),\
Product.productTypeName(forType: .weddings),\
Product.productTypeName(forType: .funerals)]

// Place the search bar in the navigation bar.
navigationItem.searchController = searchController

// Make the search bar always visible.
navigationItem.hidesSearchBarWhenScrolling = false

/** Search presents a view controller by applying normal view controller presentation semantics.
This means that the presentation moves up the view controller hierarchy until it finds the root
view controller or one that defines a presentation context.
*/

/** Specify that this view controller determines how the search controller is presented.
The search controller should be presented modally and match the physical size of this view controller.
*/
definesPresentationContext = true

setupDataSource()
}

### Update the search results

This sample uses the `UISearchResultsUpdating` protocol, along with `NSComparisonPredicate`, to filter search results from the group of available products. `NSComparisonPredicate` is a foundation class that specifies how data should be fetched or filtered using search criteria. The search criteria are based on what the user types in the search bar, which can be a combination of product title, year introduced, and price.

To prepare for a search, the search bar content is trimmed of all leading and trailing space characters. Then the search string is passed to the `findMatches` function, which returns the `NSComparisonPredicate` used in the search. The product list results are applied to the search results table as a filtered list.

func updateSearchResults(for searchController: UISearchController) {
// Update the filtered array based on the search text.
let searchResults = products

// Strip out all the leading and trailing spaces.
let whitespaceCharacterSet = CharacterSet.whitespaces
let strippedString =
searchController.searchBar.text!.trimmingCharacters(in: whitespaceCharacterSet)
let searchItems = strippedString.components(separatedBy: " ") as [String]

// Build all the "AND" expressions for each value in searchString.
let andMatchPredicates: [NSPredicate] = searchItems.map { searchString in
findMatches(searchString: searchString)
}

// Match up the fields of the Product object.
let finalCompoundPredicate =
NSCompoundPredicate(andPredicateWithSubpredicates: andMatchPredicates)

let filteredResults = searchResults.filter { finalCompoundPredicate.evaluate(with: $0) }

// Apply the filtered results to the search results table.
if let resultsController = searchController.searchResultsController as? ResultsTableController {
resultsController.filteredProducts = filteredResults
resultsController.tableView.reloadData()

resultsController.resultsLabel.text = resultsController.filteredProducts.isEmpty ?
NSLocalizedString("NoItemsFoundTitle", comment: "") :
String(format: NSLocalizedString("Items found: %ld", comment: ""),
resultsController.filteredProducts.count)
}
}

# Using suggested searches with a search controller

Create a search interface with a table view of suggested searches.

Download

Xcode 13.0+

## Overview

This sample project demonstrates how to implement a `UISearchController` in your application. `UISearchController` is a view controller that manages the display of search results based on interactions with a search bar.

The sample lists flower products. Users can search for them by title, price, year, and color. As soon as the user taps the search bar, the search controller displays the list of suggested searches. A suggested search represents a particular color: red, blue, or green. The search controller filters the list of flower products by color when a suggested color is selected. This behavior matches that of the Mail app.

This sample also demonstrates a scene-based architecture using `UISceneDelegate`. It includes the recommended `UIUserActivityRestoring` protocol to save and restore the search results. Adopt this protocol to save the search bar’s active state, first responder status, search bar text and token, and restore them when the app is relaunched.

### Create a search controller

The `MainTableViewController`, a subclass of `UITableViewController`, creates the search controller. The search controller’s search bar helps filter a set of `Product` objects and displays the results in the table view. The sample places the search controller in the `MainTableViewController's` navigation bar:

searchController = UISearchController(searchResultsController: resultsTableController)
searchController.searchResultsUpdater = self
searchController.searchBar.autocapitalizationType = .none
searchController.searchBar.searchTextField.placeholder = NSLocalizedString("Enter a search term", comment: "")
searchController.searchBar.returnKeyType = .done

// Place the search bar in the navigation bar.
navigationItem.searchController = searchController

// Make the search bar always visible.
navigationItem.hidesSearchBarWhenScrolling = false

// Monitor when the search controller is presented and dismissed.
searchController.delegate = self

// Monitor when the search button is tapped, and start/end editing.
searchController.searchBar.delegate = self

The `ResultsTableController` displays both the list of filtered flower products and the list of suggested search colors. As the user types text in the search field, the list of flower products matches what is typed. If the user doesn’t enter any text, the search controller displays a list of suggested search colors. A suggested search represents a single query to search for a specific color of a product.

### Create suggested searches

The list of suggested searches is displayed by the results controller once the search bar is tapped:

func presentSearchController(_ searchController: UISearchController) {
searchController.showsSearchResultsController = true
setToSuggestedSearches()
}

When the user first taps the search bar, the search results controller displays the suggested searches. The user chooses a suggested search, and then types additional search criteria in the search bar. Each suggested search represents a `UISearchToken`, a visual representation of a search query. Tapping a suggested search creates a search token for a particular color and the search controller places it in the search bar’s text field. This text field is represented by `UISearchTextField` which supports cut, copy, paste, and drag and drop of search tokens. Tokens always precede the text and can be selected and deleted by the user.

The sample creates a `UISearchToken` as follows:

let tokenColor = ResultsTableController.suggestedColor(fromIndex: tokenValue)
let image =
UIImage(systemName: "circle.fill")?.withTintColor(tokenColor, renderingMode: .alwaysOriginal)
let searchToken = UISearchToken(icon: image, text: suggestedTitle(fromIndex: tokenValue))

// Set the color kind number as the token value.
let color = ResultsTableController.colorKind(fromIndex: tokenValue).rawValue
searchToken.representedObject = NSNumber(value: color)

return searchToken
}

This sample inserts the search token into the search bar’s search text field as follows:

if let searchField = navigationItem.searchController?.searchBar.searchTextField {
searchField.insertToken(token, at: 0)

// Hide the suggested searches now that we have a token.
resultsTableController.showSuggestedSearches = false

// Update the search query with the newly inserted token.
updateSearchResults(for: searchController)
}

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller

- UIKit
- UIImagePickerController

Class

# UIImagePickerController

A view controller that manages the system interfaces for taking pictures, recording movies, and choosing items from the user’s media library.

@MainActor
class UIImagePickerController

## Overview

An image picker controller manages user interactions and delivers the results of those interactions to a delegate object. The role and appearance of an image picker controller depend on the _source type_ you assign to it before you present it.

- A `sourceType` of `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera` provides a user interface for taking a new picture or movie (on devices that support media capture).

- A `sourceType` of `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.photoLibrary` or `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.savedPhotosAlbum` provides a user interface for choosing among saved pictures and movies.

To use an image picker controller containing its default controls, perform these steps:

1. Verify that the device is capable of picking content from the desired source. Do this by calling the `isSourceTypeAvailable(_:)` class method, providing a constant from the `UIImagePickerController.SourceType` enumeration.

2. Check which media types are available for the source type you’re using, by calling the `availableMediaTypes(for:)` class method. This lets you distinguish between a camera that can be used for video recording and one that can be used only for still images.

3. Tell the image picker controller to adjust the UI according to the media types you want to make available — still images, movies, or both — by setting the `mediaTypes` property.

4. Present the user interface. On iPhone or iPod touch, do this modally (full screen) by calling the `present(_:animated:completion:)` method of the currently active view controller, passing your configured image picker controller as the new view controller.

On iPad, the correct way to present an image picker depends on its source type, as summarized in this table:

| Camera | Photo Library | Saved Photos Album |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use full screen | Must use a popover | Must use a popover |

The table indicates that on iPad, if you specify a source type of `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.photoLibrary` or `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.savedPhotosAlbum`, you must present the image picker using a popover controller (to learn how to do this, see `UIPopoverPresentationController`). If you attempt to present an image picker modally (full screen) for choosing among saved pictures and movies, the system raises an exception.

On iPad, if you specify a source type of `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera`, you can present the image picker modally (full screen) or by using a popover. However, Apple recommends that you present the camera interface only full screen.

5. When the user taps a button to pick a newly captured or saved image or movie, or cancels the operation, dismiss the image picker using your delegate object. For newly captured media, your delegate can then save it to the photo library on the device. For previously saved media, your delegate can then use the image data according to the purpose of your app.

For details on these steps, refer to Taking Pictures and Movies.

You can customize an image picker controller to manage user interactions yourself. To do this, provide an overlay view containing the controls you want to display, and use the methods described in Capturing still images or movies. You can display your custom overlay view in addition to, or instead of, the default controls. Custom overlay views for the `UIImagePickerController` class are available in iOS 3.1 and later by way of the `cameraOverlayView` property. For a code example, see the Customizing an image picker controller sample code project.

### Provide a delegate object

To use an image picker controller, you must provide a delegate that conforms to the `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate` protocol. Starting in iOS 4.1, you can use the delegate to save still-image metadata to the photo library along with the image. See `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`.

### Observe required viewing standards

As a view controller that renders on top of your app for the temporary purpose of selecting images, the picker controller expects your app to keep its contents visible as a prerequisite to operation. In iOS 17 and later, the picker controller ignores touch events while its opacity is anything other than fully opaque. If your app alters the controller’s visibility, such as by adjusting the `opacity` of its view’s layer, the picker controller disables user interaction.

### Adjust flash mode

In iOS 4.0 and later, you can provide custom controls to let the user adjust flash mode (on devices that have a flash LED), pick which camera to use (on devices that have a front and rear camera), and switch between still image and movie capture. You can also manage these settings programmatically. You can also manipulate the flash directly to provide effects, such as a strobe light. Present a picker interface set to use video capture mode. Then, turn the flash LED on or off by setting the `cameraFlashMode` property to `UIImagePickerController.CameraFlashMode.on` or `UIImagePickerController.CameraFlashMode.off`.

### Work with movies

Movie capture has a default duration limit of 10 minutes but can be adjusted using the `videoMaximumDuration` property. When a person taps the Share button to send a movie to MMS, YouTube, or another destination, the system applies duration and video quality limitations.

The default camera interface supports editing movies in the photo library. Editing involves trimming from the start or end of the movie, then saving the trimmed movie. To display an interface dedicated to movie editing, rather than one that also supports recording new movies, use the `UIVideoEditorController` class instead of this one. See `UIVideoEditorController`.

### Work with Live Photos

Live Photos is a Camera app feature on supported devices, enabling a picture to be not just a single moment in time but to include motion and sound from the moments just before and after its capture. A `PHLivePhoto` object represents a Live Photo, and the `PHLivePhotoView` class provides a system-standard, interactive user interface for displaying a Live Photo and playing back its content.

Although Live Photos include sound and motion, they remain photos. When you use an image picker controller to capture or choose still images (by including only the `kUTTypeImage` type in the `mediaTypes` array), assets that were captured as Live Photos continue to appear in the picker. However, when the user chooses an asset, your `delegate` object receives only a `UIImage` object containing a still-image representation of the Live Photo.

To obtain the full motion and sound content when the user chooses a Live Photo with the image picker, you must include _both_ the `kUTTypeImage` and `kUTTypeLivePhoto` types in the `mediaTypes` array. For more information, see `livePhoto` in `UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`.

### Perform fully customized media capture and browsing

To perform fully customized image or movie capture, instead use the AVFoundation framework as described in Still and Video Media Capture. Camera access using the AVFoundation framework is available starting in iOS 4.0.

To create a fully customized image picker for browsing the photo library, use classes from the Photos framework. For example, you could create a custom image picker that displays larger thumbnail images generated and cached by iOS, that makes use of image metadata including timestamp and location information, or that integrates with other features such as MapKit and iCloud Photo Sharing. For more information, see PhotoKit. Media browsing using the Photos framework is available starting in iOS 8.0.

# Customizing a document-based app’s launch experience

Add unique elements to your app’s document launch scene.

## Overview

In iOS 18 and later, you can customize the document browsing experience for your app, such as setting the title and action buttons, configuring the background, and adding custom assets to the scene.

### Set up a document-based app

To create a customized document launch experience, follow these steps:

- Declare your supported document types in the Document Types section of your app target’s Info tab.

- Set the Supports Document Browser key ( `UISupportsDocumentBrowser`) in the Custom iOS Target Properties section of the Info tab.

- Create a `UIDocument` subclass for each document type your app supports.

- Create a `UIDocumentViewController` subclass for your app, and have the subclass adopt the `UIDocumentBrowserViewControllerDelegate` protocol.

- Set your document view subclass as your app’s root view controller. Alternatively, you can embed your `UIDocumentViewController` subclass in a navigation controller, and set that as the root view controller.

- Implement your delegate’s `documentDidOpen()` method to configure your document view.

- Configure the launch scene using the document view controller’s `launchOptions` property.

When setting the document type, provide a name and the Uniform Type Identifier for your documents. Add the `CFBundleTypeRole` key with a value of `Viewer` (read-only) or `Editor` (if your app both reads and writes the document type). Finally, add a `UIDocumentClass` key, and set its value to the name of your `UIDocument` subclass for this document type.

When implementing your `documentDidOpen()` method, verify that you have a valid document and a valid view before updating the view. For more information, see `UIDocumentViewController`.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()
// Configure your launch options.
mySetupTextView()
}

override func documentDidOpen() {
mySetupTextView()
}

func mySetupTextView() {

// Make sure you have a valid document.
guard let document = document as? MyDocument else { return }

// Make sure you have a valid view.
guard let view else { return }

// Make sure the document is open.
guard !document.documentState.contains(.closed) else { return }

// Configure the view.
textView.text = document.text
}

### Create new documents

The document viewer uses app intents to create new documents. It also uses the `UIDocument.CreationIntent` structure to specify the different ways your app can create documents. `UIDocument` already provides a default intent and the corresponding `.default` enumeration value.

To add your own intents, start by extending `UIDocument.CreationIntent` and adding values for your intents.

// Extend the creation intent enumeration to add custom options for document creation.
extension UIDocument.CreationIntent {
static let template = UIDocument.CreationIntent("template")
}

Then call the `UIDocument` class’s `createDocumentAction(withIntent:)` method to create the intent. Set the intent’s title, and assign it to your `UIDocumentViewController.LaunchOptions` instance’s `primaryAction` or `secondaryAction` properties. By default, the system automatically sets the document view controller’s `primaryAction` to the default create document action.

// Provide an action for the secondary action.
let templateAction = LaunchOptions.createDocumentAction(withIntent: .template)

// Set the intent's title.
templateAction.title = "Choose a Template"

// Add the intent to an action.
launchOptions.secondaryAction = templateAction

Finally, implement the `UIDocumentBrowserViewControllerDelegate` protocol’s `documentBrowser(_:didRequestDocumentCreationWithHandler:)` method. The system calls this method when something triggers one of the create document intents. In your implementation, use the controller’s `activeDocumentCreationIntent` to determine the intent. Create the document, and then pass the URL and the `UIDocumentBrowserViewController.ImportMode` to the `intentHandler`.

switch controller.activeDocumentCreationIntent {
case .template:

// Let someone select a template, and return
// a URL to that template.
let templateURL = myPresentTemplateSelection()

// Pass the URL to the import handler.
importHandler(templateURL, .copy)

default:

// Create the default document.
let newDocumentURL = myCreateEmptyDocument()

// Pass the URL to the import handler.
importHandler(newDocumentURL, .move )
}
}

### Customize the document browsing experience

On iPad, iPhone, and Vision Pro (for compatible iPad apps), the system displays a launch scene that contains a title and any document creation buttons. It also displays the document browser as a sheet over this view. Use your document view controller’s `launchOptions` property to customize this scene as follows:

- Set the `title` property to change the name that appears in the title view. By default, the controller uses your app’s name.

- Modify the `background` property to configure the scene’s background.

- Use the `foregroundAccessoryView` or `backgroundAccessoryView` to place `UIView` objects in front of or behind the title view.

- Set the `primaryAction` or `secondaryAction` properties to add buttons to the title view. If you don’t modify the `primaryAction` property, the controller adds a Create Document button as the default primary action.

- Use `browserViewController` to access and configure the document browser controller.

Typically, you configure the launch options in your view controller’s `viewDidLoad()` method.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

// Assign the view controller as the browser delegate.
launchOptions.browserViewController.delegate = self

// Customize launch options.
launchOptions.title = "My Text Editor"
launchOptions.background.backgroundColor = .darkGray

// Provide an action for the secondary action.
let templateAction = LaunchOptions.createDocumentAction(withIntent: .template)
templateAction.title = "Choose a Template"
launchOptions.secondaryAction = templateAction

mySetupTextView()
}

# Adding a document browser to your app

Give users access to their local or remote documents from within your app.

## Overview

Use a document browser view controller as the root of your app’s view hierarchy. When a user selects a document, you present its view controller modally from your document browser.

The browser automatically gives users the option to share documents using the Share button or a drag-and-drop action. It also provides a standard interface for browsing and managing documents.

You set the type of documents that the user can select when the browser is first created. You can also set the browser’s appearance, modify its behaviors, and add custom actions.

# Providing access to directories

Use a document picker to access the content of a directory outside your app’s container.

## Overview

In iOS 12 and earlier, users can open and interact with files outside the app’s container. The `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` and `UIDocumentPickerViewController` provide access to files in the system’s local file provider, in iCloud, or in third-party services that use a File Provider extension. Users can select multiple files at a time — but they need to select each file individually.

In iOS 13, users can select a directory from any of the available file providers using a `UIDocumentPickerViewController`. The document picker returns a _security-scoped URL_ for the directory that permits your app to access content outside its container. In this case, the URL lets your app recursively access the directory and all of its contents, which includes accessing any new items you add to the directory in the future. Your app can even save a bookmark for this URL, letting it access the directory the next time it launches.

### Ask the user to select a directory

To prompt the user to select a directory, create a document picker and set the content type to open to the type `folder`. Then set the document picker’s delegate and present it.

// Create a document picker for directories.
let documentPicker =
UIDocumentPickerViewController(forOpeningContentTypes: [.folder])
documentPicker.delegate = self

// Set the initial directory.
documentPicker.directoryURL = startingDirectory

// Present the document picker.
present(documentPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)

As soon as you call the `present(_:animated:completion:)` method, the system displays the document picker to the user. If you specify the `directoryURL` property, the document picker starts with the selected directory. Otherwise, it starts with the most recent directory the user chose.

After the user taps Done, the system calls your delegate’s `documentPicker(_:didPickDocumentsAt:)` method, passing an array of security-scoped URLs for the user’s selected directories. Use a security-scoped URL to enumerate the content of the directory and any of its subdirectories, or to add, remove, or modify any files.

If the user taps Cancel, the system calls `documentPickerWasCancelled(_:)` instead.

### Access the directory’s content

When the user selects a directory in the document picker, the system gives your app permission to access that directory and all of its contents. The document picker returns a security-scoped URL for the directory. When you use one of these URLs to enumerate the directory’s content, the resulting URLs are also security-scoped. You can save a security-scoped URL as a bookmark and later resolve it back into a security-scoped URL.

To access the content of a security-scoped URL, you must do the following:

1. Before accessing the URL, call `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()`.

2. Use a file coordinator to perform read or write operations on the URL’s contents.

3. After you access the URL, call `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()`.

func documentPicker(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController, didPickDocumentAt url: URL) {
// Start accessing a security-scoped resource.
guard url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() else {
// Handle the failure here.
return
}

// Make sure you release the security-scoped resource when you finish.
defer { url.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource() }

// Use file coordination for reading and writing any of the URL’s content.
var error: NSError? = nil
NSFileCoordinator().coordinate(readingItemAt: url, error: &error) { (url) in

let keys : [URLResourceKey] = [.nameKey, .isDirectoryKey]

// Get an enumerator for the directory's content.
guard let fileList =
FileManager.default.enumerator(at: url, includingPropertiesForKeys: keys) else {
Swift.debugPrint("*** Unable to access the contents of \(url.path) ***\n")
return
}

for case let file as URL in fileList {
// Start accessing the content's security-scoped URL.
guard file.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() else {
// Handle the failure here.
continue
}

// Do something with the file here.
Swift.debugPrint("chosen file: \(file.lastPathComponent)")

// Make sure you release the security-scoped resource when you finish.
file.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()
}
}
}

### Save the URL as a bookmark

To access the URL in the future, save the URL as a `minimalBookmark` using its `bookmarkData(options:includingResourceValuesForKeys:relativeTo:)` method.

do {
// Start accessing a security-scoped resource.
guard url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() else {
// Handle the failure here.
return
}

let bookmarkData = try url.bookmarkData(options: .minimalBookmark, includingResourceValuesForKeys: nil, relativeTo: nil)

try bookmarkData.write(to: getMyURLForBookmark())
}
catch let error {
// Handle the error here.
}

You can then read the bookmark, and resolve it to a security-scoped URL again.

do {
let bookmarkData = try Data(contentsOf: getMyURLForBookmark())
var isStale = false
let url = try URL(resolvingBookmarkData: bookmarkData, bookmarkDataIsStale: &isStale)

guard !isStale else {
// Handle stale data here.
return
}

// Use the URL here.
}
catch let error {
// Handle the error here.
}

### Respond to permission changes

This means your app must be ready to handle failures when accessing a directory’s content. Calls to the `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` method can fail, as well as any attempts to read or write to the URL. This is especially true when saving and resolving bookmarks to security-scoped URLs because using saved bookmarks can greatly increase the amount of time users have to possibly change your app’s permissions.

Sample Code

# Building a document browser-based app

Use a document browser to provide access to the user’s text files.

Download

Xcode 13.0+

## Overview

The Document Browser sample code uses a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` as the app’s root view controller. The browser defines the structure of the app, and the app displays the browser view when it launches. Users can then use the browser to:

- Browse all the text files on the user’s device, in their iCloud drive, or in any supported third-party file providers.

- Create new text files.

- Open text files.

When the user opens a file, the app transitions to an editor view. There, the user can edit and save the text file. When they are done editing, the app returns to the browser, letting the user open or create another file.

This sample code project demonstrates all the required steps to set up the document browser, to work with the user’s files, and to enable system animations. The following sections describe these steps in more detail.

### Setting up the document browser

The Document Browser app performs the following setup and configuration steps:

1. Assigns a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` subclass as the window’s `rootViewController`.

2. Specifies the supported document types.

3. Customizes the document browser’s behavior.

Document browser-based apps must assign a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` instance as the app’s `rootViewController`, ensuring that the browser remains in memory throughout the app’s lifetime.

The sample code defines a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` subclass named `DocumentBrowserViewController`. It then marks the subclass as the app’s initial view controller in the `Main.storyboard` storyboard, and displays the browser view when launched.

All document browser-based apps must also declare the document types that they can open. The sample code app declares support for text files in the project editor’s Info pane. For more information on setting the document type, see Setting up a document browser app.

Finally, the sample code configures the document browser in the `DocumentBrowserViewController` class’s `viewDidLoad()` method. Specifically, it enables document creation, and disables multiple document selection. This lets users create new documents from the browser, while also preventing them from opening more than one document at a time.

allowsDocumentCreation = true
allowsPickingMultipleItems = false

For more information on configuring a document browser, see Customizing the browser.

### Creating new documents

When the user creates a new document, the system calls the document browser delegate’s `documentBrowser(_:didRequestDocumentCreationWithHandler:)` method.

// Create a new document.
func documentBrowser(_ controller: UIDocumentBrowserViewController,

let doc = TextDocument()
let url = doc.fileURL

// Create a new document in a temporary location.
doc.save(to: url, for: .forCreating) { (saveSuccess) in

// Make sure the document saved successfully.
guard saveSuccess else {
os_log("*** Unable to create a new document. ***", log: .default, type: .error)

// Cancel document creation.
importHandler(nil, .none)
return
}

// Close the document.
doc.close(completionHandler: { (closeSuccess) in

// Make sure the document closed successfully.
guard closeSuccess else {
os_log("*** Unable to create a new document. ***", log: .default, type: .error)

// Pass the document's temporary URL to the import handler.
importHandler(url, .move)
})
}
}

In this method, the app creates, saves, and then closes a new text document. If successful, the app passes the URL to the method’s import handler, requesting that the system move the document to its final location. Otherwise, it passes `nil` to the import handler, canceling document creation.

### Opening and importing documents

Users can open documents in multiple ways. The sample code handles the following situations:

- If the app imports a document (including successfully creating a new document), the system calls the `documentBrowser(_:didImportDocumentAt:toDestinationURL:)` method.

- If the user selects a document from the browser, the system calls the `documentBrowser(_:didPickDocumentURLs:)` method.

- If the user shares a document with the app, or drags a document into the app, the system calls the app delegate’s `application(_:open:options:)` method.

In the first two cases, the app calls the custom `presentDocuments(at:)` method. In the third case, the app calls the browser’s `revealDocument(at:importIfNeeded:completion:)` method to import the document (if needed). It then calls the `presentDocuments(at:)` method.

The `presentDocuments(at:)` method instantiates a `TextDocumentViewController`, sets up the document’s animation, opens the document, and then presents the view controller by calling the browser’s `present(_:animated:completion:)` method.

### Enabling animations

The document browser provides two built-in animations: one for loading a file, another for transitioning to and from the document view.

To enable either of the system-provided document browser animations, first you need to request a transition controller for the document by calling the `transitionController(forDocumentURL:)` method.

transitionController = transitionController(forDocumentAt: documentURL)

To enable the loading animation, assign a `Progress` object to the transition controller when you begin to load the document.

// Set up the loading animation.
transitionController!.loadingProgress = doc.loadProgress

Increment the progress as the document loads, making sure to mark it as complete as soon as loading finishes. To simulate slow, incremental loading in the sample code project, uncomment the `TextDocument` class’s `read(from:)` method.

# Building a document browser app for custom file formats

Implement a custom document file format to manage user interactions with files on different cloud storage providers.

Download

Xcode 12.0+

## Overview

Users can store their documents on cloud storage providers such as iCloud Drive. An app based on the document browser view controller allows users to browse and access their documents no matter where those documents are stored. In addition, the document browser view controller lets users create new documents, and acts as a springboard into your application’s main user interface.

This sample app illustrates how to use the document browser view controller. It registers a custom file format called Particles in the system, and allows the user to create new Particles documents on any of the user’s activated file providers. When the user chooses a document, the app presents an editor view, where the user can modify the document’s contents. When the user completes their modifications, the system saves the file, and the user returns to the document browser view controller.

The app also demonstrates proper file handling using the `UIDocument` class, and builds a Quick Look preview and thumbnail extension for the Particles file format. Finally, this sample illustrates how to customize the appearance of the document browser view controller, the custom browser actions, and the presentation of document view controllers with a custom zoom transition.

The `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` and this Particles app require at least iOS 13.2.

### Configure the sample code project

Xcode provides a Document Based App template for creating document-based apps. This template comes with everything you need to implement a document-based application from scratch.

Once you have selected the template, the project provides a storyboard, which uses a `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` as its entry point. Additionally, the template creates a `UIDocument` subclass, Document, which acts as the representation of a document of your application at runtime. The logic to create new documents is already in place. When the user creates a new document, or opens an existing one by tapping a file in the document browser view controller, the system presents a `DocumentViewController`, which has a reference to a `Document` instance. This `DocumentViewController` acts as the main user interface to view and modify the contents of a document.

Next, you can extend the project to fit your needs. Set up a custom file format in the exported Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs) of your application, or configure one or more existing UTIs in the imported UTIs section. The application’s document types need to be configured as well, so that the document browser view controller can display the correct files to the user.

Next, provide the document to start with when the user creates a new document; for instance, by copying a file from the application bundle, which represents a blank version of a new document. Hand over the blank file to the document browser view controller via the import handler. In order to provide proper document saving and loading, augment the `UIDocument` subclass with the logic needed in order to encode and decode the data of a document properly.

Finally, you can configure the document browser view controller to show custom browser actions to the user when selecting one or more documents at once, or when long-pressing a document to reveal the menu.

### Animate view controller transitions

When presenting a document view controller after creating a new document or choosing an existing one, a transition controller can animate the view controller change with an elegant zoom transition.

The `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` class provides a method to obtain a transition controller. The transition controller has a reference to a document, so that its thumbnail can be used as the starting point or end point of the animation.

Assign a transitioning delegate object to the document view controller (the view controller that displays the document’s contents). The transitioning delegate needs to conform to the `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` protocol. The system asks the delegate for an animation controller when the system is about to present or dismiss the view controller. The delegate returns a transition controller obtained from the document browser view controller. The transition controller displays the zoom animation when opening or closing documents.

### Configure a custom file format

This sample introduces a custom file format called Particles. Particles files use the `.particles` extension. In order to register the file format, the sample has modifies both the Exported UTIs and the Document Types in the target’s Info pane.

- In the Exported UTIs section, the sample project defines a Particles document as conforming to `public.data, public.content`. This entry registers the file format with the system.

- Under “Additional exported UTI properties,” the sample project defines the `UTTypeTagSpecification` dictionary with a `public.filename-extension` key and value of `particles` This entry sets `particles` as the document’s extension.

- In the Document Types section, the sample project also defines the Particles document, enabling support for Particle documents in the app’s document browser.

- Because this app created the file format, under “Additional document type properties,” it sets the `LSHandlerRank` to `Owner`.

### Preview custom documents

The sample provides two Quick Look extensions:

- The `ParticlesPreview` extension, which generates preview views.

- The `ParticlesThumbnails` extension, which generates thumbnails for files of the newly registered file format.

In order for Quick Look to choose the extensions when dealing with Particles documents, the `Info.plist` file of both extensions are configured with the Particles file format data.

### Apply best practices

Whenever possible, create document-based apps using `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` and `UIDocument` subclasses. The `UIDocument` class provides the commonly expected features of a document-based application, such as saving and loading documents, asynchronous reading and writing of data, versioning with conflict detection, and much more. Additionally, `UIDocument` provides the automatic coordinated reading and writing needed to avoid problems when accessing a file on disk that could be read or written by other processes at the same time. To access a file manually, use file coordination in order to avoid data loss.

Avoid listing high-level UTIs in the document types configured for an application. Only list the UTIs that the application can actually handle. Otherwise, the document browser view controller may display files of unsupported file formats that are irrelevant to the user in the Recents section, in search results, or other locations.

Configure the document types and the exported and imported UTIs in the application’s `Info.plist` file correctly. Dynamic sections such as Recent Documents, collections of tagged documents, and the popover of the application need this information to work properly.

Finally, it’s important to know when to use the picker view controller. The `UIDocumentPickerViewController` and `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` are two different view controllers, each with their own purpose. Use the `UIDocumentPickerViewController` to allow the user to quickly pick an existing file to, for example, insert into the currently opened document, or to export a document to a certain location. Use the `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` as the entry point in the application to let the users create new or choose an existing document.

Customizing the browser

## Overview

With the document browser view controller, users can easily access and view their documents in the cloud. By default, the document browser can access both the system’s local file provider and its iCloud file provider.

The local file provider grants access to all the documents in the app’s `Documents` directory. Users can also access documents from another app’s `Documents` directory, if that app declares either the `UISupportsDocumentBrowser` key, or both the `UIFileSharingEnabled` and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` keys in its `Info.plist` file. When the user opens a document from another app’s `Documents` directory, they edit the document in place, and save the changes to the other app’s `Documents` directory.

The iCloud file provider creates a folder for your app in the user’s iCloud Drive. Users can access documents from this folder, or from anywhere in their iCloud Drive. The system automatically handles access to iCloud for you, so you don’t need to enable your app’s iCloud capabilities.

Third-party storage services can also provide access to the documents they manage by implementing a File Provider extension (iOS 11 or later). For more information, see File Provider.

## Mentioned in

Providing access to directories

## Overview

Use a document picker view controller to select a document to open or export, and optionally copy. Don’t copy the document if you can avoid it. The document picker operates in two modes:

- Open a document. The user selects a document. The document picker provides access to the document, and the user can edit the document in place. Optionally, you can specify that the document picker makes a copy of the document, leaving the original unchanged.

- Export a local document. The user selects a destination. The document picker moves the document, and the user can access it and edit it in place. Optionally, you can specify that the document picker makes a copy of the document, leaving the original unchanged.

### Work with external documents

Both the open and export operations grant access to documents outside your app’s sandbox. This access gives users an unprecedented amount of flexibility when working with their documents. However, it also adds a layer of complexity to your file handling. External documents have the following additional requirements:

- The open and move operations provide security-scoped URLs for all external documents. Call the `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` method to access or bookmark these documents, and the `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` method to release them. If you’re using a `UIDocument` subclass to manage your document, it automatically manages the security-scoped URL for you.

- Always use file coordinators (see `NSFileCoordinator`) to read and write to external documents.

- Always use a file presenter (see `NSFilePresenter`) when displaying the contents of an external document.

- Don’t save URLs that the open and move operations provide. You can, however, save a bookmark to these URLs after calling `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` to ensure you have access. Call the `bookmarkData(options:includingResourceValuesForKeys:relativeTo:)` method and pass in the `withSecurityScope` option, creating a bookmark that contains a security-scoped URL.

- UICloudSharingController

Class

# UICloudSharingController

A view controller that presents standard screens for adding and removing people from a CloudKit share record.

@MainActor
class UICloudSharingController

## Overview

CloudKit Sharing provides real-time collaboration between one or more people using your app. A user takes certain steps to make collaboration possible, from inviting people to participate in the collaboration to setting restrictions on what participants can do. To provide these steps to a user, you must make changes to your app. With `UICloudSharingController`, the changes require minimum effort.

The `UICloudSharingController` view controller class provides screens, presented within your app, for managing the people, permissions, and access rights associated with a `CKShare` record. The controller, along with a few lines of your own code, facilitates the setup and management of online sharing between users, making it possible for a user to:

- Invite people to view or collaborate on a shared record

- Set the access rights determining who can access the shared record (only people invited or anyone with the share link)

- Set general or individual permissions (read-only or read/write)

- Remove access from one or more participants

- Stop participating (if the user is a participant)

- Stop sharing with all participants (if the user is the owner of the shared record)

The controller provides these different actions to the user based on the user’s role. If the user is the individual sharing the record (where the record is an instance of `CKRecord` representing the data to share), then the user is called the _owner_. A user who has access to the shared record and isn’t the owner is known as a _participant_. There’s no need for you to specify the user’s role. The controller determines the role automatically.

### Inviting participants to a new share

The user who owns the data, represented as a `CKRecord`, can invite others to view or collaborate on changes to the data. To invite participants, the owner sends the share link to the other people. To provide this capability in your app, create an instance of `UICloudSharingController` using the `init(preparationHandler:)` initializer method. You use this initializer method only when the owner isn’t already sharing the record.

After creating the controller, you present it. The controller displays the Invitation screen. Using this screen, the owner can add participants and set restrictions on the shared record. Once done, the owner sends the share link to the participants.

However, before the owner can send the share link, CloudKit must generate the link. This link generation happens when saving a new `CKShare` record, but when do you save it? You save the share record in the `preparationHandler:`.

After the owner’s selections are complete, the controller invokes the preparation handler provided in the initializer call. In the handler, you create a new `CKShare` instance, initializing it with the `CKRecord` instance that represents the data to share. (This record is called the “root record.”) Next, you save the share and root records using `CKModifyRecordsOperation`. Finally, you return the shared record to the controller or return an error if the save failed. See the following code for an example of this in action.

func presentCloudSharingController(_ sender: Any) { guard
let barButtonItem = sender as? UIBarButtonItem,
let rootRecord = self.recordToShare else {
return
}

guard let `self` = self else {
return
}
self.share(rootRecord: rootRecord, completion: completion)
}

if let popover = cloudSharingController.popoverPresentationController {
popover.barButtonItem = barButtonItem
}
self.present(cloudSharingController, animated: true) {}
}

let shareRecord = CKShare(rootRecord: rootRecord)
let recordsToSave = [rootRecord, shareRecord]
let container = CKContainer.default()
let privateDatabase = container.privateCloudDatabase
let operation = CKModifyRecordsOperation(recordsToSave: recordsToSave, recordIDsToDelete: [])
operation.perRecordCompletionBlock = { (record, error) in
if let error = error {
print("CloudKit error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
}

operation.modifyRecordsCompletionBlock = { (savedRecords, deletedRecordIDs, error) in
if let error = error {
completion(nil, nil, error)
} else {
completion(shareRecord, container, nil)
}
}

privateDatabase.add(operation)
}

- (void)presentCloudSharingController:(id)sender
{
CKRecord *rootRecord = [self recordToShare];
if (rootRecord == nil || [sender isKindOfClass:[UIBarButtonItem class]] == NO) {
return;
}
UICloudSharingController *cloudSharingController = [[UICloudSharingController alloc] initWithPreparationHandler:^(UICloudSharingController * _Nonnull controller, void (^ _Nonnull preparationCompletionHandler)(CKShare * _Nullable, CKContainer * _Nullable, NSError * _Nullable)) {\
\
[self shareRootRecord:rootRecord completion:preparationCompletionHandler];\
\
}];

UIPopoverPresentationController *popover = [cloudSharingController popoverPresentationController];
if (popover) {
[popover setBarButtonItem:sender];
}
[self presentViewController:cloudSharingController animated:YES completion:nil];
}
- (void)shareRootRecord:(CKRecord *)rootRecord completion:(void (^)(CKShare * _Nullable share, CKContainer * _Nullable container, NSError * _Nullable error))completion
{
CKShare *shareRecord = [[CKShare alloc] initWithRootRecord:rootRecord];
NSArray *recordsToSave = @[rootRecord, shareRecord];
CKContainer *container = [CKContainer defaultContainer];
CKDatabase *privateDatabase = [container privateCloudDatabase];

CKModifyRecordsOperation *operation = [[CKModifyRecordsOperation alloc] initWithRecordsToSave:recordsToSave recordIDsToDelete:@[]];
[operation setPerRecordCompletionBlock:^(CKRecord * _Nullable record, NSError * _Nullable error) {\
if (error) {\
NSLog(@"%@", [error localizedDescription]);\
}\
}];

if (error) {\
NSLog(@"%@", [error localizedDescription]);\
}\
completion(shareRecord, container, error);\
}];

[privateDatabase addOperation:operation];
}

### Adding and removing participants from an existing share

To allow the owner of an existing share to manage the participants, create the `UICloudSharingController` instance using the `init(share:container:)` initializer method.

After you create the controller, present it to show the People screen. From this screen, the owner can:

- Add and remove participants

- Change the share’s access options from private to public, or public to private

- Change the share’s permissions from read-only to read/write, or vice versa

- Stop sharing with all participants

### Viewing participants and leaving a share

To allow a participant to view the list of participants and remove themselves from a share, create the `UICloudSharingController` instance using the `init(share:container:)` initializer method.

After you create the controller, present it to show the People screen. From this screen, the participant can:

- View the list of participants

- Copy the share link to send to others (if the owner has made the share publicly available)

- Leave the share

### Presenting the controller

`UICloudSharingController` is designed for use in a popover. Therefore, you should always set the `popoverPresentationController` source information before presenting the Cloud sharing controller. Doing this ensures that the `UICloudSharingController` instance is displayed properly across all device types.

The following code shows an example of setting the `popoverPresentationController` before presenting a Cloud sharing controller.

// Save the share and root records.
// Call completion(share, container, error) handler.
}

- (void)presentCloudSharingController:(id)sender
{
if ([self recordToShare] == nil || [sender isKindOfClass:[UIBarButtonItem class]] == NO) {
return;
}

UICloudSharingController *cloudSharingController = [[UICloudSharingController alloc] initWithPreparationHandler:^(UICloudSharingController * _Nonnull controller, void (^ _Nonnull preparationCompletionHandler)(CKShare * _Nullable, CKContainer * _Nullable, NSError * _Nullable)) {\
// Save the share and root records\
// Call preparationCompletionHandler(share, container, error);\
}];

UIPopoverPresentationController *popover = [cloudSharingController popoverPresentationController];
if (popover) {
[popover setBarButtonItem:sender];
}

[self presentViewController:cloudSharingController animated:YES completion:nil];
}

### Configuring the controller

By default, the `UICloudSharingController` user interface displays a generic thumbnail image and title to the user. You can, however, change these to app-specific representations of the shared record. You accomplish this by setting the controller’s `delegate` property to an object that conforms to the `UICloudSharingControllerDelegate` protocol, making sure to implement the `itemThumbnailData(for:)` and `itemTitle(for:)` delegate methods.

You can also show or hide the permission and access options presented to the user by setting the `availablePermissions` property on the `UICloudSharingController` instance.

# Collaborating and sharing copies of your data

Share data and collaborate with people from your app.

## Overview

You can share data from your app using a `UIActivityViewController` object. There are numerous options for packaging your data and instantiating the activity view controller. One approach is to create one or more `NSItemProvider` objects for the data you want to share. Use the item providers to create a `UIActivityItemsConfiguration`, and then use the configuration to create your activity view controller. You can then present the view controller.

// Create an item provider for your data.
let itemProvider = NSItemProvider(item: noteText.text as NSString,
typeIdentifier: "public.utf8-plain-text")

// Create an activity item configuration from the item provider.
let configuration =
UIActivityItemsConfiguration(itemProviders: [itemProvider])

// Create the activity view controller from the configuration.
let shareSheet = UIActivityViewController(activityItemsConfiguration: configuration)

// Present the share sheet.
present(shareSheet, animated:true) {}

This displays the share sheet, letting someone share a copy of the data with other apps on the device. The options that appear in the share sheet vary depending on the type of data that you’re sharing. The example above shares a UTF-8 string, so the share sheet shows apps that can accept text, like Messages, Mail, and Notes.

### Enable collaboration for iCloud documents

The example above shares a copy of your app’s data. You can also enable collaboration so that the recipients can see an updated view of the data, and even make their own changes to it, depending on the permissions in your app.

To enable collaboration, you need shareable content, such as:

- A URL to an iCloud document (see `url(forUbiquityContainerIdentifier:)`)

- Data stored in CloudKit

- A custom collaboration architecture that supports universal links (see Integrate your custom collaboration app in Messages)

For example, to enable collaboration for an iCloud document, you need a URL to a file in your app’s iCloud container. Create an `NSItemProvider` object, and call its `registerFileRepresentation(for:visibility:openInPlace:loadHandler:)` method, passing the URL as the `for:` parameter and `true` as the `openInPlace:` parameter.

// Create an empty item provider.
let itemProvider = NSItemProvider()

// Add the URL to a file saved in the iCloud document container.
itemProvider
.registerFileRepresentation(for: .utf8PlainText,
openInPlace: true) { completion in
completion(url, true, nil)
return nil
}

Then create and display the activity view controller as in the first code example. This time, the share sheet has a pop-up menu for selecting a sharing mode.

### Enable the copying and collaboration of CloudKit data

Because CloudKit doesn’t store its data as files, it requires a different approach for both sharing copies and collaborating. To share a copy of CloudKit data, you need to create a shareable representation of the data. Then register that data with an `NSItemProvider`. For example, if you want to share your app’s data as UTF-8 text, you can use the previous example to create an item provider for your text.

To enable collaboration, create a `CKShare` when collaboration starts. You also need your `CKContainer` and the `CKAllowedSharingOptions` that define the permissions you’re granting to collaborators.

// Create an item provider.
let itemProvider = NSItemProvider()

// Create and save a new share.
itemProvider.registerCKShare(container: container,
allowedSharingOptions: CKAllowedSharingOptions.standard) {

// Create your share.
let newShare = CKShare(rootRecord: recordToShare)

// Configure the share, save it, and handle any errors here.

// Return the newly saved share.
return newShare

}

To invite new collaborators to an existing share, create an item provider and register the share.

// Register an existing share.
itemProvider
.registerCKShare(
savedShare,
container: container,
allowedSharingOptions: CKAllowedSharingOptions.standard
)

For more information about collaboration in CloudKit, see Sharing CloudKit Data with Other iCloud Users.

### Restrict the sharing mode

By default, if your item provider supports both copying and collaborating, the share sheet shows a pop-up menu, letting people select a sharing mode. In iOS 18 and later, you can restrict sharing to only one of the two modes.

To restrict the sharing mode, create a `UIActivityViewController.CollaborationModeRestriction` and assign it to your configuration’s metadata. You can access the metadata using the configuration’s `perItemMetadataProvider` property.

// Iterate through the metadata keys.
configuration.perItemMetadataProvider = { _, key in
switch key {
case .collaborationModeRestrictions:
// If it's the collaboration mode restriction key, return an array
// containing a collaboration mode restriction object.
let modeRestriction = UIActivityViewController.CollaborationModeRestriction(
disabledMode: .collaborate
)
return [modeRestriction]
default:
return nil
}
}

Then, create and present the share sheet as before. This produces a share sheet that displays only the allowed sharing mode.

Alternatively, you can show both sharing options, but display an alert when someone selects the restricted mode. This alert can also include a recovery suggestion to help people enable the restricted mode.

// Iterate through the metadata keys.
configuration.perItemMetadataProvider = { _, key in
switch key {
case .collaborationModeRestrictions:
// Set the title and text for the alert. Optionally, you can set the title and provide
// a launch URL for the recovery action.
let modeRestriction = UIActivityViewController.CollaborationModeRestriction(
disabledMode: .collaborate,
alertTitle: "File Locked",
alertMessage: "You need to unlock the file before you can share it for collaboration.",
alertDismissButtonTitle: "Cancel",
alertRecoverySuggestionButtonTitle: "Unlock",
alertRecoverySuggestionButtonLaunch: unlockURL
)
return [modeRestriction]
default:
return nil
}
}

In this case, the share sheet shows the pop-up menu with the allowed sharing mode already selected. When someone tries to change the sharing mode to the restricted mode, the system displays an alert. If they then tap the recovery button, it calls your scene delegate’s `scene(_:openURLContexts:)` method, passing in the provided URL. For more information about using launch URLs, see Defining a custom URL scheme for your app.

### Specify the people to share with

In iOS 18 and later, you can also specify recipients for the shared data. Create an `INPerson` instance for each recipient and add them to your activity configuration’s metadata.

// Gather data about the recipient.
var name = PersonNameComponents()
name.givenName = myBFF.givenName
name.familyName = myBFF.familyName

let displayName = myBFF.givenName
let email = myBFF.email
let image = INImage(imageData: myBFF.image)

// Create an `INPerson` instance for the recipient.
let recipient = INPerson(
personHandle: .init(value: email, type: .emailAddress),
nameComponents: name,
displayName: displayName,
image: image,
contactIdentifier: nil,
customIdentifier: nil)

// Iterate through the metadata keys.
configuration.perItemMetadataProvider = { _, key in
switch key {
// Set the share recipients to an array of `INPerson` instances.
case .shareRecipients:
return [recipient]
default:
return nil
}
}

The share sheet then populates the recipient’s data in apps that accept recipients, such as Mail and Messages.

If a person selects a different recipient from the share sheet, that selection overrides your specified recipients. If they select an app that doesn’t accept recipients, the system ignores your recipient.

You can also hide the other recipients from the share sheet by setting the activity view controller’s `excludedActivityViewTypes` property to `UIActivityViewTypesPeopleSuggestions`.

// Hide the suggested recipients.
shareSheet.excludedActivityViewTypes = .peopleSuggestions

Class

# UIFontPickerViewController

A view controller that manages the interface for selecting a font that the system provides or the user installs.

@MainActor
class UIFontPickerViewController

## Overview

Use a `UIFontPickerViewController` to provide the user access to all the fonts on their device. Directly querying `UIFont` provides only system fonts, but the user may have additional fonts on their device. When the user selects one of these nonsystem fonts in the font picker, the system grants your app access to the font.

The font picker has several customization options collected into a `UIFontPickerViewController.Configuration` object. For example, you can set `includeFaces` to `true` so that the user can select not only the font but a bold or italic face within that font family. Customize the configuration object first, then pass it as an argument in the font picker’s `init(configuration:)` method.

func showFontPicker(_ sender: Any) {
let fontConfig = UIFontPickerViewController.Configuration()
fontConfig.includeFaces = true
let fontPicker = UIFontPickerViewController(configuration: fontConfig)
fontPicker.delegate = self
self.present(fontPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

When your `UIFontPickerViewControllerDelegate` receives `fontPickerViewControllerDidPickFont(_:)`, retrieve information about the user’s selected font from the font picker’s `selectedFontDescriptor`.

@MainActor
class UIColorPickerViewController

## Overview

`UIColorPickerViewController` provides a standard interface to select colors. Use this class instead of `UIColorWell` if you need more fine-grained control over the presentation.

You typically present a `UIColorPickerViewController` as a popover:

// This example code appears in a subclass of UIViewController that conforms to
// UIColorPickerViewControllerDelegate.
func presentColorPicker() {
let colorPicker = UIColorPickerViewController()
colorPicker.title = "Background Color"
colorPicker.supportsAlpha = false
colorPicker.delegate = self
colorPicker.modalPresentationStyle = .popover
colorPicker.popoverPresentationController?.sourceItem = self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem
self.present(colorPicker, animated: true)
}

You can also react to the color-selection change or the dismissal of the color picker by implementing the `UIColorPickerViewControllerDelegate` functions.

Class

# UIReferenceLibraryViewController

A view controller that displays a standard interface for looking up the definition of a word or term.

@MainActor
class UIReferenceLibraryViewController

## Overview

A `UIReferenceLibraryViewController` object should not be used to display wordlists, create a standalone dictionary app, or republish the content in any form.

You create and initialize a reference library view controller using the `init(term:)` method. You pass the term to define as the parameter to this method and the definition is displayed. You can present this view controller modally or as part of another interface. On iPad, you can set the reference library view controller as the content view controller of a `UIPopoverController` object. Optionally, use the `dictionaryHasDefinition(forTerm:)` class method to check if a definition is available for a given term before creating an instance—for example, use this method if you want to change the user interface depending on whether a definition is available.

## Topics

### Creating a reference-library view controller

Returns whether a definition is available for the given term.

`init(term: String)`

Class

# UIPrinterPickerController

A view controller that displays the standard interface for selecting a printer.

@MainActor
class UIPrinterPickerController

## Overview

You can use a printer picker controller to display a list of printers to the user prior to printing a document, photo, or other content. Printer pickers display all pickers normally but you can filter out printers by assigning an appropriate delegate object to the picker before displaying it.

A printer picker controller coordinates the presentation and dismissal of its interface with its associated delegate object. The delegate object is an object that you provide and that conforms to the `UIPrinterPickerControllerDelegate` protocol. When the user selects a printer, the picker also notifies the delegate of the selection.

A printer picker controller isn’t a view controller, so you don’t present it the way you do other view controllers. You present the picker using one of the presentation methods of this class. Those methods work with the picker’s delegate object to determine the most appropriate way to present the picker. If the delegate implements the `printerPickerControllerParentViewController(_:)` method, the picker presents itself using the view controller returned by that method. Some presentation methods may present the picker using a popover instead.

For more information about the picker delegate methods, see `UIPrinterPickerControllerDelegate`.

Sample Code

# Restoring your app’s state

Provide continuity for the user by preserving current activities.

Download

Xcode 13.0+

## Overview

This sample project demonstrates how to preserve your appʼs state information and restore the app to that previous state on subsequent launches. During a subsequent launch, restoring your interface to the previous interaction point provides continuity for the user, and lets them finish active tasks quickly.

When using your app, the user performs actions that affect the user interface. For example, the user might view a specific page of information, and after the user leaves the app, the operating system might terminate it to free up the resources it holds. The user should be able to objects. In iOS 12 and earlier, apps preserve the state of their user interfaces by saving and restoring the configuration of view controllers.

For scene-based apps, UIKit asks each scene to save its state information using an `NSUserActivity` object. `NSUserActivity` is a core part of modern state restoration with `UIScene` and `UISceneDelegate`. In your own apps, you use the activity object to store information needed to recreate your scene’s interface and restore the content of that interface. If your app doesn’t support scenes, use the view-controller-based state restoration process to preserve the state of your interface instead.

For additional information about state restoration, see Preserving your app’s UI across launches.

### Configure the sample code project

In Xcode, select your development team on the iOS target’s General tab.

### Enable state preservation and restoration

To provide the necessary activity object, the sample implements the `stateRestorationActivity(for:)` method of its scene delegate as shown in the example below. Implementing this method tells the system that the sample supports user-activity-based state restoration. The implementation of this method returns the activity object from the scene’s `userActivity` property, which the sample populates when the scene becomes inactive.

return scene.userActivity
}

For view-controller-based state restoration, this sample opts in to state preservation and restoration using the app delegate’s `application(_:shouldSaveApplicationState:)` and `application(_:shouldRestoreApplicationState:)` methods. Both methods return a `Bool` value that indicates whether the step should occur. This sample returns `true` for both functions.

This example enables the preservation of state for the app:

return true
}

This example enables the restoration of state for the app:

### Restore the app state with an activity object

Scene-based state restoration is the recommended way to restore the app’s user interface. An `NSUserActivity` object captures the app’s state at the current moment in time. For this sample, the app preserves and restores the product information as the user displays or edits it. The sample app saves the product’s data in an `NSUserActivity` object when the user closes the app or the app enters the background. When the user launches the app again, the sample’s `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method checks for the presence of an activity object. If one is present, the method configures the detail view controller that the activity object specifies.

### Restore the app state using view controllers

This sample preserves its state by saving the state of its view controller hierarchy. View controllers adopt the `UIStateRestoring` protocol, which defines methods for saving custom state information to an archive and restoring that information later.

The sample specifies which of its view controllers to save, and assigns a restoration identifier to that view controller. A restoration identifier is a string that UIKit uses to identify a view controller or other user interface element. The identifier for each view controller must be unique. The sample assigns the identifiers in Interface Builder, but this can also occur in code.

The sample assigns a restoration ID for each view controller in the storyboard file. This information is available by selecting the view controller and looking at the Identity Inspector. The Storyboard ID for that view controller is usually the same as the Restoration ID.

This sample saves the state information in the detail view controller’s `encodeRestorableState(with:)` method, and it restores that state in the `restoreState(with:)` method. Because it already encapsulates the view controller’s state in an `NSUserActivity` object, the implementations of these methods operate on the existing activity object. The sample then calls the required `super` object from these methods, which allows UIKit to restore the rest of the view controller’s inherited state.

This example enables the state preservation of `InfoViewController`:

override func encodeRestorableState(with coder: NSCoder) {
super.encodeRestorableState(with: coder)

coder.encode(product?.identifier.uuidString, forKey: InfoViewController.restoreProductKey)
}

This example enables the state restoration of `InfoViewController`:

override func decodeRestorableState(with coder: NSCoder) {
super.decodeRestorableState(with: coder)

guard let decodedProductIdentifier =
coder.decodeObject(forKey: InfoViewController.restoreProductKey) as? String else {
fatalError("A product did not exist in the restore. In your app, handle this gracefully.")
}
product = DataModelManager.sharedInstance.product(fromIdentifier: decodedProductIdentifier)
}

### Test state restoration on a device

This sample restores the following user interface:

- Detail View Controller — Tap a product in the collection view to open its detail information. The app restores the selected product and selected tab.

- Detail View Controller’s Edit State — In the detail view, tap Edit. The app restores the edit view and its content.

- Secondary Window — (iPad only) Drag a product from the collection view over to the left or right of the device screen to create a second scene window. The app restores that scene and its product. Another way to create the secondary window is to tap and hold a product from the collection view through its contextual menu and select Open New Window.

When debugging the sample project, the system automatically deletes its preserved state when the user force quits the app. Deleting the preserved state information is a safety precaution. In addition, the system also deletes the preserved state if this app crashes at launch time. To test the sample app’s ability to restore the sample’s state, do not use the app switcher to force quit it during debugging. Instead, use Xcode to stop the app, or stop the app programmatically. One technique is to suspend the sample app using the Home button, and then stop the debugger in Xcode. Launch the sample app again using Xcode, and UIKit initiates the state restoration process.

# Preserving your app’s UI across launches

Return your app to its previous state after the system terminates it.

## Overview

Preserving your app’s user interface helps maintain the illusion that your app is always running. Interruptions can occur frequently on iOS devices, and a prolonged interruption might cause the system to terminate your app to free up resources. However, users don’t know that your app has been terminated and won’t expect the state of your app to change. Instead, they expect your app to be in the same state as when they left it. State preservation and restoration ensures that your app returns to its previous state when it launches again.

At appropriate times, UIKit preserves the state of your app’s views and view controllers to an encrypted file on disk. When your app is terminated and relaunched later, UIKit reconstructs your views and view controllers from the preserved data. The preservation and restoration processes are initiated automatically, but you must also do some specific work to support those processes:

- Enable support for state preservation and restoration.

- Assign restoration identifiers to the view controllers that you want to preserve.

- Recreate view controllers, as needed, at restoration time.

- Encode and decode the custom data that you need to restore your view controller to its previous state.

If you define your interface entirely in storyboards, UIKit knows how to recreate your view controllers, and does so automatically. If you don’t use storyboards, or if you want more control over the creation and initialization of your view controllers, you can create them yourself.

To see an example of state preservation and restoration, see Restoring your app’s state.

### Enable state preservation and restoration for your app

You opt-in to state preservation and restoration by implementing your app delegate’s `application(_:shouldSaveSecureApplicationState:)` and `application(_:shouldRestoreSecureApplicationState:)` methods. Both methods return a Boolean value indicating whether the associated process should occur, and in most cases you simply return `true`. However, you can return `false` at times when restoring your app’s interface might not be appropriate.

When UIKit calls your `application(_:shouldSaveSecureApplicationState:)` method, you can save data in addition to returning `true`. You might save data that you intend to use during the restoration process. For example, the following code shows an example that saves the app’s current version number. At restoration time, the `application(_:shouldRestoreSecureApplicationState:)` method checks the version number in the archive and prevents restoration from occurring if it doesn’t match the expected version.

func application(_ application: UIApplication,

// Save the current app version to the archive.
coder.encode(11.0, forKey: "MyAppVersion")

// Always save state information.
return true
}

// Restore the state only if the app version matches.
let version = coder.decodeFloat(forKey: "MyAppVersion")
if version == 11.0 {
return true
}

// Don't restore from old data.
return false
}

If you prevent restoration from occurring, you can still configure your app’s interface manually in the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method of your app delegate.

### Assign restoration identifiers to your view controllers

You explicitly tell UIKit which view controllers to preserve by assigning restoration identifiers to them. A restoration identifier is a unique string that you assign to the view controller programmatically or in Interface Builder. The name of the view controller class is usually a suitable restoration identifier, but you may use any string. Add that string to the view controller in your storyboard file or assign it to the view controller’s `restorationIdentifier` property at runtime.

At preservation time, UIKit attempts to preserve the root view controllers of your app’s windows. For each root view controller with a restoration identifier, UIKit asks that view controller to encode its custom data in an archive. A container view controller can encode references to its child view controllers as part of its custom data. If it does, and if those view controllers also have restoration identifiers, UIKit attempts to preserve the child view controllers and their contents. This process continues recursively, following the connections from one view controller to the next until all of them are saved or ignored.

You aren’t required to assign a restoration identifier to every view controller. In fact, there are times when you might not want to preserve all of your view controllers. For example, if your app displays a temporary login screen, you might not want that screen preserved. Instead, you’d want to determine at restoration time whether to display it. In that case, you wouldn’t assign a restoration identifier to the view controller for your login screen.

For detailed information about what gets preserved, see About the UI preservation process.

### Encode and decode custom information for your app

During the preservation process, UIKit calls the `encodeRestorableState(with:)` method of each preserved view and view controller. Use this method to preserve the information that you need to return the view or view controller to its current state.

- **Do** save details about the visual state of views and controls.

- **Do** save references to child view controllers that you also want to preserve.

- **Do** save information that can be discarded without affecting the user’s data.

- **Don’t** include data that’s already in your app’s persistent storage. Instead, include an identifier that you can use to locate that data later.

State preservation isn’t a substitute for saving your app’s data to disk. UIKit can discard state preservation data at its discretion, allowing your app to .

### Create view controllers when asked

If preserved state information is available when your app is launched, the system attempts to restore your app’s interface using the preserved data.

1. UIKit calls your app delegate’s `application(_:shouldRestoreSecureApplicationState:)` method to determine if restoration should proceed.

2. UIKit uses your app’s storyboards to recreate your view controllers.

3. UIKit calls each view controller’s `decodeRestorableState(with:)` method to restore its state information.

UIKit loads both the view controller and its views from your storyboard initially. After those objects have been loaded and initialized, UIKit begins restoring their state information. Use your `decodeRestorableState(with:)` methods to return your view controller to its previous state.

The following code shows the method for decoding the state that was encoded in the previous example. This method restores the view controller’s data from the preserved user ID. If a text field was being edited, this method also restores the in-progress value and makes the corresponding text field the first responder, which displays the keyboard for that text field.

override func decodeRestorableState(with coder: NSCoder) {
super.decodeRestorableState(with: coder)

// Restore the first name and last name from the user ID.
let identifier = coder.decodeObject(forKey: "UserID") as! String
setUserID(identifier: identifier)

// Restore an in-progress values that was not saved.
let activeField = coder.decodeInteger(forKey: "EditField")
let editedText = coder.decodeObject(forKey: "EditedText") as!
String?

switch activeField {
case 1:
firstNameField?.text = editedText
firstNameField?.becomeFirstResponder()
break

case 2:
lastNameField?.text = editedText
lastNameField?.becomeFirstResponder()
break

default:
break // Do nothing.
}
}

Defining your view controllers in storyboards is the easiest way to manage state restoration, but it isn’t the only way. For more information about other ways to recreate your view controllers, see About the UI restoration process.

About the UI preservation process

## Overview

You can add state restoring objects to an archive directly or by referencing them from another object that’s preserved, such as a view controller. The methods of the protocol let you save enough information about the object to find or recreate it during the next launch cycle.

When adopting this protocol in your custom objects, you must also remember to register those objects using the `registerObject(forStateRestoration:restorationIdentifier:)` method of the `UIApplication` class. You don’t need to register views or view controllers explicitly because UIKit registers those objects automatically. View controllers adopt this protocol so that they may be used as the restoration parent of one of your custom objects.

## Topics

### Accessing the object information

`var restorationParent: (any UIStateRestoring)?`

The parent object used to scope the current object.

`var objectRestorationClass: (any UIObjectRestoration.Type)?`

The class responsible for creating this object when restoring the app’s state.

### Encoding and decoding the object

`func encodeRestorableState(with: NSCoder)`

Encodes state-related information for the object.

`func decodeRestorableState(with: NSCoder)`

Decodes and restores state-related information for the object.

`func applicationFinishedRestoringState()`

Called after all objects have had a chance to decode their state.

# Positioning content within layout margins

Position views so that they aren’t crowded by other content.

## Overview

Layout margins provide a visual buffer between a view’s content and any content outside of the view’s bounds. The layout margins consist of inset values for each edge (top, bottom, leading, and trailing) of the view. These inset values create a space between the edges of the view’s bounds rectangle and the content inside the view. The following image shows two views with different sets of layout margins. Apart from the empty space they add around your content, margins have no visible representation.

To set up constraints that respect the layout margins, enable the `Constrain to margins` option in Xcode, as shown in the following image. (If you don’t enable that option, Xcode creates your constraints relative to the view’s bounds rectangle.) If the superview’s margins change later, the positions of elements tied to those margins are updated accordingly.

Even if you aren’t using constraints to position your content, you can still manually position content relative to a view’s layout margins. The `directionalLayoutMargins` property of each view contains the edge inset values to use for the view’s margins. Take those margin values into account when computing the position of items in your view.

### Change the default layout margins

UIKit provides default layout margins for each view, but you can change the default values to values that are more appropriate for your view. To change a view’s margin values, update the view’s `directionalLayoutMargins` property. (You can also use the Size inspector to set the value of that property at design time. In the Layout Margins section, choose the Language Directional option and enter the margin values for each of the view’s edges, as shown in the following image.)

For the root view of a view controller, UIKit enforces a set of minimum layout margins to ensure that content is displayed correctly. When the values in the `directionalLayoutMargins` property are less than the minimum values, UIKit uses the minimum values instead. You can get the minimum margin values from the `systemMinimumLayoutMargins` property of the view controller. To prevent UIKit from applying the minimum margins altogether, set the `viewRespectsSystemMinimumLayoutMargins` property of your view controller to false.

The view’s actual margins are computed using the view’s configuration and the value of its `directionalLayoutMargins` property. A view’s margins are affected by the settings of its `insetsLayoutMarginsFromSafeArea` and `preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins` properties, which can increase the default margin values to ensure appropriate spacing of your content.

# Positioning content relative to the safe area

Position views so that they aren’t obstructed by other content.

## Overview

Safe areas help you place your views within the visible portion of the overall interface. UIKit-defined view controllers may position special views on top of your content. For example, a navigation controller displays a navigation bar on top of the underlying view controller’s content. Even when such views are partially transparent, they still occlude the content that’s underneath them. In tvOS, the safe area also includes the screen’s overscan insets, which represent the area covered by the screen’s bezel.

Use safe areas as an aid to laying out your content. Each view has its own layout guide (accessible from the `safeAreaLayoutGuide` property) that you can use to create constraints for items inside the view. If you aren’t using Auto Layout to position your views, you can obtain the raw inset values from the view’s `safeAreaInsets` property.

The following image shows two different devices with a view of the Calendar app and the safe area associated with each one.

### Extend the safe area to include custom views

Your container view controller can display its own content views over the views of an embedded child view controller. In this situation, update the child view controller’s safe area to exclude the areas covered by the container view controller’s content views. UIKit container view controllers already adjust the safe area of their child view controllers to account for content views. For example, navigation controllers extend the safe area of their child view controllers to account for the navigation bar.

To extend the safe area of an embedded child view controller, modify its `additionalSafeAreaInsets` property. Suppose you define a container view controller that displays custom views along the bottom and right edges of the screen, as shown in the following image. Because the child view controller’s content is underneath the custom views, you must extend the bottom and right insets of the child view controller’s safe area to account for those views.

The following code shows the `viewDidAppear(_:)` method of the container view controller that extends the safe area of its child view controller to account for the custom views, as shown in the image. Make your modifications in this method because the safe area insets for a view aren’t accurate until the view is added to a view hierarchy.

override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
var newSafeArea = UIEdgeInsets()
// Adjust the safe area to accommodate
// the width of the side view.
if let sideViewWidth = sideView?.bounds.size.width {
newSafeArea.right += sideViewWidth
}
// Adjust the safe area to accommodate
// the height of the bottom view.
if let bottomViewHeight = bottomView?.bounds.size.height {
newSafeArea.bottom += bottomViewHeight
}
// Adjust the safe area insets of the
// embedded child view controller.
let child = self.childViewControllers[0]
child.additionalSafeAreaInsets = newSafeArea
}

In this equation, `attribute1` and `attribute2` are the variables that Auto Layout can adjust when solving these constraints. The other values are defined when you create the constraint. For example, If you’re defining the relative position of two buttons, you might say “the leading edge of the second button should be 8 points after the trailing edge of the first button.” The linear equation for this relationship is shown below:

// positive values move to the right in left-to-right languages like English.
button2.leading = 1.0 × button1.trailing + 8.0

Auto Layout then modifies the values of the specified leading and trailing edges until both sides of the equation are equal. Note that Auto Layout does not simply assign the value of the right side of this equation to the left side. Instead, the system can modify either attribute or both attributes as needed to solve for this constraint.

The fact that constraints are equations (and not assignment operators) means that you can switch the order of the items in the equation as needed to more clearly express the desired relationship. However, if you switch the order, you must also invert the multiplier and constant. For example, the following two equations produce identical constraints:

// These equations produce identical constraints
button2.leading = 1.0 × button1.trailing + 8.0
button1.trailing = 1.0 × button2.leading - 8.0

A valid layout is defined as a set constraints with one and only one possible solution. Valid layouts are also referred to as a nonambiguous, nonconflicting layouts. Constraints with more than one solution are ambiguous. Constraints with no valid solutions are conflicting. For more information on resolving ambiguous and conflicting constraints, see Types of Errors in Auto Layout Guide.

After solving for the required constraints, Auto Layout tries to solve all the optional constraints in priority order from highest to lowest. If it cannot solve for an optional constraint, it tries to come as close as possible to the desired result, and then moves on to the next constraint.

This combination of inequalities, equalities, and priorities gives you a great amount of flexibility and power. By combining multiple constraints, you can define layouts that dynamically adapt as the size and location of the elements in your user interface change. For some example layouts, see Stack Views in Auto Layout Guide.

# UILayoutGuide

A rectangular area that can interact with Auto Layout.

@MainActor
class UILayoutGuide

## Overview

Use layout guides to replace the placeholder views you may have created to represent inter-view spaces or encapsulation in your user interface. Traditionally, there were a number of Auto Layout techniques that required placeholder views. A placeholder view is an empty view that does not have any visual elements of its own and serves only to define a rectangular region in the view hierarchy. For example, if you wanted to use constraints to define the size or location of an empty space between views, you needed to use a placeholder view to represent that space. If you wanted to center a group of objects, you needed a placeholder view to contain those objects. Similarly, placeholder views could be used to contain and encapsulate part of your user interface. Placeholder views let you break up a large, complex user interface into self-contained, modular chunks. When used properly, they could greatly simplify your Auto Layout constraint logic.

There are a number of costs associated with adding placeholder views to your view hierarchy. First, there is the cost of creating and maintaining the view itself. Second, the placeholder view is a full member of the view hierarchy, which means that it adds overhead to every task the hierarchy performs. Worst of all, the invisible placeholder view can intercept messages that are intended for other views, causing problems that are very difficult to find.

The `UILayoutGuide` class is designed to perform all the tasks previously performed by placeholder views, but to do it in a safer, more efficient manner. Layout guides do not define a new view. They do not participate in the view hierarchy. Instead, they simply define a rectangular region in their owning view’s coordinate system that can interact with Auto Layout.

### Creating Layout Guides

To create a layout guide, you must perform the following steps:

1. Instantiate a new layout guide.

2. Add the layout guide to a view by calling the view’s `addLayoutGuide(_:)` method.

3. Define the position and size of the layout guide using Auto Layout.

You can use these guides to define the space between elements in your layout. The following example shows layout guides used to define an equal spacing between a series of views.

let space1 = UILayoutGuide()
view.addLayoutGuide(space1)

let space2 = UILayoutGuide()
view.addLayoutGuide(space2)

space1.widthAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space2.widthAnchor).active = true
saveButton.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space1.leadingAnchor).active = true
cancelButton.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space1.trailingAnchor).active = true
cancelButton.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space2.leadingAnchor).active = true
clearButton.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(space2.trailingAnchor).active = true

UILayoutGuide *space1 = [[UILayoutGuide alloc] init];
[self.view addLayoutGuide:space1];

UILayoutGuide *space2 = [[UILayoutGuide alloc] init];
[self.view addLayoutGuide:space2];

[space1.widthAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space2.widthAnchor].active = YES;
[self.saveButton.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space1.leadingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.cancelButton.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space1.trailingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.cancelButton.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space2.leadingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.clearButton.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:space2.trailingAnchor].active = YES;

A layout guide can also act as an opaque box that contains other views and controls, letting you encapsulate parts of your view and break up your layout into modular chunks.

let container = UILayoutGuide()
view.addLayoutGuide(container)

// Set interior constraints
label.lastBaselineAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(textField.lastBaselineAnchor).active = true
label.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(container.leadingAnchor).active = true
textField.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(label.trailingAnchor, constant: 8.0).active = true
textField.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(container.trailingAnchor).active = true
textField.topAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(container.topAnchor).active = true
textField.bottomAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(container.bottomAnchor).active = true

// Set exterior constraints
// The contents of the container can be treated as an opaque box
let margins = view.layoutMarginsGuide

container.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(margins.leadingAnchor).active = true
container.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(margins.trailingAnchor).active = true
container.topAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(topLayoutGuide.bottomAnchor, constant: 20.0).active = true

UILayoutGuide *container = [[UILayoutGuide alloc] init];
[self.view addLayoutGuide:container];

// Layout the contents of the container
[self.label.lastBaselineAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.textField.lastBaselineAnchor].active = YES;
[self.label.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:container.leadingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.textField.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.label.trailingAnchor constant:8.0].active = YES;
[self.textField.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:container.trailingAnchor].active = YES;
[self.textField.topAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:container.topAnchor].active = YES;
[self.textField.bottomAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:container.bottomAnchor].active = YES;

// Set exterior constraints.
UILayoutGuide *margins = self.view.layoutMarginsGuide;

[container.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:margins.leadingAnchor].active = YES;
[container.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:margins.trailingAnchor].active = YES;
[container.topAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:self.topLayoutGuide.bottomAnchor constant:20.0].active = YES;

## Overview

Use these constraints to programatically define your layout using Auto Layout. Instead of creating `NSLayoutConstraint` objects directly, start with a `UIView`, `NSView`, or `UILayoutGuide` object you wish to constrain, and select one of that object’s anchor properties. These properties correspond to the main `NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute` values used in Auto Layout, and provide an appropriate `NSLayoutAnchor` subclass for creating constraints to that attribute. Use the anchor’s methods to construct your constraint.

// Creating constraints using NSLayoutConstraint
NSLayoutConstraint(item: subview,
attribute: .leading,
relatedBy: .equal,
toItem: view,
attribute: .leadingMargin,
multiplier: 1.0,
constant: 0.0).isActive = true

NSLayoutConstraint(item: subview,
attribute: .trailing,
relatedBy: .equal,
toItem: view,
attribute: .trailingMargin,
multiplier: 1.0,
constant: 0.0).isActive = true

// Creating the same constraints using Layout Anchors
let margins = view.layoutMarginsGuide

subview.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: margins.leadingAnchor).isActive = true
subview.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: margins.trailingAnchor).isActive = true

// Creating constraints using NSLayoutConstraint
[NSLayoutConstraint\
constraintWithItem:subview\
attribute:NSLayoutAttributeLeading\
relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual\
toItem:self.view\
attribute:NSLayoutAttributeLeadingMargin\
multiplier:1.0\
constant:0.0].active = YES;

[NSLayoutConstraint\
constraintWithItem:subview\
attribute:NSLayoutAttributeTrailing\
relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual\
toItem:self.view\
attribute:NSLayoutAttributeTrailingMargin\
multiplier:1.0\
constant:0.0].active = YES;

// Creating the same constraints using Layout Anchors
UILayoutGuide *margin = self.view.layoutMarginsGuide;

[subview.leadingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:margin.leadingAnchor].active = YES;
[subview.trailingAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:margin.trailingAnchor].active = YES;

As you can see from these examples, the `NSLayoutAnchor` class provides several advantages over using the `NSLayoutConstraint` API directly.

- The code is cleaner, more concise, and easier to read.

- The `NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute` subclasses provide additional type checking, preventing you from creating invalid constraints.

For more information on the anchor properties, see `bottomAnchor` in the `UIView`, `NSView`, or `UILayoutGuide`.

# Integrating pointer interactions into your iPad app

Support touch interactions in your iPad app by adding pointer interactions to your views.

Download

Xcode 12.5+

## Overview

This sample code project shows how to use the `UIPointerInteraction` class. A pointer interaction enables support for adding effects to a view, and for customizing the pointer’s appearance within a region of an app. It enhances user experience with mouse and trackpad devices and reduces the need for users to move their hands between a hardware keyboard and the touchscreen of an iPad. The sample places four shape views in a canvas within the app’s `ViewController`, each of which can be moved around. The shape views are a rectangle, oval, rounded rectangle, and triangle. Each of these takes on a different pointer effect when the user tracks the cursor over them. In addition, the sample shows a custom `UIControl` subclass, to illustrate how controls can adopt pointer interaction.

### Add a pointer interaction to a button

The sample adds a pointer interaction to a `UIButton`. Custom pointer interactions require a `UIButtonPointerStyleProvider` function. When applying a style provider function, UIKit hands a pointer effect and pointer shape within that function to an app; the app then returns a pointer style for that particular button. Developers can pick and choose between the proposed effect and shape that the system recommends, replace one or the other, or create an entirely custom style. The sample applies four different pointer effects to its buttons: automatic, highlight, lift, and hover. For the fifth button a custom pointer hover effect is applied, so its effect remains the same size while hovered, and uses a custom `UIPointerShape`.

### Provide a custom view for a pointer interaction

The sample implements shape views, which are a subclass of `UIView` called `ShapeView`. They interact with touch events with both the device’s touchscreen and touch pad. To visually interact with a shape view a `UIPointerInteraction` object is assigned to it. View controllers adopt `UIPointerInteractionDelegate` to help describe how that pointer interaction operates.

### Add a pointer interaction to a view

A pointer interaction is described by a pointer style or visual representation. The pointer style is made up of both a `UIPointerEffect` with a `UITargetedPreview`, and a `UIPointerShape`. A commonly used shape for pointer effects is a rounded rectangle. A pointer shape or `UIPointerShape` requires a `UIBezierPath`, which describes that shape. The sample associates a pointer interaction to a shape view by adding one like this:

shapeView.addInteraction(UIPointerInteraction(delegate: self))

### Create a targeted preview for a pointer interaction

For a shape view to describe its appearance during a pointer interaction, it must provide a `UITargetedPreview`. `UITargetedPreview` gives UIKit a view to which to apply an effect during pointer interactions:

let parameters = UIPreviewParameters()

// Use the entire view's shape for the preview.
let visiblePath = viewPath
parameters.visiblePath = visiblePath

return UITargetedPreview(view: self, parameters: parameters)
}

As the user moves the points within a shape view, the pointer interaction displays this targeted preview. Note that targeted previews are also used with context menus through the use of `UIContextMenuConfiguration`. In the sample, shape views have context menus.

### Create a pointer effect for a pointer interaction

A pointer interaction needs a visual effect to describe how it will render the shape view’s targeted preview. The oval shape view, for example, uses `UIPointerLiftEffect`, which slightly lifts the targeted preview and slides it around as the pointer is moved within the oval shape. The other shape views have their own pointer effects. The rectangle view uses a `UIPointerEffect`, a rounded rectangle view uses a `UIPointerHighlightEffect`, and a triangle view uses a `UIPointerHoverEffect`, which allows for its `UIPointerShape` to be revealed as a triangle.

### Create a shape for a pointer interaction

The Sample creates either region or shape, defined for each of its shape views, so a pointer interaction detects where to interact. The sample also implements `pointerInteraction(_:regionFor:defaultRegion:)` as the `UIPointerInteractionDelegate`. This delegate is called by UIKit as the pointer moves within the pointer interaction’s view. Returning a `UIPointerRegion` in which to apply a pointer style or returning `nil` indicates that this interaction does not customize the pointer for the current location.

func pointerInteraction(_ interaction: UIPointerInteraction,
regionFor request: UIPointerRegionRequest,

var pointerRegion: UIPointerRegion? = nil

if let view = interaction.view as? ShapeView {
// Pointer has entered one of the shape views.

// Check for modifiers keys pressed while inside the view path.
if request.modifiers.contains(.command) && request.modifiers.contains(.alternate) {
// Command + Option was both pressed, dim the view.
view.alpha = 0.50
} else {
if view.alpha != 1.0 { view.alpha = 1.0 }
}

// The user interacted with the inner path region.
pointerRegion =
UIPointerRegion(rect: view.innerPath.bounds,
identifier: ShapeView.regionIdentifier)
} else if let view = interaction.view as? AlphaControl {
// Pointer has entered the alpha control.
if view.bounds.contains(request.location) {
pointerRegion =
UIPointerRegion(rect: view.bounds,
identifier: AlphaControl.regionIdentifier)
}
}

return pointerRegion
}

The oval shape view, for example, interacts with the pointer from within its oval shaped `UIBezierPath`.

### Interact with views using gesture recognizers

To make the shape views more interactive and provide custom behaviors driven by a mouse or trackpad, the sample attaches four different gesture recognizers to each shape view, to work alongside their pointer interactions.

A `UIPanGestureRecognizer` moves a shape view and the frame color changes to orange when the command key is pressed during the pan gesture.

A `UIPinchGestureRecognizer` changes the shape’s size with two-finger pinch gesture.

A `UITapGestureRecognizer` brings the tapped shape view to the front.

A `UIHoverGestureRecognizer` changes the frame color of a shape view to blue when the cursor is positioned over it. If the user presses the command key while hovering, the frame color toggles to pink.

Below is an example of handling the `UIHoverGestureRecognizer` to a `ShapeView`:

func hoverShape(_ gestureRecognizer: UIHoverGestureRecognizer) {
guard let shapeViewToUse = gestureRecognizer.view as? ShapeView else { return }

switch gestureRecognizer.state {
case .began, .changed:
// User hovered within the view's path, change the view's border color.
var pathViewColor = UIColor.systemTeal
if gestureRecognizer.modifierFlags.contains(.command) {
// If the command key is pressed while hovering change frame color to pink.
pathViewColor = UIColor.systemPink
}
shapeViewToUse.viewPathColor = pathViewColor
shapeViewToUse.setNeedsDisplay()

case .ended, .cancelled:
// User left the view, restore the border color.
shapeViewToUse.restoreOuterFrameColor()

default:
break
}
}

### Create a gesture recognizer for continuous scrolling

The `UIPanGestureRecognizer` recognizes continuous scrolling that originates from devices like the trackpad. The sample adds a pan gesture recognizer to a custom `UIControl` subclass `AlphaControl`, that recognizes two-finger scroll gesture to change the alpha value of a given color. With `allowedScrollTypesMask` set to `continuous`, apps recognize continuous scrolling. The control’s color swatch changes as the user performs a pan scroll gesture, or through a direct touch.

Class

# UIBandSelectionInteraction

An object that tracks the selection of multiple items using pointer-based input.

@MainActor
class UIBandSelectionInteraction

## Overview

Attach a `UIBandSelectionInteraction` object to a custom view that contains one or more selectable items. On devices with pointer-based input, such as an iPad with a Magic Keyboard, this interaction object displays a visible selection rectangle over the view when someone clicks and drags on it. As the pointer moves, the selection rectangle expands or contracts to match. Use your interaction object’s handler to select items based on the current selection rectangle.

You create a band selection interaction object and add it to a view that contains one or more selectable items. When you create the interaction object, specify a handler to process changes to the selection rectangle. In the example, the custom view defines an `itemsInRect` method to get the items that intersect the selection rectangle. It also defines custom methods to modify the selection and commit the changes. If someone presses the Shift key at the start of the interaction, the code extends the current selection instead of replacing it.

// Create a UIBandSelectionInteraction object.
let bandSelectionInteraction = UIBandSelectionInteraction { [weak self] interaction in
guard let strongSelf = self else { return }

switch interaction.state {
case .began:
// Prepare the view to handle selection changes.
strongSelf.selectionSession.begin()
case .selecting:
// Get the custom view items that intersect the selection rectangle.
let newItems = strongSelf.itemsInRect(interaction.selectionRect)

if interaction.initialModifierFlags == .shift {
// If Shift is held, extend the view's current selection...
strongSelf.selectionSession.append(newItems)
} else {
// ...otherwise, replace the view's selection with the new items.
strongSelf.selectionSession.setSelection(newItems)
}
case .ended:
// When the interaction ends, commit the selection changes.
strongSelf.selectionSession.commit()
}
}

// Add the interaction object to the view.
view.addInteraction(bandSelectionInteraction)

# Handling touches in your view

Use touch events directly on a view subclass if touch handling is intricately linked to the view’s content.

## Overview

If you don’t plan to use gesture recognizers with a custom view, you can handle touch events directly from the view itself. Because views are responders, they can handle Multi-Touch events and many other types of events. When UIKit determines that a touch event occurred in a view, it calls the view’s `touchesBegan(_:with:)`, `touchesMoved(_:with:)`, or `touchesEnded(_:with:)` method. You can override these methods in your custom views and use them to provide a response to touch events.

The methods you override in your views (or in any responder) to handle touches correspond to different phases of the touch event-handling process. For example, the following image illustrates the different phases of a touch event. When a finger (or Apple Pencil) touches the screen, UIKit creates a `UITouch` object, sets the touch location to the appropriate point, and sets its `phase` property to `UITouch.Phase.began`. When the same finger moves around the screen, UIKit updates the touch location and changes the `phase` property of the touch object to `UITouch.Phase.moved`. When the user lifts the finger from the screen, UIKit changes the `phase` property to `UITouch.Phase.ended` and the touch sequence ends.

Similarly, the system may cancel an ongoing touch sequence at any time; for example, when an incoming phone call interrupts the app. When it does, UIKit notifies your view by calling the `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` method. You use that method to perform any needed cleanup of your view’s data structures.

UIKit creates a new `UITouch` object for each new finger that touches the screen. The touches themselves are delivered with the current `UIEvent` object. UIKit distinguishes between touches originating from a finger and from Apple Pencil, and you can treat each of them differently.

# Using responders and the responder chain to handle events

Learn how to handle events that propagate through your app.

## Overview

Apps receive and handle events using _responder objects_. A responder object is any instance of the `UIResponder` class, and common subclasses include `UIView`, `UIViewController`, and `UIApplication`. Responders receive the raw event data and must either handle the event or forward it to another responder object. When your app receives an event, UIKit automatically directs that event to the most appropriate responder object, known as the _first responder_.

Unhandled events are passed from responder to responder in the active _responder chain_, which is the dynamic configuration of your app’s responder objects. The following image shows the responders in an app whose interface contains a label, a text field, a button, and two background views. The diagram also shows how events move from one responder to the next, following the responder chain.

If the text field doesn’t handle an event, UIKit sends the event to the text field’s parent `UIView` object, followed by the root view of the window. From the root view, the responder chain diverts to the owning view controller before directing the event to the window. If the window can’t handle the event, UIKit delivers the event to the `UIApplication` object, and possibly to the app delegate if that object is an instance of `UIResponder` and not already part of the responder chain.

### Determine an event’s first responder

UIKit designates an object as the first responder to an event based on the type of that event. Event types include:

| Event type | First responder |
| --- | --- |
| Touch events | The view in which the touch occurred. |
| Press events | The object that has focus. |
| Shake-motion events | The object that you (or UIKit) designate. |
| Remote-control events | The object that you (or UIKit) designate. |
| Editing menu messages | The object that you (or UIKit) designate. |

Controls communicate directly with their associated target object using action messages. When the user interacts with a control, the control sends an action message to its target object. Action messages aren’t events, but they may still take advantage of the responder chain. When the target object of a control is `nil`, UIKit starts from the target object and traverses the responder chain until it finds an object that implements the appropriate action method. For example, the UIKit editing menu uses this behavior to search for responder objects that implement methods with names like `cut(_:)`, `copy(_:)`, or `paste(_:)`.

Gesture recognizers receive touch and press events before their view does. If a view’s gesture recognizers fail to recognize a sequence of touches, UIKit sends the touches to the view. If the view doesn’t handle the touches, UIKit passes them up the responder chain. For more information about using gesture recognizer’s to handle events, see Handling UIKit gestures.

### Determine which responder contained a touch event

UIKit uses view-based hit-testing to determine where touch events occur. Specifically, UIKit compares the touch location to the bounds of view objects in the view hierarchy. The `hitTest(_:with:)` method of `UIView` traverses the view hierarchy, looking for the deepest subview that contains the specified touch, which becomes the first responder for the touch event.

When a touch occurs, UIKit creates a `UITouch` object and associates it with a view. As the touch location or other parameters change, UIKit updates the same `UITouch` object with the new information. The only property that doesn’t change is the view. (Even when the touch location moves outside the original view, the value in the touch’s `view` property doesn’t change). When the touch ends, UIKit releases the `UITouch` object.

### Alter the responder chain

You can alter the responder chain by overriding the `next` property of your responder objects. When you do this, the next responder is the object that you return.

Many UIKit classes already override this property and return specific objects, including:

- `UIView` objects. If the view is the root view of a view controller, the next responder is the view controller; otherwise, the next responder is the view’s superview.

- `UIViewController` objects.

- If the view controller’s view is the root view of a window, the next responder is the window object.

- If the view controller was presented by another view controller, the next responder is the presenting view controller.

- `UIWindow` objects. The window’s next responder is the `UIApplication` object.

- `UIApplication` object. The next responder is the app delegate, but only if the app delegate is an instance of `UIResponder` and isn’t a view, view controller, or the app object itself.

Using responders and the responder chain to handle events

Handling key presses made on a physical keyboard

## Overview

Responder objects — instances of `UIResponder` — constitute the event-handling backbone of a UIKit app. Many key objects are also responders, including the `UIApplication` object, `UIViewController` objects, and all `UIView` objects (which includes `UIWindow`). As events occur, UIKit dispatches them to your app’s responder objects for handling.

There are several kinds of events, including touch events, motion events, remote-control events, and press events. To handle a specific type of event, a responder must override the corresponding methods. For example, to handle touch events, a responder implements the `touchesBegan(_:with:)`, `touchesMoved(_:with:)`, `touchesEnded(_:with:)`, and `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` methods. In the case of touches, the responder uses the event information provided by UIKit to track changes to those touches and to update the app’s interface appropriately.

In addition to handling events, UIKit responders also manage the forwarding of unhandled events to other parts of your app. If a given responder doesn’t handle an event, it forwards that event to the next event in the responder chain. UIKit manages the responder chain dynamically, using predefined rules to determine which object should be next to receive an event. For example, a view forwards events to its superview, and the root view of a hierarchy forwards events to its view controller.

Responders process `UIEvent` objects but can also accept custom input through an input view. The system’s keyboard is the most obvious example of an input view. When the user taps a `UITextField` and `UITextView` object onscreen, the view becomes the first responder and displays its input view, which is the system keyboard. Similarly, you can create custom input views and display them when other responders become active. To associate a custom input view with a responder, assign that view to the `inputView` property of the responder.

Responding to control-based events using target-action

## Overview

Apps can receive many different types of events, including touch events, motion events, remote-control events, and press events. Touch events are the most common and are delivered to the view in which the touch originally occurred. Motion events are UIKit triggered and are separate from the motion events reported by the Core Motion framework. Remote-control events allow a responder object to receive commands from an external accessory or headset so that it can manage audio and video — for example, playing a video or skipping to the next audio track. Press events represent interactions with a game controller, Apple TV remote, or other device that has physical buttons. You can determine the type of an event using the `type` and `subtype` properties.

A touch event object contains the touches (that is, the fingers on the screen) that have some relation to the event. A touch event object may contain one or more touches, and each touch is represented by a `UITouch` object. When a touch event occurs, the system routes it to the appropriate responder and calls the appropriate method, such as `touchesBegan(_:with:)`. The responder then uses the touches to determine an appropriate course of action.

During a multitouch sequence, UIKit reuses the same `UIEvent` object when delivering updated touch data to your app. You should never retain an event object or any object returned from an event object. If you need to retain data outside of the responder method you use to process that data, copy that data from the `UITouch` or `UIEvent` object to your local data structures.

For more information on how to handle events in your UIKit app, see Event Handling Guide for UIKit Apps.

# Handling input from Apple Pencil

Learn how to detect and respond to touches from Apple Pencil.

## Overview

UIKit reports touches from Apple Pencil in the same way it reports touches from a person’s fingers. Specifically, UIKit delivers a `UITouch` object containing the location of the touch in your app. However, a touch object originating from Apple Pencil contains additional information, including the azimuth and altitude of Apple Pencil and the amount of force recorded at its tip.

Because Apple Pencil is a separate device, there’s a delay between the time Apple Pencil gathers altitude, azimuth, and force values and the time that those values are reported to your app. As a result, UIKit may provide _estimated_ values for those properties initially, and then provide the real values at a later time. If you use altitude, azimuth, or force information from Apple Pencil, you must explicitly handle estimated properties.

### Handle estimated properties

When UIKit has only an estimate of a property’s value, it includes a flag in the `estimatedPropertiesExpectingUpdates` property of the corresponding `UITouch` object. When handling a touch event, check that property to determine if you need to update the touch information later.

When a touch object contains estimated properties, UIKit also provides a value in the `estimationUpdateIndex` property that you can use to identify the touch later. Use the value in the `estimationUpdateIndex` property as a key to a dictionary that you maintain. Set the value of that key to the app-specific object that you use to store the touch information. When UIKit later reports the real values, use the index to look up your app-specific object and replace the estimated values with the real values.

The following code shows the `addSamples` method of an app that captures touch data. For each touch, the method creates a custom `StrokeSample` object with the touch information. If the force value of the touch is only an estimate, the `registerForEstimates` method caches the sample in a dictionary using the value in the `estimationUpdateIndex` property as the key.

var estimates : [NSNumber : StrokeSample]

func addSamples(for touches: [UITouch]) {
if let stroke = strokeCollection?.activeStroke {
for touch in touches {
if touch == touches.last {
let sample = StrokeSample(point: touch.location(in: self),
forceValue: touch.force)
stroke.add(sample: sample)
registerForEstimates(touch: touch, sample: sample)
} else {
let sample = StrokeSample(point: touch.location(in: self),
forceValue: touch.force, coalesced: true)
stroke.add(sample: sample)
registerForEstimates(touch: touch, sample: sample)
}
}
self.setNeedsDisplay()
}
}

func registerForEstimates(touch : UITouch, sample : StrokeSample) {
if touch.estimatedPropertiesExpectingUpdates.contains(.force) {
estimates[touch.estimationUpdateIndex!] = sample
}
}

When UIKit receives the actual values for a touch, it calls the `touchesEstimatedPropertiesUpdated(_:)` method of your responder or gesture recognizer. Use that method to replace estimated data with the real values provided by UIKit.

The following code shows an example of the `touchesEstimatedPropertiesUpdated(_:)` method, which updates the force value for the cached `StrokeSample` objects created in the previous code example. The method uses the value in the `estimationUpdateIndex` property to retrieve the `StrokeSample` object from the `estimates` dictionary. It then updates the force value and removes the sample from the dictionary.

for touch in touches {
// If the force value is no longer an estimate, update it.
if !touch.estimatedPropertiesExpectingUpdates.contains(.force) {
let index = touch.estimationUpdateIndex!
var sample = estimates[index]
sample?.force = touch.force

// Remove the key and value from the dictionary.
estimates.removeValue(forKey: index)
}
}
}

# Tracking the force of 3D Touch events

Manipulate your content based on the force of touches.

## Overview

A touch on the screen primarily conveys the location of that touch. However, devices that support 3D Touch also report the amount of force imparted by the user’s finger onto the screen. (Similarly, Apple Pencil reports the amount of force at its tip to the connected device.) You can use both the touch location and the force value as input to your app. For example, a drawing app might use force to set the thickness of the current line.

The raw force value associated with a touch is available in the `force` property of the `UITouch` object. You can compare that value against the value in the `maximumPossibleForce` property to determine the relative amount of force.

## Overview

Touch Canvas illustrates responsive handling of Apple Pencil and touch input, focusing on the force, altitude, and azimuth properties of `UITouch`. The sample creates a visualization of force using line thickness, and creates a visualization of altitude and azimuth with an interactive diagram. To build on the concepts demonstrated in this sample and learn about using Apple Pencil and touch input in a drawing app, see Leveraging touch input for drawing apps.

### Calculate the force of a touch

You can use the force of a touch applied by a finger on 3D Touch-enabled devices or from the tip of Apple Pencil to create effects in your app. For example, the force of a touch can change the width of a line on a canvas.

The current force is reported by the `force` property of `UITouch`.

force = touch.force

The force value input affects the result of handling a `UITouch`. In this sample, force is interpreted as a value representing the magnitude of a point in a line, including a lower bound on the force value usable by the app.

var magnitude: CGFloat {
return max(force, 0.025)
}

This sample uses the magnitude value to affect drawing on the canvas, including the line width value.

context.setLineWidth(point.magnitude)

### Create a visualization of Apple Pencil’s altitude and azimuth

Touch Canvas contains a visualization of the altitude and azimuth for Apple Pencil as you draw on the screen when the _Debug_ mode is enabled. This visualization is a diagram which continuously updates based on Apple Pencil’s motion.

Apple Pencil reports its altitude as an angle relative to the device surface through the `altitudeAngle` property on `UITouch`.

let altitudeAngle = touch.altitudeAngle

In this sample project, the line length extends to the edge of the diagram when Apple Pencil is fully horizontal. If Apple Pencil is perfectly vertical, the line length reduces to a dot under Apple Pencil’s tip. The line length calculation transforms the altitude angle relative to the radius of the diagram.

/*
Make the length of the indicator's line representative of the `altitudeAngle`. When the angle is
zero radians (parallel to the screen surface) the line will be at its longest. At `.pi` / 2 radians,
only the dot on top of the indicator will be visible directly beneath the touch location.
*/
let altitudeRadius = (1.0 - altitudeAngle / ( CGFloat.pi / 2)) * radius
var lineTransform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: altitudeRadius, y: 1)

Apple Pencil reports its direction, or azimuth, relative to the view Apple Pencil interacts with. A drawing app might use azimuth information to change the shape or strength of a particular drawing tool. Access the azimuth information with the `azimuthAngle(in:)` and `azimuthUnitVector(in:)` methods of `UITouch`.

let azimuthAngle = touch.azimuthAngle(in: canvasView)
let azimuthUnitVector = touch.azimuthUnitVector(in: canvasView)

The interactive diagram demonstrates how altitude, azimuth angle, and azimuth unit vector values can be used together. Here, the azimuth angle rotates around the diagram opposite the actual azimuth value, and the dot at the end of the altitude line moves by combining the altitude and azimuth unit vector properties. A transform efficiently applies the calculated rotation of the line and position of the dot to the diagram so that it remains responsive to small changes in Apple Pencil’s position.

// Draw the azimuth indicator line as opposite the azimuth by rotating `.pi` radians, for easy visualization.
var rotationTransform = CGAffineTransform(rotationAngle: azimuthAngle)
rotationTransform = rotationTransform.rotated(by: CGFloat.pi)

var dotPositionTransform = CGAffineTransform(translationX: -azimuthUnitVector.dx * altitudeRadius, y: -azimuthUnitVector.dy * altitudeRadius)
dotPositionTransform = dotPositionTransform.concatenating(centeringTransform)

### Toggle debug drawing

Touch Canvas contains a debug drawing mode that allows you to view the operation of the properties in detail for different types of input, such as the difference between strokes drawn at different speeds with Apple Pencil. The debug mode enables the interactive diagram for altitude and azimuth, and changes the color of individual line segments to identify if the `UIEvent` for the line segment included data from `predictedTouches(for:)` or `coalescedTouches(for:)`.

The sample uses the double-tap feature of the second generation Apple Pencil to toggle _Debug_ mode when the user configures the preferred double tap action to switch tools. The sample app ignores the other preferred actions. See Apple Pencil interactions for more information.

func pencilInteractionDidTap(_ interaction: UIPencilInteraction) {
guard UIPencilInteraction.preferredTapAction == .switchPrevious else { return }

/* The tap interaction is a quick way for the user to switch tools within an app.
Toggling the debug drawing mode from Apple Pencil is a discoverable action, as the button
for debug mode is on screen and visually changes to indicate what the tap interaction did.
*/
toggleDebugDrawing(sender: debugButton)
}

## Overview

This sample project, Speed Sketch, shows how to render a series of strokes a user makes by moving their finger or Apple Pencil across the screen. The project also demonstrates how to:

- Distinguish between finger and Apple Pencil touches.

- Improve drawing performance.

- Enhance the app for Apple Pencil.

### Distinguish between finger and Apple Pencil touches

With Speed Sketch, users can draw by moving their finger or Apple Pencil across the screen, and the system reports the touches to the app. Speed Sketch captures these touches using the custom gesture recognizer, `StrokeGestureRecognizer`.

The stroke gesture recognizer receives each touch event, and appends data from the touches to an array of data samples.

withTimeInterval: cancellationTimeInterval,
repeats: false,
block: { [weak self] (timer) in
guard let strongSelf = self else { return }
if strongSelf.state == .possible {
strongSelf.state = .began
}
}
)
}
}
if append(touches: touches, event: event) {
if isForPencil {
state = .began
}
}
}

if append(touches: touches, event: event) {
if state == .began {
state = .changed
}
}
}

if append(touches: touches, event: event) {
stroke.state = .done
state = .ended
}
}

if append(touches: touches, event: event) {
stroke.state = .cancelled
state = .failed
}
}

The `touchesBegan(_:with:)` method sets a timer to give other gesture recognizers, such as pan and pinch, time to handle touches that the user makes with their finger. This behavior is unique to drawing apps such as Speed Sketch that start capturing and drawing a stroke the moment the user touches the screen.

In order to track finger and Apple Pencil touches separately, Speed Sketch uses two instances of `StrokeGestureRecognizer`: one for finger touches and the other to track touches coming from Apple Pencil.

self.fingerStrokeRecognizer = setupStrokeGestureRecognizer(isForPencil: false)
self.pencilStrokeRecognizer = setupStrokeGestureRecognizer(isForPencil: true)

To simplify the code, the app uses a helper method to create the gesture recognizers.

let recognizer = StrokeGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(strokeUpdated(_:)))
recognizer.delegate = self
recognizer.cancelsTouchesInView = false
scrollView.addGestureRecognizer(recognizer)
recognizer.coordinateSpaceView = cgView
recognizer.isForPencil = isForPencil
return recognizer
}

The gesture recognizer distinguishes between the touch types by setting the `allowedTouchTypes` property to `UITouch.TouchType.pencil` when tracking Apple Pencil touches, and to `UITouch.TouchType.direct` when tracking touches from a finger.

var isForPencil: Bool = false {
didSet {
if isForPencil {
allowedTouchTypes = [UITouch.TouchType.pencil.rawValue as NSNumber]
} else {
allowedTouchTypes = [UITouch.TouchType.direct.rawValue as NSNumber]
}
}
}

Each time the user draws a stroke on the screen, the stroke gesture recognizer calls the `strokeUpdate(_:)` method. This method checks to see if the recognizer is for Apple Pencil, and if so, puts the app into pencil mode. While the app is in pencil mode, the user can use one finger to pan the drawing canvas. When the app isn’t in pencil mode—that is, when the user is drawing with their finger—the user uses two fingers to pan the drawing canvas.

var pencilMode = false {
didSet {
if pencilMode {
scrollView.panGestureRecognizer.minimumNumberOfTouches = 1
pencilButton.isHidden = false
if let view = fingerStrokeRecognizer.view {
view.removeGestureRecognizer(fingerStrokeRecognizer)
}
} else {
scrollView.panGestureRecognizer.minimumNumberOfTouches = 2
pencilButton.isHidden = true
if fingerStrokeRecognizer.view == nil {
scrollView.addGestureRecognizer(fingerStrokeRecognizer)
}
}
}
}

### Improve drawing performance

The stroke gesture recognizer receives touch events from the system. For most apps, the time span between each touch event is enough to handle the gesture. However, users of drawing apps expect greater precision, which requires the app to gather all the touches reported since the last delivered touch event.

To gather the additional touches, Speed Sketch calls the `coalescedTouches(for:)` method. This method returns an array of `UITouch` objects representing the touches received by the system but not delivered in the last event. The additional touches allow Speed Sketch to provide a smoother rendering of the stroke by storing the coalesced touches as part of the stroke’s data sample.

if collectsCoalescedTouches {
if let event = event {
let coalescedTouches = event.coalescedTouches(for: touchToAppend)!
let lastIndex = coalescedTouches.count - 1
for index in 0..<lastIndex {
saveStrokeSample(stroke: stroke, touch: coalescedTouches[index], view: view, coalesced: true, predicted: false)
}
saveStrokeSample(stroke: stroke, touch: coalescedTouches[lastIndex], view: view, coalesced: false, predicted: false)
}
} else {
saveStrokeSample(stroke: stroke, touch: touchToAppend, view: view, coalesced: false, predicted: false)
}

In addition to coalesced touches, Speed Sketch uses touch data predicted by the system as a way to enhance the perceived accuracy of the app’s drawing capabilities. Speed Sketch retrieves the predicted touches by calling the `predictedTouches(for:)` method for the event, then saves the touches as part of the data sample for the stroke.

if usesPredictedSamples && stroke.state == .active {
if let predictedTouches = event?.predictedTouches(for: touchToAppend) {
for touch in predictedTouches {
saveStrokeSample(stroke: stroke, touch: touch, view: view, coalesced: false, predicted: true)
}
}
}

The app replaces the predicted touches with actual touches as they become available.

for touch in touches {
guard let index = touch.estimationUpdateIndex else {
continue
}
if let (stroke, sampleIndex) = outstandingUpdateIndexes[Int(index.intValue)] {
var sample = stroke.samples[sampleIndex]
let expectedUpdates = sample.estimatedPropertiesExpectingUpdates
if expectedUpdates.contains(.force) {
sample.force = touch.force
if !touch.estimatedProperties.contains(.force) {
// Only remove the estimate flag if the new value isn't estimated as well.
sample.estimatedProperties.remove(.force)
}
}
sample.estimatedPropertiesExpectingUpdates = touch.estimatedPropertiesExpectingUpdates
if touch.estimatedPropertiesExpectingUpdates == [] {
outstandingUpdateIndexes.removeValue(forKey: sampleIndex)
}
stroke.update(sample: sample, at: sampleIndex)
}
}
}

### Enhance for Apple Pencil

Apple Pencil can sense tilt (altitude), force (pressure), and orientation (azimuth), which drawing apps can use to affect the appearance of strokes. For instance, Speed Sketch uses azimuth to enhance the strokes when using the app’s Calligraphy drawing tool.

func drawCalligraphy(in context: CGContext,
toSample: StrokeSample,
fromSample: StrokeSample,

var fromAzimuthUnitVector = Stroke.calligraphyFallbackAzimuthUnitVector
var toAzimuthUnitVector = Stroke.calligraphyFallbackAzimuthUnitVector

if fromSample.azimuth != nil {

if lockedAzimuthUnitVector == nil {
lockedAzimuthUnitVector = fromSample.azimuthUnitVector
}
fromAzimuthUnitVector = fromSample.azimuthUnitVector
toAzimuthUnitVector = toSample.azimuthUnitVector

fromAzimuthUnitVector = lockedAzimuthUnitVector!
}

toAzimuthUnitVector = lockedAzimuthUnitVector!
} else {
lockedAzimuthUnitVector = toAzimuthUnitVector
}

}
// Rotate 90 degrees
let calligraphyTransform = CGAffineTransform(rotationAngle: CGFloat.pi / 2.0)
fromAzimuthUnitVector = fromAzimuthUnitVector.applying(calligraphyTransform)
toAzimuthUnitVector = toAzimuthUnitVector.applying(calligraphyTransform)

let fromUnitVector = fromAzimuthUnitVector * forceAccessBlock(fromSample)
let toUnitVector = toAzimuthUnitVector * forceAccessBlock(toSample)

context.beginPath()
context.addLines(between: [\
fromSample.location + fromUnitVector,\
toSample.location + toUnitVector,\
toSample.location - toUnitVector,\
fromSample.location - fromUnitVector\
])
context.closePath()

context.drawPath(using: .fillStroke)

}

Speed Sketch also displays the altitude and azimuth data as part of the stroke when the user selects the Debug drawing tool.

func drawDebugMarkings(in context: CGContext, fromSample: StrokeSample) {

let isEstimated = fromSample.estimatedProperties.contains(.azimuth)
guard displayOptions == .debug,
fromSample.predicted == false,
fromSample.azimuth != nil,
(!fromSample.coalesced || isEstimated) else {
return
}

let length = CGFloat(20.0)
let azimuthUnitVector = fromSample.azimuthUnitVector
let azimuthTarget = fromSample.location + azimuthUnitVector * length
let altitudeStart = azimuthTarget + (azimuthUnitVector * (length / -2.0))
let transformToApply = CGAffineTransform(rotationAngle: fromSample.altitude!)
let altitudeTarget = altitudeStart + (azimuthUnitVector * (length / 2.0)).applying(transformToApply)

// Draw altitude as black line coming from the center of the azimuth.
altitudeSettings(in: context)
context.beginPath()
context.move(to: altitudeStart)
context.addLine(to: altitudeTarget)
context.strokePath()

// Draw azimuth as blue (or orange if estimated) line.
azimuthSettings(in: context)
if isEstimated {
context.setStrokeColor(UIColor.orange.cgColor)
}
context.beginPath()
context.move(to: fromSample.location)
context.addLine(to: azimuthTarget)
context.strokePath()

Starting with the second generation Apple Pencil, users can double-tap their finger on Apple Pencil to request an action from the app (see Apple Pencil interactions for more information). When possible, apps should honor the system settings for double-tap actions on Apple Pencil, which include:

- Switching to the eraser or the last used tool

- Displaying a color pallet

- Ignoring double tap

Speed Sketch doesn’t have an eraser tool or color pallet, but it does have different drawing tools: Calligraphy, Ink, and Debug. When the user’s preferred double-tap action is `UIPencilPreferredAction.switchPrevious` and the user double-taps their finger on Apple Pencil, Speed Sketch switches to the tool last used by the user. The sample app ignores the other preferred actions.

func pencilInteractionDidTap(_ interaction: UIPencilInteraction) {
if UIPencilInteraction.preferredTapAction == .switchPrevious {
leftRingControl.switchToPreviousTool()
}
}

In order for Speed Sketch to receive the double-tap event, it adds a `UIPencilInteraction` object to the canvas view.

let pencilInteraction = UIPencilInteraction()
pencilInteraction.delegate = self
view.addInteraction(pencilInteraction)

## Overview

You access touch objects through `UIEvent` objects passed into responder objects for event handling. A touch object includes accessors for:

- The view or window in which the touch occurred

- The location of the touch within the view or window

- The approximate radius of the touch

- The force of the touch (on devices that support 3D Touch or Apple Pencil)

A touch object also contains a timestamp indicating when the touch occurred, an integer representing the number of times the user tapped the screen, and the phase of the touch in the form of a constant that describes whether the touch began, moved, or ended, or whether the system canceled the touch.

To learn how to work with swipes, read Handling Swipe and Drag Gestures in Event Handling Guide for UIKit Apps.

A touch object persists throughout a multi-touch sequence. You may store a reference to a touch while handling a multi-touch sequence, as long as you release that reference when the sequence ends. If you need to store information about a touch outside of a multi-touch sequence, copy that information from the touch.

The `gestureRecognizers` property of a touch contains the gesture recognizers currently handling the touch. Each gesture recognizer is an instance of a concrete subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer`.

# Coordinating multiple gesture recognizers

Discover how to use multiple gesture recognizers on the same view.

## Overview

Gesture recognizers track incoming touch events separately, but UIKit normally allows the recognition of only one gesture at a time on a single view. Recognizing only one gesture at a time is usually preferable because it prevents user input from triggering more than one action at a time. However, this default behavior can introduce unintended side effects. For example, in a view that contains both pan and swipe gesture recognizers, swipes are never recognized. Because the pan gesture recognizer is continuous, it always recognizes its gesture before the swipe gesture recognizer, which is discrete.

To prevent the unintended side effects of the default recognition behavior, you can tell UIKit to recognize gestures in a specific order using a delegate object. UIKit uses the methods of your delegate object to determine whether a gesture recognizer must come before or after other gesture recognizers. For example, your delegate can tell UIKit that a swipe gesture recognizer must fail before a pan gesture recognizer is allowed to act. Your delegate can also tell UIKit that two gestures can be recognized simultaneously.

# Adopting hover support for Apple Pencil

Enhance user feedback for your iPadOS app with a hover preview for Apple Pencil input.

Download

Xcode 14.1+

## Overview

This sample shows how to add support for hover gestures with Apple Pencil. The app is a simple drawing tool that allows a person to draw strokes on a blank canvas. When a person hovers the Apple Pencil slightly above the drawing canvas, the app uses hover gestures to render a visual preview of where the Apple Pencil touches down to draw a stroke on the canvas.

### Configure the sample code project

Although the sample app’s basic functionality is available in Simulator, running the project with physical devices is recommended to demonstrate the full capabilities of the hardware. Run this project with the following devices:

- iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation) or iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) running iPadOS 16.1 or later

- Apple Pencil (2nd generation)

To run the sample code project:

- Connect Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro, as described in Connect Apple Pencil with your iPad.

- Connect the iPad Pro to your Mac with a hardware cable.

- Open the sample code project in Xcode.

- In the Scheme menu, choose the connected iPad Pro.

- Run the app, and use Apple Pencil to interact with the app.

### Create a gesture recognizer for drawing

The sample project uses a _long-press gesture recognizer_, which reacts when a person presses and holds a touch for a minimum period of time, to draw strokes with Apple Pencil.

The app implements the `DrawGestureRecognizer` subclass, which extends the capabilities of its superclass `UILongPressGestureRecognizer` to track the `currentTouch` and `currentEvent`. These additional properties provide the information necessary to implement high-fidelity drawing.

class DrawGestureRecognizer: UILongPressGestureRecognizer {

weak var currentTouch: UITouch?
weak var currentEvent: UIEvent?

super.touchesBegan(touches, with: event)
currentTouch = touches.first
currentEvent = event
}

override func reset() {
super.reset()
currentTouch = nil
currentEvent = nil
}
}

The drawing implementation is in the `drawGesture(_:)` method. During the `UIGestureRecognizer.State.changed` state of the draw gesture, this method attempts to retrieve additional touches associated with the main touch `currentTouch` through `coalescedTouches(for:)`. This extra touch data creates a smoother drawing experience with lower latency and higher precision.

case .changed:
if let drawGR = drawGestureRecognizer,
let currentTouch = drawGR.currentTouch,
let currentEvent = drawGR.currentEvent,
let touches = currentEvent.coalescedTouches(for: currentTouch) {
for touch in touches {
let point = touch.preciseLocation(in: self)
updatePath(point: point)
}
} else {
updatePath(point: point)
}

To render the strokes on the canvas, the sample calls `updatePath(point: CGPoint)`, which updates the Bezier path associated with the current stroke and renders the visual output to a `CAShapeLayer`.

### Create a gesture recognizer for hover preview

The sample project uses a hover gesture recognizer to generate a visual preview of the stroke before Apple Pencil touches down on the iPad screen. A _hover gesture recognizer_ reacts when a pointer from a pointing device such as Apple Pencil moves over a user-interface element. When a person hovers the Apple Pencil a short distance above the iPad screen, the app generates a preview.

The sample project creates an instance of `UIHoverGestureRecognizer` to handle the hover gesture.

let hoverGesture = UIHoverGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(hoverGesture(_:)))

The hover preview implementation is in the `hoverGesture(_:)` method. This method waits for the draw gesture to end before starting hover preview rendering. This delay ensures that drawing and previewing don’t occur at the same time to create overlapping visual effects in the UI.

guard !isDrawing else { return }

### Update the hover preview

The sample changes the opacity, or _alpha_, of the hover preview effect according to the distance the Apple Pencil hovers above the iPad screen. When Apple Pencil is farther from the screen, the preview alpha is lower, which makes the visual effect more subtle. When Apple Pencil is closer to the screen, the preview alpha is higher, which makes the visual effect more prominent.

The sample calculates the preview alpha value in the `hoverGesture(_:)` method using the following values:

- `zOffset`—A property of `UIHoverGestureRecognizer` that reports the current, normalized distance between the Apple Pencil and the iPad screen.

- `maxPreviewZOffset`—A constant that represents the maximum distance between the Apple Pencil and the iPad screen. The sample uses the maximum distance `1.0` because `zOffset` is normalized.

- `fadeZOffset`—A constant that represents the threshold distance at which the preview alpha switches between fully opaque and partially opaque, causing the visual preview effect to begin fading out.

previewAlpha = 1.0 - max(zOffset - fadeZOffset, 0.0) / (maxPreviewZOffset - fadeZOffset)

This line of code calculates the preview alpha. When Apple Pencil is closer to the screen than `fadeZOffset`, the preview alpha is `1.0`, which makes the visual effect fully opaque. As Apple Pencil moves farther away than `fadeZOffset`, the alpha begins to decrease and eventually reaches `0.0`, which causes the visual preview to fade and disappear.

### Configure different behaviors for input types

By default, hover gestures work with pointing devices such as trackpads as well as Apple Pencil. For example, running the sample code project on an iPad with a connected trackpad renders a hover preview when the pointer passes over the drawing canvas. However, this sample provides a different hover experience for Apple Pencil than for a trackpad, so the default behavior might be unsuitable for trackpad input.

To restrict the hover preview to Apple Pencil input only and disable it for trackpad, uncomment the following line of code and run the app again:

// hoverGesture.allowedTouchTypes = [ UITouch.TouchType.pencil.rawValue as NSNumber ]

# Supporting gesture interaction in your apps

Enrich your app’s user experience by supporting standard and custom gesture interaction.

Download

Xcode 12.0+

## Overview

Gesture interaction is one of the most intuitive user experiences on iOS, and gesture recognizers provide an easy way for apps to implement it. iOS defines some standard gestures, and apps can use system-provided recognizers to support these standard gestures, or create custom ones for non-standard gestures. This sample demonstrates how to use standard gesture recognizers by adding pan, pinch, and rotation support for three colored views, which this sample calls _pieces_, and how to implement a custom recognizer to reset the pieces to their initial state.

### Set up a gesture recognizer

To support gesture interaction on a view, create an appropriate gesture recognizer and associate it with the view by calling the `addGestureRecognizer(_:)` method, as shown below.

let resetGestureRecognizer = ResetGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(resetPieces(_:)))
view.addGestureRecognizer(resetGestureRecognizer)

Xcode includes UIKit’s standard gesture recognizers in its Objects library so developers can use them in storyboards. To associate a recognizer with a view in a storyboard:

1. Select the storyboard in Xcode to open the storyboard view.

2. Find the gesture recognizer in Xcode’s Objects library.

3. Control-drag the recognizer onto the view.

With these steps, Xcode automatically adds the recognizer into the storyboard and associates it with the view. Developers can then add an action for the recognizer the same way they do for other UI elements.

### Handle pan, pinch, and rotation gestures

This sample uses pan, pinch, and rotation gestures to move, scale, and rotate the views. When users pan a view, UIKit triggers the associated action method, which is `panPiece(_:)` in this sample, passing in a `UIPanGestureRecognizer` instance that carries a translation. The method then calculates and moves the view to the new position, and clears the translation by setting it to `.zero` so next time, its value is still the delta relative to the current position.

let translation = panGestureRecognizer.translation(in: piece.superview)
piece.center = CGPoint(x: piece.center.x + translation.x, y: piece.center.y + translation.y)
panGestureRecognizer.setTranslation(.zero, in: piece.superview)

Similarly, when users pinch and rotate a view, this sample uses the `scale` and `rotation` properties of `UIPinchGestureRecognizer` and `UIRotationGestureRecognizer` to calculate and apply a new `transform`, and then clears the properties.

let scale = pinchGestureRecognizer.scale
piece.transform = piece.transform.scaledBy(x: scale, y: scale)
pinchGestureRecognizer.scale = 1 // Clear scale so that it is the right delta next time.

piece.transform = piece.transform.rotated(by: rotationGestureRecognizer.rotation)
rotationGestureRecognizer.rotation = 0 // Clear rotation so that it is the right delta next time.

The `scale` and `rotation` properties are relative to the `anchorPoint` property of the view’s `layer`. To be more intuitive when scaling or rotating a view, this sample moves the anchor point to the location of the gestures, which is usually the centroid of the touches involved in the gestures.

let locationInPiece = gestureRecognizer.location(in: piece)

### Allow recognizing multiple gestures simultaneously

Users sometimes intuitively expect multiple gestures to work simultaneously, like pinching and rotating a view at the same time. This sample allows that by implementing the following `UIGestureRecognizerDelegate` method, which returns `true` to allow all gesture recognizers in this sample to work together.

func gestureRecognizer(_ gestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer,

return true
}

For the delegate method to take effect, this sample sets the gesture recognizer’s `delegate` property to `self`, which is the view controller that implements the method.

resetGestureRecognizer.delegate = self

For gesture recognizers that are in the storyboard, this sample sets up their `delegate` property by Control-dragging the gesture recognizers onto the view controller and selecting `delegate`.

`UIGestureRecognizerDelegate` provides methods for apps to control the order in which gestures are recognized as well. For more information on gesture recognition order, see Preferring one gesture over another.

### Create a custom gesture recognizer

This sample creates a custom gesture recognizer, `ResetGestureRecognizer`, which recognizes a gesture that contains at least three horizontal turnings. Users can use the gesture to easily reset the views to their initial state. To do that, move the views away from their initial positions, then put one finger on the area the colored views don’t cover, and move right, left, right, and left (or vice versa), like shaking the finger on the screen.

To recognize the gesture, this sample picks up a valid touch in `touchesBegan(_:with:)`, and gathers the touched locations in `touchesMoved(_:with:)`. When a user lifts their finger, which triggers `touchesEnded(_:with:)`, this sample counts the horizontal turnings in the touched path, and recognizes the gesture by setting the `state` property to `.ended` if the path has more than two turnings.

let count = countHorizontalTurning(touchedPoints: touchedPoints)

Note that this sample doesn’t go further to eliminate the location noise or validate the segments by checking their distance. Real-world apps might consider doing that to improve the gesture recognition accuracy and avoid recognizing false positive gestures.

## Mentioned in

Handling pan gestures

## Overview

`UIPanGestureRecognizer` is a concrete subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer`.

Clients of this class can, in their action methods, query the `UIPanGestureRecognizer` object for the current translation of the gesture ( `translation(in:)`) and the velocity of the translation ( `velocity(in:)`). They can specify a view’s coordinate system to use for the translation and velocity values. Clients can also reset the translation to a desired value.

A panning gesture is continuous. The user must press one or more fingers on a view while panning it. The gesture begins ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.began`) when the user moves the minimum number of fingers allowed ( `minimumNumberOfTouches`) enough distance for recognition as a pan. It changes ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.changed`) when the user moves a finger while pressing with the minimum number of fingers. It ends ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.ended`) when the user lifts all fingers.

## Mentioned in

Handling pinch gestures

## Overview

`UIPinchGestureRecognizer` is a concrete subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer`.

The user must press two fingers on a view while pinching it. When the user moves the two fingers toward each other, the conventional meaning is zoom out; when the user moves the two fingers away from each other, the conventional meaning is zoom in.

Pinching is a continuous gesture. The gesture begins ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.began`) when the user moves the two fingers enough to create a pinch gesture. The gesture changes ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.changed`) when a finger moves (while both fingers remain touching). The gesture ends ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.ended`) when the user lifts both fingers from the view.

## Topics

### Interpreting the pinching gesture

Handling swipe gestures

## Overview

`UISwipeGestureRecognizer` is a concrete subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer`. ``

`UISwipeGestureRecognizer` recognizes a swipe when the user moves the specified number of touches ( `numberOfTouchesRequired`) in an allowable direction ( `direction`) far enough to create a swipe. Swipes can be slow or fast. A slow swipe requires high directional precision but a small distance; a fast swipe requires low directional precision but a large distance. Because a swipe is a discrete gesture, the system sends the associated action message just once per gesture.

You can determine the location where a swipe begins by calling the `UIGestureRecognizer` methods `location(in:)` and `location(ofTouch:in:)`. The former method provides the centroid if the gesture contains more than one touch; the latter provides the location of a particular touch.

## Topics

## Mentioned in

Handling tap gestures

Preferring one gesture over another

## Overview

`UITapGestureRecognizer` is a concrete subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer`.

For gesture recognition, the specified number of fingers must tap the view a specified number of times. Although taps are discrete gestures, they’re discrete for each state of the gesture recognizer. The system sends the associated action message when the gesture begins and then again for each intermediate state until (and including) the ending state of the gesture. Code that handles tap gestures should test for the state of the gesture, for example:

func handleTap(sender: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
if sender.state == .ended {
// handling code
}
}

- (void)handleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)sender
{
if (sender.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded)
{
// handling code
}
}

Action methods handling this gesture can get the location of the gesture as a whole by calling the `UIGestureRecognizer` method `location(in:)`. If there are multiple taps, this location is the first tap. If there are multiple touches, this location is the centroid of all fingers tapping the view. Clients can get the location of particular touches in the tap by calling `location(ofTouch:in:)`. If multiple taps are allowed, this location is the first tap.

# Implementing a custom gesture recognizer

Discover when and how to build your own gesture recognizers.

## Overview

When the built-in UIKit gesture recognizers don’t provide the behavior you want, you can define custom gesture recognizers. UIKit defines highly configurable gesture recognizers to handle touch sequences for taps, long presses, pans, swipes, rotations, and pinches. For other touch sequences, or to handle gestures that involve button presses, you can define a custom gesture recognizer.

You might also use a custom gesture recognizer to simplify the event-handling code in your app. For example, the Leveraging touch input for drawing apps sample uses a gesture recognizer to capture input and display it onscreen, as shown in the following image.

To define a custom gesture recognizer, subclass `UIGestureRecognizer` (or one of its subclasses). At the top of your source file, import the `UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h` header file (for Objective-C) or the `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass` module (for Swift), as shown in the following code. This file defines the methods and properties that you must override to implement your custom gesture recognizer.

import UIKit
import UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass

In your custom subclass, implement whatever methods you need to process events. For example, if your gesture consists of touch events, implement the `touchesBegan(_:with:)`, `touchesMoved(_:with:)`, `touchesEnded(_:with:)`, and `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` methods. Use incoming events to update the `state` property of your gesture recognizer. UIKit uses the gesture recognizer states to coordinate interactions with other objects in your interface.

tvOS

@MainActor
class UIGestureRecognizer

## Overview

A _gesture recognizer_ decouples the logic for recognizing a sequence of touches (or other input) and acting on that recognition. When one of these objects recognizes a common gesture or, in some cases, a change in the gesture, it sends an action message to each designated target object.

The concrete subclasses of `UIGestureRecognizer` are the following:

- `UITapGestureRecognizer`

- `UIPinchGestureRecognizer`

- `UIRotationGestureRecognizer`

- `UISwipeGestureRecognizer`

- `UIPanGestureRecognizer`

- `UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer`

- `UILongPressGestureRecognizer`

- `UIHoverGestureRecognizer`

The `UIGestureRecognizer` class defines a set of common behaviors that can be configured for all concrete gesture recognizers. It can also communicate with its delegate (an object that adopts the `UIGestureRecognizerDelegate` protocol), thereby enabling finer-grained customization of some behaviors.

A gesture recognizer operates on touches hit-tested to a specific view and all of that view’s subviews. It thus must be associated with that view. To make that association you must call the `UIView` method `addGestureRecognizer(_:)`. A gesture recognizer doesn’t participate in the view’s responder chain.

A gesture recognizer has one or more target-action pairs associated with it. If there are multiple target-action pairs, they’re discrete, and not cumulative. Recognition of a gesture results in the dispatch of an action message to a target for each of the associated pairs. The action methods invoked must conform to one of the following signatures:

@IBAction func myActionMethod()
@IBAction func myActionMethod(_ sender: UIGestureRecognizer)

- (IBAction)handleGesture;
- (IBAction)handleGesture:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer;

Methods conforming to the latter signature permit the target in some cases to query the gesture recognizer sending the message for additional information. For example, the target could ask a `UIRotationGestureRecognizer` object for the angle of rotation (in radians) since the last invocation of the action method for this gesture. Clients of gesture recognizers can also ask for the location of a gesture by calling `location(in:)` or `location(ofTouch:in:)`.

The gesture interpreted by a gesture recognizer can be either discrete or continuous. A discrete gesture, such as a double tap, occurs but once in a multi-touch sequence and results in a single action sent. However, when a gesture recognizer interprets a continuous gesture such as a rotation gesture, it sends an action message for each incremental change until the multi-touch sequence concludes.

A window delivers touch events to a gesture recognizer before it delivers them to the hit-tested view attached to the gesture recognizer. Generally, if a gesture recognizer analyzes the stream of touches in a multi-touch sequence and doesn’t recognize its gesture, the view receives the full complement of touches. If a gesture recognizer recognizes its gesture, the remaining touches for the view are canceled. The usual sequence of actions in gesture recognition follows a path determined by default values of the `cancelsTouchesInView`, `delaysTouchesBegan`, `delaysTouchesEnded` properties:

- `cancelsTouchesInView` — If a gesture recognizer recognizes its gesture, it unbinds the remaining touches of that gesture from their view (so the window won’t deliver them). The window cancels the previously delivered touches with a ( `touchesCancelled(_:with:)`) message. If a gesture recognizer doesn’t recognize its gesture, the view receives all touches in the multi-touch sequence.

- `delaysTouchesBegan` — As long as a gesture recognizer, when analyzing touch events, hasn’t failed recognition of its gesture, the window withholds delivery of touch objects in the `UITouch.Phase.began` phase to the attached view. If the gesture recognizer subsequently recognizes its gesture, the view doesn’t receive these touch objects. If the gesture recognizer doesn’t recognize its gesture, the window delivers these objects in an invocation of the view’s `touchesBegan(_:with:)` method (and possibly a follow-up `touchesMoved(_:with:)` invocation to inform it of the touches current location).

- `delaysTouchesEnded` — As long as a gesture recognizer, when analyzing touch events, hasn’t failed recognition of its gesture, the window withholds delivery of touch objects in the `UITouch.Phase.ended` phase to the attached view. If the gesture recognizer subsequently recognizes its gesture, the touches are canceled (in a `touchesCancelled(_:with:)` message). If the gesture recognizer doesn’t recognize its gesture, the window delivers these objects in an invocation of the view’s `touchesEnded(_:with:)` method.

Note that “recognize” in the above descriptions doesn’t necessarily equate to a transition to the Recognized state.

### Subclassing notes

You may create a subclass of `UIGestureRecognizer` that recognizes a distinctive gesture — for example, a “check mark” gesture. If you’re going to create such a concrete gesture recognizer, be sure to import the `UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h` header file (for Objective-C) or the `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass` module (for Swift). This file declares all the methods and properties a subclass must either override, call, or reset.

Gesture recognizers operate within a predefined state machine, transitioning to subsequent states as they handle multi-touch events. The states and their possible transitions differ for continuous and discrete gestures. All gesture recognizers begin a multi-touch sequence in the Possible state ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.possible`). Discrete gestures transition from Possible to either Recognized ( `recognized`) or Failed ( `UIGestureRecognizer.State.failed`), depending on whether they successfully interpret the gesture or not. If the gesture recognizer transitions to Recognized, it sends its action message to its target.

For continuous gestures, the state transitions a gesture recognizer might make are more numerous, as indicated in the following sequence:

The Changed state is optional and may occur multiple times before the Cancelled or Ended state is reached. The gesture recognizer sends action messages at each state transition. Thus for a continuous gesture such as a pinch, action messages are sent as the two fingers move toward or away from each other. The `enum` constants representing these states are of type `UIGestureRecognizer.State`. (Note that the constants for Recognized and Ended states are synonymous.)

Subclasses must set the `state` property to the appropriate value when they transition between states.

#### Methods to override

The methods that subclasses must override are described in Implementing subclasses. Subclasses must also periodically reset the `state` property (as described above) and may call the `ignore(_:for:)` method.

#### Special considerations

The `state` property is declared in `UIGestureRecognizer.h` as being read-only. This property declaration is intended for clients of gesture recognizers. Subclasses of `UIGestureRecognizer` must import the `UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h` header file (for Objective-C) or the `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass` module (for Swift). This file contains a redeclaration of `state` that makes it read-write.

## Mentioned in

Preferring one gesture over another

## Overview

The delegates receive messages from a gesture recognizer, and their responses to these messages enable them to affect the operation of the gesture recognizer or to specify a relationship between it and another gesture recognizer, such as allowing simultaneous recognition or setting up a dynamic failure requirement.

An example of a situation where dynamic failure requirements are useful is in an app that attaches a screen-edge pan gesture recognizer to a view. In this case, you might want all other relevant gesture recognizers associated with that view’s subtree to require the screen-edge gesture recognizer to fail so you can prevent any graphical glitches that might occur when the other recognizers get canceled after starting the recognition process. To do this, you could use code similar to the following:

let myScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer = UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer(target: self, action:#selector(handleScreenEdgePan))
myScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer.delegate = self
// Configure the gesture recognizer and attach it to the view.

...

guard let myView = myScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer.view,
let otherView = otherGestureRecognizer.view else { return false }

return gestureRecognizer == myScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer &&
otherView.isDescendant(of: myView)}

UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer *myScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer;
...
myScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer = [[UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleScreenEdgePan:)];
myScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer.delegate = self;
// Configure the gesture recognizer and attach it to the view.
...
- (BOOL)gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer shouldBeRequiredToFailByGestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)otherGestureRecognizer {
BOOL result = NO;
if ((gestureRecognizer == myScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer) && [[otherGestureRecognizer view] isDescendantOfView:[gestureRecognizer view]]) {
result = YES;
}
return result;
}

Class

# UIPreviewInteraction

A class that registers a view to provide a custom user experience in response to 3D Touch interactions.

@MainActor
class UIPreviewInteraction

## Overview

A 3D Touch interaction results in a _preview interaction_ that comprises two phases, the first also called _preview_, followed by _commit_. The interaction progresses through these phases as a person applies more force with a touch. The following image shows the relationship between the force of a person’s touch and the phases of the preview interaction.

When using view controller previewing, _peek_ represents the preview phase, and _pop_ the commit phase.

A preview interaction is responsible for managing 3D Touch interactions for a specified view. It uses a delegate object to communicate the progress and status of the interaction to your code.

To use a preview interaction in your app:

1. Create a `UIPreviewInteraction` object, passing the view into the default initializer.

2. Create a delegate object that conforms to the `UIPreviewInteractionDelegate` protocol, and implement the appropriate methods.

3. Assign the delegate object to the `delegate` property on the preview interaction object.

For more information about the state transitions through which a preview interaction progresses, see `UIPreviewInteractionDelegate`.

## Topics

Protocol

# UIPreviewInteractionDelegate

A set of methods for communicating the progress of a preview interaction.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
protocol UIPreviewInteractionDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

A preview interaction abstracts a 3D Touch interaction into a state machine and communicates its progress through the state machine though a delegate. You’re responsible for implementing the appropriate UI behavior.

Create an object that conforms to this protocol and assign it to the `delegate` property on an instance of `UIPreviewInteraction`. Use this delegate object to respond to the state changes that occur within the preview interaction as the user performs 3D Touch interactions.

### Control preview interaction state changes

The methods on `UIPreviewInteractionDelegate` allow you to control whether a preview interaction is allowed to begin, and to observe its progress through the phases of a preview interaction. This allows you to provide a custom user experience while maintaining coherence with the system.

A preview interaction consists of two main phases: _preview_ and _commit_. The following image is a visualization of the underlying state machine associated with a preview interaction.

The `previewInteractionShouldBegin(_:)` method is called as the user begins to press on a view that has a preview interaction associated with it. Implement this method and return `false` to prevent the preview interaction from continuing. Returning `true`, or not implementing this optional method, will allow the preview interaction to continue.

Once a preview interaction begins, it enters the first phase — also called _preview_ —\_ \_through which it progresses as the user presses harder on the view. During this phase, the `previewInteraction(_:didUpdatePreviewTransition:ended:)` method is called repeatedly, reporting the progress through the transition as a `CGFloat` with a value from `0` to `1`. Implement this method and use the `transitionProgress` parameter to update the UI, providing visual feed to `true`, the preview interaction transitions to the second phase — _commit_. There are no further calls to the `previewInteraction(_:didUpdatePreviewTransition:ended:)` delegate method.

The progress through the _commit_ phase is reported to the `previewInteraction(_:didUpdateCommitTransition:ended:)` delegate method. Implement this method and use the ```transitionP``rogress``` parameter to update the UI appropriately. The preview interaction is said to be completed when the `ended` parameter is true, at which point you should complete any UI changes.

At any point before the preview interaction is completed, it can be canceled, either when the user lifts their finger from the screen, or when the `cancel()` method is called on the `UIPreviewInteraction` instance. When this happens, the `previewInteractionDidCancel(_:)` delegate method is called. You should use this method to cancel any UI transitions currently in progress.

### Preview interaction user interface updates

`UIPreviewInteraction` abstracts 3D Touch interactions away from touch force, allowing you to provide your own user interface updates for an interaction pattern that’s well understood by people. The preview interaction sits between view controller previewing ( _peek_ and _pop_) and the force values in `UITouch`, in that you’re required to provide your own user interface updates but don’t need to handle raw touch force values.

It’s important that during the preview and commit phases, you update the UI in such a way that a person is aware that the interaction is taking place. For example, pressing a table row in the Mail app first progressively blurs the other rows (the preview phase), and then shows a popover of the email as the commit phase begins. Throughout the commit phase, the popover grows, before finally transitioning to the email detail view at the end of the commit phase.

You can provide any user experience you want to accompany the preview and commit phases, but be sure to follow the appropriate section on 3D Touch in the iOS Human Interface Guidelines. Consider using `UIViewPropertyAnimator` to implement the UI changes that track the progress through the preview and commit phases of the preview interaction. This class allows you to build an animation and then scrub through that animation, using the `fractionComplete` property. This maps perfectly to the `transitionProgress` property provided in the `previewInteraction(_:didUpdatePreviewTransition:ended:)` and `previewInteraction(_:didUpdateCommitTransition:ended:)` methods, allowing you to use `UIViewPropertyAnimator` to update the UI in response to a person’s touch force.

# Understanding a drag item as a promise

Use drag items to convey data representation promises between a source app and a destination app.

## Overview

When a user drags an onscreen visual representation of an item in your app, such as a photo, a Maps location, a Calendar event, or a text selection, your app associates the underlying data with a _drag item_. The drag item, in turn, uses an _item provider_. Your app populates the item provider’s `registeredTypeIdentifiers` array with uniform type identifiers (UTIs).

The array of UTIs constitutes the source app’s promise about the specific data representations it can deliver, on request, to a destination app. The term _promise_ means that, at the time your app constructs a drag item, it commits to providing certain data representations but doesn’t yet perform the work to create them. Although it appears to the user that the item itself is being dragged, the drag item instead consists of promises along with a preview image that remains under the user’s touch point onscreen.

The portion of your app that constructs the drag item is the _drag interaction delegate_ ( `UIDragInteractionDelegate`). On the destination side, an app’s _drop interaction delegate_ ( `UIDropInteractionDelegate`) interacts with the drag item to consume promised data.

This table shows the protocols you implement to support constructing or consuming a drag item, depending on whether a view in your app is acting as a source or destination:

| Drag-and-drop role | Protocol | Your implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source app | `NSItemProviderWriting` | Register UTIs |
| Destination app | `NSItemProviderReading` | Request items |

The following classes automatically support these protocols: `NSString`, `NSAttributedString`, `NSURL`, `UIColor`, and `UIImage`.

# Making a view into a drag source

Adopt drag interaction APIs to provide items for dragging.

## Overview

By implementing a drag interaction delegate ( `UIDragInteractionDelegate`) for a view, you enable that view to function as a drag source in your app.

### Enable a view as a drag source

Any instance or subclass of `UIView` can act as a drag source. Your first steps to make this happen are:

1. Create a drag interaction (a `UIDragInteraction` instance).

2. Specify the drag interaction’s delegate (an object that conforms to the `UIDragInteractionDelegate` protocol).

3. Add the interaction to the view’s `interactions` property.

Here’s how to do this using a custom helper method, which you’d typically call within a view controller’s `viewDidLoad()` method:

func customEnableDragging(on view: UIView, dragInteractionDelegate: UIDragInteractionDelegate) {
let dragInteraction = UIDragInteraction(delegate: dragInteractionDelegate)
view.addInteraction(dragInteraction)
}

### Create a drag item

A drag item encapsulates a source app’s promises for providing a variety of data representations for one model object.

To create a drag item, implement the `dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:)` method in your drag interaction delegate, as shown here in a minimal form:

// Cast to NSString is required for NSItemProviderWriting support.
let stringItemProvider = NSItemProvider(object: "Hello World" as NSString)
return [\
UIDragItem(itemProvider: stringItemProvider)\
]
}

This implementation uses the `init(object:)` convenience initializer. When you instantiate a drag item, pass an object in your app’s native representation, or in the highest-fidelity representation you support. In general, ensure that the first element in the item provider’s `registeredTypeIdentifiers` array represents the highest-fidelity data your drag interaction delegate can deliver.

To add more data representations to a drag item, as you typically would in your app, add them in fidelity order, from highest to lowest. When adding representations, you have choices:

- The best option for adding multiple data representations to a drag item, in many cases, is to adopt the `NSItemProviderWriting` protocol in your model class. Using this protocol, you place the code for providing multiple data representations within the model class.

- You can use the `registerObject(_:visibility:)` method, or related methods, from the `NSItemProvider` class, to explicitly register data representations.

### Understand a drag source in context

In the `dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:)` protocol method, your source app responds to a request from the system. This request is itself triggered by the user starting to drag an item in your app’s UI. The conversation between your app and the system proceeds as shown here:

The figure above depicts the steps for constructing a drag item, in context:

1. The user initiates a drag activity with a long press on a view in your app, followed by moving their finger while still touching the screen. The system instantiates a drag session (an object that conforms to the `UIDragSession` protocol, not shown in the figure) for managing the drag activity.

2. The system calls the drag interaction delegate’s `dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:)` protocol method. Your delegate returns one or more drag items.

3. Finally, the system populates the drag session with your drag items, ready for the user to move the drag session to a destination.

# Making a view into a drop destination

Adopt drop interaction APIs to selectively consume dragged content.

## Overview

By implementing a drop interaction delegate ( `UIDropInteractionDelegate`) for a view, you enable that view to accept dropped items.

### Enable a view as a drop destination

Any instance or subclass of `UIView` can act as a drop destination. Your first steps to make this happen are:

1. Create a drop interaction (a `UIDropInteraction` instance).

2. Specify the drop interaction’s delegate (an object that conforms to the `UIDropInteractionDelegate` protocol).

3. Add the interaction to the view’s `interactions` property.

Here’s how to do this:

func customEnableDropping(on view: UIView, dropInteractionDelegate: UIDropInteractionDelegate) {
let dropInteraction = UIDropInteraction(delegate: dropInteractionDelegate)
view.addInteraction(dropInteraction)
}

### Consider accepting the drag items

When the user moves the touch point of a drag session over a drop destination, you can immediately refuse it, or you can tell the system to continue its conversation with your delegate object. Provide your response as follows:

// Ensure the drop session has an object of the appropriate type
return session.canLoadObjects(ofClass: UIImage.self)
}

This example assumes that your drop destination can consume only `UIImage` objects. The method implementation tests for this type in the `return` statement. You can also use this method to refuse a drop session based on the state of your app. The _drop session_ is a system-managed object that conforms to the `UIDropSession` protocol. You can access a drop session for information about the items being dropped.

The `dropInteraction(_:canHandle:)` method is your app’s only chance to respond to the system’s question about whether your app will _consider_ accepting the items. For example, you might preemptively reject a drop session if it contains no data representations your app can consume, or if consuming dragged items is inappropriate given your app state. Your app’s definitive opportunity to accept or reject dropped items is in your implementation of the `dropInteraction(_:sessionDidUpdate:)` protocol method.

### Provide the required drop proposal

For a view to be eligible to accept the data from a drop session, you _must_ implement the `dropInteraction(_:sessionDidUpdate:)` protocol method. In your implementation, return a drop proposal—a `UIDropProposal` object that specifies the drop operation type, a constant from the `UIDropOperation` enumeration.

Provide a drop proposal like this:

// Propose to the system to copy the item from the source app
return UIDropProposal(operation: .copy)
}

If your app instead opts to refuse the dropped items, return the `UIDropOperation.cancel` constant.

The system calls this protocol method when the user has moved the touch point of a drag session over a drop-enabled view — as long as the view didn’t already reject the drop by returning `false` in its `dropInteraction(_:canHandle:)` method (see Consider accepting the drag items).

### Consume the data in the drag items

The final step of the conversation between the drop interaction delegate and the system is when your app consumes the data the user has dragged from the source app. Here, your drop interaction delegate asks the drop session to load its drag items:

func dropInteraction(_ interaction: UIDropInteraction, performDrop session: UIDropSession) {
// Consume drag items (in this example, of type UIImage).
session.loadObjects(ofClass: UIImage.self) { imageItems in
let images = imageItems as! [UIImage]
self.imageView.image = images.first
}
// Perform additional UI updates as needed.
}

The `dropInteraction(_:performDrop:)` method is a destination app’s only opportunity to request representations of drag items. Receiving the items is potentially time-consuming and proceeds asynchronously. _Don’t_ wait within this method to receive items; instead, return from this method quickly.

### Understand a drop destination in context

When the touch point for a drop session moves over a view that you’ve configured as a drop destination, the system initiates a conversation with the drop interaction delegate. This conversation gives your app opportunities to accept or reject the drop, to prepare for consuming the drag items, and to update your model and UI, as shown here:

The figure above depicts the steps for consuming a drag item, in context:

1. The user moves their finger onscreen so the touch point of a drag session is within a configured view in your app. The system instantiates a drop session (an object that conforms to the `UIDropSession` protocol, not shown in the figure) for managing the drop activity.

2. The system calls the drop interaction delegate’s `dropInteraction(_:canHandle:)` protocol method. Check whether your app can, and opts to, consume the drag items.

3. The system calls the delegate’s `dropInteraction(_:sessionDidEnter:)` protocol method. Prepare to consume the drag items.

4. The system calls the delegate’s `dropInteraction(_:sessionDidUpdate:)` protocol method. Your implementation _must_ return a `UIDropProposal` object, or the system ends the session.

5. If the user confirms their intent to complete the drop, the system calls the delegate’s asynchronous `dropInteraction(_:performDrop:)` protocol method. This a destination app’s only opportunity to request representations of drag items.

Sample Code

# Adopting drag and drop in a custom view

Demonstrates how to enable drag and drop for a `UIImageView` instance.

Download

Xcode 11.3+

## Overview

This sample code project uses a `UIImageView` instance to show how any instance or subclass of the `UIView` class can act as a drag source or a drop destination.

To enable drag and drop, you add one or more interaction objects to a view. To provide or consume data, you implement the protocol methods in the interaction delegates.

### Get started

Deploy this sample code project on iPad, which supports drag and drop between apps. When you first launch this project’s built app, you see an image view containing an image. Use this app along with a second app that has images, such as Photos. For example, configure the iPad screen to Split View, with this app side by side with Photos. Then drag the image from this app into Photos, or drag an image from Photos into this app.

### Enable drag and drop interactions

To enable dragging, dropping, or both, attach interactions to views. A convenient place for this code is in an app’s `viewDidLoad()` method.

Add the drag interaction:

let dragInteraction = UIDragInteraction(delegate: self)
imageView.addInteraction(dragInteraction)

Add the drop interaction:

let dropInteraction = UIDropInteraction(delegate: self)
view.addInteraction(dropInteraction)

Enabling drag and drop for an image view, which this project uses, requires an additional step. You must explicitly enable user interaction, like this:

imageView.isUserInteractionEnabled = true

### Provide data for a drag session

The `dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:)` method is the one essential method for allowing dragging from a view.

guard let image = imageView.image else { return [] }

let provider = NSItemProvider(object: image)
let item = UIDragItem(itemProvider: provider)
item.localObject = image

/*
Returning a non-empty array, as shown here, enables dragging. You
can disable dragging by instead returning an empty array.
*/
return [item]
}

The system calls this delegate method in response to the user gesture that initiates dragging. In your implementation, return an array of one or more drag items, each with one item provider. In each item provider, specify one or more data representations of the model object to be dragged. The model object must conform to the `NSItemProviderWriting` protocol.

For more about providing data for dragging, see Making a view into a drag source.

### Consume data from a drop session

To enable a view to consume data from a drop session, you implement three delegate methods.

First, your app can refuse the drag items based on their uniform type identifiers (UTIs), the state of your app, or other requirements. Here, the implementation allows a user to drop only a single item that conforms to the `kUTTypeImage` UTI:

return session.hasItemsConforming(toTypeIdentifiers: [kUTTypeImage as String]) && session.items.count == 1
}

Second, you must tell the system how you want to consume the data, which is typically by copying it. You specify this choice by way of a drop proposal:

let dropLocation = session.location(in: view)
updateLayers(forDropLocation: dropLocation)

let operation: UIDropOperation

if imageView.frame.contains(dropLocation) {
/*
If you add in-app drag-and-drop support for the .move operation,
you must write code to coordinate between the drag interaction
delegate and the drop interaction delegate.
*/
operation = session.localDragSession == nil ? .copy : .move
} else {
// Do not allow dropping outside of the image view.
operation = .cancel
}

return UIDropProposal(operation: operation)
}

Finally, after the user lifts their finger from the screen, indicating their intent to drop the drag items, your view has one opportunity to request particular data representations of the drag items:

func dropInteraction(_ interaction: UIDropInteraction, performDrop session: UIDropSession) {
// Consume drag items (in this example, of type UIImage).
session.loadObjects(ofClass: UIImage.self) { imageItems in
let images = imageItems as! [UIImage]

/*
If you do not employ the loadObjects(ofClass:completion:) convenience
method of the UIDropSession class, which automatically employs
the main thread, explicitly dispatch UI work to the main thread.
For example, you can use `DispatchQueue.main.async` method.
*/
self.imageView.image = images.first
}

// Perform additional UI updates as needed.
let dropLocation = session.location(in: view)
updateLayers(forDropLocation: dropLocation)
}

In addition to these three methods, drag and drop offers additional API hooks for customizing your adoption of the feature. For more about consuming data from a drop session, see Making a view into a drop destination.

# Adopting drag and drop in a table view

Demonstrates how to enable and implement drag and drop for a table view.

Download

Xcode 12.5+

## Overview

This sample code project uses a `UITableView` instance to show how to make a table view into a drag source and a drop destination.

To enable drag and drop, you specify the table view as its own drag delegate and drop delegate. To provide or consume data, you implement the drag and drop delegate methods.

Adopting drag and drop in a table view differs in some important ways compared to the process you follow for a custom view. To compare the steps, see Adopting drag and drop in a custom view.

### Drag text in the sample app

Deploy this project on iPad, which supports drag and drop between apps. When you first launch this project’s built app, you see a table with several rows, each with a text string. Use this app along with a second app that supports editing of text strings, such as Notes or Reminders. For example, configure the iPad screen to Split View, with this app side by side with Reminders. Then drag a row from this app into Reminders, or drag a reminder into this app.

This app also supports rearranging rows in the table by dragging a row up or down. However, rearrangement in this app uses the traditional `tableView(_:canMoveRowAt:)` and `tableView(_:moveRowAt:to:)` methods rather than the drag and drop API.

### Enable drag and drop interactions

To enable dragging, dropping, or both, specify a table view as its own drag or drop delegate. A convenient place for this code is in an app’s `viewDidLoad()` method. This code enables both dragging and dropping:

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

tableView.dragInteractionEnabled = true
tableView.dragDelegate = self
tableView.dropDelegate = self

navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = editButtonItem
}

Unlike a custom view, a table view does not have an `interactions` property to which you add interactions. Instead, a table view uses a drag delegate and a drop delegate directly.

### Provide data for a drag session

To provide data for dragging from a table view, implement the `tableView(_:itemsForBeginning:at:)` method. Here’s the model-agnostic portion of this code:

return model.dragItems(for: indexPath)
}

The following helper function, used by the `tableView(_:itemsForBeginning:at:)` method, serves as an interface to the data model in this sample code project:

let placeName = placeNames[indexPath.row]

let data = placeName.data(using: .utf8)
let itemProvider = NSItemProvider()

itemProvider.registerDataRepresentation(forTypeIdentifier: kUTTypePlainText as String, visibility: .all) { completion in
completion(data, nil)
return nil
}

return [\
UIDragItem(itemProvider: itemProvider)\
]
}

### Consume data from a drop session

To consume data from a drop session in a table view, you implement three delegate methods.

First, your app can refuse the drag items based on their class, the state of your app, or other requirements. This project’s implementation allows a user to drop only instances of the `NSString` class. Here is the model-agnostic portion of this code:

return model.canHandle(session)
}

The following helper function, used by the `tableView(_:canHandle:)` method, serves as the interface to the data model:

return session.canLoadObjects(ofClass: NSString.self)
}

Second, you must tell the system how you want to consume the data, which is typically by copying it. You specify this choice by way of a drop proposal:

var dropProposal = UITableViewDropProposal(operation: .cancel)

// Accept only one drag item.
guard session.items.count == 1 else { return dropProposal }

// The .move drag operation is available only for dragging within this app and while in edit mode.
if tableView.hasActiveDrag {
if tableView.isEditing {
dropProposal = UITableViewDropProposal(operation: .move, intent: .insertAtDestinationIndexPath)
}
} else {
// Drag is coming from outside the app.
dropProposal = UITableViewDropProposal(operation: .copy, intent: .insertAtDestinationIndexPath)
}

return dropProposal
}

Finally, after the user lifts their finger from the screen, indicating their intent to drop the drag items, your table view has one opportunity to request particular data representations of the drag items:

/**
This delegate method is the only opportunity for accessing and loading
the data representations offered in the drag item. The drop coordinator
supports accessing the dropped items, updating the table view, and specifying
optional animations. Local drags with one item go through the existing
`tableView(_:moveRowAt:to:)` method on the data source.
*/
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, performDropWith coordinator: UITableViewDropCoordinator) {
let destinationIndexPath: IndexPath

if let indexPath = coordinator.destinationIndexPath {
destinationIndexPath = indexPath
} else {
// Get last index path of table view.
let section = tableView.numberOfSections - 1
let row = tableView.numberOfRows(inSection: section)
destinationIndexPath = IndexPath(row: row, section: section)
}

coordinator.session.loadObjects(ofClass: NSString.self) { items in
// Consume drag items.
let stringItems = items as! [String]

var indexPaths = IndexPath
for (index, item) in stringItems.enumerated() {
let indexPath = IndexPath(row: destinationIndexPath.row + index, section: destinationIndexPath.section)
self.model.addItem(item, at: indexPath.row)
indexPaths.append(indexPath)
}

tableView.insertRows(at: indexPaths, with: .automatic)
}
}

In addition to these three methods, drag and drop offers additional API hooks for customizing your adoption of this feature for table views. For more about providing and consuming data, see Supporting drag and drop in table views.

Sample Code

# Data delivery with drag and drop

Share data between iPad apps during a drag and drop operation using an item provider.

Download

Xcode 11.0+

## Overview

With drag and drop, users can copy data from one iPad app to another. The data is shared between the apps using an `NSItemProvider` object. This sample code project shows how to use an item provider to:

- Share a contact that the user drags from the sample iPad app and drops into another app.

- Retrieve contact information that the user drags from another app and drops into the sample app.

The sample iPad app uses a table view to display a list of contacts. The user can drag one or more contacts and drop them into another app such as Contacts or Notes. Also, the user can use another app, like Contacts or Notes, to drag and drop new contacts into the sample app.

### Add drag support

The table view in the sample app displays a list of contacts. When the user begins dragging a contact, the system calls the `tableView(_:itemsForBeginning:at:)` method. The method’s implementation retrieves the contact from the list using the `at` parameter to determine the contact’s location within the list. The method then creates an item provider with the contact object and wraps the item provider in a `UIDragItem` object. The method places the drag item into an array which it returns to the system. Finally, the system adds the drag item to the current drag session.

func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
itemsForBeginning session: UIDragSession,

let contactCard = dataSource.clients[indexPath.row]
let dragItem = UIDragItem(itemProvider: NSItemProvider(object: contactCard))
return [dragItem]
}

The user may select multiple contacts to drag to another app. Each time the user selects a contact, the system calls the `tableView(_:itemsForAddingTo:at:point:)` method. Similar to beginning a drag session, this method creates an item provider for the selected contact, creates a drag item that contains the item provider, and returns an array containing the drag item so the system can add the drag item to the drag session.

func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
itemsForAddingTo session: UIDragSession,
at indexPath: IndexPath,

// use this to NOT allow additional items to the drag:
// return []

let contactCard = dataSource.clients[indexPath.row]
let dragItem = UIDragItem(itemProvider: NSItemProvider(object: contactCard))
dragItem.localObject = true // makes it faster to drag and drop content within the same app
return [dragItem]
}

In both cases, the `UITableViewDragDelegate` methods create item providers using instances of the `ContactCard` class. This class implements the `NSItemProviderWriting` protocol, making it possible to initialize a new item provider with a contact card object.

By conforming to this protocol, a contact card object can tell the item provider the data types it supports; the sample app supports vCard and plain text. A contact card can also load data of a specified type, which an item provider retrieves by calling the contact card’s `loadData(withTypeIdentifier:forItemProviderCompletionHandler:)` method.

### Add drop support

When the user drops contact information from another app into the sample app, the system calls the `tableView(_:performDropWith:)` method. `ContactsTableViewController` implements this method to handle the drop operation. The implementation of the method uses the drop item’s item provider to call `loadObject(ofClass:completionHandler:)`, which retrieves a `ContactCard` object representing the dropped contact information.

The `loadObject` method asks the `ContactCard` class for the contact card object. The class, which conforms to the `NSItemProviderReading` protocol, implements the `object(withItemProviderData:typeIdentifier:)` class method, which creates and initializes a contact card object with the item provider data.

When the user drops a contact at a specific location within the table view, the completion handler (from the `loadObject` call) creates a placeholder that displays a gap at the drop location. Next, the handler inserts the dropped contact into the list of contacts at the index path of the drop location. And finally, the completion handler replaces the placeholder with a view displaying contact.

_ = dropItem.dragItem.itemProvider.loadObject(
ofClass: ContactCard.self,
completionHandler: { (data, error) in
if error == nil {
DispatchQueue.main.async {
let placeHolder = UITableViewDropPlaceholder(
insertionIndexPath: destinationIndexPath!,
reuseIdentifier: ClientsDataSource.tableCellIdentifier,
rowHeight: UITableView.automaticDimension)

let placeHolderContext = coordinator.drop(dropItem.dragItem, to: placeHolder)

placeHolderContext.commitInsertion(dataSourceUpdates: { (insertionIndexPath) in
// Update our data source with the newly dropped contact.
if let newContact = data as? ContactCard {
self.dataSource.clients.insert(newContact, at: insertionIndexPath.item)
}
})
}
} else {
print("""
There was an error in loading the drop item: ### \(#function),
\(String(describing: error?.localizedDescription))
""")
}
})

When the user drops the contact on an empty location in the table view, the completion handler adds the dropped contact to the end of the list without displaying a gap.

_ = dropItem.dragItem.itemProvider.loadObject(
ofClass: ContactCard.self,
completionHandler: { (data, error) in
if error == nil {
if let newContact = data as? ContactCard {
self.dataSource.clients.append(newContact)
DispatchQueue.main.async {
self.tableView.reloadData()
}
}
} else {
print("""
There was an error in loading the drop item: ### \(#function),
\(String(describing: error?.localizedDescription))
""")
}
})

@MainActor

## Mentioned in

Presenting content on a connected display

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

A `UIScreen` object provides information about the screens attached to an iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS device. A screen object for an iOS or iPadOS device has information about the integrated display or an attached display. A screen object for a tvOS device represents the television connected to the device. In a compatible iPad or iPhone app running in visionOS, don’t rely on screen-related properties to configure your app.

You don’t create any of these screen objects directly. Instead, fetch the screen object for one of your app’s windows from the `UIWindowScene` object that manages the window.

Avoid using screen objects to make decisions about your app’s interface. Use a screen object only as needed to retrieve screen-related information, such as the screen’s bounds rectangle, brightness, and overscan settings. Apps that rely on the screen dimensions can use the object in the `fixedCoordinateSpace` property as a fixed point of reference for any calculations they must make.

## Topics

### Capturing a snapshot

Returns a snapshot view based on the current screen contents.

### Detecting screen capture

`var isCaptured: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the system is actively cloning the screen to another destination.

Deprecated

`var mirrored: UIScreen?`

@MainActor
class UIWindow

## Mentioned in

Using responders and the responder chain to handle events

## Overview

Windows work with your view controllers to handle events and to perform many other tasks that are fundamental to your app’s operation. UIKit handles most window-related interactions, working with other objects as needed to implement many app behaviors.

You use windows only when you need to do the following:

- Provide a main window to display your app’s content.

- Create additional windows (as needed) to display additional content.

Normally, Xcode provides your app’s main window. New iOS projects use storyboards to define the app’s views. Storyboards require the presence of a `window` property on the app delegate object, which the Xcode templates automatically provide. If your app doesn’t use storyboards, you must create this window yourself.

Most apps need only one window, which displays the app’s content on the device’s main screen. Although you can create additional windows on the device’s main screen, extra windows are commonly used to display content on an external screen, as described in Presenting content on a connected display.

You also use `UIWindow` objects for a handful of other tasks:

- Setting the z-axis level of your window, which affects the visibility of the window relative to other windows.

- Showing windows and making them the target of keyboard events.

- Converting coordinate values to and from the window’s coordinate system.

- Changing the root view controller of a window.

- Changing the screen on which the window is displayed.

Windows don’t have any visual appearance of their own. Instead, a window hosts one or more views, which are managed by the window’s root view controller. You configure the root view controller in your storyboards, adding whatever views are appropriate for your interface.

You should rarely need to subclass `UIWindow`. The kinds of behaviors you might implement in a window can usually be implemented in a higher-level view controller more easily. One of the few times you might want to subclass is to override the `becomeKey()` or `resignKey()` methods to implement custom behaviors when a window’s key status changes. For information about how to display a window on a specific screen, see `UIScreen`.

### Understand keyboard interactions

Whereas touch events are delivered to the window where they occurred, events that don’t have a relevant coordinate value are delivered to the _key window_. Only one window at a time can be the key window, and you can use a window’s `isKeyWindow` property to determine its status. Most of the time, your app’s main window is the key window, but UIKit may designate a different window as needed.

If you need to know which window is key, observe the `didBecomeKeyNotification` and `didResignKeyNotification` notifications. The system sends those notifications on the main actor in response to key window changes in your app. To force a window become key, or to force a window to resign the key status, call the appropriate methods of this class.

Protocol

# UICoordinateSpace

A set of methods for converting between different frames of reference on a screen.

iOSiPadOStvOSvisionOSwatchOS

@MainActor
protocol UICoordinateSpace : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

The `UIView` class adopts this protocol so that you can convert easily between most coordinate spaces in your app. The `UIScreen` class includes the `coordinateSpace` and `fixedCoordinateSpace` properties, which give you access to the screen’s coordinate spaces. You can adopt this protocol in your own classes to convert between your custom coordinate spaces and the coordinate spaces of your app’s views and screens.

In iOS 8 and later, window and screen coordinate spaces aren’t fixed to a specific device orientation. Instead, window and screen coordinates change to match the app’s interface orientation, which typically (but not always) matches the current device orientation. (View controllers still determine which interface orientations the app supports.) Rotating the window and screen simplifies the interactions between views, windows, and the screen. In cases where you still need a fixed frame of reference — for example, because you need to store the location of a touch event or onscreen item persistently — you can use the methods of this protocol to convert coordinate values to the fixed coordinate space provided by the `UIScreen` object.

To convert a point from a view’s current coordinate space to the screen’s fixed coordinate space, use code similar to the following:

[myView convertPoint:point toCoordinateSpace:myView.window.screen.fixedCoordinateSpace];

When implementing the methods of this protocol, you must convert coordinate values to or from your local coordinate space. When performing such conversions, use the screen coordinate space as an intermediate coordinate space, converting to screen coordinates before converting to the target coordinate space. For example, when converting from your local coordinate space to the coordinate space of another view, convert your local coordinates to the screen coordinate space first and then convert those screen coordinates to the coordinate space of the view.

# Displaying transient content in a popover

Show a temporary interface on top of your app’s content on iPad.

## Overview

Use popovers for app content that appears when needed and disappears when the user is finished with it. For example, use popovers to display information about the currently selected item, to display tools and configuration options, or to gather information from the user. You anchor a popover to a specific location onscreen, and the popover floats above the main window. The following image shows how the Calendar app on iPad uses a popover to prompt the user for new meeting information.

You specify the content of a popover using a view controller. You then present your view controller using the popover presentation style. UIKit anchors your popover to the location you specify.

The following code shows how to present a popover from a bar button item, which acts as the anchor point for the popover. UIKit uses the position of that bar button item to determine where to place the popover and how to orient its arrow. The view controller’s `UIPopoverPresentationController` manages the display of your popover onscreen.

@IBAction func displayOptionsForSelectedItem () {
// Load and configure your view controller.
let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
let optionsVC = storyboard.instantiateViewController(
withIdentifier: "itemOptionsViewController")

// Use the popover presentation style for your view controller.
optionsVC.modalPresentationStyle = .popover

// Specify the anchor point for the popover.
optionsVC.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem =
optionsControl

// Present the view controller (in a popover).
self.present(optionsVC, animated: true) {
// The popover is visible.
}
}

Configure other properties of your view controller’s `UIPopoverPresentationController` object before calling the `present(_:animated:completion:)` method. For example, you might want to assign a delegate to manage the presentation and dismissal of the popover.

## Mentioned in

Displaying transient content in a popover

## Overview

From the time a popover is presented until the time it’s dismissed, UIKit uses an instance of this class to manage the presentation behavior. You use instances of this class as-is to configure aspects of the popover appearance and behavior for view controllers whose presentation style is set to `UIModalPresentationStyle.popover`.

In nearly all cases, you use this class as-is and don’t create instances of it directly. UIKit creates an instance of this class automatically when you present a view controller using the `UIModalPresentationStyle.popover` style. You can retrieve that instance from the presented view controller’s `popoverPresentationController` property and use it to configure the popover behavior.

If you don’t want to configure a popover immediately after presenting a view controller, you can use a delegate object to configure the popover instead. During the presentation process, the popover presentation controller calls various methods of its delegate—an object that conforms to the `UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate` protocol—to ask for information and to inform it about the state of the presentation. Your delegate object can use those methods to configure the popover and adjust its behavior as needed. For information about how to implement a delegate for a popover presentation controller, see `UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate`.

@MainActor
class UIPopoverBackgroundView

## Overview

This class must be subclassed before it can be used. The implementation of your subclass is responsible for providing the border decoration and arrow for the popover. Subclasses must override all declared properties and methods to provide information about where to lay out the corresponding popover content and arrow. Subclasses must also provide implementations for all methods of the `UIPopoverBackgroundViewMethods` protocol.

### Subclassing notes

Your subclass is responsible for providing the background visual styling of the popover, which includes the arrow and appropriately styled border. The popover controller places the actual popover content on top of your background view to finish the popover’s presentation.

The background contents of your view should be based on stretchable images. Because the popover is animated into place (and may require animated transitions), using images is the only way to ensure that the animations are smooth and not jittery. By creating images that can be stretched at appropriate places, your popover can still be resized and adjusted as needed. You can then incorporate those images using `UIImageView` subviews or Core Animation layers. When the size of the popover changes (perhaps to accommodate the keyboard), all you have to do is adjust the frame rectangles of your embedded image views.

In addition to providing the background content, your subclass must implement the `arrowOffset` and `arrowDirection` properties and the methods in the `UIPopoverBackgroundViewMethods` protocol. The popover controller uses these methods and properties to get and set information related to your background view. The protocol methods are called once and the values you return should never change. However, the values in the `arrowOffset` and `arrowDirection` properties can change while your popover is on the screen, so your setter methods should call `setNeedsLayout()` when that happens to update the background image views or layers.

To create a stretchable image, use the `resizableImage(withCapInsets:)` method of `UIImage`.

## Topics

### Accessing the arrow metrics

`var arrowOffset: CGFloat`

The distance (measured in points) from the center of the view to the center line of the arrow.

`var arrowDirection: UIPopoverArrowDirection`

# Getting the user’s attention with alerts and action sheets

Present important information to the user or prompt the user about an important choice.

## Overview

Display an alert or action sheet when your app requires additional information or acknowledgment from the user. Alerts and action sheets interrupt your app’s normal flow to display a message to the user. In the following image, the left image shows an alert and the right image shows an action sheet. The user dismisses an alert or action sheet by selecting one of the listed options.

To display an alert or action sheet, create a `UIAlertController` object, configure it, and call its `present(_:animated:completion:)` method, as shown in the following code. Configuring the alert controller includes specifying the title and message that you want the user to see and the actions the user can select. You must add at least one action — represented by a `UIAlertAction` object — to an alert controller before presenting it.

@IBAction func agreeToTerms() {
// Create the action buttons for the alert.
let defaultAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Agree",
style: .default) { (action) in
// Respond to user selection of the action.
}
let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Disagree",
style: .cancel) { (action) in
// Respond to user selection of the action.
}

// Create and configure the alert controller.
let alert = UIAlertController(title: "Terms and Conditions",
message: "Click Agree to accept the terms and conditions.",
preferredStyle: .alert)
alert.addAction(defaultAction)
alert.addAction(cancelAction)

self.present(alert, animated: true) {
// The alert was presented
}
}

### Present an action sheet on iPad

On iPad, UIKit requires that you display an action sheet inside a popover. The following image shows an action sheet anchored to a bar button item.

To display your action sheet in a popover, specify your popover’s anchor point using the `popoverPresentationController` property of your alert controller. It’s safe to configure this property regardless of the underlying device. In other words, The following code displays the action sheet in a popover on iPad and as a slide-up presentation on iPhone.

@IBAction func deleteItem() {
let destroyAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Delete",
style: .destructive) { (action) in
// Respond to user selection of the action
}
let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel",
style: .cancel) { (action) in
// Respond to user selection of the action
}

let alert = UIAlertController(title: "Delete the image?",
message: "",
preferredStyle: .actionSheet)
alert.addAction(destroyAction)
alert.addAction(cancelAction)

// On iPad, action sheets must be presented from a popover.
alert.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem =
self.trashButton

Getting the user’s attention with alerts and action sheets

## Overview

Use this class to configure alerts and action sheets with the message that you want to display and the actions from which to choose. After configuring the alert controller with the actions and style you want, present it using the `present(_:animated:completion:)` method. UIKit displays alerts and action sheets modally over your app’s content.

In addition to displaying a message to a user, you can associate actions with your alert controller to give people a way to respond. For each action you add using the `addAction(_:)` method, the alert controller configures a button with the action details. When a person taps that action, the alert controller executes the block you provided when creating the action object. The following code shows how to configure an alert with a single action.

let alert = UIAlertController(title: "My Alert", message: "This is an alert.", preferredStyle: .alert)
alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: NSLocalizedString("OK", comment: "Default action"), style: .default, handler: { _ in
NSLog("The \"OK\" alert occured.")
}))
self.present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)

UIAlertController* alert = [UIAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:@"My Alert"\
message:@"This is an alert."\
preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];

UIAlertAction* defaultAction = [UIAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"OK" style:UIAlertActionStyleDefault\
handler:^(UIAlertAction * action) {}];

[alert addAction:defaultAction];
[self presentViewController:alert animated:YES completion:nil];

When configuring an alert with the `UIAlertController.Style.alert` style, you can also add text fields to the alert interface. The alert controller lets you provide a block for configuring your text fields prior to display. The alert controller maintains a reference to each text field so that you can access its value later.

# Presenting content on a connected display

Fill connected displays with additional content from your app.

## Overview

The user can connect additional displays to an iOS device at any time using AirPlay or a physical cable. Each additional display represents new space on which to present your app’s content. To present content on a connected display, you attach windows to `UIWindowScene` objects that the system provides and respond to life-cycle events using scene delegates.

UIKit defines different `UISceneSession.Role` types to indicate how the user interacts with the content for a scene. The following types relate to content displayed on a connected screen:

- Scenes with the `windowApplication` role present interactive windows. The windows render on the built-in display or a connected display for some iPad models. Windows for more than one scene may present concurrently and may not take up the full screen.

- Scenes with the `windowExternalDisplayNonInteractive` role present noninteractive windows on connected displays. When an app presents content for this scene, it spans the full screen.

### Configure your project for scenes

You provide the system with scene configurations to specify the information it uses to create scenes for your app and indicate the types of scenes your app supports.

By default, Xcode preconfigures new projects to use scenes with the `windowApplication` role. iPad models with the M1 chip can present interactive content on the connected screen through this type of scene, when using Stage Manager, an external keyboard, and a pointing device.

To use the connected display to present noninteractive content that supplements the interactive content your app presents on the built-in screen, provide a new configuration for the `windowExternalDisplayNonInteractive` role. When an external display connects, the system provides an additional scene for your app to add the noninteractive content to. For example, a game might show its content on a connected display and show game controls on the built-in screen.

For more information, see Specifying the scenes your app supports.

### Attach a window to a scene

When a display connects to an iOS device, the system provides a scene for your app. Your app receives the scene through the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method on your scene delegate. You can use the method and the session object it provides to configure and attach a window to the scene. The system displays the window you provide on the window scene’s current screen.

This example configures a window to render on a scene’s display.

func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

if session.role == .windowApplication {
let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
window.rootViewController = ViewController()
self.window = window
window.makeKeyAndVisible()
}
}

When using a storyboard, the system initializes and attaches a window to the scene for you.

In addition to calling this method, UIKit also posts the `willConnectNotification` notification.

### Handle disconnection

When the system disconnects a scene from your app, which may occur if a user disconnects the display, your app receives a call through the `sceneDidDisconnect(_:)` method on the scene’s delegate. Use this method to perform any final cleanup and update the content other scenes present, when necessary.

UIKit also posts the `didDisconnectNotification` notification in addition to calling this method.

### Handle transitions to and from connected displays

Scenes may appear on different displays during their lifetime. If you use information from a `UIScreen` object, obtain it contextually using a windows scene’s `screen` property.

Use the scene delegate’s `windowScene(_:didUpdate:interfaceOrientation:traitCollection:)` method if your app needs to know when a scene is changing screens.

This examples uses a display link and updates the link when the scene changes screens.

class ExternalDisplaySceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {
var window: UIWindow?
var screen: UIScreen?

if session.role == .windowExternalDisplayNonInteractive {
let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
window.rootViewController = ExternalDisplayViewController()
self.window = window
window.makeKeyAndVisible()
...
setupDisplayLinkIfNecessary()
}
}

func windowScene(_ windowScene: UIWindowScene, didUpdate previousCoordinateSpace: UICoordinateSpace, interfaceOrientation previousInterfaceOrientation: UIInterfaceOrientation, traitCollection previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection) {
setupDisplayLinkIfNecessary()
}

weak var linkedScreen: UIScreen?

func setupDisplayLinkIfNecessary() {
let currentScreen = self.screen
if currentScreen != linkedScreen {
// Set up display link
...
self.linkedScreen = currentScreen
}
}

...
}

### Change the screen mode of an external display

Many displays support multiple resolutions, some of which use different pixel aspect ratios. Screen objects use the most common screen mode by default, but they support changing that mode when they display content for a scene with the `windowExternalDisplayNonInteractive` role. For example, if you’re implementing a game using textures for a 640 x 480 pixel screen, you might change the screen mode for screens with higher default resolutions. Don’t attempt to change the mode of a screen for a scene with the `windowApplication` role.

If you plan to use a screen mode other than the default one, apply that mode to the `UIScreen` object before associating the screen with a window. The `UIScreenMode` class defines the attributes of a single screen mode. You can get a list of the modes supported by a screen from its `availableModes` property and then iterate through the list for one that matches your needs.

For more information about screen modes, see `UIScreenMode`.

class UIScreenMode

## Mentioned in

Presenting content on a connected display

## Overview

A screen mode object encapsulates information about the size of the screen’s underlying display buffer and the aspect ratio it uses for individual pixels. Most developers should never need to use the information provided by this class and should simply use the bounds provided by the `UIScreen` object for their drawing space. The bounds of screen and window objects automatically take the pixel aspect ratio and underlying drawing hardware into consideration. However, developers that work with pixel-level information more directly may use the information in the current screen mode object to tailor their code for the target screen.

You don’t create instances of this class directly. Instead, you get the screen modes supported by a given screen from the corresponding `UIScreen` object.

## Topics

### Accessing the screen mode attributes

`var size: CGSize`

The screen size, measured in pixels.

`var pixelAspectRatio: CGFloat`

## Mentioned in

Choosing a user interface idiom for your Mac app

## Overview

Hardware keyboards allow a user to hold down the Control, Option, Command, or other modifier key and press another key in combination to initiate commands such as Cut, Copy, or Paste. You can use instances of this class to define custom command sequences that your app recognizes and then provide an appropriate response.

To use this class, you create instances and associate them with your app’s responder objects. Each responder has a `keyCommands` property that you can redefine and use to return the key command objects that responder supports. Key command sequences are generated only for devices with an attached hardware keyboard.

The system always has the first opportunity to handle key commands. Key commands that map to known system events (such as Cut, Copy, and Paste) are automatically routed to the appropriate responder methods. For other key commands, the system looks for an object in the responder chain with a key command object that matches the pressed keys. If it finds such an object, it then searches the responder chain, looking for the first object that implements the corresponding action method, and calls the first one it finds.

iPad apps that run in macOS can use `UIKeyCommand` to create menu elements that have keyboard shortcuts.

## Topics

Class

# UIEditMenuInteraction

An interaction that provides edit operations using a menu.

@MainActor
class UIEditMenuInteraction

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

Edit menu interactions provide edit actions — such as cut, copy, and paste — for the content a view displays. The presentation style the interaction uses to display the actions conforms to the input method of the interaction. For touch interactions, the actions display in an editing menu. When responding to a secondary click on devices with pointer-based input, the actions display in a context menu.

Standard UIKit classes, such as `UITextView` and `UITextField`, are preconfigured to use edit menu interactions.

To add an edit menu interaction to a generic view:

1. Create an edit menu interaction object, and pass an optional delegate into the default initializer.

2. Call the `addInteraction(_:)` method on your view to add the interaction.

3. Create a gesture recognizer to trigger the interaction and add it to the view.

The following example creates an edit menu interaction triggered by a long press.

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

// Add the edit menu interaction.
editMenuInteraction = UIEditMenuInteraction(delegate: self)
interactionView.addInteraction(editMenuInteraction!)

// Create the gesture recognizer.
let longPress = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(didLongPress(_:)))
longPress.allowedTouchTypes = [UITouch.TouchType.direct.rawValue as NSNumber]
interactionView.addGestureRecognizer(longPress)
}

@objc func didLongPress(_ recognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) {
let location = recognizer.location(in: self.view)
let configuration = UIEditMenuConfiguration(identifier: nil, sourcePoint: location)

if let interaction = editMenuInteraction {
// Present the edit menu interaction.
interaction.presentEditMenu(with: configuration)
}
}

By default, an edit menu interaction generates a menu that includes commands for the standard edit actions your view implements. For more information on these actions, see `UIResponderStandardEditActions`. You can use the interaction’s delegate to add additional items to the menu and set the target rectangle to display around using methods in the `UIEditMenuInteractionDelegate` protocol. For text views, you can specify the items the menu displays for specific text ranges using methods from the `UITextViewDelegate`, `UITextFieldDelegate`, or `UITextInput` protocols.

## Topics

Class

# UIMenu

A container for grouping related menu elements in an app menu or contextual menu.

@MainActor
class UIMenu

## Overview

Create `UIMenu` objects and use them to construct the menus and submenus your app displays. You provide menus for your app when it runs on macOS, and key command elements in those menus also appear in the discoverability HUD on iPad when someone presses the Command key. You also use menus to display contextual actions in response to specific interactions with one of your views. Every menu has a title, an optional image, and an optional set of child elements. When someone selects an element from the menu, the system executes the code you provide. The code sample below illustrates adding a menu group that contains two menu elements — New and Open — to the File menu.

// Ensure that the builder is modifying the menu bar system.
guard builder.system == UIMenuSystem.main else { return }

let newDocument = UIKeyCommand(title: "New",
action: #selector(newDocument(_:)),
input: "n",
modifierFlags: .command)

let openDocument = UIKeyCommand(title: "Open...",
action: #selector(openDocument(_:)),
input: "o",
modifierFlags: .command)

// Use the .displayInline option to avoid displaying the menu as a submenu,
// and to separate it from the other menu elements using a line separator.
let newMenu = UIMenu(title: "", options: .displayInline, children: [newDocument, openDocument])

// Insert the menu item at the top of the File menu.
builder.insertChild(newMenu, atStartOfMenu: .file)

## Overview

You don’t create a menu builder object. Instead, you override `buildMenu(with:)` in your app delegate or view controller to receive a builder object. Where you override this method determines the system that the builder updates. To add and remove menus from the menu bar using the `main` menu system, override `buildMenu(with:)` in your app delegate. To build a context menu using the `context` system, override the method in your view controller.

## Overview

A menu system groups root menus together. The `main` system has only one root menu while the `context` system can have multiple root menus, each built in different `UIResponder` objects like a view controller.

Use `UIMenuSystem` in your implementation of `buildMenu(with:)` to isolate changes to a specific system.

override func buildMenu(with builder: UIMenuBuilder) {
super.buildMenu(with: builder)

// Ensure that the builder is modifying the menu bar system.
guard builder.system == UIMenuSystem.main else { return }

// ...
}

You can also use a menu system to rebuild or revalidate menus as changes occur in your app. To rebuild a menu, call the `setNeedsRebuild()` method. Call `setNeedsRevalidate()` when you need the menu system to revalidate a menu.

# UIContextMenuInteraction

An interaction object that you use to display relevant actions for your content.

@MainActor
class UIContextMenuInteraction

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

Use a `UIContextMenuInteraction` object to focus the user’s attention on a specific portion of your content, and to provide actions for the user to perform on that content. A context menu interaction object tracks Force Touch gestures on devices that support 3D Touch, and long-press gestures on devices that don’t support it. When the appropriate gesture occurs, this object animates your content to a new interface and displays the contextual menu that you supplied. UIKit manages all menu-related interactions and reports the selected action, if any, . After creating the object, assign an appropriate object to its `delegate` property and use the `addInteraction(_:)` method to attach it to one of your views. The delegate object you provide must adopt the `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate` protocol. Use the methods of that object to provide the contents of the contextual menu. Add your context menu interaction object to a view in your interface using the view’s `addInteraction(_:)` method.

@MainActor
protocol UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

Use this protocol to provide UIKit with the contextual menu that you want to display. When a `UIContextMenuInteraction` object detects an appropriate interaction, it calls the `contextMenuInteraction(_:configurationForMenuAtLocation:)` method of your delegate. You use that method to specify the basic configuration details for your interface. In addition to your contextual menu, you can tell UIKit whether you want it to display a default preview interface or a custom view controller that you provide. You can also specify options for how you want UIKit to animate the presentation and dismissal of that interface.

Class

# UIFindInteraction

An interaction that provides text finding and replacing operations using a system find panel.

@MainActor
class UIFindInteraction

## Mentioned in

Building a desktop-class iPad app

## Overview

Use a find interaction to add text-finding capabilities to your view.

When invoking the interaction, the system displays a find panel for entering a string to search, with buttons for navigating between results. When supporting replacement, this also includes a field for the text replacing matches. The find panel presents as a part of the onscreen keyboard when visible, or inline as part of the receiver’s view hierarchy.

Input from a hardware keyboard triggers a find interaction using standard system shortcuts such as Command+F for find, Command+G for find next, and Command+Shift+G for find previous. Adding the interaction also enables these commands in the menu bar on macOS when your view becomes first responder. You can also trigger the interaction by calling the `presentFindNavigator(showingReplace:)` method on the interaction object, providing access to find and replace operations programatically.

Some classes, such as `UITextView`, `WKWebView`, and `PDFView`, support built-in find interactions. To enable the interaction on these views, set `isFindInteractionEnabled` to `true`.

textView.isFindInteractionEnabled = true

To add find and replace operations to other views:

1. Create the find interaction object, passing a delegate into the default initializer.

2. Add the interaction by calling the `addInteraction(_:)` method on the view.

3. Provide a `UIFindSession` object to manage the search performed on the content displayed in the view. You return this object through the `findInteraction(_:sessionFor:)` method on the delegate.

The following example creates a find interaction for a view that presents searchable content for a document.

let document = Document(string: "")
lazy var interactionView = InteractionView(document: document)

lazy var findInteraction = UIFindInteraction(sessionDelegate: self)

override func viewDidLoad() {
super.viewDidLoad()

// Add the find interaction.
interactionView.addInteraction(findInteraction)
}

// Return a searchable object.
return UITextSearchingFindSession(searchableObject: document)
}

Implement the `UITextSearching` protocol on the class that encapsulates the searchable content for your view to use an instance of `UITextSearchingFindSession` as the session object. Alternatively, you can subclass `UIFindSession` when you want to manage the details of the session using a custom class.

## Overview

You return a session object from the delegate of a `UIFindInteraction` to manage the state, presentation, and behavior for a given search. The session object responds to navigation and replacement requests through its `highlightNextResult(in:)` and `performSingleReplacement(query:replacementString:options:)` methods. It also provides presentation information to the system find panel through `resultCount` and `highlightedResultIndex`.

UIKit can manage the state when you implement the `UITextSearching` protocol on a class that encapsulates the searchable content. To do this, create an instance of `UITextSearchingFindSession` and provide it a `searchableObject` using an instance of your class.

If you want to manage the state yourself or already have a class that implements find and replace for your app, you can subclass `UIFindSession` to bridge your custom implementation to the system UI.

Sample Code

# Add Home Screen quick actions

Expose commonly used functionality with static or dynamic 3D Touch Home Screen quick actions.

Download

Xcode 12.0+

## Overview

On the Home screen of a device running iOS 13 or later, apps can display Home Screen quick actions when users touch and hold the app icon (on a 3D Touch device, users press briefly on the icon).

Each Home Screen quick action includes a title, an icon on the left or right (depending on your app’s position on the Home Screen), and an optional subtitle. Define quick actions statically at build time from the app’s `Info.plist` or dynamically configured at runtime. For information about the types of functionality you might expose using quick actions, see the Human Interface Guidelines.

The app in this sample project is a basic contact manager that allows users to view and edit a small set of contacts. The initial view controller shows a list of contacts in a table view. Tapping any contact shows a detail screen where you can edit the name and email address, or tap to turn on the Favorite switch.

When you press the sample app’s Home Screen icon, several Home Screen quick actions are displayed. The first two give access to search and sharing functionality, and the rest provide shortcuts to favorite contacts.

### Define static quick actions

If the quick actions appropriate for an app never change, define them as static quick actions using the project’s `Info.plist` file. This sample project defines two static quick actions: one for searching and one for sharing. The `UIApplicationShortcutItems` key in the `Info.plist` file contains an array of two dictionaries that represent the two static quick actions.

The value for `UIApplicationShortcutItemType` must be a unique string that the system passes to your app when a user invokes the quick action. When processing the selected quick action, the unique item type distinguishes between the defined quick actions.

For information about other `Info.plist` keys available for configuring Home Screen quick actions, see the Information Property List Key Reference.

### Define dynamic quick actions

Dynamic quick actions depend on specific data or state of the app. Configure dynamic Home Screen quick actions by setting the `shortcutItems` property of the shared `UIApplication` instance to an array of `UIApplicationShortcutItem` objects.

Set dynamic screen quick actions at any point, but the sample sets them in the `sceneWillResignActive(_:)` function of the scene delegate. During the transition to a background state is a good time to update any dynamic quick actions, because the system executes this code before the user returns to the Home Screen.

func sceneWillResignActive(_ scene: UIScene) {
// Transform each favorite contact into a UIApplicationShortcutItem.
let application = UIApplication.shared

return UIApplicationShortcutItem(type: ActionType.favoriteAction.rawValue,
localizedTitle: contact.name,
localizedSubtitle: contact.email,
icon: UIApplicationShortcutIcon(systemImageName: "star.fill"),
userInfo: contact.quickActionUserInfo)
}
}

Don’t limit the number of quick actions provided to the `shortcutItems` property, because the system displays only the number of items that fit the screen. For this reason, the implementation of `favoriteContacts` on the `ContactsData` class returns all contacts that have the `favorite` property set to `true`.

### Define quick action icons

Define quick action icons with `UIApplicationShortcutIcon` class defined two different ways: with a template image or SF Symbol.

With a template image name:

UIApplicationShortcutIcon(type: .favorite)

With an SF Symbol name:

UIApplicationShortcutIcon(systemImageName: "star.fill")

As mentioned earlier, this sample app creates two static quick actions in its `Info.plist` with their icons set to `UIApplicationShortcutItemIconType`.

Create a quick action icon with an SF Symbol:

To support older versions of iOS, you can specify multiple icon-related keys in the app’s `Info.plist` for a given `UIApplicationShortcutItem`. iOS chooses the icon in the following order:

1. UIApplicationShortcutItemIconSymbolName

2. UIApplicationShortcutItemIconFile

3. UIApplicationShortcutItemIconType

iOS prefers the symbol name icon if it’s defined, otherwise, the icon file if defined, otherwise the last choice is the icon type.

### Pass data with a quick action

The dynamic quick actions in this sample all have the same `type` because they all perform the same action. However, the contact information associated with each is different and the sample passes it to through the `userInfo` dictionary.

var quickActionUserInfo: [String: NSSecureCoding] {
/** Encode the name of the contact into the userInfo dictionary so it can be passed
back when a quick action is triggered. Note: In the real world, it's more appropriate
to encode a unique identifier for the contact than for the name.
*/
return [ SceneDelegate.favoriteIdentifierInfoKey: self.identifier as NSSecureCoding ]
}

Static Home Screen quick actions can also pass `userInfo` data by including it in the `UIApplicationShortcutItemUserInfo` key in the app’s `Info.plist` file.

All values passed as `userInfo` must conform to `NSSecureCoding`.

### Respond to triggered quick actions

When the user triggers a Home Screen quick action, the app is notified in one of these ways:

- If the app isn’t already loaded, it’s launched and passes details of the shortcut item in through the connectionOptions parameter of the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` function.

func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
/** Process the quick action if the user selected one to launch the app.
Grab a reference to the shortcutItem to use in the scene.
*/
if let shortcutItem = connectionOptions.shortcutItem {
// Save it off for later when we become active.
savedShortCutItem = shortcutItem
}
}

- If your app is already loaded, the system calls the `windowScene(_:performActionFor:completionHandler:)` function of your scene delegate.

func windowScene(_ windowScene: UIWindowScene,
performActionFor shortcutItem: UIApplicationShortcutItem,

let handled = handleShortCutItem(shortcutItem: shortcutItem)
completionHandler(handled)
}

When this sample handles the quick action, it shows an alert, but in a real-world app the actual functionality would be executed.

### Debug quick actions on app launch

For Xcode to debug quick actions on app launch, an app needs to have the target’s scheme configured. Follow these instructions to debug quick actions at launch:

1. Build and run the app to make sure it’s installed on the device.

2. Quit the app.

3. Set a breakpoint in SceneDelegate.swift, function `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` to be used when a shortcut will be chosen by the user.

5. Select the Run Scheme, Info tab.

6. Change the Launch setting to “Wait for executable to be launched”.

7. Run the app again in Xcode (Xcode’s debugger will then wait).

8. Go to the Home Screen, tap and hold on the sample’s app icon.

9. Select a quick action shortcut.

The breakpoint will then fire.

Class

# UIApplicationShortcutItem

An application shortcut item, also called a Home Screen dynamic quick action, that specifies a user-initiated action for your app.

class UIApplicationShortcutItem

## Overview

On a device that supports 3D Touch, a person invokes the quick action by pressing your app’s icon on the Home Screen and then selecting the quick action’s title. Your app delegate receives and handles the quick action.

You must specify the characteristics of your `UIApplicationShortcutItem` instances during initialization, before you register them with your app object. The quick actions you’ve registered with your app object are immutable.

### Register an array of dynamic quick actions with your app

To register an array of Home Screen dynamic quick actions, set the value of your shared app object’s `shortcutItems` property with an `NSArray` instance containing your defined dynamic Home Screen quick actions.

### Change your app’s dynamic quick actions

To change your app’s Home Screen dynamic quick actions, replace your app object’s `shortcutItems` array by setting a new value for the property. As a convenience for working with registered quick actions, this class has a mutable subclass, `UIMutableApplicationShortcutItem`. The following code snippet illustrates one way to use the `mutableCopy()` method, along with mutable quick actions, to change the title of a dynamic Home Screen quick action:

var shortcutItems = UIApplication.shared.shortcutItems ?? []
if let existingShortcutItem = shortcutItems.first {
guard let mutableShortcutItem = existingShortcutItem.mutableCopy() as? UIMutableApplicationShortcutItem
else { preconditionFailure("Expected a UIMutableApplicationShortcutItem") }
guard let index = shortcutItems.index(of: existingShortcutItem)
else { preconditionFailure("Expected a valid index") }

mutableShortcutItem.localizedTitle = "New Title"
shortcutItems[index] = mutableShortcutItem
UIApplication.shared.shortcutItems = shortcutItems
}

UIApplicationShortcutItem *existingShortcutItem = [existingShortcutItems firstObject];

UIMutableApplicationShortcutItem *mutableShortcutItem = [existingShortcutItem mutableCopy];
NSInteger index = [existingShortcutItems indexOfObject:existingShortcutItem];
[mutableShortcutItem setLocalizedTitle: @"New Title"];
[updatedShortcutItems replaceObjectAtIndex: index withObject: mutableShortcutItem];
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setShortcutItems: updatedShortcutItems];

### Dynamic and static quick actions

Although immutable, a `UIApplicationShortcutItem` instance is considered _dynamic_ to distinguish it from a _static_ quick action you specify at build time.

- Define Home Screen _dynamic_ quick actions using this class. Your code creates dynamic quick actions, and registers them with your app object, at runtime.

- Define Home Screen _static_ quick actions in the UIApplicationShortcutItems array in your Xcode project’s `Info.plist` file, as described in the iOS Keys chapter in Information Property List Key Reference. The system registers your static quick actions when your app is installed.

The system limits the number of quick actions displayed when a user presses a Home Screen app icon. Within the limited set of displayed quick action titles, your static quick actions are shown first, starting at the topmost position in the list. If your static items don’t consume the permissible number for display and you’ve also defined dynamic quick actions using this class, then one or more of your dynamic quick actions is displayed.

### App launch and app update considerations for quick actions

When a user chooses one of your Home Screen quick actions, the system launches or resumes your app and UIKit calls the `application(_:performActionFor:completionHandler:)` method in your app delegate. Be sure to read the description of that method in `UIApplicationDelegate` for information on how to ensure the method is called only when it should be.

After a user first installs your app and before they first launch it, pressing your Home Screen icon displays only the app’s static quick actions. After first launch, your dynamic quick actions (if you’ve defined any and there’s room in the list to accommodate them) are displayed as well.

If a user installs an update for your app but hasn’t yet launched the update, pressing your Home Screen icon shows the dynamic quick actions for the previously installed version. One way to gracefully handle this scenario is to provide app version information in the `userInfo` dictionary of a quick action.

Class

# UIPencilInteraction

An interaction that tells your app when a person double-taps or squeezes Apple Pencil.

@MainActor
class UIPencilInteraction

## Overview

People can interact with certain models of Apple Pencil with a double tap or squeeze. To detect the double tap or squeeze in your app, create a `UIPencilInteraction` object with a corresponding `delegate` object. Then, add the interaction to your app’s view. When a person double-taps or squeezes Apple Pencil, the interaction calls the delegate’s corresponding `pencilInteraction(_:didReceiveTap:)` or `pencilInteraction(_:didReceiveSqueeze:)` method.

For more information, read Handling double taps from Apple Pencil and Handling squeezes from Apple Pencil.

# UIPencilHoverPose

An object that describes the hover pose of Apple Pencil during an interaction like double tap or squeeze.

@MainActor
class UIPencilHoverPose

## Overview

Use the hover pose of Apple Pencil to support more complex interactions in response to a double tap or squeeze. Information about the hover pose — such as azimuth, altitude, and hover distance — is available when a person holds a supported model of Apple Pencil close to the screen during a double tap or squeeze.

The following code example shows how to use the `location` of a hover pose to present a contextual palette near the tip of Apple Pencil.

func pencilInteraction(_ interaction: UIPencilInteraction,
didReceiveSqueeze squeeze: UIPencilInteraction.Squeeze) {
let preferredAction = UIPencilInteraction.preferredSqueezeAction

if preferredAction == .showContextualPalette, squeeze.phase == .ended {
if let anchorPoint = squeeze.hoverPose?.location {
presentContextualPalette(atLocation: anchorPoint)
}
}
}

## Topics

### Getting the hover characteristics

In macOS and iOS, users can choose to adopt a system-wide light or dark appearance. The dark appearance, known as Dark Mode, implements an interface style that many apps already adopt. Users choose the aesthetic they prefer, and can also choose to toggle their interface based on ambient lighting conditions or a specific schedule.

All apps should support both light and dark interface styles, but might perform better with a specific appearance in some places. For example, you might always adopt a light appearance for printed content.

Before you change your code, turn on Dark Mode and see how your app responds. The system does a lot of the work for you, and if your app uses standard views and controls, you might not need to make many changes. Standard views and controls automatically update their appearance to match the current interface style. If you already use color and image assets, you can add dark variants without changing your code.

### Choose adaptive colors for your UI

Choose colors that adapt automatically to the underlying interface style. Light and dark interfaces use very different color palettes. Colors that work well in a light appearance may be hard to see in a dark appearance, and vice versa. An adaptive color object returns different color values for different interface styles.

There are two ways to create adaptive color objects:

- Choose semantic colors instead of fixed color values. When configuring UI elements, choose colors with names like `labelColor`. These semantic colors convey the intended use of the color, rather than specific color values. When you use them for their intended purpose, they render with color values appropriate for the current settings. For a complete list of semantic color names, see `NSColor` and `UIColor`.

- Define custom colors in your asset catalog. When you need a specific color, create it as a color asset. In your asset, specify different color values for both light and dark appearances. You can also specify high-contrast versions of your colors.

You configure custom color assets using Xcode’s asset editor. Add a Color Set asset to your project and configure the appearance variants you want to modify. Use the Any Appearance variant to specify the color value to use on older systems that do not support Dark Mode.

To load a color value from an asset catalog, load the color by name:

// macOS
let aColor = NSColor(named: NSColor.Name("customControlColor"))

// iOS
let aColor = UIColor(named: "customControlColor")

When you create a color object from a color asset, you do not have to recreate that object when the current appearance changes. Each time you set the fill or stroke color for drawing, the color object loads the color variant that matches the current environment settings. The same is true for semantic colors such as `labelColor`, which adapt automatically to the current environment. By contrast, color objects you create using fixed component values do not adapt; you must create a new color object instead.

### Create images for all appearances

Make sure the images in your interface look good in both light and dark appearances. Interfaces use images in many places, including in buttons, image views, and custom views and controls. If an image is difficult to see when changing appearances, provide a new image asset that looks good in the other appearance. Better yet, use a symbol image or template image, which define only the shape to render and therefore do not require separate images for light, dark, and high-contrast environments.

For information about configuring images for both light and dark interfaces, see Providing images for different appearances.

### Update custom views using specific methods

When the user changes the system appearance, the system automatically asks each window and view to redraw itself. During this process, the system calls several well-known methods for both macOS and iOS, listed in the following table, to update your content. The system updates the trait environment before calling these methods, so if you make all of your appearance-sensitive changes in these methods, your app updates itself correctly.

| Class | Appropriate methods |
| --- | --- |
| `NSView` | `updateLayer()`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `draw(_:)`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `layout()`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `updateConstraints()` |
| `UIView` | `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `layoutSubviews()`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `draw(_:)`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `updateConstraints()`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `tintColorDidChange()` |
| `UIViewController` | `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `updateViewConstraints()`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `viewWillLayoutSubviews()`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `viewDidLayoutSubviews()` |
| `UIPresentationController` | `traitCollectionDidChange(_:)`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `containerViewWillLayoutSubviews()`![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/67dc4b07a8d84366d4cc0e812eb40b4a/spacer.png) `containerViewDidLayoutSubviews()` |

If you make appearance-sensitive changes outside of these methods, your app may not draw its content correctly for the current environment. The solution is to move your code into these methods. For example, instead of setting the background color of an `NSView` object’s layer at creation time, move that code to your view’s `updateLayer()` method instead, as shown in the code example below. Setting the background color at creation time might seem appropriate, but because `CGColor` objects don’t adapt, setting it at creation time leaves the view with a fixed background color that never changes. Moving your code to `updateLayer()` refreshes that background color whenever the environment changes.

override func updateLayer() {
self.layer?.backgroundColor = NSColor.textBackgroundColor.cgColor

// Other updates.
}

If your app has code that’s not part of an `NSView` and can’t use the preferred methods listed above, it can observe the app’s `effectiveAppearance` property and update `current` manually.

// Use a property to keep a reference to the key-value observation object.
var observation: NSKeyValueObservation?

func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ aNotification: Notification) {
observation = NSApp.observe(\.effectiveAppearance) { (app, _) in
app.effectiveAppearance.performAsCurrentDrawingAppearance {
// Invoke your non-view code that needs to be aware of the
// change in appearance.
}
}
}

### Choose visual-effect materials based on the intended usage

Visual-effect views add transparency to your background views, which gives your UI more visual depth than if the backgrounds were opaque. To ensure that your content remains visible, visual-effect views blur the background content subtly and add vibrancy effects to adjust the colors of your foreground content automatically. The system updates these effects dynamically, ensuring that your app’s content remains visible when the underlying content changes.

Use visual-effect views in your interface as container views, and add subviews to them to represent your foreground content. Configure each visual-effect view with the material or effects that are appropriate for the appearance you want:

- In macOS, configure an `NSVisualEffectView` with the appropriate material based on how you use that view in your interface. For example, when using a visual-effect view as the background for a sidebar interface, configure it with the `NSVisualEffectView.Material.sidebar` material.

- In iOS, configure a `UIVisualEffectView` with specific vibrancy and blur effects to create the appearance you want. Blur effects define the apparent thickness of the background view, and vibrancy effects adjust the appearance for specific types of content to ensure that they remain visible. For example, when your view contains labels, choose the `UIVibrancyEffectStyle.label` style or one of the other label-related vibrancy options.

### Opt out only as needed

Make every effort to adopt both light and dark appearances in your apps. If supporting one appearance makes no sense for all or part of your app, you can opt out of appearance changes in the appropriate windows or views. For example, you might always use a light appearance for your app’s printing views.

You can configure all or part of your interface to opt out of a specific appearance. You can also adopt a specific appearance for your entire app. For more information, see the following:

- Choosing a Specific Appearance for Your macOS App

- Choosing a specific interface style for your iOS app

### Avoid expensive tasks during appearance transitions

When the user toggles between light and dark interfaces, the system asks your app to redraw all of its content. Although the system manages the drawing process, it relies on your custom code at several points during that process. Your code must be as quick as possible and not perform tasks unrelated to the appearance change. In macOS, AppKit usually creates transition animations during appearance changes, but it aborts those animations if your app takes too long to redraw itself.

# Configurations

Specify the appearance and content of your views and cells using configurations.

## Overview

Configurations provide a lightweight way to apply content and styling to views without having to manage the rendering of the appearance yourself.

Using a configuration, you can obtain system default styling for a variety of different view states and customize that styling as needed. Then, you assign that configuration to a view that supports configurations, like `UICollectionViewCell`, or use it to create a custom content view, like `UIListContentView`. The configuration updates itself when the view’s configuration state changes, causing the view to reflect the new styling for that state.

There are two types of configurations:

- Background configurations, which let you specify background appearance for a view. For more information, see `UIBackgroundConfiguration`.

- Content configurations, which let you specify content (like image and text) and styling for that content (like tint color and padding). For list-based content, `UIListContentConfiguration` defines many customization options.

To customize the appearance of all instances of a class, use `appearance()` to get the appearance proxy for the class. For example, to modify the bar background tint color for all instances of `UINavigationBar`:

UINavigationBar.appearance().barTintColor = navBarTintColor

To customize the appearances for instances of a class when contained within an instance of a container class, or instances in a hierarchy, use `appearanceWhenContainedIn:` to get the appearance proxy for the class. For example, to modify the appearance of bar buttons, based on the object that contains the navigation bar:

let navigationBarAppearance =
UINavigationBar.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [UINavigationController.self])
navigationBarAppearance.setBackgroundImage(navBarBackgroundImage, for: .any, barMetrics: .default)

let barButtonNavigationBarAppearance =
UIBarButtonItem.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [UINavigationBar.self])
barButtonNavigationBarAppearance.setBackgroundImage(barButtonNavBarImage, for: .normal, barMetrics: .default)

let barButtonToolbarAppearance =
UIBarButtonItem.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [UIToolbar.self])
barButtonToolbarAppearance.setBackgroundImage(barButtonToolbarImage, for: .normal, barMetrics: .default)

In any given view hierarchy, the outermost appearance proxy wins. Specificity (depth of the chain) is the tie-breaker. In other words, the containment statement in `appearanceWhenContainedIn:` is treated as a partial ordering. Given a concrete ordering (actual subview hierarchy), UIKit selects the partial ordering that’s the first unique match when reading the actual hierarchy from the window down.

You can further refine which instances of a class will have their appearance customized by specifying a trait collection. Use the `appearance(for:)` and `appearanceForTraitCollection:whenContainedIn:` methods to retrieve the proxy for a class with the specified trait collection.

To support appearance customization, a class must conform to the `UIAppearanceContainer` protocol and relevant accessor methods must be marked with `UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR`.

iOSiPadOSMac CatalysttvOSvisionOS

@MainActor
protocol UIAppearanceContainer : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

To participate in the appearance proxy API, tag appearance property accessor methods in your header with `UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR`.

Appearance property accessor methods must be of the form:

func setProperty(property: PropertyType, forAxis1 axis1: IntegerType, axis2: IntegerType)

- (PropertyType)propertyForAxis1:(IntegerType)axis1 axis2:(IntegerType)axis2 … axisN:(IntegerType)axisN;
- (void)setProperty:(PropertyType)property forAxis1:(IntegerType)axis1 axis2:(IntegerType)axis2 … axisN:(IntegerType)axisN;

You may have no axes or as many as you like for any property.

The property type may be any standard iOS type: `id`, `NSInteger`, `NSUInteger`, `CGFloat`, `CGPoint`, `CGSize`, `CGRect`, `UIEdgeInsets` or `UIOffset`. Axis parameter values must be either `NSInteger` or `NSUInteger`. UIKit throws an exception if other types are used in the axes.

For example, `UIBarButtonItem` defines these methods:

- `setTitlePositionAdjustment(_:for:)`

- `backButtonBackgroundImage(for:barMetrics:)`

- `setBackButtonBackgroundImage(_:for:barMetrics:)`

# About focus interactions for Apple TV

Design and implement intuitive control schemes for menus and interactive user interface layouts.

## Overview

On iOS devices, a user interacts directly with the touchscreen. On Apple TV, a remote or other input device is used to control the interface indirectly. Focus refers to the effect onscreen of external, indirect user input from an input device. As the user navigates through the interface, the next focusable item in the direction in which the user is navigating becomes focused, which triggers a focus update. If the focused item is selectable, the user selects it with the remote. Certain items, such as tab bars, are automatically selected after a slight delay.

The UIKit framework supports focus-based interfaces only, and in most cases this behavior is automatically provided. For apps with custom user interface components, you need to implement custom focus behavior.

### Understanding the focus engine

The system within UIKit that controls focus and focus movement is called the focus engine. The focus engine listens for incoming focus-movement events in your app. When an event comes in, the focus engine automatically determines the next focusable item and notifies your app. This creates a consistent user experience across apps, provides automatic support for all current and future input methods, and helps developers concentrate on implementing their app’s unique behavior rather than defining or reinventing basic navigation.

Only the focus engine can explicitly update focus, meaning there’s no API for directly setting the focused item or moving focus in a particular direction. The focus engine updates focus only when the user sends a movement event or when the system or the app requests an update. Keep the following focus behaviors in mind when creating your layout design:

**Not all items are focusable.** If an item isn’t focusable, it’s ignored whenever focus is determined. Use the `canBecomeFocused` property to determine if an item is focusable.

**Only a single item can have focus at any given time.**

**Users change focus by selecting a direction on the remote.** UIKit then attempts to move the focus to a new user interface element in that direction. If the system finds another item that can accept focus in that direction, the found item gains focus. If no element is found in that direction, the currently focused item stays in focus and a `movementDidFailNotification` notification is broadcast.

**Only the user can directionally change focus.** Your app can’t programmatically search for a new element in a given direction. Although you can change focus programmatically, there are restrictions on how focus may change. Focus should almost always be under user control. For example, if the contents of a table view changed and the original focus element no longer exists, it’s reasonable to have your app programmatically select a new item to be in focus.

**Focus is managed by the focus environment.** When a focus environment gains focus, it can either keep the focus or give that focus to one of its own child focus environments. The focus environment it selects is its preferred focus environment. If a child focus environment is chosen, the child focus environment can also choose whether to keep focus or pass it to one of its child focus environments. This process drills down until a focus environment accepts focus for itself. The root view controller of the window also participates in the focus process. The root view controller’s `preferredFocusEnvironments` property is the first focus environment that’s selected to gain focus.

# Adding user-focusable elements to a tvOS app

Create intuitive and easily manipulated user-interactive controls for your tvOS app.

## Overview

On Apple TV, people use a remote or game controller to navigate through interface elements like movie posters, apps, or buttons, highlighting each item as they come to it. The highlighted item is said to be _focused_ or _in focus_. It appears elevated or otherwise distinct from other items. An item is considered focused when the user has highlighted it, but not selected it. The user moves focus by navigating through different UI items, which triggers a focus update.

### Add focusable items to the view

In Xcode, search the Library pane for the item you want to add to your app, and drag it to your app’s storyboard. Several UIKit elements are focusable by default, including buttons ( `UIButton`), text fields ( `UITextField`), and table cells ( `UITableViewCell`). The top-left item is in focus when your app launches. (In right-to-left languages, the top-right item is initially in focus.) You don’t need to do anything to UIKit elements that are focusable by default. However, you can add SceneKit and SpriteKit nodes as focusable elements. To make a SceneKit or SpriteKit node focusable, set the `focusBehavior` property of the node to `focusable`, as shown below.

node.focusBehavior = .focusable

### Design your layout in a grid pattern

The easiest way to ensure that focus moves between focusable items is to arrange the items in a grid pattern. Swiping on the remote triggers the focus engine—the system that controls focus and movement—to find all of the focusable items in the direction of the swipe. The first item found then becomes the newly focused item. The following image shows the items found by the focus engine when the user swipes right, and the resulting focused item.

The following image shows the items found by the focus engine when the user swipes down, and the resulting focused item.

When the focus engine doesn’t find any items in the direction of the swipe, by default the focused item doesn’t change, as shown in the following image.

When necessary, you can change the default behavior by using `UIFocusGuide` to redirect focus to other focusable items in the user interface.

Protocol

# UIFocusItem

An object that can become focused.

@MainActor
protocol UIFocusItem : UIFocusEnvironment

## Overview

An object that conforms to the `UIFocusItem` protocol is capable of participating in the focus system; further, only `UIFocusItem` objects can be focused.

Even when an object that conforms to `UIFocusItem` isn’t currently focusable, it may still have an effect on the focus system. For example, items that aren’t focusable, but that completely obscure other items, may prevent those other items from being focusable, because they aren’t visible to the user. Also, because `UIFocusItem` conforms to `UIFocusEnvironment`, items that aren’t focusable may still affect the focus behavior of items they contain, or react to focus updates.

## Topics

### Determining focusability

`var canBecomeFocused: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the item can become focused.

**Required**

`var isFocused: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the item is currently focused.

### Retrieving the item frame

`var frame: CGRect`

The geometric frame of the item.

### Determining the focus priority

`var focusGroupPriority: UIFocusGroupPriority`

The importance of the item within a focus group, used by the focus system to determine the group’s primary item.

`struct UIFocusGroupPriority`

The importance of an item within a focus group, used by the focus system to determine the group’s primary item.

### Providing movement hints

`func didHintFocusMovement(UIFocusMovementHint)`

Indicates to the currently focused item that focus movement might occur.

`class UIFocusMovementHint`

Provides movement hint information for the focused item.

### Indicating focus visually

`var focusEffect: UIFocusEffect?`

The visual effect to apply when the item becomes focused.

### Working with transparent items

`var isTransparentFocusItem: Bool`

# Creating custom navigation interactions

Build nonstandard navigation interactions that move focus to the desired location.

## Overview

For most apps, a simple layout is all that’s needed for the user to interact with your app. However, sometimes the focus engine doesn’t move focus where desired, or doesn’t move focus at all. For these situations, use the `UIFocusGuide` class to create invisible regions that redirect focus.

### Place your focusable items

Place focusable items in your app and arrange them as desired. Where possible, take advantage of the focus engine’s built-in behavior. Use a focus guide only when absolutely necessary. The following image shows a row of three buttons and a column of three buttons. Focus moves automatically between buttons in the same row or column, but the focus engine doesn’t move focus when the user swipes down from Button 2 or Button 3. However, for this layout, the goal is for Button 4 to become focused when the user swipes down.

### Add a focus guide

To get focus to move to Button 4 when the user swipes down from Button 2 or Button 3, a focus guide is required. Create a focus guide and add it to the current view. The focus guide is detectable by the focus engine and redirects focus as indicated.

let myFocusGuide = UIFocusGuide()
self.view.addLayoutGuide(myFocusGuide)

### Add constraints to the focus guide

When the user swipes down from Button 2 or Button 3, the focus should move to Button 4. To make this happen, you need to programmatically add constraints to the focus guide. The focus guide needs to be as wide as Button 2 and Button 3 combined. Set the focus guide’s left constraint to Button 2’s left constraint and its right constraint to Button 3’s right constraint. For convenience, this example sets the focus guide’s top and bottom constraints to Button 4’s top and bottom constraints. Finally, the `preferredFocusEnvironments` property is set to Button 4. The following image shows the location and size of the focus guide created using the constraints in the following code.

myFocusGuide.leftAnchor.constraint(equalTo: button_2.leftAnchor).isActive = true
myFocusGuide.rightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: button_3.rightAnchor).isActive = true
myFocusGuide.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: button_4.topAnchor).isActive = true
myFocusGuide.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: button_4.bottomAnchor).isActive = true
myFocusGuide.preferredFocusEnvironments = [button_4]

When users swipe down from Button 2 or Button 3, focus correctly redirects to Button 4.

Adding user-focusable elements to a tvOS app

Creating custom navigation interactions

## Overview

As a subclass of `UILayoutGuide`, a focus guide is not a view and does not define a new view or participate in the view hierarchy at all, except as an Auto Layout guide. Unlike `UILayoutGuide`, `UIFocusGuide` represents an invisible, focusable region that can redirect focus movement to other views. The `UIFocus.h` header file, including its related classes and its protocol, creates a single high-level software interface for controlling focus in apps that use focus-based input. This programming interface also helps to control focus behavior on the screen.

# Debugging focus issues in your app

Find errors and determine why the next focused item isn’t what you expected.

## Overview

With the use of indirect controls for your tvOS app, it’s imperative that focus works correctly. To help you find focus problems, Apple provides two debugging tools: `UIFocusLoggingEnabled` and `UIFocusDebugger`.

### Turn on live focus logging

See how the focus engine determines which view is currently in focus by turning on live focus logging. As the user moves focus, the log updates, showing how the new view came into focus.

In your Xcode project, select Edit Scheme and add `-UIFocusLoggingEnabled YES` to the Arguments Passed On Launch section.

On launch, all focus events are logged and displayed in the Xcode console and the Console app. Logs are updated as focus changes in your app.

### Find focus issues using UIFocusDebugger

The `UIFocusDebugger` class contains several methods to help you find focus issues. You don’t use this class or its methods directly from your code. Instead, during a debugging session, you call the methods of this class from the LLDB debugger command line to obtain information about the state of the focus system. For example, `po UIFocusDebugger.status()` returns the state of the focus engine.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifocusanimationcoordinator

- UIKit
- UIFocusAnimationCoordinator

Class

# UIFocusAnimationCoordinator

A coordinator of focus-related animations during a focus update.

@MainActor
class UIFocusAnimationCoordinator

## Overview

`UIFocusAnimationCoordinator` instances are always created by the system and vended to your app during a focus update, and are typically discarded after the update is complete; it is not useful to instantiate `UIFocusAnimationCoordinator` objects yourself. The `UIFocus.h` header file, including its related classes and its protocol, creates a single high-level software interface for controlling focus in apps that use focus-based input. This programming interface also helps to control focus behavior on the screen.

When a focus update occurs, two main animations happen: the previously focused view animates to an unfocused state, and the next focused view animates to a focused state. The purpose of the animation coordinator is to allow other views to coordinate their animations along with the primary animations of the previously or next focused views. Every animation added to the coordinator will run together in the same animation block, with the same timing, and options.

For example, suppose a user interface consists of an focusable image with a title underneath. When the image is focused, it will animate expanding its size to a larger, focused state, so it schedules an animation using the `UIFocusAnimationCoordinator` instance provided during the focus update. Since the image is expanding, the title should also animate its position to stay a fixed length from the expanding bottom edge of the image, so it also schedules this animation using the coordinator. Since both animations were scheduled using the coordinator, they will be run together at the end of the update to ensure they are correctly synchronized.

It is important to schedule animations using `UIFocusAnimationCoordinator` because the properties of the animation are defined by the system to achieve certain system-level behaviors. For example, when focus is moving quickly, the timing of the animations are sped up to keep up with the user’s movement. In addition, _focusing_ animations typically run faster than _unfocusing_ animations, to create a trail effect as the user moves. As such, you should never assume a fixed duration across multiple focus updates, nor should you that timing of animations for different views in different branches of the view hierarchy is the same.

If you need more control over the timing of focus-related animations, you can add a nested animation block inside the coordinated animation. This follows all the same rules as regular nested animations, meaning that the animation duration and properties are inherited. Use `UIView.AnimationOptions`– set of options- to edit as necessary. If you want to change the timing of the animation, it is recommended that you specify a duration relative to the inherited duration in `inheritedAnimationDuration` method, so that your application still benefits from the timing behaviors.

For example, in the below code listing it shows how to add a coordinated animation that should run at half the system-defined duration:

override func didUpdateFocusInContext(context: UIFocusUpdateContext, withAnimationCoordinator coordinator: UIFocusAnimationCoordinator) {
coordinator.addCoordinatedAnimations({
let duration : NSTimeInterval = UIView.inheritedAnimationDuration();
UIView.animateWithDuration((0.5*duration), delay: 0.0, options: UIViewAnimationOptions.OverrideInheritedDuration, animations: {
//add your animations
}, completion: nil)
}, completion: nil)

However, if you nest animations with different durations, note that the completion block of the `addCoordinatedAnimations(_:completion:)` method is run only after the main (inherited) animation is complete.

Class

# UIScribbleInteraction

An interaction for customizing the behavior of Scribble on text input views, or for suppressing it entirely in specific cases.

@MainActor
class UIScribbleInteraction

## Overview

By default, Scribble lets users enter text by writing directly into any editable view that implements `UITextInput`.

In apps with customized text fields, you can use the `UIScribbleInteractionDelegate` callbacks to optimize the UI for a better writing experience. For example, you can hide custom placeholders when the user starts writing, or delay focusing on the field if it moves while gaining focus.

With text views that support drawing with Apple Pencil, you’ll need to suppress Scribble on nearby text fields to keep them from taking over the Pencil events for writing.

## Topics

### Creating a Scribble interaction

`init(delegate: any UIScribbleInteractionDelegate)`

Creates a Scribble interaction that allows customizing the behavior of Scribble on text input views with the delegate you provide.

### Managing Scribble interactions

`var delegate: (any UIScribbleInteractionDelegate)?`

The object that acts as the delegate for this interaction and responds to Scribble events for text input views.

### Detecting writing

`var isHandlingWriting: Bool`

A Boolean value that indicates whether the user is actively writing in a text view.

### Expecting input from Apple Pencil

`class var isPencilInputExpected: Bool`

Protocol

# UIScribbleInteractionDelegate

Methods for customizing or suppressing Scribble behavior within text input views.

@MainActor
protocol UIScribbleInteractionDelegate : NSObjectProtocol

## Overview

By default, Scribble let users enter text by writing directly into any editable view that implement `UITextInput`. In apps with customized text fields, you can use the `UIScribbleInteractionDelegate` callbacks to optimize the UI for a better writing experience, including:

- Opting individual text fields in or out of Scribble interactions.

- Controlling how quickly a given text field responds to input, giving the view an opportunity to change its configuration, if necessary.

- Receiving notifications when the user writing begins and ends.

## Topics

### Allowing and controlling Scribble interactions

Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the delegate should allow writing at a specific location in the view.

Tells the delegate to delay focusing the text input view.

### Tracking Scribble input

`func scribbleInteractionWillBeginWriting(UIScribbleInteraction)`

Informs the delegate when the user begins writing in the view.

`func scribbleInteractionDidFinishWriting(UIScribbleInteraction)`

Informs the delegate that the user stops writing in the view, after Scribble transcribes and enters the last word.

# Customizing Writing Tools behavior for UIKit views

Modify the behavior of Writing Tools in standard iOS text views, and adjust your app’s behavior while the feature is active.

## Overview

The `UITextView` and `UITextField` classes have built-in support for Writing Tools, but you can customize how the feature works for your interface. You might choose to change how someone experiences Writing Tools in your app, or disable the feature for specific types of content. For example, you might disable Writing Tools in a view that you use to display code listings. You can also customize the type of content Writing Tools generates for your text view.

### Specifying the Writing Tools UI experience you want

Writing Tools supports both limited and complete versions of the Writing Tools experience. The limited experience keeps changes in the Writing Tools interface until the person approves them. The limited experience displays the changes inline with the rest of your view’s content. Both experiences give people the ability to accept or reject changes, but the complete experience offers a more interactive way to view those changes.

To specify the experience you want, change the value in your view’s `writingToolsBehavior` property. The system applies the best available experience to views by default, but you can specify the experience you prefer in your views. You can also disable the feature if you don’t want Writing Tools to be active in your view. To disable the feature, set the value of this property to `UIWritingToolsBehavior.none`.

### Modify your app’s behavior when Writing Tools is active

It takes time for the large language models (LLMs) of Writing Tools to suggest changes. It also takes time for someone to review the changes and approve them. While those things happen, Writing Tools might make temporary changes to your view’s content. During that time, disable any app-specific features that might interfere with the Writing Tools operation. For example, you might choose to disable cloud-based updates of your text while Writing Tools is active.

In a `UITextView` you can determine when Writing Tools is active using your delegate object. When a text view uses the complete experience, the system calls the delegate’s `textViewWritingToolsWillBegin(_:)` method before Writing Tools makes any modifications, and it calls the `textViewWritingToolsDidEnd(_:)` method after incorporating any final changes. For the limited experience, the system calls the text view’s `willPresentWritingTools()` and `didDismissWritingTools()` methods instead. Use those methods to turn off any features that might interfere with Writing Tools while it’s active.

### Specify ranges of text for Writing Tools to ignore

If you don’t want Writing Tools to modify portions of your `UITextView` object, implement the `textView(_:writingToolsIgnoredRangesInEnclosingRange:)` method in your delegate. Writing Tools calls that method for each operation, providing you with the range of text it’s considering. Use your implementation of the method to specify any subranges of text you want Writing Tools to ignore. You might use this method to prevent Writing Tools from changing code listings, proper names, or direct quotes embedded in the text.

# Adding Writing Tools support to a custom UIKit view

Add Writing Tools support, including support for inline replacement animations, to your custom iOS views that contain text.

## Overview

If you don’t use a `UITextView` or `UITextField` object in your app, you can still add Writing Tools support to other views that contain text. You might use this support when you prefer not to use the standard text views. For example, you might use it if you build your own text view using TextKit or your own proprietary text engine. The UIKit API for this support gives you access to the same Writing Tools features available in the system views, including the ability to animate changes to the text in your view.

When a person triggers the Writing Tools UI from your custom view, UIKit works with your view to evaluate the relevant text and incorporate changes. You specify the type of Writing Tools experience you want for your view. The complete experience animates changes to your view’s content directly, working with your view to create those animations. The limited experience displays changes in the Writing Tools UI, and only incorporates the final changes back into your view’s text storage. All of these interactions happen with the help of the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator` object you attach to your view.

### Add a Writing Tools coordinator to your view

A `UIWritingToolsCoordinator` object manages interactions between your view and the Writing Tools feature. In iOS, this object is a type of `UIInteraction` object, and you attach to your view only when you want to support Writing Tools. To manage your view-specific behavior, you provide a delegate object when setting up the coordinator. Your delegate provides Writing Tools with initial text to evaluate, incorporates changes, provides proofreading marks, and provides preview objects to use during animations.

Attach a coordinator object to your view, typically when creating and configuring that view. Supply a delegate object that adopts the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` protocol and has access to your view’s text content and layout information. The following example shows an extension to a custom view that creates the coordinator and initializes it with the view itself. The custom method checks to see if Writing Tools is available before creating a coordinator object and adding it to the view.

class MyTextView : UIView {
var coordinator: UIWritingToolsCoordinator?

//…
}

extension MyTextView : UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate {

func configureWritingTools() {
guard UIWritingToolsCoordinator.isWritingToolsAvailable else { return }
guard coordinator == nil else { return }

coordinator = UIWritingToolsCoordinator(delegate:self)
addInteraction(coordinator!)
}
//…
}

The presence of a coordinator object on your view causes UIKit to enable Writing Tools support for that view. When someone interacts with your view’s contextual menu, UIKit automatically adds a command to that menu to launch Writing Tools.

For a complete list of delegate methods you must implement to support Writing Tools, see `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate`.

### Configure your view’s Writing Tools behavior

When setting up Writing Tools for your view, configure your coordinator’s `preferredBehavior` property with the types of interactions you support. Writing Tools offers different levels of integration with your view’s content, which also affects how much work you need to do to support the feature. With the complete experience, you provide UIKit with more information so that it can make changes directly in your view. The limited experience pushes more interactions into the Writing Tools UI, giving you a less integrated experience, but one that’s easier to implement.

At configuration time, you also specify the types of text content your view supports using your coordinator’s `preferredResultOptions` property. The models that Writing Tools uses to evaluate your text can generate plain or formatted text. Writing Tools supports all types of output by default, but you can limit it to specific types as needed.

The following code updates the previous example method, and adds some preferred behaviors for the coordinator object. In addition to wanting the inline experience for Writing Tools interactions, the method requests that the system generate rich text and optional list-based content. Providing a specific list of result options tells Writing Tools to generate only that type of content. You might provide this information if your view doesn’t support specific types of content, like tables.

coordinator = UIWritingToolsCoordinator(delegate:self)
coordinator?.preferredBehavior = .complete
coordinator?.preferredResultOptions = [.richText, .list]
addInteraction(coordinator!)
}

The availability of Writing Tools depends on the current device, its operating system, and its readiness to execute requests. On devices with appropriate hardware, some Writing Tools features operate locally after the system downloads the required models. However, more complex requests require a network connection so the system can use Private Cloud Compute to evaluate the provided text.

### Supply your view’s text for evaluation

When someone starts Writing Tools in your view, the system asks your delegate to provide the text to evaluate. Depending on what the person wants to do, Writing Tools might ask for only the selected text or it might ask for all of your view’s text. For example, they might want to proof only the currently selected text, or they might want to proofread all of the text in your view. You provide that text from your delegate inside a context object.

A `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context` object is a data object that you fill with the requested text. Context objects provide the common ground that you and Writing Tools use to communicate throughout a single operation. For each request, you create one context object for each text-storage object that has text for Writing Tools to consider. Most views have only one text-storage object and therefore create only one context object. However, a view that uses multiple subviews to manage different parts of its content might assign separate text- storage objects to each subview. In that scenario, you create one context object for each subview that contains the requested text.

To request your view’s context object, the coordinator calls your delegate’s `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsContextsFor:completion:)` method. Use the parameters of that method to determine if Writing Tools wants all of your view’s text or only some of it. The following example creates a single context object with either the currently selected text or the view’s full text. After creating the context, the custom `storeContexts` method saves a reference to the context for subsequent tasks.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: UIWritingToolsCoordinator,
requestsContextsFor scope: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.ContextScope,

// Store the created contexts for the completion handler.
var contexts = UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context

switch scope {
case .userSelection:
let context = getContextObjectForSelection()
contexts.append(context)
break

case .fullDocument:
let context = getContextObjectForFullDocument()
contexts.append(context)
break

case .visibleArea:
let context = getContextObjectForVisibleArea()
contexts.append(context)
break

default:
break
}

// Save references to the contexts for later delegate calls.
storeContexts(contexts)

// Deliver the contexts to Writing Tools.
completion(contexts)
}

When specifying only a subset of your view’s text, provide some of the surrounding text to give Writing Tools additional content for its evaluation. As a general principle, include whole paragraphs of text in the context object, not just the currently selected text. Use the context object’s range value to identify the portion of the overall text that Writing Tools requested. For example, if you fill a context object with the current text selection and some of the surrounding text, use the context object’s `range` property to specify the location of the selected text in that object.

After you create a context object, cache any additional information that you need to map the text in your context object to the text in your view’s text storage. You need to know where the content for each context object starts, in order to update your text storage later. One option is to create a dictionary that maps the context object’s identifier to the starting location of its text in your text storage. You can use that value to adjust any context-specific ranges that Writing provides you later.

The following example shows a method that the delegate uses to create a context object for the current text selection. The method calls the custom `getSelectedTextToEvaluate` function, which returns an expanded version of the text that includes both the selection and some of the surrounding text. The method also returns the starting location of that expanded text in the view’s text storage. Because the text selection is now in the middle of the text, the method initializes the context object with a range that provides the location of only the selected text, relative to the start of `textToEvaluate`. The method saves the actual starting location in a dictionary variable, mapping the value to the context’s unique identifier.

var startingLocationsForContexts = UUID : Int

// Get the text to evaluate, which includes the text selection and some
// of the surrounding text. The method returns (NSAttributedString, Int),
// which represents the text itself, and the starting location of that
// text in the view's text storage.
let (textToEvaluate, startLocation) = getSelectedTextToEvaluate()

// Get the NSRange for the text selection, relative to the text storage.
let textSelectionRange = getTextSelectionRange()
var contextRange = textSelectionRange

// The view guarantees that startLocation is less than or equal to the
// selection range. Adjust contextRange so that location 0 corresponds
// to the first character in textToEvaluate. Keep the length the same.
contextRange.location = textSelectionRange.location - startLocation

// Create the new context object.
let context = UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context(attributedString: textToEvaluate, range: contextRange)

// Save the starting location of the text, relative to the text storage.
startingLocationsForContexts[context.identifier] = startLocation

return context
}

After you create a context object, you can use its unique identifier as a key for saving other data. The context objects you create remain in existence for the duration of the current Writing Tools operation. If the person rejects the current changes and starts a new operation, Writing Tools asks you for a new set of context objects.

### Incorporate Writing Tools changes into your view

After evaluating your view’s text, Writing Tools delivers any suggested changes to your delegate object. If your view adopts the limited experience, Writing Tools waits until the person accepts any changes before delivering them to your view. If you adopt the complete experience, Writing Tools delivers the changes before the person accepts them. If the person later rejects the changes, Writing Tools delivers a new set of changes that restore your view’s original text.

In your delegate’s `writingToolsCoordinator(_:replace:in:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` method, incorporate the specified change into your view’s text storage. Writing Tools calls this method for each distinct change it needs to make, and it might call the method multiple times with different range values for the same context object. The following simple example validates the provided range information and validates the view’s own cached information for the context object. If everything is valid, the method then calculates the correct range of text to replace and creates a transaction to perform the replacement. Before returning, the method executes the provided completion handler with the text it incorporated, if any.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: UIWritingToolsCoordinator,
replace range: NSRange,
in context: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,
proposedText replacementText: NSAttributedString,
reason: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.TextReplacementReason,
animationParameters: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.AnimationParameters?,

// Make sure there's a valid starting location in the text storage.
guard let startingLocation = startingLocationsForContexts[context.identifier]
else { completion(nil); return }
guard let textStorage = textContentStorage.textStorage else { completion(nil); return }

// Determine the correct location in the text storage.
let adjustedRange = NSRange(location: startingLocation + range.location, length: range.length)

// Update the view’s NSTextContentManager using a transaction.
textContentStorage.performEditingTransaction {
textStorage.replaceCharacters(in: adjustedRange, with: replacementText)
}

completion(replacementText)
}

After each replacement operation, update other parts of your app as needed to account for the change. An `NSTextContentManager` object automatically generates the required layout updates when you make changes using a transaction. If you need to update other parts of your interface, initiate those changes from your `writingToolsCoordinator(_:replace:in:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` method. For example, you might update a view that displays the current character count for your document. Check the `reason` parameter to determine when Writing Tools is making changes interactively, and use the provided animation parameters object to create the actual animations.

### Update your view’s selected text

When working on your view’s selected text, Writing Tools updates the text selection to account for any text updates. Use your delegate’s `writingToolsCoordinator(_:select:in:completion:)` method to update the selected text in your view. The method delivers an array of range values to allow for views to create discontiguous selections. If your view supports only a continuous range of selected characters, update your view’s selection based on the first element in the `ranges` array.

When implementing your delegate method, remember to update range values to account for offset to the start of the text in your context object. The following example creates an adjusted set of ranges by adding the starting location recorded at the start of the operation for the context object. It then passes that information to the view’s text engine to highlight the appropriate ranges of text.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: UIWritingToolsCoordinator,
select ranges: [NSValue],
in context: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,

guard let startingLocation = startingLocationsForContexts[context.identifier]
else { completion(); return }
var adjustedRanges = NSRange

for value in ranges {
let range = value.rangeValue
let newRange = NSRange(location: startingLocation + range.location, length: range.length)
adjustedRanges.append(newRange)
}

// Highlight the specified text in the view.
selectTextInDocument(adjustedRanges)
completion()
}

### Generate preview images for inline animated changes

When you choose the complete Writing Tools experience for your view, the system animates changes to your content directly in your view. The system creates animations when Writing Tools starts evaluating your text, when it removes old text, and when it inserts new text. Because the animations involve your content, you must help the system create them. At appropriate times, the coordinator asks your delegate object to perform the following tasks:

1. Create a preview image of a specific portion of your content.

2. Hide that content when the animation starts.

3. Show the content again when the animation finishes.

To create a preview image of your text, use your layout manager and a `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` to generate the image in your delegate’s `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsPreviewFor:of:in:completion:)` method. Use your layout manager to get the frame rectangle that surrounds the specified text, and configure your image renderer with the size of that rectangle. In your rendering code, configure a clipping path to limit drawing to the area that contains only the specified text, and render that text onto a clear background.

The following example shows an implementation of the `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsPreviewFor:of:in:completion:)` method that creates a preview image for the view’s text. The method relies on the view’s layout manager to get the text rectangles that surround each line of text in the specified range. It also uses the layout manager to draw the text within the block of the graphics renderer. The image renderer generates an image with the rendered text, which the method places in an image view and uses to create a `UITargetedPreview` object. Setting the frame rectangle of the image view tells Writing Tools where to place that image in the overall text view. When creating animations, Writing Tools applies the required visual effects to the provided image view instead of to the text itself.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: UIWritingToolsCoordinator,
requestsPreviewFor textAnimation: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.TextAnimation,
of range: NSRange,
in context: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,

let textRange = MyTextRange(range) // Create the view's custom subclass of NSTextRange.

if !textRange.isEmpty {
// Get the frame rectangle that encloses the text.
let textFrame = unionRect(for: textRects.map({$0.cgRectValue}))

// Create the image renderer and render the image.
let renderer = UIGraphicsImageRenderer(bounds: textFrame)
let image = renderer.image { context in
// Limit drawing to the text rectangles.
context.cgContext.clip(to: textRects.map({$0.cgRectValue}))

// Draw the specified range of text using the view's layout manager.
drawTextInRange(range)
}
// Create an image view and set its frame to match the area with the text.
let imageView = UIImageView(image:image)
imageView.frame = textFrame

// Create the targeted preview.
let parameters = UIPreviewParameters(textLineRects:
textRects.map({NSValue(cgRect: $0.cgRectValue)}))
let target = UIPreviewTarget(container: self, center: self.center)
let preview = UITargetedPreview(view: imageView, parameters: parameters, target: target)

completion(preview)
}
else {
completion(nil)
}
}

In addition to providing the initial image, use the `writingToolsCoordinator(_:prepareFor:for:in:completion:)` method to hide the specified range of text in your view. UIKit inserts the image view from your `UITargetedPreview` object into the same part of your view that contains the hidden text. Placement of the image view is important, which is why you must set its frame rectangle to the precise location of the text in your view. When the animations finish, Writing Tools calls the `writingToolsCoordinator(_:finish:for:in:completion:)` method so you can show the text in the specified range again.

### Create proofreading marks for your content

If someone chooses a proofreading option, Writing Tools evaluates your view’s text and asks you to provide proofreading marks to decorate the view. For each mark, Writing Tools asks you to provide a Bézier path that underlines the text in a particular range. The following example uses the view’s layout manager to get the bounding rectangles for the specified range of text. It then flattens those rectangles to create a line shape underneath the text and passes the resulting paths to the completion handler. The code creates separate shapes for each rectangle to account for situations where a proofreading mark extends onto multiple lines of text.

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: UIWritingToolsCoordinator,
requestsUnderlinePathsFor range: NSRange,
in context: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,

var paths = UIBezierPath
for rect in textRects.map({$0.cgRectValue}) {
let underlineHeight: CGFloat = 2
let newRect = CGRect(x: rect.origin.x, y: rect.origin.y + rect.height - (underlineHeight/2),
width: rect.width, height: underlineHeight)
paths.append(UIBezierPath(rect: newRect))
}

completion(paths)

}

In addition to providing the proofreading mark shapes, Writing Tools also asks you to provide the bounding rectangles for the text itself. Writing Tools uses these bounding rectangles to draw highlights around your text. The following example retrieves the bounding rectangles for the specified range of text and passes a Bézier path for each rectangle to the completion handler:

func writingToolsCoordinator(_ writingToolsCoordinator: UIWritingToolsCoordinator,
requestsBoundingBezierPathsFor range: NSRange,
in context: UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context,

var paths = UIBezierPath
for rect in textRects.map({$0.cgRectValue}) {
paths.append(UIBezierPath(rect: rect))
}

completion(paths)
}

### Respond to state changes

During the course of changing content, the state of the Writing Tools system changes based on what’s happening. Writing Tools starts in the inactive state, but quickly moves to other states based on the type of experience it creates. When a person accepts or rejects the changes for the current operation, Writing Tools moves ) method to respond to the following types of changes:

- Use a transition to the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.State.inactive` state to clear any cached data from the previous operation.

- Use transitions to the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.State.noninteractive` or `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.State.interactiveResting` state to determine the level of interactivity with your view.

- Use a transition to the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.State.interactiveStreaming` state to start progress controls or otherwise indicate that Writing Tools is working on the request. In addition, use transitions to and from this state to implement undo coalescing. Specifically, start a new undo group on a transition to this state, and end that undo group on a transition away from this state. Notify Writing Tools of any undo stack changes by calling the `updateRange(_:with:reason:forContextWithIdentifier:)` method.

For more information about how to handle individual states, see the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.State` type.

### Inform the coordinator of external changes to your content

When Writing Tools is active, it tracks changes to the text in your view. If you make changes to your view’s text storage while Writing Tools is active, let the system know immediately. Writing Tools tracks the changes it makes internally, so it needs to know about any external changes to make sure it delivers accurate information to your delegate object. To notify Writing Tools of any changes, use one of the following methods:

- Call the `updateRange(_:with:reason:forContextWithIdentifier:)` method if you change the text that corresponds to text in one of your context objects. Depending on the scope of your changes, Writing Tools might incorporate your changes or abort the current operation altogether.

- Call the `updateForReflowedTextInContextWithIdentifier(_:)` method to report any changes that affect your view’s layout. For example, call this method if the size of your view changes, or if you change the text that precedes what’s in one of your context objects.

## Mentioned in

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom UIKit view

## Overview

Add a `UIWritingToolsCoordinator` object to a custom view when you want to add Writing Tools support to that view. The coordinator manages interactions between your view and the Writing Tools UI and back-end capabilities. When creating a coordinator, you supply a delegate object to respond to requests from the system and provide needed information. Your delegate delivers your view’s text to Writing Tools, incorporates suggested changes back into your text storage, and supports the animations that Writing Tools creates to show the state of an operation.

Create the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator` object when setting up your UI, and initialize it with a custom object that adopts the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` protocol. Add the coordinator to your view using the `addInteraction(_:)` method. When a coordinator is present on a view, the system adds UI elements to initiate Writing Tools operations.

When defining the delegate, choose an object from your app that has access to your view and its text storage. You can adopt the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` protocol in the view itself, or in another type that your view uses to manage content. During the interactions with Writing Tools, the delegate gets and sets the contents of the view’s text storage and supports Writing Tools behaviors.

## Topics

class Context

## Mentioned in

Adding Writing Tools support to a custom UIKit view

## Overview

At the start of every Writing Tools operation, you create one or more `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Context` objects with a copy of the text you want Writing Tools to evaluate. Each Writing Tools operation starts with a call to the `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsContextsFor:completion:)` method of your `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` object. Use the parameters of that method to determine how much of your view’s text to provide. For some operations, Writing Tools asks for all of your view’s text, but in others it asks for only a portion of the text. When Writing Tools finishes its evaluation, it reports changes property of your context object to indicate what text it considered.

If your context object includes text that you don’t want Writing Tools to evaluate, add the `excludeFromWritingTools` attribute to the corresponding characters of your `NSAttributedString` object. You might add this attribute if the text string includes a code listing or readonly content that you don’t want Writing Tools to change.

## Topics

### Creating a context object

`init(attributedString: NSAttributedString, range: NSRange)`

Creates a context object with the specified attributed string and range information.

### Getting the source text details

An object you use to configure additional tasks or animations to run alongside the Writing Tools animations.

class AnimationParameters

## Overview

When Writing Tools replaces text in one of your context objects, it provides a `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.AnimationParameters` object for you to use to configure any additional animations. During a Writing Tools session, you hide the text under evaluation and provide a targeted preview of your content. Writing Tools animations changes to that preview, but you might need to provide additional animations for other parts of your view’s content. For example, you might need to animate any layout changes caused by the insertion or removal of text in other parts of your view. Use this object to configure those animations.

You don’t create a `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.AnimationParameters` object directly. Instead, the system creates one and passes it to the `UIWritingToolsCoordinator/writingToolsCoordinator(_:replaceRange:inContext:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` method of your `UIWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` object. Use that object to specify the blocks to run during and after the system animations.

## Topics

### Getting the animation values

`var duration: CGFloat`

The number of seconds it takes the system animations to run.

`var delay: CGFloat`

The number of seconds the system waits before starting its animations.

### Creating custom animations

A custom block that runs at the same time as the system animations.

# UIAccessibility

A set of methods that provides accessibility information about views and controls in an app’s user interface.

## Overview

The `UIAccessibility` informal protocol provides accessibility information about an app’s user interface elements. Assistive apps, such as VoiceOver, convey this information to users with disabilities to help them use the app.

Standard UIKit controls and views implement the `UIAccessibility` methods and are accessible to assistive apps by default. This means that if your app uses only standard controls and views, such as `UIButton`, `UISegmentedControl`, and `UITableView`, you need only supply app-specific details when the default values are incomplete. You can do this by setting these values in Interface Builder or by setting the properties in this informal protocol.

The `UIAccessibilityElement` class, which represents custom user interface objects, also implements the `UIAccessibility` informal protocol. If you create a completely custom UIView subclass, you might need to create an instance of `UIAccessibilityElement` to represent it. In this case, you’d support all the `UIAccessibility` properties to correctly set and return the accessibility element’s properties.

## Mentioned in

Supporting VoiceOver in your app

## Overview

You can use `UIAccessibilityElement` to provide information about an icon or text image that isn’t automatically accessible because it doesn’t inherit from `UIView` (or `UIControl`). A view that contains such nonview items creates an instance of `UIAccessibilityElement` to represent each item that needs to be accessible.

The properties of an accessibility element provide information about the element, such as location and current value, to an assistive application. You might need to set an element’s property even if you don’t need to create an instance of `UIAccessibilityElement` to represent it. For example, if your app includes a button with a custom icon that means “solve,” the button itself is already represented by an accessibility element because it’s a subclass of `UIButton`. However, you need to supply information for the label and hint properties because this information is unique to this button. You can do this in Interface Builder or by setting the properties in the UIAccessibility informal protocol.

# Supporting VoiceOver in your app

Add VoiceOver support to make your iOS app more accessible to users who are blind or have low vision.

## Overview

VoiceOver is a gesture-based screen reader that enables people to experience the interface on their devices without having to see the screen. People who are blind depend on VoiceOver to provide auditory feedback while using their iOS devices, but VoiceOver isn’t exclusively for users who are blind or have low vision. For example, someone prone to motion sickness might choose to turn VoiceOver on while they’re in a moving vehicle. VoiceOver assists all types of people, but those who are blind rely on VoiceOver whenever they use their devices.

With a few steps, you can make your app VoiceOver-accessible in Xcode or programmatically. By increasing accessibility, you open your app to a wider audience, and make it easier for everyone to use.

### Audit your app with VoiceOver on

Auditing reveals which elements are accessible with VoiceOver and which aren’t, and shows you if VoiceOver navigation is clear and logical. Keep track of which elements aren’t accessible, and create a list of improvements for adding better VoiceOver support.

### Navigate with VoiceOver on

To audit your app with VoiceOver on, you use VoiceOver’s unique set of gestures to navigate your app. For testing, there are five key gestures that you may use:

- Swipe left or right to navigate to the next or previous UI element.

- One-finger double-tap to activate the selected element.

- Two-finger tap to stop and resume speaking.

- Swipe up with two fingers to read everything onscreen.

- Three-finger triple-tap to turn Screen Curtain on and off.

To replicate the experience of someone who is solely relying on VoiceOver, test your app using Screen Curtain. As the name implies, Screen Curtain blacks out the entire screen. You can still navigate using VoiceOver gestures, but you can’t see the elements on the screen.

### Identify common accessibility issues

To audit your app, check that you can access every element and that the ordering of those elements is what you intend. Take note of which elements VoiceOver can or can’t access. Also, pay attention when you find it difficult to perform a task because you assume it’s reliant on visuals. For example, when you’re navigating

For elements that aren’t accessible to VoiceOver, start by improving their accessibility labels and hints. The `accessibilityLabel` property provides descriptive text that VoiceOver reads when the user selects an element, and the `accessibilityHint` property provides additional context (or actions) for the selected element.

Accessibility labels are very important because they provide the text that VoiceOver reads. A good accessibility label is short and informative. It’s important to note that a `UILabel` and an `accessibilityLabel` are different things. By default, VoiceOver reads the text for standard UIKit controls, such as `UILabel` and `UIButton`. However, these controls can also have corresponding `accessibilityLabel` properties to add more detail about the label or button.

Depending on the context, hints aren’t always necessary. In some cases, the label provides enough context. If you feel like you’re saying too much in an accessibility label, consider moving that text into a hint.

To ensure that users understand the intent of your interface, you might need to set some accessibility labels manually. You can set accessibility labels and hints in Xcode’s Identity inspector, or programmatically.

### Add accessibility labels and hints using the Identity inspector

When using standard UIKit controls, assign accessibility labels and hints in Xcode using the Identity inspector’s Accessibility pane. To improve accessibility, you make an element accessible by selecting the Accessibility Enabled option. For example, the play button in a music app might include the following label and hint:

### Add accessibility labels and hints programmatically

There are times when adding accessibility labels and hints in Xcode isn’t enough, such as when you’re working with custom UI elements that VoiceOver doesn’t automatically recognize, or if you’re using variables as part of your accessibility labels. In those situations, you need to set the accessibility labels or hints programmatically. You specify that an element is an accessibility element, and then create a corresponding accessibility label and hint.

To make your element accessible to VoiceOver programmatically, define it as an accessibility element.

score.isAccessibilityElement = true

An element’s label might not stay the same throughout the entire life cycle of your app. For example, for a counter that keeps score as you play a game, you want to change the label as the score changes. Do this programmatically by setting the accessibility label and hint.

score.accessibilityLabel = "score: \(currentScore)"
score.accessibilityHint = "Your current score"

### Simplify your accessibility information

VoiceOver reads in the direction of the device’s language. For example, VoiceOver reads English from left-to-right and it reads Arabic and Farsi from right-to-left. If you vertically stack labels in a UI, or display text in a table, VoiceOver may not read the labels in the correct order. You can programmatically group accessibility elements to ensure that VoiceOver reads them as you intend. For example, if you’re creating an app that stacks a title and a value to display a person’s name and email address, depending on their order in the interface, VoiceOver may not read those elements together. Group the elements to ensure that you’re creating a clear context.

In the image above, there are four labels on the left that VoiceOver reads from the leading to the trailing edge, in this case, left-to-right. Although every element is accessible to VoiceOver, this doesn’t provide the best user experience. On the right, VoiceOver reads the grouped labels in the intended order, which allows clear navigation.

To group the labels, create a `UIAccessibilityElement` and add the information you want to group together.

var elements = UIAccessibilityElement
let groupedElement = UIAccessibilityElement(accessibilityContainer: self)
groupedElement.accessibilityLabel = "\(nameTitle.text!), \(nameValue.text!)"
groupedElement.accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace = nameTitle.frame.union(nameValue.frame)
elements.append(groupedElement)

Including an accessibility label for each element and grouping elements allows people who depend on VoiceOver to navigate their devices and use your app.

Type Method

# requestGuidedAccessSession(enabled:completionHandler:)

Transitions the app to or from Single App mode asynchronously.

tvOS

@MainActor
static func requestGuidedAccessSession(
enabled enable: Bool,

)

## Parameters

`enable`

Specify `true` to put the device into Single App mode for this app or `false` to exit Single App mode.

`completionHandler`

The block that notifies your app of the success or failure of the operation. This block takes the following parameter:

didSucceed

If `true`, the app transitioned to or from Single App mode successfully. If `false`, the app or device is not eligible for Single App mode or there was some other error.

## Discussion

You can use this method to lock your app into Single App mode and to release it from that mode later. For example, a test-taking app might enter this mode at the beginning of a test and exit it when the user completes the test. Entering Single App mode is supported only for devices that are supervised using Mobile Device Management (MDM), and the app itself must be enabled for this mode by MDM. You must balance each call to enter Single App mode with a call to exit that mode.

Because entering or exiting Single App mode might take some time, this method executes asynchronously and notifies you of the results using the `completionHandler` block.

# UIActionSheet

A view that presents a set of alternatives for how to proceed with a task.

iOS 2.0–8.3DeprecatediPadOS 2.0–8.3DeprecatedMac Catalyst 13.1–13.1Deprecated

@MainActor
class UIActionSheet

## Overview

In apps that target versions of iOS prior to iOS 8, use the `UIActionSheet` class to present the user with a set of alternatives for how to proceed with a given task. You can also use action sheets to prompt the user to confirm a potentially dangerous action. The action sheet contains an optional title and one or more buttons, each of which corresponds to an action to take.

Use the properties and methods of this class to configure the action sheet’s message, style, and buttons before presenting it. You should also assign a delegate to your action sheet. Your delegate object is responsible for performing the action associated with any buttons when they’re tapped and should conform to the `UIActionSheetDelegate` protocol. For more information about implementing the methods of the delegate, see `UIActionSheetDelegate`.

You can present an action sheet from a toolbar, tab bar, button bar item, or from a view. This class takes the starting view and current platform into account when determining how to present the action sheet. For applications running on iPhone and iPod touch devices, the action sheet typically slides up from the bottom of the window that owns the view. For applications running on iPad devices, the action sheet is typically displayed in a popover that’s anchored to the starting view in an appropriate way. Taps outside of the popover automatically dismiss the action sheet, as do taps within any custom buttons. You can also dismiss it programmatically.

When presenting an action sheet on an iPad, there are times when you shouldn’t include a cancel button. If you’re presenting just the action sheet, the system displays the action sheet inside a popover without using an animation. Because taps outside the popover dismiss the action sheet without selecting an item, this results in a default way to cancel the sheet. Including a cancel button would therefore only cause confusion. However, if you have an existing popover and are displaying an action sheet on top of other content using an animation, a cancel button is still appropriate. For more information, see iOS Human Interface Guidelines.

### Subclassing notes

`UIActionSheet` isn’t designed to be subclassed, nor should you add views to its hierarchy. If you need to present a sheet with more customization than provided by the `UIActionSheet` API, you can create your own and present it modally with `present(_:animated:completion:)`.

@MainActor
class UILocalNotification

## Overview

The operating system is responsible for delivering local notifications at their scheduled times; the app does not have to be running for this to happen. Although local notifications are similar to remote notifications in that they are used for displaying alerts, playing sounds, and badging app icons, they are composed and delivered locally and do not require connection with remote servers.

Local notifications are primarily intended for apps with timer-based behaviors and simple calendar or to-do list apps. An app that is running in the background may also schedule a local notification to inform the user of an incoming message, chat, or update. An app can have only a limited number of scheduled notifications; the system keeps the soonest-firing 64 notifications (with automatically rescheduled notifications counting as a single notification) and discards the rest.

When you create a local notification, you must specify either a specific date or a geographic region as the trigger for delivering the notification. Date-based notifications are delivered at the day and time you specify, and allowances can be made for time zone changes as needed. Region-based notifications are delivered when the user enters or exits the specified region. In both cases, you can specify whether the notifications are one-time events or can be rescheduled and delivered again.

After creating a `UILocalNotification` object, schedule it using either the `scheduleLocalNotification(_:)` or `presentLocalNotificationNow(_:)` method of the `UIApplication` class. The `scheduleLocalNotification(_:)` method uses the fire date to schedule delivery; the `presentLocalNotificationNow(_:)` method presents the notification immediately, regardless of the value of `fireDate`. You can cancel one or more local notifications using the `cancelLocalNotification(_:)` or `cancelAllLocalNotifications()` method of the `UIApplication` object.

When the system delivers a local notification, several things can happen, depending on the app state and the type of notification. If the app is not frontmost and visible, the system displays the alert message, badges the app, and plays a sound—whatever is specified in the notification. If the notification is an alert and the user taps the action button (or, if the device is locked, drags open the action slider), the app is woken up or launched. (If the user taps one of the custom actions you specify using the `category` property, the app is woken up or launched into the background.) In its `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method, the app delegate can obtain the `UILocalNotification` object from the launch options dictionary using the `localNotification` key. The delegate can inspect the properties of the notification and, if the notification includes custom data in its `userInfo` dictionary, it can access that data and process it accordingly. On the other hand, if the local notification only badges the app icon, and the user in response launches the app, the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method is called, but no `UILocalNotification` object is included in the options dictionary. When the user selects a custom action, the app delegate’s `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:for:completionHandler:)` method is called to handle the action.

If the app is foremost and visible when the system delivers the notification, the app delegate’s `application(_:didReceive:)` is called to process the notification. Use the information in the provided `UILocalNotification` object to decide what action to take. The system does not display any alerts, badge the app’s icon, or play any sounds when the app is already frontmost.

An app is responsible for managing the badge number displayed on its icon. For example, if a text-messaging app processes all incoming messages after receiving a local notification, it should remove the icon badge by setting the `applicationIconBadgeNumber` property of the `UIApplication` object to 0.

@MainActor
class UIMenuController

## Overview

The singleton `UIMenuController` instance is referred to as the editing menu. When you make this menu visible, `UIMenuController` positions it relative to a target rectangle on the screen; this rectangle usually defines a selection. The menu appears above the target rectangle or, if there isn’t enough space for it, below it. The menu’s pointer is placed at the center of the top or bottom of the target rectangle, as appropriate. Be sure to set the tracking rectangle before you make the menu visible. You’re also responsible for detecting, tracking, and displaying selections.

The `UIResponderStandardEditActions` informal protocol declares methods that are invoked when the user taps a menu command. The `canPerformAction(_:withSender:)` method of `UIResponder` is also related to the editing menu. A responder implements this method to enable and disable commands of the editing menu just before the menu is displayed. You can force the menu commands enabled state to update by calling the `update()` method.

You can also provide your own menu items via the `menuItems` property. When you modify the menu items, you can use the `update()` method to force the menu to update its display.

@MainActor
class UIMenuItem

## Overview

Custom menu items appear in the menu after any validated system items. A `UIMenuItem` object has two properties: a title and an action selector identifying the method to invoke in the handling responder object. Targets aren’t specified; a suitable target is found via normal traversal of the responder chain. To have custom menu items appear in the editing menu, you must add them to the `menuItems` property of the `UIMenuController` object.

## Topics

### Creating a menu item

`init(title: String, action: Selector)`

Creates and returns a menu-item object initialized with the given title and action.

### Accessing menu-item attributes

`var title: String`

The title of the menu item.

`var action: Selector`

A selector identifying the method of the responder object to invoke for handling of the menu command.

@MainActor
class UIMutableUserNotificationAction

## Overview

When a notification is delivered, the system displays a button for each custom action associated with the notification. Tapping a button launches your app (either in the foreground or background) and gives you a chance to perform the indicated action. You use this class to configure the details about the button that is displayed and the information your app needs to perform the corresponding action.

To associate custom actions with a local or remote notification, create one or more instances of this class and use them to configure one or more UIMutableUserNotificationActionSettings objects. An action settings objects defines the set of actions to associate with a single notification. You register your app’s action settings objects at launch time, along with your app’s preferred notification options, using a `UIUserNotificationSettings` object.

For each action you define, you must specify whether execution of that action requires the app to be running in the foreground or background. You can also specify whether the device must be unlocked or can remain locked while the action is performed. Unlocking the device may be necessary if the action involves reading or writing files that are encrypted on disk using the system’s data protection mechanism. When the user selects an action, the system puts your app into the appropriate mode and calls your app delegate’s `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:forRemoteNotification:completionHandler:)` or `application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:for:completionHandler:)` method to perform the action.

## Topics

### Getting the action information

`var identifier: String?`

The string that you use internally to identify the action.

`var title: String?`

The localized string to use as the button title for the action.

### Configuring the action’s behavior

`var isAuthenticationRequired: Bool`

A Boolean value indicating whether the user must unlock the device before the action is performed.

`var isDestructive: Bool`

@MainActor
class UIPopoverController

## Overview

The `UIPopoverController` class is used to manage the presentation of content in a popover. You use popovers to present information temporarily. The popover content is layered on top of your existing content and the background is dimmed automatically. The popover remains visible until the user taps outside of the popover window or you explicitly dismiss it. Popover controllers are for use exclusively on iPad devices. Attempting to create one on other devices results in an exception.

To display a popover, create an instance of this class and present it using one of the appropriate methods. When initializing an instance of this class, you must specify the view controller that provides the content for the popover. Popovers normally derive their size from the view controller they present. However, you can change the size of the popover by modifying the value in the `contentSize` property or by calling the `setContentSize(_:animated:)` method. The latter approach is particularly effective if you need to animate changes to the popover’s size. The size you specify is just the preferred size for the popover’s view. The actual size may be altered to ensure that the popover fits on the screen and does not collide with the keyboard.

When displayed, taps outside of the popover window cause the popover to be dismissed automatically. To allow the user to interact with the specified views and not dismiss the popover, you can assign one or more views to the `passthroughViews` property. Taps inside the popover window do not automatically cause the popover to be dismissed. Your view and view controller code must handle actions and events inside the popover explicitly and call the `dismiss(animated:)` method as needed.

If the user rotates the device while a popover is visible, the popover controller hides the popover and then shows it again at the end of the rotation. The popover controller attempts to position the popover appropriately for you but you can also implement the `popoverController(_:willRepositionPopoverTo:in:)` method in the popover delegate to specify a new position.

You can assign a delegate to the popover to manage interactions with the popover and receive notifications about its dismissal. For information about the methods of the delegate object, see `UIPopoverControllerDelegate`.

iOS 3.0–8.0DeprecatediPadOS 3.0–8.0DeprecatedMac Catalyst 13.1–13.1Deprecated

@MainActor
class UISearchDisplayController

## Overview

You initialize a search display controller with a search bar and a view controller responsible for managing the data to be searched. When the user starts a search, the search display controller superimposes the search interface over the original view controller’s view and shows the search results in its table view.

In addition to managing the searchable data, the original view controller typically plays four more roles you need to fill when using a search display controller. Those roles are the following:

1. Data source for the search results table view ( `searchResultsDataSource`), which provides the data for the results table.

2. Delegate for the search results table view ( `searchResultsDelegate`), which responds to the user’s selection of an item in the results table.

3. Delegate for the search display controller ( `delegate`), which responds to events such the starting or ending of a search, and the showing or hiding of the search interface. As a convenience, this delegate may also be told about changes to the search string or search scope, so that the results table view can be reloaded.

4. Delegate for the search bar ( `delegate` described in `UISearchBar`), which responds to changes in search criteria.

Typically, you initialize a search display controller from a view controller (usually an instance of `UITableViewController`) that’s displaying a list. See the Simple UISearchBar with State Restoration sample code project for an example of how to configure a search display controller in Interface Builder. To perform configuration programmatically, set `self` for the search display controller’s view controller and search results data source and delegate, as shown here:

searchController = [[UISearchDisplayController alloc]\
initWithSearchBar:searchBar contentsController:self];
searchController.delegate = self;
searchController.searchResultsDataSource = self;
searchController.searchResultsDelegate = self;

If you follow this pattern, then in the table view data source and delegate methods you can check the methods’ table view argument to determine which table view is sending the message:

- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {

if (tableView == self.tableView) {
return ...;
}
// If necessary (if self is the data source for other table views),
// check whether tableView is searchController.searchResultsTableView.
return ...;
}

Starting in iOS 7.0, you can use a search display controller with a navigation bar (an instance of the `UINavigationBar` class) by configuring the search display controller’s `displaysSearchBarInNavigationBar` and `navigationItem` properties.

## Topics

### Initializing a search bar

`init(searchBar: UISearchBar, contentsController: UIViewController)`

Returns a display controller initialized with the given search bar and contents controller.

### Displaying the search Interface

`var isActive: Bool`

The visibility state of the search interface.

`func setActive(Bool, animated: Bool)`

Displays or hides the search interface, optionally with animation.

### Configuring a search bar

`var delegate: (any UISearchDisplayDelegate)?`

The controller’s delegate.

`var searchBar: UISearchBar`

The search bar.

`var searchContentsController: UIViewController`

The view controller that manages the contents being searched.

`var searchResultsTableView: UITableView`

The table view in which the search results are displayed.

`var searchResultsDataSource: (any UITableViewDataSource)?`

The data source for the table view in which the search results are displayed.

`var searchResultsDelegate: (any UITableViewDelegate)?`

The delegate for the table view in which the search results are displayed.

`var searchResultsTitle: String?`

The title for the search results view.

`var displaysSearchBarInNavigationBar: Bool`

Specifies that the navigation bar contains a search bar.

`var navigationItem: UINavigationItem?`

Represents the search display controller in a navigation controller’s navigation bar.

Schedules a document-reading or document-writing operation on a concurrent background queue.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`block`

A block that’s invoked as the task to execute on the background queue. The block returns no value and takes no parameters.

## Discussion

A typical `UIDocument` subclass — one that overrides `contents(forType:)` and `load(fromContents:ofType:)` — doesn’t need to call this method.

The default implementations of `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` and `open(completionHandler:)` call this method to serialize file access. If you override these methods and don’t call `super`, you should call this method to serialize file access on a background queue. If you directly call the `read(from:)` method, you should wrap that call in the block passed into `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)`.

A constant that indicates whether the document file is being written the first time or whether it is being overwritten. See `UIDocument.SaveOperation` for details.

`completionHandler`

A block with code that is executed when the save operation concludes. The block returns no value and has one parameter:

`success`

`true` if the save operation succeeds, otherwise `false`.

This block is invoked on the calling queue.

## Discussion

The default implementation of this method first calls the `contents(forType:)` method synchronously on the calling queue to get the document data to save. Then it calls the `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)` method on a background queue to perform the actual writing of the data to disk.

If you override this method, it’s recommended that you first call the superclass implementation of the method ( `super`). If you do not call `super`, you must do two things:

- Call `performAsynchronousFileAccess(_:)` to put the save operation on a background queue.

- In the block parameter, implement coordinated writing by using the `NSFileCoordinator` class.

- From within the coordinated write, call `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)`.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/handleerror(_:userinteractionpermitted:)

#app-main)

- handleError(\_:userInteractionPermitted:)

Instance Method

# handleError(\_:userInteractionPermitted:)

Handles an error that occurs during an attempt to read, save, or revert a document.

@MainActor
func handleError(
_ error: any Error,
userInteractionPermitted: Bool
)

## Parameters

`error`

An object encapsulating information about an error encountered in an attempt to open, save, or revert a document. The error domain is `NSCocoaErrorDomain`. The error code is one of the `enum` constants declared in `FoundationErrors.h`.

`userInteractionPermitted`

If `false`, no attempt is (or should be) made to present a modal view to the user. This value can be `false` in cases such as when a save operation fails while the application is being suspended. If this parameter is `true`, UIKit or your override may present error information to the user in a modal view and (optionally) allow the user to resolve the error.

## Discussion

Typical `UIDocument` subclasses don’t need to call or override this method. Instead, they can observe the `stateChangedNotification` notification to be notified of changes in document state. In their notification handler, they can check the value of the `documentState` property and proceed accordingly. See Resolve conflicts and handle errors for a discussion of this.

If you’re using managed documents (instances of the `UIManagedDocument` subclass), you must subclass this method and, if desired, the `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)` method. Subclassing allows your app to observe errors in saving or validation. The `stateChangedNotification` notification doesn’t contain a `userInfo` dictionary and so doesn’t convey specific error information.

If you directly call any of the advanced reading and writing methods that have an error-object parameter (for example, `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)`) and that call returns an `NSError` object by indirection, you should call this method ( `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)`), passing in the error object.

This method is called by the default implementations of `open(completionHandler:)` and `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` when `UIDocument` encounters a reading or writing error, respectively.

If you override this method and don’t invoke the superclass implementation ( `super`), you’re responsible for the following:

- Calling `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)` when you’re finished handling the error — for example, when the application doesn’t require any additional user feedback about the error.

- Implementing `userInteractionNoLongerPermitted(forError:)` to conclude error handling immediately. If `userInteractionPermitted` is `false`, you should immediately handle the error and call `finishedHandlingError(_:recovered:)` within the context of the `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)`.

## See Also

## Parameters

`error`

An error object encapsulating information about the error.

`recovered`

`true` if you recovered from the error, otherwise `false`.

## Discussion

This method is called by default when handling of an error (including any user interaction) is complete. Subclasses need to call this method only if they override `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)` and do not call the superclass implementation ( `super`). If you override this method, you must call `super`.

Instance Method

# readAdditionalContent(from:)

## Parameters

`absoluteURL`

The URL for the additional content directory in the document’s file package.

## Discussion

You override this method to read non-Core Data content from the additional content directory in the document’s file package.

If you implement this method, it’s invoked automatically by `read(from:)`.

There’s no need to invoke `super`’s implementation.

### Special considerations

Additional content isn’t supported on iCloud.

# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uimanageddocument/additionalcontent(for:)

- UIKit
- UIManagedDocument
- additionalContent(for:)

Instance Method

# additionalContent(for:)

Handles writing non-Core Data content to the additional content directory in the document’s file package.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`absoluteURL`

The URL for the additional content directory in the document’s file package.

## Return Value

An object that contains the additional content for the document at `absoluteURL`, or `nil` if there is a problem.

## Discussion

You override this method to perform to manage non-Core Data content to be stored in the additional content directory in the document’s file package.

If you implement this method, it’s invoked automatically by `contents(forType:)`. The returned object is passed to `writeAdditionalContent(_:to:originalContentsURL:)`.

There’s no need to invoke `super`’s implementation.

### Special considerations

A return value of `nil` indicates an error condition. To avoid generating an exception, you must return a value from this method. If it isn’t always the case that there will be additional content, you should return a sentinel value (for example, an `NSNull` instance) that you check for in `writeAdditionalContent(_:to:originalContentsURL:)`.

The object returned from this method is passed to `writeAdditionalContent(_:to:originalContentsURL:)`. Because `writeAdditionalContent(_:to:originalContentsURL:)` is executed on a different thread, you must ensure that the object you return is thread-safe. For example, you might return an `NSData` object containing an archive of the state you want to capture.

Additional content isn’t supported on iCloud.

Handles writing non-Core Data content to the document’s file package.

@MainActor
func writeAdditionalContent(
_ content: Any,
to absoluteURL: URL,
originalContentsURL absoluteOriginalContentsURL: URL?
) throws

## Parameters

`content`

An object that represents the additional content for the document.

This is the object returned from `additionalContent(for:)`.

`absoluteURL`

The URL to which to write the additional content.

`absoluteOriginalContentsURL`

The current URL of the document that’s being saved.

## Discussion

You override this method to perform to write non-Core Data content in the additional content directory in the document’s file package. There are several issues to consider:

- You should typically implement this method only if you also implemented `additionalContent(for:)`.

- Because this method is executed asynchronously, it’s possible that the document’s state may be different from that at which the save operation was initiated. If you need to capture the document state at save time, you should do so in `additionalContent(for:)`.

- If you implement this method, it’s invoked automatically by `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)`.

- There’s no need to invoke `super`’s implementation.

### Special considerations

Instance Method

# contents(forType:)

Returns the document data to be saved.

@MainActor

## Parameters

`typeName`

The file type of the document, a Uniform Type Identifier (UTI). This string typically derives from the `fileType` property. If you want to save the document under a different UTI, you can override the `savingFileType` method.

## Return Value

The document data to be saved, or `nil` if you cannot return document data. The returned object is typically an instance of the `NSData` class for flat files or the `FileWrapper` class for file packages. If you return `nil`, you should also return an error object in `outError`.

If you return an object other than an `NSData` or `FileWrapper` object, you must override the `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)` or `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)` method to handle the writing of data.

## Discussion

When you subclass `UIDocument`, override this method to provide UIKit with the document data for saving.

This method is called on the queue that the `save(to:for:completionHandler:)` method was called on (typically, the main queue). Writing of data occurs on a background queue. The default implementation of this method returns `nil`.

When you return a non- `nil` value in the `outError` parameter, the completion handlers for the following methods don’t get called:

- `save(to:for:completionHandler:)`

- `autosave(completionHandler:)`

- `close(completionHandler:)`

Instead, in this case, the error is available to your app in the `handleError(_:userInteractionPermitted:)` method and in the `stateChangedNotification` notification.

If you want more control over the saving operation than this method provides—for example, if you want to perform incremental writing of data — override, instead, one of the lower-level data-writing methods such as `writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)` or `writeContents(_:to:for:originalContentsURL:)`. These methods are called on a background thread.
