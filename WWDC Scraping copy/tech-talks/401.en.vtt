WEBVTT

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.735
This is a five-minute
walkthrough

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:06.073
of all the features in Safari's
browser development tool,

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:07.341
Web Inspector.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.376
Let's get started.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.711
To see Web Inspector,

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:13.914
first you will need
to enable the Develop menu.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.649
To enable the Develop menu,

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.719
click Preferences
in the Safari menu.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.554
Go to the Advanced section,

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:23.323
and check the check box
at the bottom of the section

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:26.059
to enable Develop options.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.061
After enabling these options,

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.932
press "Command + Option + I"
to open Web Inspector,

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.801
or choose
the Show Web Inspector option

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.604
from the Develop menu.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.909
Web Inspector's tools
are split into tabs.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.143
You can dismiss tabs

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:46.880
and add them back
with the plus tab.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.751
Across the bottom of every tab
is a console bar.

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.920
Click Escape
to expand this bar

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.590
into a mini console window.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.495
On the sides are two sidebars
for Navigation and Details.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:02.596
The Navigation bar

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:06.566
has its own filter
at the bottom of the window.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.202
Choosing something
in the Navigation sidebar

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.239
changes the content
of the main content area

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.008
and the Details sidebar.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:19.012
Each sidebar
can be shown or hidden.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.082
Then there's
the main content area.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.584
This area saves
your navigation history

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.254
so you can move back
and forward.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.389
There's also
a selection path bar,

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.426
which shows the entire path
of the current resource.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.863
Across the top of your tabs

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:40.133
is the toolbar
with docking options,

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.370
a refresh button,
a download button,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.505
a dashboard of page statistics,

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:49.109
a global search bar,
to search across all resources,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.979
and an element selection button.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.480
If you select an element,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.782
you will be taken
to our first tab,

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.517
the Elements tab.

00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:02.856
The Elements tab's main content
is an editable DOM tree outline.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:06.159
The Details sidebar
has three sections.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.160
The Nodes section

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.398
shows additional information
relating to the selected node.

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:14.701
The Styles section
has three views:

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:19.072
Computed, Rules, and Visual.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:22.709
Styles lets you view and edit
CSS properties.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.012
The layers section
shows information

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:29.616
about any compositing layers
related to the selected element.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.518
You can navigate
and edit the DOM

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.954
using the jump bar.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:37.057
Across the top
is a series of buttons

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:39.226
to enable
the print style sheet,

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:43.096

show compositing borders,

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:46.099
and enable paint flashing.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.402
Next is the Network tab.

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:52.773
This tab shows all the resources
loaded by the current webpage.

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.875
In addition
to the default tab features,

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.376
there are buttons

00:02:56.376 --> 00:03:00.514
to disable the cache
and clear network items.

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:04.017
To see headers,
check the Details sidebar.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.553
To see the selected resource,

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:12.059
click on the jump arrow
next to the list item.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.294
Next is the Resources tab.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:16.129
This tab, like the Network tab

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.801
also shows a list of resources
and has default tab features.

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.569
In addition,
it has three buttons

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.638
to examine your code.

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.974
The pretty print tool
unminifies your code.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:30.944
Type profiling
annotates objects in your code

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.380
with color-coded types.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.951
Code coverage dims code
that hasn't been executed.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.986
The Timelines tab
helps you check

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.689
the performance
of your webpage.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.225
Select your instruments
and record events

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:49.296
like a reload operation
with the record timeline button.

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:50.497
Once you stop recording,

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.566
you can examine
your timeline data

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:56.636
either by events
or captured frames.

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:57.637
For more details,

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.773

The Debugger controls

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:31.071
and pause, continue,
and step through your code,

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:34.374
are in the top left corner
of the tab.

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.810
The Storage tab shows
a persistent state

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.846
that is available
to web content being inspected,

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.815
which can be refreshed.

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:43.717

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:03.036
this tab has buttons.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:06.806
To filter the console log,
