WEBVTT

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.330
Hello and thank you for joining us.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.560
In this presentation,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.840
we'll discuss how you can implement Family Sharing

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.203
for your subscriptions and non-consumable in-app purchases.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.840
I'm Bryan and I'm part of the App Store Monetization Team,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.420
and I'm joined by Hemant, a developer advocate

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.013
on the App Store Commerce Team.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.539
Today, I'll be giving you an overview

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.223
of Family Sharing for in-app purchases.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.060
I'll then discuss the benefits of the feature

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.360
and give you some tips to make the most of it.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.593
Finally, Hemant will discuss engineering and implementation.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.043
So let's get started.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.480
As a reminder, Family Sharing is a powerful tool

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.220
that makes it easy for customers

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.250
to share their digital purchases with their family members

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.980
across all of their Apple devices.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.580
We launched it in 2014, and since then,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.980
Family Sharing has become an important part

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.030
of the Apple ecosystem, bringing content and services

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
to more customers and more devices than ever before.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.603
And we've expanded these capabilities

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:11.790
to StoreKit as part of our ongoing investment

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.873
in Family Sharing.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.490
And that's what today's session is all about,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.260
getting started with Family Sharing

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.570
for your auto-renewable subscriptions

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.913
and non-consumable in-app purchases.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.270
In addition to being available

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.300
for both subscriptions and non-consumables,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.370
Family Sharing enables Purchase Sharing

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.050
with up to five family members

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.363
included in a customer's family group.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.290
As a developer, you can choose to implement it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.080
on existing SKUs or create new ones

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.943
specifically for Family Sharing.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.070
It's easy to implement within App Store Connect

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.610
and it provides a streamlined, convenient user experience

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.793
that can help you improve your monetization KPIs.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.050
So how will Family Sharing for in-app purchases

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.360
help impact your business?

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.300
It helps in four key areas,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.380
subscriber growth, increased engagement,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.000
and reduction in churn,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.453
which all add up to a higher customer lifetime value.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.350
Here's how these metrics work together

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.213
using Michael as an example.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.120
Family Sharing can be a compelling way

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.860
to grow your subscriber base

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.440
and attract Michael to your product.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.990
Once you've acquired Michael as a subscriber,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.550
he can extend his subscription

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.530
to the rest of his family members,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.570
which ultimately multiplies the number

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.483
of customer touchpoints to your service and app.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.820
And with the whole family now engaging with your product,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.830
a compelling content offering

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.350
combined with effective engagement marketing

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.300
can keep them coming back,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.328
and the overall effect of incremental users

00:02:53.328 --> 00:02:56.310
getting value from your product and service

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.753
is reduction of churn.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.190
And customers love Family Sharing too

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.260
because it enables them to share purchases

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.090
with their family members.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.670
It's been engineered alongside iOS

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.570
to offer a seamless and easy to use out-of-box experience

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.303
that's consistent across devices and apps.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.330
It's built with privacy in mind

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.850
and eliminates the need for password sharing

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.740
because each family member receives

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.860
their own entitlement to a purchase.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.880
And finally, Family Sharing adds value to in-app purchases

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.720
by offering up to six entitlements instead of one.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.510
This gives customers the ability to extend the number

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.970
of people with access to a purchase

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.813
and gives each family member a personalized app experience.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.761
Now, let's talk about how customers and developers

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.803
can make the most of the feature.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.250
Customers must first create a family group

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.150
in order to begin using Family Sharing for in-app purchases.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.400
One adult in a household can do this

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.460
by inviting up to five of their family members to join

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.590
using their Apple IDs.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.140
Each family member uses their own account

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.010
so their experience stays personalized and private.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.444
And each family member will then get instant access

00:04:13.444 --> 00:04:16.050
to the group's subscriptions and content

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.850
that is eligible for sharing

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.743
once the family group is created.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.840
Let's take a look at how customers manage

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.380
their sharing preferences within the Settings app.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.450
This is the Manage Subscriptions page

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.700
where customers can view all of the products

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.323
they're currently subscribed to.

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:38.550
The Share With Family toggle at the bottom of the page

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.440
allows them to choose whether or not

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.820
they automatically share

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.613
Family Sharing enabled SKUs moving forward.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.880
This toggle is turned on by default

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.793
but customers can choose to opt out at any time.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.350
Selecting any of the listed apps will allow you

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.926
to edit purchases and choose whether Family Sharing

00:04:57.926 --> 00:05:02.130
is turned on or off for a specific subscription.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.660
The initial setting is based

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.400
on the Share with Family preference

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.560
in the image on the left.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.620
Customers can also come here to opt into Family Sharing

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.623
if it becomes available for an existing subscription.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.550
These are the steps family groups

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.930
would need to take to share

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.600
their family shared subscriptions.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.714
Family Sharing is enabled automatically

00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:27.363
for any new purchases of family shared subscriptions.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.060
When existing subscriptions

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.430
become available for Family Sharing,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.161
the original purchaser has to opt

00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:36.900
into sharing within settings.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.540
This is to ensure the customer fully acknowledges

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.033
the updates to their subscription's terms.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.779
While we highly encourage you to message the availability

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:51.270
of Family Sharing through your own marketing channels,

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.670
there are two use cases where the App Store

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.713
will message customers directly.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.130
Purchasers will receive a push notification

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.260
when Family Sharing becomes available

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.780
on an existing subscription SKU,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.574
and push notifications will also be sent to customers

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:10.560
that purchase a new Family Sharing enabled SKU

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.240
but have previously turned off

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.490
the share with Family Main Toggle

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.430
within the Manage Subscriptions page.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.740
These push notifications will link customers

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.070
to the edit subscriptions page for that specific app

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.360
where they can choose to share it

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.160
with the rest of their family group.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.040
and the process is slightly different

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.070
for non-consumable in-app purchases.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.050
Family Sharing of non-consumables

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.920
is automatically enabled for both new and existing purchases

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.803
as long as Purchase Sharing is enabled in iCloud.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.370
The family is sharing purchases and the app

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.353
is not hidden from purchase history.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.248
Family members will automatically have access

00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:51.960
to the content of the new purchases

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.970
but when Family Sharing becomes available

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.070
on an existing purchase,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.810
family members will have to select

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.260
the Restore purchase button in order to unlock the content

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.363
that has newly become available to them.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.973
This is the screen which includes the Share Purchases

00:07:06.973 --> 00:07:10.170
with Family toggle, which must be turned on

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.353
in order to share the non-consumable with family members.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.190
This page can be found by selecting Apple ID

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.960
followed by Family Sharing,

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.753
then Purchase Sharing within the Settings app.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.820
There are a number of ways

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.890
to make your Family Sharing functionality

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.533
as discoverable and engaging as possible.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.560
App Store Connect makes it easy

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.563
to turn on family sharing for all of your customers.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.590
Consider including the functionality

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.178
in your onboarding flow to clearly communicate

00:07:40.178 --> 00:07:42.179
the ability to share your subscription

00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:44.430
with your family members as part

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.893
of the overall service value proposition.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.490
It's also possible to offer Family Sharing

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.920
as a separate subscription tier.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.898
This purchase flow clearly differentiates

00:07:54.898 --> 00:07:58.500
between the available tiers and includes a link out

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.630
to the Family Sharing overview page

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.073
at the bottom of the screen.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.820
If you do choose to offer Family Sharing

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.830
as a higher tier of service,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.840
remember to group the higher tier

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.383
with the individual tier or tiers in App Store Connect.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.860
This will allow you to offer upgrade messaging,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.480
like this in-app example,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.242
which highlights the value of upgrading

00:08:20.242 --> 00:08:23.853
an individual subscriber's plan to the family tier.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.010
After a new family member completes their purchase,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.140
consider marketing the functionality

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.390
to remind them to encourage their family members

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.400
to take advantage of the service

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.933
as shown here on the left.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.810
And on the right, you can see a message

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.190
for the family members

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.253
communicating that they now have access to the subscription.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.340
Hemant will walk you through how to recognize

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.340
a family member and unlock access seamlessly

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.983
so they can start enjoying your service right away.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.660
And here's a live example from Night Sky.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.040
They're offering Family Sharing

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.623
to all their customers on an existing SKU.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.602
On the left, you can see how they've clearly

00:09:04.602 --> 00:09:07.890
highlighted Family Sharing within their signup flow

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.683
and promote that it's available at no extra cost.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.740
And on the right, you can see they've given

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.100
the feature a dedicated page

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.930
within their post-purchase subscriber onboarding carousel

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.850
that encourages new plan owners

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.713
to take advantage of the benefits.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.490
Here's a summary of a few items to keep in mind

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.343
when reviewing implementation plans with your team.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.880
Consider the incremental value Family Sharing

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.220
could provide to your in-app purchases

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.870
and how you could use the feature

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.213
to bring new subscribers to your service,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.510
decide whether you'll enable Family Sharing

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.493
on a new or existing SKU,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.660
and work with your product and marketing teams

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.950
to create merchandising

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.754
that helps you encourage new subscribers

00:09:51.754 --> 00:09:54.120
and increase engagement with your service

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.323
through Family Sharing.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.410
I'll now hand it over to Hemant

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.683
to discuss engineering and implementation of the feature.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.100
Thank you, Bryan. Hi everyone.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.443
I'm Hemant from the App Store Commerce Team.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.795
I'm here today to share with you some engineering

00:10:10.795 --> 00:10:13.890
and implementation details to consider

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.893
when adopting Family Sharing for in-app purchases.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.850
We have three sections to cover.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.370
We'll start with enabling Family Sharing

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.010
per product in App Store Connect.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.290
Then I'll discuss how your application

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.540
will be able to entitle service

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.823
for the family members of a purchaser.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.170
And I'll finish up with what's available in StoreKit

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.160
and our App Store server notifications for Family Sharing.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.648
So let's begin with enabling Family Sharing.

00:10:44.648 --> 00:10:47.040
To start, you'll visit App Store Connect

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.518
and navigate to the subscription

00:10:48.518 --> 00:10:52.800
or non-consumable product that you wish to enable.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.420
You'll see a new section labeled Family Sharing

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.353
with an option to turn on.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.610
A confirmation dialogue will be shown.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.113
And once you select Confirm,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.020
your product will be family shareable

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.700
for all your customers,

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.343
new and existing, within a few hours.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.410
Now we do want to emphasize that once enabled

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.173
for a given product, this cannot be reverted.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.980
This is because customers may have based

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.803
their purchasing decision on this functionality.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.820
Once enabled in App Store Connect,

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.940
StoreKit will now return the property

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.733
as family shareable for any products you have enabled.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.620
This property is available in both StoreKit 2

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.943
and original StoreKit.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.323
You'll recognize this as shown earlier by Bryan.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.830
This is the property you will need

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.760
to allow dynamically controlling Family Sharing specific UI

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.023
within your application.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.523
And this is available from iOS 14 and later.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.320
On screen is some sample code of how your application

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.060
could make use of the property

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.043
from the StoreKit product object.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.550
The isFamilyShareable property

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.790
is a simple Boolean allowing you to identify

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.760
and merchandise family shareable products

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.713
with custom UI or copy.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.540
This property is also available in sandbox

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.643
and our Xcode testing environments,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.960
and this allows you to easily test any experience changes

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.263
you wish to make for a product that is family shareable.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.120
Now, let's dive deeper into how Family Sharing works

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.323
for the family member.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.930
The great news is, Family Sharing works the same way

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.443
your server and application are going to be familiar with.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.730
Your application will likely already handle

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.610
this family transactions without making any changes,

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.730
either server side or client side.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.940
And this is because automatically these purchases

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.433
are available to all the family members.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.120
So when your application is launched,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.510
you'll see a transaction available via StoreKit,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.013
just like normal purchase.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.000
This allows you to validate that each family member

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.670
is entitled to access to a subscription

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.973
or a non-consumable product using their own Apple ID.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.010
With our assumption that your app will work

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.653
for family members without any changes,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.400
let's review some key best practices

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.530
that ensures your application

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.043
delivers an optimal experience in all scenarios.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.670
Whatever version of StoreKit you're using,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.180
it is critical to listen out for transaction at launch

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.363
and to continue to do so throughout the lifetime of the app.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.953
This will ensure your app never misses a transaction.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.570
This is also important for other scenarios

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:05.520
such as Ask to Buy, PSD2, or subscription offer codes

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.973
where a transaction may be finalized outside of your app.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.860
Before you merchandise any products to the customer,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.750
it is another best practice

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.183
to ensure you know their status first.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.620
You can do this by interacting with StoreKit directly

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.053
or by retrieving and validating their receipt.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.360
You can determine if they have past purchases

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.280
that you need to entitle,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.400
and in the scenario where this is a new customer,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.803
you can merchandise to them appropriately.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.860
With these two best practices,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.050
you can reduce customer escalation,

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.170
minimize refunds, negative reviews,

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.113
and ultimately improve the customer experience.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.930
For a deeper dive on this subject, check out the session

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.583
from WWDC Implement Proactive In-App Purchase Restore.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.610
Now, let's illustrate what a new purchase look like

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.223
for a family members and their devices.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.720
The purchaser initiates a purchase

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.123
on their device just like normal.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.780
As this product is family shareable,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.783
transaction will be created for each family member.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.130
If you're following our best practices,

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.282
your application will see this new transaction

00:15:28.282 --> 00:15:32.613
upon launch or in real time from StoreKit.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.390
At this point, you can validate

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.453
and entitle service like any other transaction.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.070
One thing to note, we have implemented a delay

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.603
for the family transaction.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.710
This delay allows the purchaser

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.983
time to disable Family Sharing if they choose to do so.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.970
Let's take the same illustration,

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.313
but for an existing subscription purchase.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.110
As mentioned earlier, for existing purchases,

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.933
Family Sharing is not enabled by default.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.220
The purchaser would need to enable Family Sharing

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.260
from the Manage Subscription page

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.273
for each existing subscription.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.370
Once enabled, the transaction for each family members

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.623
would be created shortly thereafter.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.320
The ownership type property available in StoreKit

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.410
and our server API allows you to distinguish

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.053
between the purchaser and the family member.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.070
As Bryan shared earlier, if your application

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.740
wanted to have a custom onboarding experience

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.063
for family members, then this is the property you would use,

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.120
or this could be helpful

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.310
if you wanted to identify a customer

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.223
who has the ability to manage the subscription,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.793
then you would look for the value purchased.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.470
The property can be found within the objects

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.420
of each transaction,

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.003
and are also available in the app receipt.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.193
Next up, handling subscriber events.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.180
There are unique scenarios to be aware of

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.360
as there are times you may need to revoke access

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:23.360
from a family member, such as when a purchaser

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.610
has disabled Family Sharing completely

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.060
or perhaps the purchaser has received a refund

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.940
for the subscription or a non-consumable.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.640
Finally, it may be the case that either

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.340
of the family member or the purchaser

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.773
is no longer part of the family unit.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.470
To account for the scenarios,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.410
we have the information you need via StoreKit

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.780
in iOS 14 and later

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.213
and from our App Store server notification.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.550
Let's take a look at how you would check for this scenario

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.813
in this code example.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.490
As you receive updates for your transaction

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.890
from your transaction listener,

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.690
you should check for the presence

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.613
of the revocationDate property.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.750
This tells you this transaction has been revoked

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.830
and the customer is no longer entitled to the product.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.350
However, it is important to note

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.390
that there could be other transaction

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.560
that entitle customers to the same or different products,

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.950
so you should check and make sure the customer

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.413
is receiving what they are paying for.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.280
If you're still using original StoreKit,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.620
you need to use a callback method

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.717
called didRevokeEntitlementsForProductIdentifiers.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.900
This is the same signal that some entitlements

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.270
may have changed for this customers

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.433
and you should verify their status.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.750
In addition, we have an App Store server

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.780
notification type called Revoke.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.840
This real time server to server notification

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.280
is an indication

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.360
that there may have been changes to entitlements.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.140
This notification is available for both version one

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.780
and version two notifications.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.380
So when you receive either of this callbacks,

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.043
it is important to reestablish the correct entitlements,

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.913
meaning it's important to iterate

00:19:22.913 --> 00:19:25.860
through the entire transaction history

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.860
as these customers may have had multiple entitlements.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.810
So if one has been revoked,

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.410
there maybe another transaction entitling the customer

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.363
for the same or a different product.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.110
By doing this, in those cases,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.933
you're going to ensure there is no service interruption.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.320
So let's briefly review

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.010
the App Store server notification types we have today.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.833
Here, we have a list of the V2 notification,

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.380
and the great news is,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.200
you'll get all the relevant lifecycle notification

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.500
for the family members you would expect to receive

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.350
in order to keep those customer entitlements

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.093
up to date on your server.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.830
And we'll omit the ones that are exclusively relevant

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.733
to the purchaser.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.870
If you're still using V1 notification,

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.333
we'll get the equivalent lifecycle updates too.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.790
Also, if you have not already added your server endpoint

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.630
in App Store Connect, you can do so at any time

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.270
and experiment in the sandbox environment

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.950
to help you develop support

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.743
for this important lifecycle updates.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.390
Finally, let's cover what's available

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.033
in sales and trends section in App Store Connect.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.190
With the subscription report, you may have questions,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.450
such as, How many paid subscriptions do I have by product?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.533
Or how many customers have access including family members?

00:21:00.681 --> 00:21:02.880
Available in the subscription report

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.353
is the subscriber column.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.930
This column will provide you the count of customers

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.960
who have access to the subscription.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.510
This includes the primary subscribers

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.853
and any entitled family members.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.080
Note that this field is only populated

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.640
if the record represents

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.733
more than three active subscriptions for your product.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.020
To close out today, we would like to encourage you

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.870
to consider Family Sharing functionality

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.933
with either your new or existing products.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.130
You should clearly communicate Family Sharing availability

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.560
and its value proposition.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.710
Remember, Family Sharing provides customer privacy

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.173
and can help reduce credential sharing.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.430
You can also find guidance on in-app purchases,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.883
including subscriptions, on the Apple Developer website.
