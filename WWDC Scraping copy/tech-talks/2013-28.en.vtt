WEBVTT

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.490
All right, you guys.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.340
We're going to get going.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.960
Try to get everyone out of here on time.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.380
So my name is Mike Stern.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.600
I am a user experience
evangelist with Apple.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.380
And thanks for sticking through to
the end of the day to watch my talk.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.700
So today I want to talk to
you about UI design for games.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.000
And the session of the
title is iOS 7 Games.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.600
And we'll talk a little bit about iOS 7.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.780
But for a large part of this
presentation here in the beginning,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.840
I'm just going to talk
about general UI advice.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.620
Stuff that was relevant at
any point in time for iOS.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.160
Now, as an evangelist,
I spent a lot of time working with

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.540
developers of both games and apps.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.680
And in particular,
when I talk to game developers,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.010
I'm always really interested to
look out for how they take the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.790
theme of the game that they have,
the motif, the style of it,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.930
and apply it to solving interaction
design problems for their game

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.520
and all the different screens
that people are going to see.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.900
It's always really surprising
and interesting to see what

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.900
kind of things result from that.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.310
Olo is a really good example of this.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.100
When you go to the menu,
you simply tap anywhere on the screen and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.040
the board splits open to reveal the menu.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.720
You can pinch it, close,
or tap to close it again.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.960
That's a completely non-standard
interaction design paradigm.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.360
We don't have anything like that
anywhere else for our built-in apps,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.280
let's say.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.680
But it's totally
appropriate for this game.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.300
It makes perfect sense for the
way the game board is designed.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.300
It's very clever, it's really unique,
and it works well.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.920
And they take the style of that game and
they apply it to every screen that you're

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130
going to see when you play the game.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.790
Let's look at another example.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.940
This is a game called Beat Sneak.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.400
It has a very unique and
coherent design motif to it.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.300
And that style is applied
to all sorts of screens,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.570
from the pause screen to
the level chooser and every

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.700
other screen that you'll see.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.730
And this kind of heavy UI customization
for games is something that

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.700
at Apple we really appreciate.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.700
It's great.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.690
It brings a lot of
diversity to the platform,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.690
a lot of variety and
creativity to that experience.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.380
So we totally encourage that.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.120
Here's another example.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.600
This is Badland.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.350
Won an ADA, an Apple Design Award,
earlier this year.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.680
And part of the reason
why it did is because,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.360
as you can see, the artwork for this
game is totally stunning.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.640
And they take that artwork,
they take that great

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.840
attention to visual detail,
and they apply it to

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.740
everything in the game.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.600
The pause screen and the level chooser.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.200
Here's another example,
completely different style, yet again,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.600
this is Ridiculous Fishing,
also an ADA winner.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.710
And again, you can see how thoroughly
the UI has been customized.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.890
These games,
the games that you guys make,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.450
they should be completely
immersive experiences.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.260
They should be worlds
that people can escape to,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.420
get lost in.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.710
But in order for that to happen,
the experience must be consistent.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.340
So when we complete a
level in Tiny Wings,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.550
you expect to see something
that looks like this.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.380
Not something that looks like that.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.080
That just looks like it's not finished,
even though those are totally

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.870
standard UI kit elements
that have been placed here.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.660
But even if your game
looks totally custom,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.740
it should behave in a way that
matches other iOS apps and games.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.430
It's really important.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.010
So for example,
even if you have a button that

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.160
looks like a plank of wood,
it should still behave like

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.740
any other button does on iOS.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.730
So when you press it,
it should highlight immediately.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.780
And when you release your finger or
slide your finger off of the button,

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.750
it should go back to its normal,
non-highlighted state.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:37.000
[ Transcript missing ]

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.750
Or when you press the button and
you slide your finger off of it,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.750
it'll stay in its active state.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.840
That's a problem because you feel like
you're trapped into pressing this button.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.740
How do you bail out?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.450
How do you escape?

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.830
How do you not press this
button at this point?

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.030
So these kind of inconsistent
interaction behaviors,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.180
like just with this button,
this is just one small

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.420
example of a larger thing,
which is that if you

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.790
don't match iOS behaviors,
people are going to get confused

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.010
and frustrated using your game.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:31.900
[ Transcript missing ]

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:50.580
: I'm here today to provide
some basic guidance to you guys

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.360
about how to make this happen.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.170
Much of this guidance is tailored
to you as game developers,

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.280
but to be honest,
I've provided this type of advice

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.480
to non-game app developers as well.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.990
This advice applies to any iOS app,
whether it's a game or not.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.040
The purpose of matching standard
iOS conventions is that it's going

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.300
to make your game more intuitive.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.860
And the purpose of that is the
more intuitive your game is,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.030
the more enjoyable it's
going to be to play.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.740
Which is really what it's all about,
right?

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.680
This simple thing.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.140
This is ultimately the
goal for all of us,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.610
for all of you in this room.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.140
To maximize enjoyment.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.070
So let's dive in.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.560
Talk about some examples of how to make
the UI for your games really great.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.780
So the first and most important thing,
and Alan actually talked about this

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.680
quite a bit in the previous discussion.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.100
John talked about this
earlier this morning.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.390
But I'm just going to reiterate
this because it's so important.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.840
That is you're designing for touch.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:07.060
iOS is not a desktop where you're
using a keyboard or trackpad or a

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.440
mouse to interact with the game.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.110
And it's not a gaming console
where you're dependent upon

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.780
using a game controller.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.430
And we see lots of games that
try to recreate desktop or gaming

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:26.010
console mechanics by superimposing
buttons over the game or a D-pad.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.010
And typically this
doesn't work very well.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.610
It's not necessary.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.460
Adding these elements gets in the
way of your ability to see the game.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.780
And unlike physical buttons,
unlike a physical D-pad,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.460
you can't feel when your
finger is over the button or

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.450
the D-pad and when it's not.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.610
So as much as possible,
you want to design for

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.470
direct manipulation.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.640
So for example,
if we want to take this paddle here and

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.920
move it to the right side of the screen,
we simply drag it to

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.480
where we want it to go to.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.480
Or we tap a location on the screen.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.440
and have it just go there.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:10.610
We use the movement of the device
to control things in the interface.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.160
By the way,
I just want to take a quick moment.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.240
You're going to see a lot of this game.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.730
It's not a real game.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.740
I designed it for today's presentation.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.530
It's called Paddlemania 3000.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.880
It's not coming to an app store near you.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.420
All right, let's keep going.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.180
So, as you know,
we now have the ability to

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.420
connect to game controllers.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.650
And that's great for
controlling gameplay,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.100
but avoid forcing people to interact
with the UI using a game controller.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.900
It's often not going to be
clear what button does what.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.950
Which of these physical buttons
relates to which button on screen.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.180
Do these buttons quit and resume?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.440
Are these buttons?

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.100
No one knows.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.100
In fact, people may accidentally press
those buttons without realizing

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.600
that they actually will either
quit the game or resume gameplay.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.740
If you want to quit the
game or resume gameplay,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.320
if you want to press one of
those buttons on the screen,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.560
it's much, much easier to just press one
of those buttons on the screen.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:38.800
[ Transcript missing ]

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.900
It's much easier to just press the thing
that you're interested in pressing.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.240
So always go for direct manipulation.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.130
Always make sure that the
touchscreen experience is

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.040
really great and at the center.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.100
Let's move on to gestures.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.600
Gestures are the primary way that
we interact with everything on iOS.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.200
And to use an iOS device,
all you really need to know are a half

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.910
dozen really simple gestures like tap,
pan, swipe, pinch, rotate, long press.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.490
And these gestures work
because they're intuitive.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.990
And so many of the apps that we interact
with on a daily basis support these

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.810
gestures in a very consistent way.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.450
So it's all become very deeply ingrained.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.030
It's all very intuitive.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.200
Not that much to remember.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.030
So with that in mind,
here's a few tips about how

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.990
to use gestures successfully.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.290
First and foremost,
match iOS behavior and performance.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.340
This is a big one.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.560
I can't stress this enough.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.040
When basic gestures like pinching
and dragging don't work exactly

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.270
like they do in other iOS apps,
we start to feel like

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.420
something isn't quite right.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.520
So for example--

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.600
In a second,
I'm going to drag this paddle

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.860
over to the right-hand side.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.510
And as I do so,
my expectation is that it's going to

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.500
stay directly underneath my finger.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.750
If it doesn't do that,
it undermines that sense

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.200
of direct manipulation.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.080
I don't feel like I'm actually
dragging the paddle anywhere.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.060
Similarly,
if I do exactly the same thing and

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.440
it takes a while for the paddle
to go to where I want it to go,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.770
it also undermines direct manipulation,
makes the game or the

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.170
app feel really sluggish.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.030
It's a bad performance.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.160
You want to make sure that touch
interactions are really responsive.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.700
Next up, we want to avoid remapping.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.140
So this is really jarring.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.880
When an app or a game has a gesture,
uses a standard gesture

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.480
to do an uncommon thing.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.900
So for example,
we understand that pinching

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.000
is used to scale objects.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:08.670
So it would be strange if a simple tap
was how we zoomed in and zoomed out.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.990
Next up, prefer gestures to buttons.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.060
So don't use buttons for interactions
which could be more intuitively

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.160
performed using a gesture.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.760
So for example, scrolling.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.840
You don't need up and
down buttons to scroll.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.110
It's much easier to just
swipe on the screen to scroll.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.560
Consider plus and minus
buttons for zooming.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.900
You see this every once in a while.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.480
Explicit controls for zooming
are typically not necessary.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:51.880
: I'm going to go ahead
and start the presentation.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.810
No matter how your game looks,
I'm going to kind of repeat myself here,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.700
but it's important.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.750
UI elements should function in
intuitive and predictable ways,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.500
meaning they should match,
they should be consistent

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.420
with how iOS controls behave.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.660
So if you have things like
buttons or scroll views or alerts,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.040
you want to make sure that you're doing
a good job recreating the expected

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.290
behaviors that players of your game have.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.890
So let's talk about six different
types of controls and views

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.690
that are really commonplace.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.080
And I want to start
with the most basic one,

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.810
the most common UI element,
which is a button.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.550
Now, this is going to sound really
basic and at the risk of

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.750
insulting everyone's intelligence,
I'm just going to put it out there

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:47.670
that it's really a lot easier to press
a big button than a small button.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.110
I know, it's very profound.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.640
Based on our experience
and extensive testing,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.340
we've determined that you want to
make sure that a button is at least

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.400
44 points tall and 44 points wide.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.980
If it's any smaller than that,
there's a high likelihood that

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.400
your finger is going to be
completely covering the button.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.200
So you're not going to be able to target
it accurately and you're not going to

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.330
know if you pressed the right button.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.740
Now this play button, this is really big.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.790
So it's easy,
super easy to target it accurately.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.390
And when we press it,
we know that we've pressed it

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.480
because it has a very clear
and obvious highlight state.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.710
Clear and obvious highlight states
are not to be taken lightly.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.990
These are really important because,
again, it's a touchscreen device.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.720
There could be a lot of things around it.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.030
And you want to make sure that people
know that they pressed the right thing.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.230
Now here we have a much smaller button.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.750
And if we were to use the
same highlight state for that,

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.140
you could see there's a bit of a problem.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.320
It's too small.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.840
The finger could be covering
most or all of that button.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.530
So that's a problem.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.780
The same highlight state that
works for a large control doesn't

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.640
work so well for a small control.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.680
So in these situations,
consider having a highlight state

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.540
that is extraordinarily obvious and
is expanded beyond the bounds of

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.830
the button artwork so that you know
even if your finger is completely

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.220
covering the button as you press it,
you're going to get that instantaneous

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.250
confirmation that you pressed the
thing that you had intended to press.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.440
So let's move on to alerts.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.700
Now, with alerts,
when you give people choices,

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.050
it's really important that the
options that you're presenting

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.480
to them make it obvious what the
outcome of those actions will be.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.100
So let's say, for example,
in Paddlemania 3000,

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.500
we've earned this Mega Paddle upgrade,
or we're asked for confirmation if we

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.260
want to buy this Mega Paddle upgrade,
and the options that are

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.850
presented to me are no or yes.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.340
Well, that's okay.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.090
That's not terrible.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.420
I can read the question,
sort of understand what those

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.300
potential answers are going to be.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.600
But it's not a great design.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.550
A much better design would be
to replace those labels with

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.000
something more descriptive.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.560
So in this case,
this is a much better design.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.860
The options for action
are much more clear.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.830
You want to try to figure out
how you can use the labels of the

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.990
buttons that you're presenting to
people in such a way that they're

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.960
reinforcing the way you've phrased
the question that you've asked them.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.280
So here we see that we're being
asked if we want to buy something

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.220
and then the button label is buy.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:33.920
So I don't have to second guess or
do any kind of interpretation to know

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.410
which option is going to do which thing.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.540
Also, the order that you show buttons
in is incredibly important.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:48.240
On iOS, the button on the right
is the affirmative action.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.990
We're going to answer the
question by saying yes.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.000
It's also typically the default action,
the most likely one.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.560
But there is a big exception to this.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:05.000
If the default action or the affirmative
action is also a destructive action,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.970
meaning it's going to throw away data
or throw away your progress in the game,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.900
you want to make sure that it's
not on the right-hand side.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.900
A lot of people will just press the
option on the right because they trust

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.840
it's the thing that they're going
to want to do or the safest thing.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.020
So you want to move it and put
it over on the left-hand side.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.360
Also, the design of the button
is really important.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.150
The design of the button can help to
suggest which option is the default one,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:37.130
the one that you as the game developer
are encouraging people to press.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.540
Right now, or previously,
those buttons were exactly the same.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.410
These are much better button
designs because the one on

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.080
the right is so much stronger.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.570
It seems like it's the one
that people should select.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.900
The best alerts are really
succinct but descriptive.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.120
So this is a good alert.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.530
Game's over.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.280
That's all I need to say to people.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.500
And the buttons are also really succinct.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.910
Go to the menu.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.100
Play again.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.440
It's perfectly acceptable
to use sentence fragments.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.900
You're not trying to
write war and peace here.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.510
Long messages like this
are tedious to read.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.740
People want to play your game.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.230
Reading a lot of text and alerts
and other parts of the UI will

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.200
prevent them from doing that.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.340
So it's not a very good experience.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.700
You want to offer choices
that are relevant to people,

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.200
match the things that they want to do.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.600
So here, the game's ended.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.450
I can go to the menu or I can play again.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.790
Makes perfect sense.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.040
If we presented these options,
it wouldn't be what I wanted to do.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.740
So this is not a very good experience.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.710
And make sure that you use labels
that people really understand easily.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.730
Menu, play again, totally get it.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.820
Those are really easy
to understand labels.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.130
Now if I had some labels that
matched the theme of the game,

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:03.840
which is this futuristic theme,
it might match that theme,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.140
but it makes no sense whatsoever.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:11.500
It would take a lot of interpretation
to understand what's being said here.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.540
You also want to make sure not
to give people too many choices.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.530
You ask a simple question and you give
people two very clearly distinct options,

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.290
two very different options.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.850
If you just put a third option in there,
all of a sudden you wind up

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.230
having to think a lot more
about what's being asked of you.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.730
It's really going to slow you down
and be hard for you to proceed.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.890
And just as important,
having too few options

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.080
can be really frustrating.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.750
If people feel like they're railroaded
into a certain course of action,

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.090
they're going to feel
limited and frustrated.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.900
So we've unlocked this new paddle
and I only have one option.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.490
I have to upgrade.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:51.100
It's not so good.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.630
This is a much better UI because
I'm being given a choice.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:01.120
Also, some messages do not
require user confirmation.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.030
I won.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.450
I got it.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.440
OK.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.800
I'm likely to be concentrating
and looking at the screen

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.720
at this very point in time,
right after I finished a level.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.130
So I'll see that I won.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.260
I know it.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:22.680
Also, avoid showing multiple alerts or
dialogues at one point in time.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.070
So here we're on a pause screen,
and I'm going to press

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.340
the restart button,
and I'm going to be shown another alert,

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.920
which asks me,
am I sure I want to restart?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.340
And as I talked about before,
that's actually kind of a good thing.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.190
You want to make sure if someone
pressed that button accidentally,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.060
they're going to lose all the
progress that they made in the game.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.090
So you want to be sure
they want to restart.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.860
But if you do that by just
layering on top another alert,

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.410
I don't know why,
but I see this all the time in games,

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.630
you can wind up having five or more
options presented at one point in time.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.040
And here we see restart twice,
and it can be confusing for people

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.150
which one they're supposed to press.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.560
So I'm going to press restart,
and restart and play

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.570
there in the background,
they have the same appearance.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:09.570
They have the same default appearance.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:20.200
[ Transcript missing ]

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.860
Never, ever,
ever show a close button on an alert.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.270
This is totally unnecessary.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.730
For one thing, usually in an alert,
one of the buttons is actually

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.790
just going to close it.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.430
In fact, sorry,
all of the buttons in the alert

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.200
are going to close the alert.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.760
So you don't need to show a close button.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.640
It's ambiguous.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.170
No one's going to know what's going to
happen if they just close the alert.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:56.100
Okay, let's talk about scroll
views a little more.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.210
So earlier I talked about the
importance of using gestures and

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.790
not buttons for scroll views.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.310
I've actually used a lot of games
that show a scroll bar on the

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.530
right hand side and sometimes that
scroll bar looks big enough and it

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.160
looks like I can interact with it.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.060
But if you go and you press
your finger on the scroll

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.920
thumb and try to drag it down,
you realize that it's

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.440
actually not a control.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.760
Or if it was a control,
it wouldn't work very well.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.710
It would be too coarse of an
adjustment and the list would scroll

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.640
way too quickly or way too slowly.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:39.790
Now, scroll bars, there's a reason why we
don't have them in iOS.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:39.790
For regular UIKit apps,
they don't work well.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:45.530
Now I think the reason why people
show scroll bars is because they want

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.760
to tell players of the game or users
of the app that they can scroll,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.260
that there's more stuff below.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.590
And I think that's understandable,
but luckily there's a

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.200
few solutions for that.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.360
So the first one is you can quickly
flash a scroll bar when you come

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.830
to a screen that has a scroll view.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.250
Or when you press anywhere on the screen,
you show that scroll bar.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.400
And that's what we do
in a lot of our apps.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:13.040
Or you can adjust the spacing of the
items in the scroll list so that the

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.260
last thing is partially off screen.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.000
And because of that,
you imagine that there's more,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.170
and you intuitively know how to see
the rest of the stuff in that list.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.520
Similar to that,
you can fade out the scroll

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.520
view at the very bottom.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.050
It's very similar to
the previous technique.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.460
It lets you know that there's
going to be something else

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.100
beyond the bottom of the screen.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.830
Next up, let's talk about popovers.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.710
So popovers are these transient
views that we use to display

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.470
additional information or controls.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:55.400
[ Transcript missing ]

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.260
That arrow is very important.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.320
It makes it clear what
the popover relates to.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.360
So with that in mind,
it's pretty important that the arrow is

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.360
pointing at the thing that it relates to,
not close to the thing

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.140
that it relates to.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:22.410
I'm going to show you a little
bit about the UI design.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:29.690
I'm going to show you a little
bit about the UI design.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.690
I'm going to show you a little
bit about the UI design.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:43.700
[ Transcript missing ]

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.430
So now we know that if we press
about or help or top scores or store,

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:55.630
it's not going to give us the about
popover or take us to help or show

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.160
us the top scores or go to the store.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.860
It's just going to close the popover.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:20.400
[ Transcript missing ]

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.260
And then press it again
and press it again.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.340
It shouldn't just make new
instantiations of the popover.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.790
Try this on your favorite game.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.100
You may find that it does exactly this.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.470
Obviously,
the problem with this is you don't need

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.700
multiple instances of this popover.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.310
And you're going to have to literally
tap outside of it multiple times

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:48.230
to close the popover or all the
popovers that you've created.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.120
It's terrible.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:00.030
And also, one more thing,
you do not need a close

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.060
button in a popover.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.530
As I said before,
tapping anywhere outside of

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.000
the popover should dismiss it,
or even oftentimes tapping

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.710
something inside of the
popover should also dismiss it.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.740
Let's move on to page controls.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.310
So page controls are
used widely in games.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.240
See them all the time for
in-app purchase screens,

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:25.400
or level choosers,
or instruction screens.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.060
But many times, of course,
they're not actual UI kit page controls,

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.180
but rather a reproduction of one.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.980
They're not a very good
reproduction either.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.300
If you're going to
reproduce this control,

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.060
you want to pay attention to the details
of how it works and get it right.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.320
So here's some important
ones to keep in mind.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.350
Page control is all about swiping.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.700
You do not need the
arrows for page control.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.650
It's not necessary to do that.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.530
So get rid of them.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.180
Awesome flame transition.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.370
So one reason I think that
people add these arrows is

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.040
because they want to tell people,
you know,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.950
you can increment one at a time.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.840
But you don't really need that.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.610
In fact,
you can press on either side of those

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.870
dots to go to the next or previous thing,
item.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.400
And make sure that you accurately
reproduce the swiping behavior.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.400
So there, I just grabbed the next item,
I dragged it a little ways,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.400
but I didn't drag it
far enough to select it,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.400
so it moved back.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.400
Didn't change my selection.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.400
That's the correct behavior.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.400
Now, if I drag it a little bit further,

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.680
It will snap forward
to the next selection.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.430
That's the correct behavior.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.340
And notice that the thing I was
dragging while my finger was touching

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.270
the screen was always staying
directly underneath my finger.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.000
Let's do that again and see what
the wrong behavior looks like.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.540
So I'm going to press my
finger down on the screen.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.720
I'm going to slide it a bit to the left.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:08.460
Without lifting my finger,
the next item is going to get selected.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.960
This prevents me from
changing my mind mid-course.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.120
It's like the interface is being too
eager to change to the next thing,

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.980
and it undermines the sense
of direct manipulation.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.260
Finally, progress indicators.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.080
I know this is what you've
all been waiting for.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.640
So.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.880
No one likes waiting, right?

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.650
But it's just a fact of life.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.900
People have to wait sometimes.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.060
When your game makes people wait
for more than a few seconds,

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.910
if you're not showing any kind of
feedback that something is occurring,

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.620
they're going to begin to
wonder what's going on.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.540
How long are they going
to be waiting for?

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.150
Another few seconds?

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.610
A couple minutes?

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.590
A couple of hours?

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.800
Did the game crash?

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.030
So here's a couple successful
tips for showing good,

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:04.600
accurate progress feedback.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.580
If people will only be waiting
for a short period of time,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.040
just show a simple activity
indicator like this.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.210
Let them know that something is going on,
something is happening.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.110
But if it's gonna take, oh, and also,

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.060
Even if this is kind
of a little bit boring,

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.370
honestly, this is much better for a game,
right?

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.850
Take this as an opportunity
to entertain people,

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.610
to do something kind
of adorable and cute.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.720
or you can take this
time to educate people.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.460
So again, this is the game Badland.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.440
This loading screen is providing tips
and tricks about how to use the game.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.920
So they're making a valuable
use of people's time.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.810
When people are going to be
waiting for longer periods of time,

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.230
you want to provide specific
information about how long

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.900
something is going to take.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.330
Get creative with your loading screens.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.650
Now this is from Plants vs.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:54.140
Zombies.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.720
It's totally stylized.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.140
Matches the motif of the game.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.660
Here's a different
example from Cut the Rope.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.920
This is the progress bar that
you see when you're about to

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.420
go play a level in the game.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.780
They use this box knife
to cut open the level.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.500
And then when you leave the level,
go back to the main menu,

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.700
they tape it back up again.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.080
All right?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.930
It's thematic, it's clever,
and it's informative.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.020
And for tasks that are really
going to take a while to complete,

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.030
it's really important to let
people know how long they're going

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:31.420
to be waiting for and to give
them the option of bailing out,

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.170
of canceling, not completing the task.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.200
Maybe they don't have
enough time to wait,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.110
or maybe they don't want to
wait for whatever it is that

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.180
you're going to be doing.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.910
Give them the option.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.220
Let's switch gears a little bit.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:49.830
It's also really important to
be self-consistent in your game.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.260
This goes for every
aspect of your design.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:57.520
So for example,
I recently saw this in a game

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.400
where there was a close button.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.160
They were showing this ad,
and there was a close

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.400
button to dismiss it.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.170
But every time I saw the ad,
they were picking a different

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.550
place for that close button.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.850
It's like they couldn't decide
what the best place was,

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.160
so they just decided
to go with all of them,

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.680
which made it really
unpredictable and confusing,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.500
because of course,
I wanted to press the close button and

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.280
not buy their other game that they make.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.730
Another form of self-consistency
is with iconography.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.880
There's many examples of this,
but I'm just going to call out a few.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:34.420
So here we have this hand-drawn
border for this button,

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.740
and then we have this really
clean geometric shape for the

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.610
icon that's inside of that border.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.240
But they don't match each other.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.320
They should either both
be clean and geometric,

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.180
or they should both look hand-drawn.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.660
This is a bit of a stretch,
but it's also possible to be

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.810
too consistent with yourself.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.360
So if you have an icon for
play that looks too much like

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.080
your icon for next level,
it's going to confuse people,

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.320
even if the icons have a
slightly different treatment.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.180
A clearer distinction between
the icons is going to be much

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.370
easier for people to parse.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.500
Now I really want to switch gears.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:20.520
So, done talking about matching standard
behavior for iOS apps and games.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:25.520
I want to talk a little bit specifically
about UI design challenges that

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.570
I think are really particular to games.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:35.400
So when I was preparing the talk,
I started thinking,

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.420
one of the most important things
for a game is to be a good teacher.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:45.030
Now, when someone gets a new game,
they don't know how to play it,

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.800
they don't know what
their objectives are,

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:51.150
they have few, if any,
strategies for winning

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.270
the game and succeeding.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.210
So think about that.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.020
Be sympathetic.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.050
Give people help getting started.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.380
If they don't get that kind of help,
they're going to get frustrated,

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.650
they're going to quit,
and they're going to delete your game,

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.110
and you'll never see them again.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.420
There's plenty of games
out there to play.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.210
Now the best tutorials make learning fun.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.280
They're easy to follow,
they provide instructions

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:22.270
about key game mechanics,
and they set a mood and establish a plot.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.840
Plants vs.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.970
Zombies is a game that
I encourage you to look at.

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.450
I think they really get it right.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:33.060
And when you download the game,
the first thing you see is a

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.330
choice to go through the tutorial.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:40.480
You can either skip over this lesson
or go through and play the tutorial.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.150
And that's really important
to give people that option.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.080
It's pretty much impossible
to predict whether someone

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.750
has played your game before.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.040
Maybe their buddy had
that game on the iPad.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.630
So he already knows how to play the game.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.200
It's a smart idea to
give people an option.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.560
So let's go through the tutorial.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:07.740
Now, this tutorial is basically just a
simplified version of this game.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.180
And the approach is great because it's
going to teach beginners in context,

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.810
not through an abstraction.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:18.460
You're told how to perform an action,
and then you're asked to practice it.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.200
And the game confirms each success
in learning about how to play.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.680
It's a positive and it's
a rewarding experience.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.810
And it's fun.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.480
You don't feel like you're learning.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.470
You feel like you're playing the game.

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.350
And in Plants vs.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.550
Zombies, there is a lot to teach.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.810
Just getting to know each of
the characters is a pretty

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.700
time consuming process.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:42.650
There's a lot of characters.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.840
There's sunflowers and coins and
shovels and plants that explode

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.460
and plants that shoot things.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.160
And of course there's zombies.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.140
And each of these characters
has a different role to play,

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:57.540
has unique capabilities,
has unique vulnerabilities,

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.220
has different motivations.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:06.090
The tutorial uses a technique that we in
the UI world call progressive disclosure.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:12.200
This is a game that's really simple,
but it's also a game that keeps

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:12.780
people from feeling overwhelmed
at any one point in time.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.200
So characters like this walnut,
they appear one at a time,

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.720
and when they're introduced to you,
the game is giving you a brief

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.200
description about what that
character's capabilities are.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.610
And when you start playing,
you don't have a whole horde

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.170
of zombies coming at you from
all different directions.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:34.110
Gameplay is initially simplified by
having just one row on the board.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.680
So it's a lot easier to see the
zombies coming at you and deal

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.200
with the situation at hand.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.540
Cut the Rope is another good case study.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:49.640
They use a technique called coaching
tips to explain what the objective is,

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.900
deliver candy to Om Nom.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.860
And they use coaching tips to provide
instructions about the game mechanic,

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.510
to swipe your finger to cut the rope.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.940
Each new game mechanic is
introduced one at a time,

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.350
and each time a coaching
tip is displayed.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.250
Tips are shown before
and during gameplay,

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:18.500
and they also introduce interface
elements at appropriate moments.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.170
You can feel that the onboarding
experience was very well thought through.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.320
Game mechanics, again,
are introduced one at a time.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.740
Gameplay is initially very easy,
so you feel good about your

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.780
ability to play the game.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.540
And by completing each level,
you're effectively demonstrating that

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:41.600
you're ready for more instructions
and increasingly difficult challenges.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.840
But most importantly,
you're always learning by playing.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.460
You're always having fun.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:55.040
By contrast, I've seen way too many games
that do something like this.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.680
This is totally overwhelming.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:00.440
It's way too much information
to process at one time,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.940
and you're never going to remember
everything which is being told to you.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:10.600
Another common technique is to display
a series of images with instructions.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:14.440
And typically these give you way
too much information at once.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.590
There's no way that people are going
to remember all of this information

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.480
that you're communicating to them.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:20.880
And it's overwhelming.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.750
Instead of playing the game,
you're being asked to work.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:31.270
Just as bad as being overloaded
with too many instructions is

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:36.280
being asked to go through an
elaborate configuration process.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.360
New players do not understand
how your game works,

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:43.640
so it's premature to ask them
questions about how they want to

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.780
customize their gaming experience.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:52.820
Again, the goal of all of you should
be to maximize enjoyment.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.820
If people get excited
about playing your game,

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.820
they're going to be inclined to start
customizing it to create a richer

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.930
and more personalized experience.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.880
Now, above all,
make sure people's first experience

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.160
with your game is amazing.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:15.360
Whether that experience is a
tutorial or customization even,

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.370
or just diving in and playing the game,
your game needs to be fun and

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.980
entertaining from the very beginning.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.160
If, on the other hand,
your game is boring or

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.360
confusing or overwhelming,

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:37.320
People are going to assume that your game
is boring and confusing and overwhelming.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.000
And rightfully so.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.290
Next up, wait to ask for feedback.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.540
So when you leave here tonight,
imagine that you go to a restaurant,

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.790
you're really hungry because
we kept you here way past 6:00,

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.520
and you're thirsty.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.990
So you want some food and drink.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.180
You want the waiter to bring you a menu.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.310
But instead he comes over and he says,
hey,

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:04.640
the manager of the restaurant wants us
to have you fill out this survey to tell

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.200
you what you think about the restaurant.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.100
Right?

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.690
What are you going to say?

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.100
Nice silverware?

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.350
Nice ambiance?

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.660
Nice lighting?

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.760
you don't know anything
about the restaurant.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.090
In fact, you're annoyed at being
asked that question.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.420
Right?

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.950
Because you're hungry, you're thirsty.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.880
Now I know this is a bit
of a ridiculous example,

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.760
but it's totally applicable
for apps and games.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.340
When a game asks players to
provide feedback before they've

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.100
really gotten to know the game,
they're not going to write

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.420
a very substantive review.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.160
And they're probably going
to be annoyed at being asked

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.810
to provide feedback so early.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.840
And it's kind of self-defeating.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.810
You actually want to ask people
for feedback if they've been

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.300
playing your game for a while.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.340
Because if they've been
playing your game for a while,

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:56.690
they probably like your game more than
the average person who downloaded it.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.790
Thank you.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.930
And also advertise thoughtfully.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.840
So people who play PaddleMania 3000,
they love PaddleMania 3000.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.130
Call themselves PaddleManiacs.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.630
Great.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.330
I love them.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.700
So, it's understandable that
if I make a new game,

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:18.300
I'm going to want to
advertise that to them.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.740
Do you want to talk to
them about Cosmic Paddle?

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.140
They might be interested in that.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.550
But you want to exercise good judgment.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.180
People are going to get annoyed if you
overwhelm your own game's interface

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.220
with a bunch of advertisements.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.840
It's going to take them
out of the experience,

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.220
and it undermines that
engagement that you're trying

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.670
to work so hard to establish.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:46.600
And also, don't try to trick people
into clicking on ads.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:51.020
Now, I've seen this a number of times,
and maybe it's just a sheer coincidence.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.220
But I'm looking at a
menu screen like this,

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.080
and I'm about to press the Play button.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.980
And right before I do, up pops an ad.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.480
And off to the app store I go.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.960
I don't really want to buy this game,
and it's just totally annoying.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.280
So this is just one example.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.940
There's many others.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.450
But you don't want to
try to trick people.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.210
You don't want to be deceptive.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.440
Respect the people who play your game.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.540
Now Cut the Rope, I think,
does a pretty good job

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.530
of advertising to people.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:26.400
So we're in the level chooser screen,
and over on the left-hand side,

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.870
we see these little
things poking out there.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:31.600
And if we swipe over
to see what those are,

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:34.350
they're ads in the level chooser.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.870
A little unexpected, but OK.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.540
They're innocuous,
and I kind of understand that

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.980
they're ads for other games,
and I can choose to tap those or not.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.010
And additionally, on the menu screen,
there's a little ring

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.430
there connected to a rope.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:54.730
And if I pull that down,
I'll see another promotion.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.760
So clearly,
they're not shy about advertising

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:04.800
to the people that play their game,
but they're not trying to deceive people

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:11.390
into pressing one of those advertisements
and purchasing the other games they make.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:20.050
And also,
it's really important to not cut corners.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:23.340
You want to have high
quality in your games,

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.600
high production value.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:30.750
A big part of what makes games
great are the awesome graphics,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.660
the beautiful sounds,

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.240
But games with really
great source material,

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.410
really great artwork and sound
design can be hampered by really

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.520
easy to avoid production mistakes.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.700
Here's some quick tips for making sure
that you put your best foot forward.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.020
First up, design for retina displays.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:55.630
It's really important to use artwork
that's the correct resolution.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.590
It's high resolution.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:59.100
It looks great on a retina screen.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.620
Low resolution graphics will make
your game look fuzzy or jagged.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.220
Yes, we know that those graphics
take up more space,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.740
but they're worth it.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.860
They show off all the great artistry
and care and time and attention that

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.280
went into the design of your game.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.900
Next, don't stretch graphics.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.540
So let's say we have this button
that we designed for our game,

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.000
but we have another button
which has a longer title,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.910
so we need it to be wider.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.600
So what do we do?

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.560
Well,
if we just stretched it as one piece,

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.000
it would look terrible.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.970
The rounding on those corners
doesn't look right at all.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:47.270
Again,
it's also going to look jagged or blurry.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.040
So what you want to do is
use a three-part image,

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:52.440
meaning you take the left
cap and the right cap,

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:53.670
and you reposition those.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.000
And then you take a
slice from the center,

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.510
and you either tile it or you stretch it.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.660
Also, when it comes to video and sound,
timing is everything.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.950
We know when audio is played too early.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.400
or too late.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.950
Make sure that your audio clips are
trimmed so that they can be timed

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.690
perfectly to events in the game.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.490
And for background music,
add some variation.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.100
It's okay to loop background music,
but looped music can

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.000
get old really quickly.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.040
So it's best to have some variety.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:40.750
Play different loops for different
levels or different modes of the game.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.250
Okay.

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.000
So I've covered a lot
of ground here today,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.890
I think.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:52.060
But before I go, I, as promised,
want to talk a little bit about iOS 7.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.960
Now, at first blush,
you might believe that the

00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:03.280
changes to the look and feel of
iOS 7 don't really affect you.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.160
Maybe you're right.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.100
But I'm not so sure.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.840
So what I want to share with you
are the principles that influenced

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:18.250
and inspired the redesign of iOS 7.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:21.220
Because in my opinion,
those principles are just as relevant

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.480
to all games as they are to all apps.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:30.790
So what are those principles?

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.380
Well, there's really three core ones.

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.230
Clarity, deference, and depth.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.580
I'll explain what those are.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.140
So clarity is a really
straightforward concept.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.340
It's just about being clear.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:50.460
So UI design at its essence is
really just about communication.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.700
So the most successful interface
designs are the ones that are

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.900
the easiest to understand.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:58.750
So a quick example.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.040
Here's weather.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.240
Weather makes it really easy
to understand what the current

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.270
weather conditions are.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.750
Deference is about getting
out of people's way.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:13.680
It's about allowing content
to be front and center.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:18.950
As much as possible,
the interface should not interfere with

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.450
that experience of engaging with content.

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:27.190
It shouldn't cover up visual
content or be too distracting.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:28.960
So let's look at Mail.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.270
Mail exemplifies this
characteristic of deference.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.850
Photos go edge to edge.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.200
They're big,
so it's easier to see the detail in them.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.260
Text is easy to read,
and if you have a hard time seeing,

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.240
you don't have perfect vision,
you can increase the size of

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.200
text so it's even more legible.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.950
And the navigation bar at
the top and toolbar at the

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.860
bottom are visually subdued,
so they're not trying to compete

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.200
with the content for your attention.

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:58.140
In fact,
they kind of blend in to the message,

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:01.230
making the message seem
like it's stretching to the

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.280
full height of the screen.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.270
And depth.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.110
Depth is about using layering.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:16.470
and animation to establish and
reinforce hierarchy within apps

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.360
and on the platform as a whole.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:23.210
It's also about creating a
more profoundly vibrant and

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:27.300
lifelike experience through
how things move in response to

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.910
touch or movement of the device.

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.680
Now, in my opinion,
I think these principles are just as

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.600
relevant to games as they are to any app.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.680
So let's start with clarity.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.140
Clarity is a principle that can be
applied to just about everything

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:44.260
that we've talked about today.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:48.320
Being internally consistent
helps to provide clarity.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:52.020
Giving useful and informative
feedback makes your game more

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.960
clear about what's going on.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.880
A tutorial that teaches you while
you play your game is far more

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:02.820
clear than learning by seeing
a series of abstract images,

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.220
a series of static images.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:10.240
and low resolution graphics that
make it hard to see the details and

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.610
character and background artwork is quite
literally making your game less clear.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:18.730
The principle of clarity can
be applied beyond what we've

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.240
talked about today as well.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:25.120
So consider the copy that you display
and how you can be more clear with that.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.910
Ask yourself, are you saying too much?

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:33.500
Are you using words
that people understand?

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:36.740
Let's apply clarity to typography.

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:38.940
Is text large enough?

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:43.070
Sometimes I think that game developers
have exceptionally good eyesight,

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.680
superhuman eyesight,
because text is always so

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.330
incredibly small and hard to read.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.940
Is the font face you're using legible?

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.800
It's pretty hard to read.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.010
It's not very clear at all.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.250
It's much easier to read.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:02.850
And is there sufficient contrast
or visual interference with

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:06.180
background elements that makes
it hard to read the text?

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.520
This is much easier to read.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.870
Deference is about getting out of
people's way and allowing their

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.090
content to be front and center.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.020
Forcing people through a series of
complicated customization screens

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.640
before they're even allowed to play
the game is not very deferential.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:28.170
If you overlay heads-up displays
or health meters or other status

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:32.420
information over your game,
those elements shouldn't get in

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:37.390
the way of your ability to see
characters and the game environment.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.680
So consider the heads-up
display in Real Racing 3.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.440
They do a really good job
of getting out of your way.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.900
You can see key race information
like the track or your speed,

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:53.530
but it doesn't limit your
field of vision or cover up

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.150
the amazing graphics they have.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.980
Being deferential is all about
maximizing the size and prominence

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.840
of what's most important to people.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.240
Secondary elements shouldn't
be too distracting.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:42.200
[ Transcript missing ]

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:47.420
In iOS 7, we use this parallax
effect for the home screen.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.210
I think this effect is
a natural fit for games.

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:54.670
Platformer,
side-scroller games could use parallax

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:59.760
to create a greater sense of depth
between foreground and background layers.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:04.090
Even my terrible Paddlemania
3000 game is enhanced by that.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.190
And depth also refers to animation.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:12.620
We use 2 and 1/2D animations for
navigating hierarchical views.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.150
You zoom in and out when going
between the grid view or single

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.200
image view in the Photos app.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.600
This helps to establish
and reinforce hierarchy.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:24.500
There's no reason why that
type of animation wouldn't

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.540
work really well for games.

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:32.690
Using zoom animations when going in and
out of a level chooser is an obvious fit.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.280
So that's all I have for you today.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:40.760
That's all we have for you today.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:46.030
I want to thank you very much for being
here and encourage you guys to stick

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.260
around and share some drinks with us.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.160
We have some refreshments outside.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.250
Thank you very much.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:52.780
It was a pleasure being here.
