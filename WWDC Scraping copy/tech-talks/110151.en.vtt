00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.110
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.730
I'm excited to share some ideas

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.580
around optimizing your subscription for success

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.230
using the App Store's features

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.903
to help you improve your subscriber acquisition.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.143
I'm Meghana,

00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:15.090
and I'm part of the App Store Scaled Engagement Team.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.170
Today's session begins

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.540
with an overview of acquisition offers

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.180
and a recap of the tools the App Store has available

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.830
to stand them up.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.270
I'll then spend some time walking

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.670
through different acquisition strategies to consider

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.173
that utilize these features.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.493
I'll wrap up by discussing engineering considerations.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.953
Okay, let's get started.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.730
The App Store is the world's safest

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.040
and most trusted app marketplace

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.490
serving over 650 million visitors each week

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.883
across more than 175 storefronts.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.320
Customers trust that apps and subscriptions on the platform

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.700
are held to high standards

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.640
for privacy, security, and content,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.470
and we now have more than 1 billion

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.400
active paid subscriptions across Apple services.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.950
Today, I'll share some sample strategies

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.570
that can help you attract customers

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.000
to your subscription service.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.080
As a reminder,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.720
let's review the two subscription offer features

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.433
that can be used for acquisition.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.350
Introductory offers is the feature

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.200
that allows you to set a standard introductory price

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.430
for new subscribers, shown here as one week free

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.470
before the subscription auto renews

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.513
into the standard paid price.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.720
Offer codes takes the functionality

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.390
of introductory offers a step further

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.100
allowing more flexibility

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.230
for how you merchandise your offers

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.603
both inside and outside of your app,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.440
shown here, the custom code NEWYEAR unlocks

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.153
a special offer inside the app,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.410
and in fact, 60% of active paid subscriptions

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.620
on the platform first began with an intro offer,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.490
so these can be quite powerful

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.410
but how do you know what to offer new customers?

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.480
There are three different discount types

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.730
that you can choose from:

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.400
free trial, which gives customers free access

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.130
to your subscription for an allotted period of time

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.050
before they're billed,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.120
pay upfront, which gives customers

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.700
a one-time discounted purchase for a period

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.653
before renewing at the regular rate,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.970
and pay as you go, which gives customers multiple renewals

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.243
at a discounted price before renewing at the regular rate.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.190
Keep in mind that offers should always be utilized

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.100
as part of a great customer experience.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.350
Apps should never attempt to trick users

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.100
into purchasing a subscription under false pretenses,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.740
cheat users with irrationally high prices,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.083
or engage in other scammy behavior.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.130
Apps must also provide ongoing value to customers

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.953
in order to offer auto-renewing subscriptions.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.070
Looking at a breakdown of the discount types

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.290
redeemed by currently paying subscribers

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.230
in all territories outside of Greater China,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.590
we see that nearly all of them began with a free trial.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.510
But when we look at a global view,

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.480
you can see that nearly a quarter of active subscriptions

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.820
began with a paid offer,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.043
either pay upfront or pay as you go.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.940
In addition to their popularity

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.740
in markets like Greater China,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.900
where free trials are uncommon,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.640
paid offers can also be useful

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.610
for apps with strong brand recognition

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.703
or specific content licensing considerations.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.180
Free trials are popular because they allow customers

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.180
to sample a subscription service at no cost

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.770
and are therefore a great tool

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.353
for demonstrating the value of your service.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.470
Let's review some trends that we observe

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.563
when looking at how developers are using free trials today.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.380
The length of free trial offered

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.620
is one of the areas where we see some differences.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.360
We find that at a platform level,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.060
the popularity of trial lengths that developers use

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.283
varies based on their apps category.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.620
For example, entertainment, social, music, and book apps

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.623
tend to over-index on one-month free trials.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.790
Apps in the health and fitness, productivity, education,

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.830
and weather tend to use week-long trials more heavily

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.610
and three-day trials are most popular

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.963
amongst photo and video, games, utilities and business apps.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.480
We also observed some trends

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.720
across the popularity of trial lengths that developers use

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.670
based on the region they're offered in.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.580
Monthly trials are most commonly offered

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.580
in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.010
whereas Greater China, Japan, and LATAM

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.310
all over-index in providing seven-day trials,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.080
and three-day trials are most popular

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.243
in Southeast Asia and Pan EMIEA.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.570
Keep in mind that this data is directional

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.280
and you should always test and evaluate

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.463
what makes most sense for your specific app and service.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.590
With some of the basics

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.900
of acquisition offers under our belt,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.460
let's dive a little bit deeper

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.440
and explore how offer tools can be used

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.423
to support some sample strategies.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.380
To approach this, we've organized these strategies

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.840
by onboarding and marketing,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.640
two areas that you should be thinking about

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.890
when developing your subscription.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.250
For each of these, we'll provide some strategies to consider

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.890
and show you how to use the App Store's offer features

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.300
to create them.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.760
So let's begin by discussing some ways

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.250
that you can optimize your app's onboarding

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.240
to help you introduce your subscription to new users.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.000
One of the benefits of using an introductory offer

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.250
is that it gives customers an accessible way

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.613
to sample content before becoming paid subscribers.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.820
When customers are in this trial period

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.950
it's helpful to keep them engaged

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.623
and exploring of the value of your service.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.400
In-app messaging and push notifications

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.520
are tools that can help you reach these new customers

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.413
during their intro offer period.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.710
Remember that customers must opt in

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.203
to receiving push notifications from your app.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.873
Let's take a look at an example.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.410
Here you can see how the hypothetical app Ocean Journal

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.740
offers to remind customers when their trial is ending

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.450
to encourage them to take advantage

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.120
of their remaining days of service.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.800
You can take this a step further

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.010
by providing a timeline to customers before they subscribe

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.080
to highlight key days to keep in mind

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.030
throughout their free trial.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.480
This allows them to know exactly when they'll be charged.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.610
When used alongside notifications,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.380
timeline or countdown messaging

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.440
can help customers comfortably explore your service

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.080
and understand its value proposition

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.820
so they can make an informed decision

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.590
about becoming a paying subscriber

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.273
at the end of the free trial.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.210
Users who download your app

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.730
have different interests and ambitions.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.530
When onboarding new users

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.600
you may want to learn a little bit about them

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.430
so that you can tailor your content

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.950
and messaging to their needs,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.660
but do keep this short and sweet.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.700
A good rule of thumb is to provide onboarding

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.270
that helps people enjoy your app, not just set it up.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.670
You might also consider using this information

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.210
to surface and distribute offer codes for acquisition offers

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.810
tailored directly to a customer's motivations.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.630
Here's an example of how personalized offer messaging

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.090
might look with Ocean Journal.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.470
Here, the app has included

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.480
a question in their onboarding flow

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.870
that helps them understand their customer's interests.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.530
This will help them better customize their app's experience.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.330
In the question shown here,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.483
they're looking to understand a user's surfing experience.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.410
If a user indicates that they're new to surfing,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.790
Ocean Journal can consider

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.130
surfacing contextualized messaging

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.770
like this "Practice makes perfect" copy

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.920
alongside an offer code to help encourage users

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.550
to commit to using the app to learn the sport.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.030
Next, consider offering longer-term subscription plans

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.550
as part of your subscription offering.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.510
Some of your customers

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.270
may quickly understand the value of your service

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.860
and may be interested in committing

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.840
to a longer term upfront,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.760
especially when the option to do so

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.923
is provided at a discounted price.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.550
When presented alongside clear messaging

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.090
and an understanding of a service's value proposition,

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.250
longer-term SKUs can be an effective way

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.133
to provide customers with long-term value.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.260
Across the platform,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.900
we observe that yearly and half-yearly SKUs

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.240
are the most popular long-term offerings

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.593
amongst customers today.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.670
And remember, you can still provide intro offers

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.370
on these longer terms to provide an opportunity

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.280
for customers to try out your app for free

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.690
or at a reduced price

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.920
before the subscription renews at the standard rate.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.040
Here you can see Ocean Journal subscription options.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.310
They have both a yearly and monthly term available

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.990
and use the intro offer feature

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.680
to provide users with a seven-day free trial.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.350
They offer a 33% annual discount

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.530
on their yearly SKU compared to monthly,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.180
so customers who choose yearly

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.663
get an entire year of service for the price of eight months.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.840
In turn, this discounted offering

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.850
is of benefit to Ocean Journal

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.910
as it enables them to engage and retain their customers

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.920
for a longer period of time

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.633
than they might on a monthly SKU.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.750
Here are some KPIs to keep in mind

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.720
when developing these onboarding strategies.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.960
Consider monitoring your introductory offer conversion rate

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.860
to understand how many customers convert to paid subscribers

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.963
after their introductory offer period,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.470
retention rate can help you understand

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.950
the amount of customers that renew their subscriptions,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.930
and tracking subscription activations

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.210
can help you evaluate the total number

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.080
of new customers subscribing to your service.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.810
Now let's talk about some ways that you can market your app

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.973
to drive new-user acquisition.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.540
As discussed earlier, offer codes is a feature

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.700
that helps you reach potential customers

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.370
through online and offline marketing channels

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.200
outside your app.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.880
While you're likely already using

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.260
your own marketing channels

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.010
to help customers discover your app and drive downloads,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.940
you can now use them

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.330
to help drive new subscription starts with offer codes.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.070
You can even customize offers

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.563
for each of your different marketing audiences.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.020
For brand-new users,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.730
offer codes gives you the ability

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.810
to surface offers before a user even downloads your app

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.800
and the redemption flow

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.350
will automatically prompt users to install it

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.323
if they don't already have the app on their device.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.130
Surfacing acquisition offers outside of your app

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.950
is an efficient way to utilize paid media channels

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.720
as a means to drive customers

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.943
directly into your subscription funnel.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.270
Here you can see how Ocean Journal

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.430
is using an offer code advertising

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.400
a 50% discount off the first month of service

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.533
using the code SUMMERWAVES.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.680
We recommend testing and tailoring

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.510
the messaging of your campaign

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.920
so that the promotion reaches

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.460
and is relevant for your intended audience.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.020
If you'd like to distribute offers

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.700
through offline media channels,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.820
consider using offer codes to promote compelling offers

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.590
through events or out-of-home,

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.353
for example, flyers or outdoor advertising.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.400
And finally, peer-to-peer member referral programs

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.400
are another effective way to reach new audiences

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.190
and can be executed using offer codes.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.800
These programs allow your current customers

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.160
to refer their friends to your subscription service

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.030
and invite them to take advantage of special member offers.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.800
Member referral programs

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.590
can be very effective user-acquisition drivers

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.930
for developers of all sizes

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.950
and can generate new leads at a lower cost-per-acquisition.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.430
Let's take a look at how this could work in application.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.010
Here you can see the referrer's journey.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.140
Ocean Journal is prominently promoting

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.400
their member referral program on the app's first screen.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.740
Once a customer taps on invite a friend,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.850
they're then prompted

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.480
to share a custom offer code via iMessage.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.620
The code and copy is pre-populated by the developer

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.450
so all the customer needs to do

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.620
is enter their friend's contact information and hit send.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.050
Once a referred user receives the iMessage,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.100
they can tap the link

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.190
and be taken directly into the offer code redemption flow

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.990
to begin their subscription.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.000
In a little bit I'll walk you through

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.750
the complete redemption experience that a customer sees.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.940
When implementing these marketing strategies

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.740
that utilize offer codes,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.720
consider evaluating the total number

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.220
of offer code redemptions

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.670
to see how many users are activating your offer.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.910
Additionally, monitoring offer code conversion rate

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.650
will show you how many customers

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.320
that begin their subscription with an offer code

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.930
convert to fully-paid subscribers.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.080
Note that all the KPIs mentioned in today's presentation

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.560
are available for your reference in Sales and Trends.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.960
In this section, I'll cover the best practices

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.970
you'll need to consider when implementing

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.493
these acquisition strategies into your app.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.590
Let's take a look at one acquisition strategy example

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.990
for each of the subscription offers,

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.670
as well as what you'd need to consider

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.700
when planning and implementing the subscription offers

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.190
into your app and server.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.020
When providing introductory offer

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.660
for a longer term on subscription plan,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.190
something that you'll need to consider

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.800
when merchandising an introductory offer

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.110
is that a customer may have previously redeemed

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.530
an introductory offer and may not be eligible,

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.320
so this copy will need to be dynamically merchandised

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.960
to only eligible customers.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.090
This will help you to ensure that the merchandising

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.880
is in sync with the App Store payment sheet.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.100
Let's see how you can do that.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.780
With StoreKit 2 you can check

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.090
customer's eligibility on device

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.843
by using the isEligibleDorIntroOffer Property.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.350
The value for this property will return true

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.700
if the customer's eligible

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.420
for an introductory offer per subscription group.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.280
Optionally, on server side,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.250
you can use either JWSTransactions,

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.120
available with the history API

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.220
and check for the field offerType = 1,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.950
or use the latest receipt info array

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.711
to check for the field is_trial_period

00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:25.755
and is_in_intro_offer_period.

00:14:25.755 --> 00:14:29.850
This will help you determine if an intro offer was consumed.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.250
If any of these fields indicate that the customer

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.760
has not previously redeemed an introductory offer,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.883
then you can merchandise them the introductory offer.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.570
Now to merchandise offer detail accurately

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.150
and verify if your products in App Store Connect

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.330
have the introductory offer available, you can do this

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.570
with introductoryOffer property for StoreKit 2

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.320
and introductoryPrice property for original StoreKit.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.370
If they're available,

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.773
the introductory offer details are returned.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.220
StoreKit will prevent you from merchandising an offer

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.423
that is not available.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.930
It is important that this is not hard coded

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.760
and you should instead leverage StoreKit,

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.710
which uses the start and end date

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.633
configured in App Store Connect.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.350
To speed up your testing in Sandbox,

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.920
and to avoid creating multiple Sandbox Apple IDs,

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.220
you can take advantage of the reset eligibility feature

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.280
in the Sandbox subscription management page.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.350
This can easily be accessed within your app

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.160
if you implement the showManageSubscription method.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.280
Otherwise, you can navigate to your Sandbox Apple ID

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.260
in App Store settings.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.990
For more information on testing best practices

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.590
for Xcode and Sandbox enhancements, you can check out

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.190
the introducing StoreKit Testing and Xcode session

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.173
on the Apple Developer website.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.150
Now, let's take a look

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.970
at the personalized messaging strategy example.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.850
We're using offer codes as our recommended tool.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.580
This is a great feature for two reasons.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.860
First, it'll provide you with the flexibility

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.590
to create multiple offers, and second,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.563
you can leverage your existing SKU and subscription group.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.070
Let's walk through the complete redemption flow.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.400
You can embed the offer code link in claim offer button

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.023
once the customer taps on it.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.000
They'll be presented

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.490
with the App Store offer redemption sheet

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.880
which will represent the configured offer code details

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.203
in App Store Connect.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.610
Now, when the user taps on redeem offer,

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.910
they will be provided with payment confirmation sheet

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.830
and the transaction will be processed

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.473
once the customer completes the purchase.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.890
After successfully completing the purchase,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.570
the customer will be presented

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.150
with the offer redemption message.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.350
Now, you need to ensure

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.620
that your app handles external transactions gracefully

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.250
and provides a smooth onboarding experience.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.750
To do this, you can use StoreKit 2 Transaction.updates,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.340
and for original StoreKit,

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.223
it would be SKPaymentTransactionObserver.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.850
These are critical to be initiated at app launch

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.093
because offer code redemption can occur outside of your app.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.660
It's also important to call finish() transaction

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.520
after products or services

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.680
have been delivered to the customers.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.140
These unfinished transactions will remain in the queue

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.510
to help your app keep track of any purchases

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.763
that are yet to be delivered to customers.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.920
This is also critical

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.100
in case there was any interruption on device.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.800
You can do this with StoreKit testing on Xcode

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.500
and iOS 15.4 and later.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.300
The supported redemption experience

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.210
uses the presentCodeRedemptionSheet().

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.200
If you're not familiar

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.140
with StoreKit testing with Xcode already,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.300
it allows you to test fully offline

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.070
without App Store Connect.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.950
You can create and manage your in-app purchase locally

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.260
in the StoreKit configuration file,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.540
where you can also set up subscription offers

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.190
such as offer codes.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.980
This will allow you to test a successful redemption

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.830
and how your app handles new transactions

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.680
as a result of an offer code redemption.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.210
On backend systems,

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.850
you can easily identify offer code redemptions

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.280
using JWSTransactions

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.640
which will contain offerType value equals 3

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.920
and the offerIdentifier.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.200
The offerIdentifier will contain the value

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.240
which you configured in App Store Connect

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.700
when setting up the offer code,

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.810
and you will also receive

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.900
the notification type OFFER_REDEEMED

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.843
in near-real time when the customer redeems an offer.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.930
For more information on offer codes,

Next, on the reporting side,

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.130

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.370
This report contains all offer codes

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.310
that have been redeemed, whether they're in effect currently

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.443
or will be at the next billing period.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.030
The offer code redemptions are aggregated by territory

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.630
and the offer code column includes specific custom codes,

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.430
while for one-time codes,

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.773
it'll remain blank for customer privacy.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.850
