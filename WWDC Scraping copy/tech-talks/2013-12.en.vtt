WEBVTT

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.800
All right, well, let's get started.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.600
So my name is Mike Stern.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.240
I am a user experience
evangelist with Apple.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.000
And it's my pleasure to be
with you today to talk about

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.750
designing your app for iOS 7.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.120
So what I do year-round is I work
with developers such as yourself on

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.360
how to design great apps for iOS.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.460
And as you can imagine,
since this summer at

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.790
WWDC when we announced iOS 7,
I've spent a lot of time working

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.840
with developers specifically on the
process of redesigning their existing

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.990
apps or designing new apps for iOS 7.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.870
And through that experience,
I've been able to see really up close and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.340
get a lot of hands-on experience of where
people have difficulties or questions and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.890
what are the opportunities of success for
designing for this new version of iOS.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.190
And so I wanted to take that experience,
draw from that experience,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.310
and share with you some observations
that I've had of the kind of real-world

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.800
situations that people have gone through
as they've gone through this process.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.070
And hopefully I'll be able to anticipate
some of the questions that you may have.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.890
So when designing for iOS 7,
I think the best place to get started

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.020
is to consider some of the principles
that influenced the redesign of iOS.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.380
Now, there are many different principles,
but the top three,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.550
the most important three,
are these-- clarity,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.940
Deference and Depth.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.960
And if you're interested,
I gave a talk at WWDC where we

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.720
introduced some of these principles
when we first talked about iOS 7.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.720
And I go into a little
bit greater detail there.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.270
But for the purpose of today,
I just want to recap what these mean.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.230
So clarity is a really simple concept.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.040
It's just about being clear.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.610
Now, if you think about UI design,
at its essence, what UI design is is a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.820
form of communication.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.220
It's your app communicating with
the people who use it and the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.180
people communicating with your app.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.650
And the best form of communication,
the most clear form of communication,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.540
is when things are really
easy to understand,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.520
when information is presented
as clearly as possible,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.170
when the functions of your app are
obvious and intuitive and easy to use,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.030
easy to grasp.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.630
So for example, here's weather.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.770
The most important piece of
information in this app is what

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.280
the current weather conditions are.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.330
And the design of the interface
is almost solely devoted to

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.500
presenting that singularly
important piece of information.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.840
There's no mistaking what the
current weather conditions are.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.880
There's other information presented here,
too, and it's also very

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.840
straightforward and easy to grasp.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.160
And that's the bar.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.950
Your app should make information
and functions as easy to

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.500
understand and as easy to grasp.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.940
How people interact with
your app when they launch it.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.540
At the very first moment,
the app should tell them

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.000
what this interface,
what this app is capable of doing,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.860
and how they do it.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.240
Next up is deference.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.360
And I think this is kind of a novel
concept when it comes to design,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.220
somewhat of an unusual
and unexpected one.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.380
But it's a really critical one.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.660
So to define deference,
it's basically about having the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.770
best possible content consumption
experience that you can possibly

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.310
provide for the people who use your app.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.100
It's about taking content and
putting it at the front and center

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.570
of the experience that they're
having with your app's interface.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.560
So for example, this is mail.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.560
In mail,
the content is the email message.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.100
And within that, there's text and photos.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.500
So being deferential in this
situation involves making

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.720
sure that text was legible.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.210
So the whole text size scaling
feature was in large part

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.600
driven by that singular goal.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.250
So if you have a hard time
reading text at a small font size,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.840
you can adjust it to make it
more legible for yourself.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.230
Photos are now edge to edge.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.770
So there's a larger image,
meaning you can see more detail

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.580
within each photo that you look at.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.090
And the navigation itself was designed
in such a way that it's visually subdued.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.220
So it's not competing for your
attention with the content,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.290
with the email message.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.800
It's sort of the navigation bar,
the toolbar,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.610
kind of blend into the message,
making the message seem as

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.300
large as it can possibly seem.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.250
And depth is about creating a vibrant
and lifelike experience within apps

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.770
and on the platform as a whole.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.860
It's also about using separate
informational and functional

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.780
layers to help people stay oriented
within their current context.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.330
Now these three principles,
these are really important,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.540
timeless and universal principles.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.950
And they're critical when you're
designing something to have

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.050
objectives and principles like this.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.420
To have principles that provide
an objective criteria for you to

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.720
make really great design decisions.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.520
The contrary of that,
the opposite of that,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.090
is to have subjective
design making decisions.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.760
So if you were designing
in a subjective way,

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.050
you might ask yourself,
how can I make this look cool?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.040
Or what can I do that's new and fresh?

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.180
And it may yield some
interesting results.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.680
But it's likely to yield results that are
trendy and won't stand the test of time.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.940
So when thinking about principles
and talking about principles,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.100
there's a risk of sounding
somewhat academic or you're

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.720
over-intellectualizing things.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.960
And I think it's actually not that true.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.940
The best way to approach designing
around these principles is just

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.360
to ask the right questions.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.640
So I've prepared some examples for
each of these three principles.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.960
And there's more questions
that you can ask,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.340
many more, ones that are specific to the
type of app that you're designing.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.520
These are good ones to start with.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.480
So for clarity,
am I using words that people understand?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.140
Do they have the vocabulary to understand
the text that's in the interface?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.300
Am I speaking clearly?

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.050
Am I using grammatically
correct phrasing?

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.580
Can people tell what my app
does just by looking at it?

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.730
That's a pretty high bar to set,
but it's an important one to

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.150
keep your eyes on and try to
work towards that ultimate goal.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.380
And can people use my app
with little or no instruction?

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.620
Now,
sometimes some instruction is necessary,

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.910
especially with a very
complicated application.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.010
But your ultimate goal should be to make
the app so intuitive to use that people

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.870
can just guess how to interact with it.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.980
For deference, is the interface calling
attention to itself?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.530
Is it trying to speak too loudly,
and therefore, it's kind of distracting?

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.700
Does the interface compete with content?

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.140
Again, is it so visually noisy that
it's overwhelming your ability

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.480
to accurately see visual
information within the content,

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.750
whether that's photos or text?

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.090
And can content be larger and more
central to the app experience?

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.190
Again, these are really basic questions,
but they're good ones to ask.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.630
And for depth,
do people get lost or confused in my app?

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.840
You have to watch people
using your app and,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.320
you know,
be really honest about where they're

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.550
stumbling and then figure out,
is the ultimate problem the app

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.340
interface and the way it's been designed?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.880
Can you help address that?

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.740
Next up,
and I think this is really critical,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.620
how do my apps spatially
relate to one another?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.930
It's really important when you design
an interface to have a clear spatial

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.700
model of all aspects of your application.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.700
If you don't have that spatial
model of how things are arranged,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.170
when people are using your app,
they won't have a spatial model

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.700
of how things are arranged.

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.640
Meaning,
they don't know where they can go.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.700
They don't know where they are.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.690
And as a consequence,
they're going to feel lost and confused,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.150
like the first question.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.400
And finally, how can animation provide
a sense of continuity?

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.100
Now,
animation is really important for iOS 7.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.980
We've used it and we've leveraged it
to a greater extent than ever before.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.990
And I'm going to go into a lot more
detail about some of the ins and

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
outs of animation a little bit later.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.650
But I want you to be thinking about
that because animation is really

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.970
important for providing continuity.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.900
So these questions, they're actually very
basic and simple questions.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.740
But the answers that you come up with to
these questions might be very profound.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.150
They might take you on a
totally different path than

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.970
the one you had been on before.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.000
So it's important to ask these.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.100
It's important to ask
these at the beginning,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.060
when you set out to
begin designing an app.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.520
But it's just as important to continue
to ask yourself these questions as you're

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.120
designing and as you're developing.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.830
That will help you make sure that you're
staying on course and make sure that

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:46.930
you're continuing to make really good,
objective, rational decisions.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.900
Okay, so that's the principles.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.000
I want you to keep thinking about
some of those principles as we go

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.780
through the rest of the presentation,
because hopefully it'll help

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.740
provide that framework for some
of the things that I'll discuss.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.940
So in software interface design,
we talk about the look

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.090
and feel all the time,
more than just software interface design,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.640
all aspects of design.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.840
And that's a really good way
for talking about iOS 7 as well.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.210
So I want to start with the look.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.510
Specifically,
I want to talk about six different

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:24.230
things related to the look of iOS 7,
starting with app icons.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.720
Now, the reason why I want to start
here is because no matter what

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.980
type of application you make,
you're going to have to redesign

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.300
your existing app icon for iOS 7,
presuming that you have one.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.310
There's two reasons for this.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.750
The first one is that
the size has changed.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.920
That's pretty basic.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.820
The app icons are now
a little bit bigger,

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.280
and you don't want to just
stretch existing artwork to fit

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.230
because it won't quite look right.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.690
It's not high enough resolution.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.060
The next one, and the more important one,
is that the mask shape

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.770
for app icons has changed.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.600
So the contours of those
corners are now a bit different.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.020
And that can be a problem for some icons.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.590
You see a lot of app icons
that do something like this.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.920
They have a faux 3D appearance.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:15.110
It's like a three-dimensional tile
which has been tilted back slightly.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.990
Or they have inner highlights or borders,
frames that trace the

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.360
contour of the mask shape.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.230
And if you've done something
like this with your app icons,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.870
obviously it's not really going to
look right with the new mask shape.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.160
Those corners are going to get cut off.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.240
The faux 3D effect isn't
going to be very convincing.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.360
Now, of course,
you can just read and draw this

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.340
stuff to make sure that it's
based around the new mask shape.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.120
But I think this is a good moment to ask
whether these elements are necessary.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.820
Many successful app icons don't
have those visual adornments.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.000
These six icons,
these are from a larger set of

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.520
icons that I had shown at the
conference earlier this year.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.940
And I was doing a presentation
called Best Practices in UI Design.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.160
And actually,
these icons were made before I was seven,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.380
before it was public.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.740
And I held these up as exemplars of
icon design for a couple of reasons,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.660
because they do a couple
of things really well.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.660
The first is that they
focus on a limited palette.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.360
There's not too many colors
in each one of these icons.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.890
Some of them really
just have one key color.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.180
Next,
the colors that they choose are vibrant.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:30.840
They stand out.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.080
They have life to them, right?

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.020
And the third is that they
focus on a very simple shape.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:42.320
And as a result of those attributes,
they reduce extremely well.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.820
Or looked at another way,
you can recognize them

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.140
from a very great distance.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.720
And that's important.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.200
Those characteristics are
also really great because it's

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:56.480
easy for people to memorize,
to remember what these look like.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.340
So these are great icons.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.620
And none of them have a faux 3D effect.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.960
None of them have an inner
glow or specular highlight

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.940
or frame around the edge.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.100
Okay.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:15.510
Speaking of icons, many app UIs,
probably most, I'd venture to guess,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.870
have icons in their interface,
either as buttons or as status

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.640
or some other type of label.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.680
So chances are your app is
going to have some icons.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.700
And in iOS 7,
all of the icons for all of the

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.460
apps that we ship were redesigned.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.180
And they're redesigned
to match each other.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.800
And they're redesigned to match the
overall design vernacular for iOS 7.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.470
And by doing that,
it creates great degree of

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.530
consistency for the platform.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:48.380
The platform experience is much more
internally consistent and cohesive.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:55.060
And the new icon style was designed
in large part... because these are the

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.720
clearest icons that we could produce.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.070
Again, that principle of clarity affected
everything that was done for iOS 7.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:09.310
These icons are crisp, they're precise,
they're unadorned,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.760
icons are drawn using a minimum number
of visual details to effectively describe

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.660
the object that's being referenced.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.210
And they're created using
simple geometric forms

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.770
like rectangles or squares,
line segments,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.690
I'm going to show you how to create a
new app that's going to be able to bring

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.000
you to the next level of your life.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.720
I'm going to show you how to create a
new app that's going to be able to bring

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.080
you to the next level of your life.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.510
And graphical features,
like the lines for the

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.350
voicemail icon here,
are even one-point strokes.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:05.910
and Selection is represented
consistently by their thickening

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.910
outlines to be two-point strokes,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.560
or filling in shapes,
whatever is most appropriate

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.870
for an individual icon.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.930
And you can mix and match
these things within one app.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.490
as with iTunes U.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.860
They demonstrate both of
these forms of selection.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.600
On the left,
featured and charts get filled

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.170
in when they're selected,
and on the right,

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.550
browse and search just have thicker
outlines when they are selected.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.410
Okay, so now I've talked a little
bit about the characteristics

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:38.370
of the new icon set for iOS 7,
but what does it actually take to

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.030
make icons that match this style?

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.340
So as a designer, I wanted to understand
that a bit better myself.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.180
And there's really no better way of
learning how to match a particular

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.860
design style than by doing it,
than by practicing it.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.410
So that's exactly what I did.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:03.180
So this is the old design that we had
for the WWDC app that we released just

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.120
before the conference this summer.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.530
And so I took this and
I redesigned it for iOS 7.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.190
And I want to walk you through the
process that I went through for

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.860
redesigning each of the various
icons that you see in this interface.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.470
I'm going to start with the day
switcher controls there at the top.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:26.280
These let you go through the various
days of the schedule during the week.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:31.160
Now, if my approach had just been
to take the old iOS 6 icon and

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.840
drop it into the iOS 7 app UI,
it wouldn't look right.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.120
It wouldn't look really good.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.070
The old icon was designed to make
it look inset into the surface,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.340
or recessed into the surface.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.300
And that's not how icons look in iOS 7,
or how we have designed

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.360
them for ourselves,
at least.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.520
They don't look inset.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.220
They don't look like they're raised above
the surface and casting a shadow onto it.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.020
They look as though they've been
printed directly onto the surface.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.720
So the first step was just to
remove those visual effects

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.600
that made it look inset.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.260
But that's not quite enough, right?

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:10.530
We also tint icons and tint
buttons with a key color,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.540
which helps people understand that
they are interactive or tappable.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.660
And I'll talk more about
tint colors in a second.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.000
The next step was to look at the shape.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.220
Now, this triangle here,
this is filled in.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.170
And that's an issue,
because as I just talked about earlier,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.390
we reserve filling in icons
to help show selection.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.730
But in this situation,
this control doesn't

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.460
actually get selected.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.400
So it's inappropriate.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.930
We don't want to confuse
people by filling this in.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:40.560
And I needed to pick a new shape.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.700
And in this situation,
it was actually kind of easy

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.380
because there's a lot of precedent.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.850
We have back buttons.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.240
We have back and forward buttons
from Safari's browser history.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.340
And those are conceptually
very similar to the controls

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.080
that I'm redesigning here.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.000
So I just created an image that was
based on a chevron and was scaled

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.250
to be the correct size for the
situation that we're using it in.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.920
And that was basically it.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.120
It's pretty easy.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.920
It's pretty straightforward.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:10.920
This is a different icon.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.180
This is the repeat badge,
which helps you know that an event

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.920
is repeating in the schedule.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.000
And you can see some of the same
characteristics of the previous icon.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.640
We have the triangular
shape for the arrowheads.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.120
But we can see here that we have kind
of an outline which is too thick.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.740
So some of the changes that went in
here are similar to what we had before.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.520
Changed the triangular shape to
a chevron and thinned out the

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.820
lines from the arrow's tail.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.360
Next up are color labels,
those little color swatches that

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.290
have the triangular shape on the
left or the big circle on the right.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.410
And they were two different icons,
actually, because the circles didn't work

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.330
well on the left and the triangles
didn't work very well on the right.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.210
And this one was really
kind of just a cheat.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.600
I just looked at Calendar,
which has color labels for its icons.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.180
I dropped them into the new design,
and I found that they

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.600
actually worked really well.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:05.380
In fact, the same circle of color worked
very well in both situations

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.340
because it's much smaller,
so it's more repurposable.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:14.780
And these icons, I'll just call out,
these are 15-point, I believe, icons,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.830
very small circles of color,
but they're just large enough

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.530
to do what they need to do,
which is to show you that swatch,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.620
that sample of color.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.980
No larger, no smaller.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.900
Okay, now last up, and most importantly,
are the tab bar icons.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.110
Tab bar icons are typically
the largest and most prominent

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.200
icons in any app's interface.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.100
And they're persistent
because it's a tab bar.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.200
It'll stay visible as you
navigate throughout the app.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.600
So it's really important that your
tab bar icons are designed with

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.200
great care and attention to detail.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.800
So let's walk through these four icons.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.880
Now the first two, these were, again,
really easy.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.230
The process here was to just look for
similar icons in other existing apps

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.800
that we've shipped and just take them,
just reuse them, right?

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.140
So maps and videos,
it was easy to find analogs for

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.760
those two sections of the app
and to just use those icons.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.640
And that's perfectly fine to do, right?

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.980
Now, next up came Events.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.820
That one was a bit trickier,
a bit more involved.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.040
And so let's dive into that.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.020
So that's the old icon.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.120
And as you can see here,
there's some problems with this.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.310
The outline is too thick,
and it's just not that one

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.620
point thickness line weight.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.260
And the squares represent days.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.620
They're also pretty chunky.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.070
They're pretty heavy
and don't feel light.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.900
They don't feel correct for
the design language of iOS 7.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.360
The next issue is that the header,
it's so large.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.200
As I talked about before,
when we're showing selection,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.030
we want to make sure that there's
a great contrast and fill things

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.130
in or make things thicker.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.500
But that header is so thick that it's
hard to make this even more filled in.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.390
And finally, those two rings at the top,
which represent the metal rings that

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.420
hold the months of a calendar together,
the individual pages of

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.030
the calendar together,
I wasn't sure if they're

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:11.930
totally necessary.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.400
And this is just a general bit of advice.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.260
Every time you're designing icons,
you should ask yourself,

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.590
is every individual element that's
in the artwork absolutely necessary

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.600
for conveying the image that I'm
trying to communicate to people?

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.670
And if it's not,
if it's not carrying its weight,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.640
if it's not totally necessary,
then it should just be removed

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:37.300
because it's one more bit of visual
noise that people have to process.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.890
So here's the new icon.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.530
As you can see,
I removed those rings at the top.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.370
I didn't think that they
were actually necessary.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.900
The header was thinned down,
so there's much more negative space.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.500
There's much more white
space in this icon,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.920
so it's easy to imagine how
it's going to be filled in and

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.000
more strongly show selection.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.410
And the outlines and the dots were
all made to be quite a bit thinner.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.000
And finally,
this is the icon that represents

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.500
the news section of the app.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.000
And as you can see here,
it has some of those same downsides,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.990
the same problems.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.000
So the icon is almost 100% filled in,
so it would be very difficult

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.450
to have a version of this which
is heavier to show selection.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.740
And of course,
I could just approach redesigning

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.540
this icon by outlining
that speak bubble shape,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.950
but that would look kind of fussy.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.220
It wouldn't look really right.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.870
And also, it's not designed based
on geometric primitives.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.870
These are sort of freehand
Bezier paths that are used to

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.870
design every bit of this icon.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.870
It's very non-geometric.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:54.300
[ Transcript missing ]

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.400
The reason why I did that,
and the thing I want to

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.910
impart with you today,
is that you should think

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:00.960
about the symbology.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.800
Let me jump back here for a second.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.600
Think about the symbology of
the icon that you're using to

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.370
represent different concepts.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:13.290
If we look at this individual icon here,
we see that it has an exclamation mark.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.240
So what does that mean?

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.950
It means urgency.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.300
I want to get your attention.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:37.790
And there's a speak bubble,
which translates to this is a message.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:37.790
So if you string it together,
I have an urgent message.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:37.790
And the section that it's
representing is called news.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:37.790
So yes, conceptually, they kind of match,
but it's not a perfect fit.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:37.790
So if we go back forward again.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.880
You can see that ultimately there's
a better icon that has a more direct

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:47.080
semantic correlation to the concepts that
we're trying to communicate to people.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.090
Newspaper connects with news.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.160
Okay, and then the other attributes.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.890
Because it's a newspaper,
it actually has a lot of, luckily,

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:01.190
vertical and horizontal shapes,
a lot of white space inside the icon,

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.060
so it'll be easy to show
selection when you get around

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.470
to designing that version of it.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:11.040
So these changes to the icons,
they're actually all pretty subtle.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.330
They're not big changes.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.440
It's not really rocket science here.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.330
But collectively,
all of these individual changes

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.200
has resulted in icons which
will now allow the WWDC app to

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.580
family much better with iOS 7,
to feel much more at home on iOS 7.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.290
All right.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.600
Enough about icons.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.130
So let's talk about tint colors.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.900
Tim Cutler is really important in iOS 7.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.500
I can't stress this enough.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.010
The reason why they're important,
beyond just allowing you to

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.380
give a theme or a particular
feel to your apps interface,

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.640
is they help tell people
what elements are tappable.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.090
They help indicate interactivity.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.020
But it's really easy to overuse color.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.180
Lots of apps have lots of
interactive elements at all times.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.680
And if all of those had a tint color,
there would be way too much color.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.980
No matter what the color is,
it would be totally overwhelming.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.700
So to avoid this,
you want to mix things up a little bit,

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.530
maybe use multiple tint colors.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.620
So let me explore what I'm talking about.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.710
Let me explain what
I'm talking about here.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.620
So this is our App Store interface,
the App Store app.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.440
And as you can see here,
it has a blue tint color.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.810
And there's a lot of elements on
screen that are given that tint color,

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.150
have it consistently.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.440
So it's pretty easy to know
what things are tappable.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.660
But not everything is blue.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.180
This segment to control in the middle
of the screen here is also interactive.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.770
But its design, its shape,
its form lets people know that

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.730
they can interact with this thing.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.790
So there's no really
need to make it blue.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.270
I mean, we could have made it blue.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.700
But there wasn't a need to do that.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.650
And by making it this medium gray color,
it helps to break up the

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.350
screen so it's less monotonous.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.170
And some things don't even
need a different tint color.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:07.780
So there's a visual indicator here,
the chevron on the right-hand

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.380
side of the developer name,
which lets people know that they can

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:15.730
tap this whole line of text and get
more information about the developer.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:22.820
So, again, multiple tint colors,
other visual indicators are really

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:22.820
important to help break up the interface.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.640
Now I want to dive into a very
specific thing about tint colors,

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.440
and that is when it comes
to the navigation bar.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.320
So I've seen a lot of apps

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:41.600
[ Transcript missing ]

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.200
If you can, I would really recommend
avoiding doing this.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.160
Because when you have longer
labels for titles and buttons,

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.360
they start to bleed together,
and it becomes hard to distinguish

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.280
between things that are interactive
and things that are not interactive.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.450
It's not a very clear design,
because I can't see where one

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.140
stops and the other begins.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.410
So it's really important to give a
distinct color to button items in

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:10.100
the back button in the navigation bar
to make sure that they look tappable

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.740
and visually distinct from titles.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.500
And if you really want to have
white buttons in the navigation bar,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.070
that's OK.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.830
But do pick a different
color for your titles.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:30.120
Also, if the title is white,
don't pick a light blue color or

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.660
something that makes the buttons
look like they're disabled.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.290
This is a big issue,
and I've seen it so many times.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.040
I want to talk to everyone
about this and say,

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.850
please avoid doing something like this.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.870
You don't want to make tappable
items look like they're disabled.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.360
All right, next up, button borders.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.590
The removal of button borders is probably
one of the most discussed and talked

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.490
about aspects of the design for iOS 7.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.560
It's really noticeable, right?

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:01.560
Getting rid of those borders.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.100
That's a big change.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:09.370
And I'll be upfront and say that if
you get rid of borders from buttons,

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.070
it can lead to some issues.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.100
So for example,
here's the iOS 6 version of the WWDC app,

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.890
and we see three buttons there
arrayed in a vertical stack

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.080
at the bottom of the screen.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:25.650
And as this was redesigned for iOS 7,
here's how it would look if

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.980
we just stripped away those
borders and gave a tint color

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.100
to the labels of those buttons.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.060
Now, this is okay.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.100
It's not terrible.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.100
It's not that great either, right?

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.490
Those button labels seem like
they're just kind of floating

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.090
there without any real structure.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.100
They're centered on the screen,
and we can all see that.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.100
But it just looks loose
and a little bit sloppy.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.210
So my approach to fixing that
problem was just to put everything

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.100
in the main view into a table.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:00.090
That left aligns the button labels and
puts table row separators between them,

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.080
which gives them some separation and
gives them much-needed structure.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.630
And one nice side benefit of
doing that is the hit area,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.100
the tap target area for those buttons
now extends to the full screen.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.100
So it's not like you're going to be able
to see the buttons in the main view.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.100
It's like you're going to be able
to see the buttons in the main view.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.100
And so that's a big change.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.100
So there's actually more space
to tap on those controls.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:21.810
But a more difficult problem is
when you have buttons that are

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.060
side by side with each other.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.100
If we remove these borders,
it starts to kind of bleed

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.490
together a little bit.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.380
And it's especially bad if
we use larger type because we

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.480
want it to be more legible.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.970
Or we allow these to be -- the size
of these to be changed with the text

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.430
size -- the text scaling feature.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.180
And it's really bad if,
like in this situation,

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.490
the button labels are multiple words.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.480
And so there's spaces that are dividing
the words within an individual label.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.270
As you can see here,
it's all just bleeding together

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.470
in one nonsensical sentence.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.270
So one solution to this
is pretty straightforward,

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:58.980
right?

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.500
Relay out the ZIP.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:02.490
Create more space between the controls.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.520
And that can work if you
have the space to do it.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:11.410
Or you can try to figure out if you can
have shorter and more succinct labels.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.120
I know I'm talking to
a German audience here,

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.040
so this is a bit difficult.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.580
But luckily for you,
there's other solutions.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.330
So this is exactly the situation
that we faced with the login

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.440
screen for the WWDC app.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.560
We have register and sign in that
are at the bottom of the screen.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.950
And if I just, in designing for iOS 7,
took away those borders,

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.250
Who thinks this looks good?

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.670
I mean,
I think this looks pretty terrible,

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.290
actually.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.230
It's not a severe usability problem.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.400
You can kind of see
that these are controls,

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.440
but they look small and a bit lost
down there in the middle of the screen.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.900
So this is the design that
I actually came up with.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.240
I used a group table view.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.700
I used individual table rows to
present those different controls.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.880
I moved the register button down
to the bottom of the screen so

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.960
it's out of the way of the primary
flow of entering in your ID and

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.660
your password and then signing in.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.100
And in fact,
most people who use this app,

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.830
most of the time,
don't need to press that register button

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.870
because they are already registered
and they're just logging in again.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.930
So this is a better design, actually.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.560
And we have the full width of
the screen to present the title,

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.840
the label for each of those buttons.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.920
And one nice side benefit of
that is when you begin to enter

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.770
in your ID and your password,
the keyboard comes up from the bottom

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.480
of the screen and covers the register
button because presumably you do not

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.140
need the register button anymore.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.000
So it's a nice, elegant design.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.220
And there's a lot of other apps that we
ship that have done something like this.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:58.730
"But is it a button?" So this gets at
the heart of some of the discussion,

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.440
the debate that occurred among designers
and developers at large in the design

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.380
community in response to iOS 7.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.920
And the criticism is that
without seeing that border,

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.220
people won't be able to connect it
to a real physical world button.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.920
And so therefore,
they won't know that it's tappable.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.320
And so therefore,
usability will be diminished.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.700
And that's an understandable criticism,
I think.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.140
It's a legitimate one.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.370
But I think it's a bit overblown.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.350
So let me delve into why I'm saying that.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.900
The first reason is that a lot of
controls that people interact with

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.410
are in a navigation bar at the very
top of the screen or in a toolbar

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.000
at the very bottom of the screen.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.310
And the placement of those controls at
the very top and the very bottom is a

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:52.260
very strong cue to people using the app
that those are interactive elements.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.540
Because people have been interacting
with mobile apps for quite a while now,

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.500
there's a really strong
set of expectations.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.360
That things that are placed in those
areas of the screen are interactive.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.860
So, that covers some ground.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:15.250
In addition to that, and again,
I know I'm in Germany here,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:21.300
but there's a lot of words in any
language which people understand

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.910
because we see them all the time.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.620
We see them on other iOS apps.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.050
We see them on Mac apps.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.390
We see them on websites.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:36.040
And we know when we see these
words that these are probably

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.420
things that we can interact with.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.700
We know that because they're verbs.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.620
We know that because they are
actions that we understand.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.260
They're just that familiar to us.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:52.050
So with text buttons,
this covers a lot of ground too,

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:57.200
especially if there's a special
color applied to those labels.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:02.990
But there's some situations
not covered by those two cases,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.160
the location of controls or their label.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.850
And by the way, I talked about text,
but there's also a lot of images

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:14.300
that we understand to be actionable,
like plus signs and the share icon.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.580
But that doesn't cover everything.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.040
So here is the App Store again.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.280
And we have prices there
listed on the right-hand side.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.120
And as I'm sure everyone here knows,
that's the way that people download

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.700
and purchase apps on the App Store.

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.280
But without borders around those prices,
they just look like they're prices.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.260
They just look like they're labels
that you can't interact with.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.780
Even though they have a tint color,
there's some concern that people would

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.740
still not know to press those things.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.770
And as we can all, I'm sure, agree here,
it's really important that people

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.830
who are using the App Store know
how to download and purchase apps.

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:57.660
So the App Store decided that
it was critical that they put

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.550
a border around those buttons.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:06.800
So we ourselves, in apps we've made,
have made this decision to do that

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.500
in situations where it was deemed
important for the usability of the app.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.450
And if you're in the same situation,
where you determine that it's necessary

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.700
to draw a border around a button to make
sure that people know it's interactive,

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.720
then I suggest that you do
something similar to this.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.340
Just draw a one-point outline,
one-point stroke around the border,

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.840
or just fill in the button
shape with a solid color.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.240
Both of those look really good on iOS 7.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.440
They match the design
vernacular of the platform,

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.980
and they're effective in making sure
that people know that things are tapable.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.540
So if we go back to the
WWDC app for a second here,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:46.440
again, this is the login screen that
we were looking at before.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.470
And I could have treated those buttons
in the same way as the App Store did.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.460
But to be honest with you,
this is actually a better design.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.950
Boxes, lines, and shadows.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:09.340
So part of being more deferential
in an app's design is removing

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:16.250
the visual adornments that are
so common in pre-iOS 7 apps.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:18.610
These adornments are
often really unnecessary.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.380
They don't improve usability
or help things out very much.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.500
But if you simply just strip
away these visual adornments,

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.950
it can sometimes leave your
app feeling unstructured.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.280
So let me explain what I'm talking about.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.420
This is just a fake
generic app that I made.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:44.360
But you see a lot of apps that
actually have this type of interface.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.120
So it's a long scrolling view,
and you see a bunch of photos.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.380
And then associated with
each one of those photos,

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:56.460
there's a caption and a timestamp,
maybe some comments,

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.400
some controls for acting on it.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.790
And all of that is grouped
together and clustered together

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:08.820
by the use of a visual device,
by a box which is being drawn around it.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.200
In design, we would call it clustering.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.170
And that clustering allows these things
to come together as one entity and be

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:19.120
separated from other unrelated items.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.860
And this is actually really important.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:26.120
Without that box,
things become really unstructured.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:40.000
[ Transcript missing ]

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.060
Oh, got ahead of myself.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:49.210
So the problem gets even worse if you
make the photos larger so that your

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:52.320
app's interface is more deferential by,
you know,

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.140
allowing the content to come more front
and center by having a larger photo,

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.570
as we do in Mail,
and as you've seen in a lot of other

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:01.520
apps that have shipped for iOS 7.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:06.280
So one solution to this is to increase
the amount of space between each

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.860
of these elements on the screen.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.140
And so that's a bit better,
but the obvious downside here is

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.400
that we're seeing a lot less content.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.390
So we're sort of going
backwards in terms of deference.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:22.890
We're barely seeing maybe
50% of that second photo.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.100
So another solution is to take
some of those elements and

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.720
composite them onto the photos.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.700
That really tightens up
the design considerably.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.990
Now we can see a great deal of
that second photo on the screen.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.450
But everything is
basically really legible.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:46.450
Now, a lot of great apps have taken
this a step further and just

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.800
put everything onto the photo.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.540
And of all the options
that we looked at thus far,

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:55.200
this is by far the most
deferential design.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.140
Every pixel on the screen,
every bit of visual real estate

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.140
that you have is devoted to
displaying content other than,

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.710
of course, the navigation bar.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.970
In fact, it's such a tight,
such a much more tight design that

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:14.420
you can begin to see a third photo
at the bottom of the screen that

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.790
we couldn't have seen before in any
of the other design alternatives.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.480
So I encourage you to explore
this type of direction in your app

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.610
if you have a similar situation.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.450
Okay,
and the last thing I want to talk about,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.530
the look of iOS 7.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.750
I need to pick up a
little bit of time here.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.730
Is that one of the most noticeable
design changes for iOS 7 is the

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.000
use of blurring and translucency.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.780
So we can see that here at the
control center or search results.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.290
And I've seen a lot of designers
who've enthusiastically adopted

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.550
this design characteristic as
they've redesigned for iOS 7.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.430
But I've also seen a lot
of apps that have done this

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.450
for aesthetic purposes only.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:00.230
And that's really not the intention
of using blurring and translucency.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.120
So to explain what I'm talking about,
here's the login panel

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.610
for the WWDC app again.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.220
And let's say that we looked
at this design and we thought,

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.780
you know, this is really too simple.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.420
This is really kind of bare bones,
and we wanted to just

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.960
spice it up a little bit.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.340
So let's take a photo that we have.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.530
There's WWDC, Moscone.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.720
And we're going to take that photo,
we're going to put it

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.020
into the background,
and we'll blur it.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.060
And that's going to add
some more visual interest.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.790
And while that might look
more attractive to some,

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.860
although I don't think
it looks very good,

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.460
it's not a very good design decision.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.850
It's just there for stylistic purposes.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.370
It's just there for aesthetic reasons.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.830
Blurring and translucency on iOS 7
are used with the intent of improving

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:48.560
usability and making the user interface
more deferential to people's content.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.400
So let me show two good examples of that.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.790
Let's bring up the Control Center.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:00.210
When the control center comes up,
it blurs what's behind it.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.300
This is important so you can
really see the home screen,

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:08.050
or whatever your previous context was,
coming through the control center.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.440
So you feel like you haven't
left the home screen.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.010
You've just brought the
control center up on top of it.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:20.940
We haven't left the home screen.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:20.940
We haven't left the calculator when
we bring up the control center.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:32.100
[ Transcript missing ]

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.320
- And I'll just point out too that it
doesn't completely cover the background.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.720
We're still seeing a sliver
of that background there.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.980
It's dimmed, but it's in sharp focus.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:49.300
And that contrast between what's
blurred and what's not blurred really

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.490
helps to sell that visual effect
of the control center being printed

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.850
onto this frosted glass material.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.400
You need to have that contrast
for that effect to work.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.130
So that's improving usability.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.770
It's helping people stay oriented
in their current context.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.700
Now let's look at how blurring
is used in the video player.

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:12.570
So this is how the video player would
look if the backgrounds of these

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:18.420
playback control bars were totally
opaque and had no translucency.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.160
And as you can see here,
the video image looks squished.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.330
It looks small.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.210
It's confined.

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:24.760
Doesn't have enough space.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.490
And in a video player interface,
that's the one thing that you care about.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.660
It's the video image and, of course,
the sound.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:36.760
So that's why blurring and
translucency are used here.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:40.000
It allows that color and
that visual information to

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.420
come through the interface.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.760
And it allows the interface
itself to not seem so heavy so

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.150
that it's not occluding important
information from the background.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.480
And then blurring is critical
here because without blurring,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.520
you wouldn't be able to see the controls
that are being presented to you.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.550
So that's the intention around
blurring and translucency.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.920
Other uses of blurring
and translucency really,

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.580
again, are just there for eye candy.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.170
So again,
coming back to the login screen,

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:12.050
the use of blurring and translucency
does nothing here to improve

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:15.540
usability or make the interface
more deferential to content.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.700
Okay.

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.390
So that's the look of iOS 7.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.300
Now on to, I think,
what's the more interesting

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.990
part of this talk,
which is the feel of iOS 7.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:31.790
Animation is a key aspect
of what defines iOS 7.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:35.170
iOS 7's user interface is highly dynamic.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:40.300
Animation is used to establish
and to reinforce hierarchy.

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:46.720
Interactions like scrolling your
messages is a playful experience,

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.750
feels physically realistic.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.950
And interfaces like this one for the
home screen seem to have real depth.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.540
The icons float above the wallpaper.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.630
There's distance between
those two layers.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.440
And two big technological
innovations have enabled this

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:10.710
shift towards using more animation.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.710
Dynamics and motion effects.

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.340
Dynamics is essentially a physics-based
engine for animating different views.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:20.460
It's what enabled the camera bounce
interaction on the lock screen.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.720
With dynamics, views can respond to
gravitational forces.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.600
They can collide with each other.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.120
They can snap to specific
points on the screen.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.860
They can be pushed by external forces.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.430
Objects, views,
can have... You can control

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:39.490
properties like friction,
density, elasticity,

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.510
and other properties.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:46.440
And motion effects is what
enables that home screen parallax

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:51.630
effect and the realistic movement
of alerts and Safari tabs in a

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.470
convincing three-dimensional space.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:02.440
And a big reason for this is
to make iOS feel more lifelike,

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:04.570
to feel more realistic.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.960
Now, realism previously used to be
conveyed through visual effects,

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:14.050
like highlights and shadows, textures,
reflections.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:18.890
But that approach to establishing
realism has its limits.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:40.100
[ Transcript missing ]

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.040
Realism in iOS 7 is conveyed
through kinetic realism.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:50.490
iOS 7 feels more lifelike
because of the way things move

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:55.850
in response to your touch,
in response to how you hold the device.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.880
Now, how things feel is
tremendously important.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.930
Let's put aside software interface
design for a second and just talk

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:06.740
about our experience with the
physical world and physical products.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.260
Let's take an iPad, for example.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.290
What do you know about an iPad?

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:14.840
You learn a few things
based on how it looks.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.790
You can tell what its color is.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.960
You can maybe tell something about its
material properties and how big it is.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.310
But you learn much more when
you hold an iPad in your hand.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:26.760
You feel its weight.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.740
You feel that it's light.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:33.000
You feel the materials as you move
your finger across the surface of it,

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.810
so you know how they're finished.

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:36.210
You know what it's made of.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.200
It doesn't warp in your hand,
so you know that it's durable.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.810
You know that it was designed
and manufactured with great

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.000
care and attention to detail.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.860
When you press a button,
pressing a physical button

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.920
is really important.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.820
It should be a very
satisfying experience.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:56.160
It shouldn't have too much resistance,
but it shouldn't be too

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.500
easy to press either.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:02.040
When you press a button,
it shouldn't shift around, feel loose.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.920
It should just kind of
go right in and out.

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.940
And because of that,
because of that tactile experience that

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.720
you have when you interact with an iPad,
you learn about its quality.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.810
You learn about its true nature,
its real characteristics.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.300
Thank you.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.410
So more than ever,
we're able to consider some of

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.580
those same factors when it comes
to software interface design.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:30.240
Dynamics and motion effects have
really enabled this shift in UI design.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:34.960
Conveying a sense of kinetic realism
is going to be a key differentiator

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.780
for next-generation apps.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.140
And I encourage you to
explore these things,

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.280
to play with animation and dynamics,
motion effects.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.100
They'll help your app to stand out.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.020
But it's important to
use these tools wisely.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.320
And we've all seen animations that are
completely and totally superfluous.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.550
And animation for the sake of
animation gets old really quickly,

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.800
while animations that improve
usability will stand the test of time.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.990
So with that in mind,
I've put together nine guidelines

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:07.320
to keep in mind when thinking
about the feel of iOS 7.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:14.820
Now, the first one is that sometimes
animations are not helpful.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.400
They're not appropriate.

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.200
Pressing a button can
be an example of that.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:22.920
When you tap on a button,
you want it to highlight immediately

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.700
so you get instant confirmation
that you pressed the button

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.410
that you had intended to press.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.990
If it took time for the button
to respond in its highlight,

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:37.390
the app would feel
sluggish and unresponsive.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:40.900
You wouldn't get that
instantaneous confirmation.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.600
Okay, so show restraint.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:50.270
Next up, animation is really great
at keeping people oriented.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.240
So in the real world,
if we're looking at this box

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:57.190
here on the left-hand side,
it doesn't suddenly disappear from

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:59.960
the left and appear over on the right.

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:02.220
That would be teleportation.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.140
Teleportation's awesome,
and maybe it'll exist one day,

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.860
but it doesn't exist now.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.900
So if things moved in that
way in the real world,

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.920
we'd be really freaked out.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.760
It would feel very strange and unnatural.

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:16.120
In the real world,
we watch that box move from

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.470
one location to another.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:40.100
[ Transcript missing ]

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:44.380
But as simple and as basic as that is,
a lot of user interfaces

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.960
don't act this way.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:49.240
We'll go from one screen to the next,
and we may have certain objects

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.900
that are on all of those screens,
but they just move to different

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.600
locations on the screen or have
different size or appearance.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:59.210
We don't see them move.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.520
So let's see this principle in action.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:03.550
Here's the Photos app.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.100
And I'm going to tap on one
of these photos in a second.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:09.560
And we'll watch that
transition when I do.

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:14.530
Press that photo and it just
scales up right in place.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.900
Gets bigger, it centers on screen.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.230
And that transition,
it's very quick and it's very kind of

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.320
obvious and intuitive that it does that,
but it's really important.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.670
It improves usability because
I immediately know after tapping the

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:32.930
photo that the one I'm looking at is the
same one that I had intended to look at.

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.210
I don't even have to think about it,
I don't have to be conscious about

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:39.280
it or cognitively just check,
am I looking at the right thing?

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.670
It just happens immediately.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:46.120
And when we go back to the grid view,
we see that animation is reversed.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.720
It scales right back down.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:51.450
And we see the photo that we were
looking at has now taken its place

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.460
among the other photos in the grid view.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.620
And so we're immediately
oriented in place,

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.800
and we can move on to the next
photo and the photo after that.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:03.580
And that's just as important for
the usability of the Photos app.

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.790
I was there.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.900
So let's imagine a different
type of animated transition.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.790
Let's say we use a slide transition.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:17.560
So we don't get that immediate
and important usability benefit.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.700
We're not really totally sure
that this is the photo that

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.630
we had intended to press.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:23.810
There's no confirmation.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.480
And again, just reversing that,

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:49.990
So this is a really simple but
powerful UI animation concept.

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:49.990
That same type of direct scale
up and scale down transition

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:49.990
was used all over iOS.

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:49.990
From the home screen to calendar
to the home screen to the desktop.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.800
to the multitasking UI.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.160
This is really consistent.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.930
Works really well.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.900
It's very effective.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.030
Now, spatial relationships.

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:07.920
Because we live in a
three-dimensional world,

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:11.690
two-dimensional computer
interfaces can feel pretty flat.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:17.630
iOS 7 uses animation to create
a sense of physical space.

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.590
The best example of this
is the multitasking UI.

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:23.980
Let's watch that animation occur.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.580
What's going on here?

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:29.240
I wanted to understand this a bit better.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.320
So I created this little animation.

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:34.850
Now we're looking at Weather App.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:37.980
We're going to go into
the multitasking UI.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.010
And as we do, we feel like we're stepping
back from the weather app,

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:48.100
and that's the reason why we can see some
of these other apps that are near it.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.110
When that, through that animation,
we get a sense of a spatial

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:56.290
relationship with the various
apps that are currently running.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.540
We feel a sense of
distance and proximity.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.500
Things are closer or farther away.

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:05.640
Not only that,
we get a sense of a spatial

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:09.920
relationship between the applications,
and that they're ordered

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.220
based on recency.

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.540
And again,
having that spatial model and imparting

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:17.590
that spatial model on the people that
use your app is really important to do.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:21.260
Animation is a powerful way
of creating these spatial

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.880
relationships for an interface,
specifically because it's a

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.740
really natural way for us to
understand what's going on,

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.210
and it makes it more memorable.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:38.840
Animations are also a really fantastic
way of providing feedback to people

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:44.140
using your app without needing
to display status text or alerts.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:47.230
So let me share a couple of
really good examples of this.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:52.360
First up is the focus and exposure
indicator from the camera app.

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.160
Now let's look at what's going on here.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.780
There's three parts of this animation.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:01.000
This indicator does three
really important things.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.860
By first appearing and then scaling down,
it's telling you it's locking on a

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:10.360
specific part of the image to reference
for setting the exposure and focus.

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:14.140
And because it's scaling down,
it feels like it's getting more precise,

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:15.070
which is a good thing.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:17.400
We want it to be precise.

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:23.060
When it stops scaling, it quickly pulses,
and then it fades away.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:26.480
By pulsing and fading away,
it's telling you that it's

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:31.390
completed the process of focusing
and setting the exposure.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.420
and that it's ready for
you to now take a photo.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.760
So that's a lot of information
which is communicated through a

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.860
very simple and quick animation.

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:45.460
Next up,
let's talk about the lock screen.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:51.630
So when you enter in your passcode,
but you do so incorrectly, it animates.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:55.060
sort of shakes his head no and says, "No,
that's not the right password.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:58.230
I'm going to clear out the gibberish
that you just entered in here,

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:02.840
and I'm going to let you try
again," all without saying a word.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.940
So as many of you know,
this animation was initially

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:09.460
debuted on the Mac platform,
and it was so successful there

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.740
that it was brought over to iOS.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:17.270
Again, an animation which is elegant and
improves usability in this way is

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.890
going to stand the test of time.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:25.230
Animation is also really great
at focusing our attention.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:29.160
We are predisposed to fixate
on and track moving objects.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.160
We can't help it, right?

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.420
It's in our nature.

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:36.820
That is why animation is so good
at drawing our attention to a

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.250
specific area of the screen.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:44.530
Animations are a powerful way
of notifying us that something

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:48.560
requires our attention and telling
us where we should be looking at now.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.480
So, for example,
the left-to-right highlight of the slide

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.430
to unlock control on the lock screen

00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:01.000
draws your attention to the single
most important part of this interface,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.240
which is the instructions for
how to unlock the screen and

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.500
proceed with using your phone.

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:09.650
Now, how you animate something
is really important when

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.330
focusing people's attention.

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:14.770
You may have multiple
elements moving at once,

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:18.960
and so to draw people's attention
to a specific part of the screen,

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:22.910
you should be cognizant of the fact
that elements that animate that are

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:26.600
bigger are going to draw your attention
more than ones that are smaller.

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.560
So I'm going to play
this animation again.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:32.830
This is what happens when you tap on the
unified search field in the Safari app.

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:35.100
And what you'll see is
inside of the search field,

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.280
it kind of scales and
morphs a little bit.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.930
But your attention is drawn down
to the bottom part of the screen

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.220
because the bookmarks animating
in and the keyboard sliding up,

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.920
those are much bigger animations,
much more noticeable ones.

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:48.220
And that's great.

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:51.260
For this-- situation,
because that's where you

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.900
want to be looking at next.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.890
Let's watch that again.

00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:59.190
Now, I mean, I don't know about you,
but my attention is

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.600
brought to the keyboard,
which totally makes sense.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:05.000
That might not be the
situation in your app.

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:08.090
So if that's the case,
where you happen to have larger elements

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:11.340
that are taking people's attention
away from where they should be looking,

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.130
stagger the ending time of animations.

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.830
The last animation,
the last thing animating,

00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:21.270
is probably going to be the one
that's attracting your attention.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.280
Okay.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:29.040
So when something animates,
when we watch something move,

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:34.430
not only can you track the object better,
but you get a sense of what it's made of.

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.940
And in iOS 7's built-in apps,
you'll find a lot of views and objects

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.240
seem to squish and bounce when they move.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.780
Consider that lock screen
bounce for the camera.

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:48.910
When the screen drops down,
it bounces off the bottom

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.700
edge of the screen.

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:54.010
The lock screen appears to be made
of some kind of elastic material,

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:57.930
and it's colliding with the surface,
which is rigid and immovable.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:59.930
It's solid.

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:01.890
So let's let it go.

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:10.050
These physical behaviors are what
makes iOS 7 feel more lifelike.

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:15.310
Dynamics can help you add these sorts of
subtle touches to your app's interface.

00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:18.440
But before you start writing
a single line of code,

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.220
consider the emotional response
that you want to elicit.

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:26.240
Even with a simple drop animation,
a lot can be expressed

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.470
just by how objects move.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.760
So perhaps you have an app that's
really serious and you use the same type

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.180
of animation that we just looked at.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:37.500
Well,
it might not feel appropriate to have

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.230
a playful and bouncing animation.

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:43.920
It might feel a bit out of place
for something that's so serious.

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:49.090
Instead, this box should feel as
though it's heavy and dense,

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:52.580
rigid, so it barely bounces at all.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.500
Maybe it shouldn't even bounce.

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:57.470
It just drops to the
bottom and lands there.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.000
Let's consider a different type of app.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.560
Maybe you're making an app for
children and you want something

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.800
which is just over the top,
fun and playful.

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:07.540
Those other two are kind of boring.

00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:11.180
Maybe it shouldn't fall linearly.

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:14.100
It should bounce around a
little bit and slide into place.

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.260
That's much more fun.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:21.010
Or maybe you're trying to convey a
sense of technical sophistication.

00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:23.410
So when we let this go,

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.020
All right.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.020
It's not -- we don't just
drop the box onto the ground.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.020
We're lowering it with care.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.020
And when it gets close to the ground,
it's pulled and snaps right into place.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.020
It feels very precise.

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:41.590
Finally, maybe you're trying to go
with something that has more

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.030
of a light and ethereal feel.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:48.390
So when we let this box go,
it floats down.

00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:52.800
gets pushed up,
then finally comes to rest.

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:54.890
All right, these are just a few examples.

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:58.880
There's a lot of stuff you can do with
animation that gives a sense of what

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.910
this simple white square is made of.

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:08.430
Now, this is probably pretty obvious,
but it's worth pointing out anyway.

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.900
Speed is really important
when it comes to animation.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:16.410
People don't want to feel like they're
waiting for an animation to complete.

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:18.770
We'll just let that finish there.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.270
As a general guideline with UI animation,
you want to try to keep

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.650
animations under a second,
if possible.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:29.360
It's OK to take a little bit
more time in some situations.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.950
In fact,
this animation took about two seconds.

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:34.790
But that was the shortest time
it could be to complete that

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:36.860
animation and still feel natural.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.980
And the box had quite
a distance to travel.

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:43.140
Now, also, animations can be too quick.

01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:48.710
Overly fast animations don't give you
enough time to process what's going on.

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:51.750
It can feel just like a bug, basically.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.660
So keep in mind also that
animations start to feel slower

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.960
the more times we see them.

01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:01.440
So when you're coming to
making final decisions around

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.840
the timing of an animation,
make sure you defer that

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.460
decision as long as possible.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.500
You really want to live with
animations for a while before

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.460
you make those final decisions.

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.950
Now, in the real world,
objects don't tend to move at

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.230
a perfectly even rate of speed.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.200
So when things move-- and
then we call that easing,

01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:26.760
you know, slowing up and slowing down.

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:32.110
So when things move without easing,
they can seem really unnatural.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.890
It's useful to consider why something
is moving in the way that it is when

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:38.860
it comes to thinking about easing.

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:42.660
So even if something moves like this
without any ease in or ease out,

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:47.300
that can make sense if we imagine
that it's on this conveyor belt.

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:48.500
But typically that's not the case.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.770
Usually some type of easing
is helpful and welcomed when

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:54.560
it comes to UI animation.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.860
So let's look at a simple
ease out animation.

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.140
So this is going to move really
quickly right away and then slow

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:02.000
into place when it comes to a stop.

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:04.750
And it has a really different feel to it.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.170
We understand the physical dynamics
of why it's moving and why it's

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:11.500
slowing down in the way that it is.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:17.730
To me, it suggests that this block is
being pushed by some external force.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.090
It's invisible,
but it's still acting on the block.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.160
Let's consider an ease in.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.340
That has a different feel to it.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:29.100
To me, it suggests that this box is
being attracted to an invisible

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:33.070
magnet and stopping because
it's colliding with a wall.

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:34.640
Or the magnet.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.450
And then there's a combination
of ease in and ease out.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.640
So why is the box moving
the way that it is?

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:40.870
Maybe it has some wheels.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.440
It's driving itself there and
has to speed up and slow down

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:46.670
when it gets to its destination.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:48.720
And things start to get more
interesting when you begin to

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.330
chain these animations together.

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:53.820
So here's two ease outs in a row.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:58.210
Pull back, go forward.

01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:58.210
All right.

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:02.840
So we understand why things are
moving in the way that they're moving,

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.760
even if we can't see the forces
that are acting upon them.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:11.270
Now finally, some words of advice
about motion effects.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.310
You want to be subtle
with motion effects,

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.470
specifically the use of
motion effects for parallax.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.790
Motion effects are what
allowed us to accomplish this

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.310
effect on the home screen,
to have that real sense of depth.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.360
But it's really easy
to overdo this effect,

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.000
so you want to proceed with caution.

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:33.960
Now,
we imagine what's going on with Parallax.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.780
We have these different layers
which have some depth between them.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.380
And if they have too
much depth between them,

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.500
if objects are too far
or too close to us,

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.450
when we move the device around,
they're going to swing around wildly.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:46.670
All right?

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.580
Swinging things moving around wildly
on the screen is typically not such

01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:52.740
a good thing for a user interface.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.650
So with motion effects,
a little bit of depth is

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.220
going to go a long way.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.550
So we bring those layers
closer to each other,

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:02.090
and we still have a great sense of depth,
but things aren't going

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.590
off screen immediately.

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:08.940
You can also put some things
above the surface and below

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.980
the surface so you get a lot of
relative movement between layers,

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:15.700
but not in relation to the screen.

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:18.700
And if things are really important
and you want to make sure that

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.900
they're staying in a fixed location,
then put them on the surface and move

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:29.570
other elements behind them to give that
sense of depth while still maintaining

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:34.580
elements in the consistent location.

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:37.740
So Dave DeLong, the next session,
which you guys will be

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.180
about to go through,
is going to go into a lot of

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.030
detail about motion effects.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.700
All right,
so just some quick final thoughts.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.660
Just keep in mind that
everything I talked about,

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.770
all these guidelines,
are really a foundation for how

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.680
to approach designing for iOS 7.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.210
What you do for your app will vary.

01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:57.340
Each app is different,
and so what's appropriate

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.620
for each app is different.

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.400
What works well for one doesn't
work so well for the other.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.420
And keep in mind that the best
designs are the products of tremendous

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:07.560
experimentation and iteration.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:12.060
It takes hundreds, if not thousands,
of iterations to come up with a truly

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:14.380
great icon or layout or animation.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.100
And also remember that design
is a process of discovery,

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.530
so try out a lot of different ideas
and executions of those ideas until

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.960
you find the one that's just right.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:28.760
And most importantly, simplify, simplify,
simplify.

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:33.750
If something isn't critically
essential for your app's interface,

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:34.400
cut it.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.500
That's going to give you more
time to focus on the features.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.020
The ones that you retain,
the ones that are the most important,

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:44.020
so you can do the best job designing
those limited set of features

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.870
and make a truly great iOS 7 app.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.620
Thank you very much for your time,
and I'll turn it over

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.200
to the next speaker.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.490
Thank you.
