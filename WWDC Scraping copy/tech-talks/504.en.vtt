00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.037
Welcome to the Apple TV
Distribution Program Overview.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.772
This program is for TV providers

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.741
that are interested
in partnering with Apple

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.277
to distribute Apple TVs
to customers

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:13.046
as an over-the-top set top box
replacement.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.015
So let's get started.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.418
In this video we'll go through
the Zero Sign-On user experience

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.421
and how to support it
with the authentication context,

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.423
VideoSubscriberAccount
framework,

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.326
and the set top box APIs.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.195
The Apple TV
Distribution Program

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.697
enables Apple TV
to become the center

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.634
of your customers' content
consumption experience.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.002
During Apple TV setup,

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.271
your TV provider brand
is promoted

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:40.941
and the Apple Zero Sign-On
user experience is enabled.

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:42.209
Customers are presented

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.044
with a welcome screen
to your service

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.913
informing them
of the automatically

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:47.648
authenticated account

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:50.517
and the TV provider app
to be installed.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.953
This allows customers
to have a seamless experience

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.088
with your service
so they can watch video

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.657
right out of the box.

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:59.326
Oh, and one more thing,
all of these features work

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:03.063
even if the customer
doesn't have an iTunes account.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.631
So that's Zero Sign-On.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.867
Next,
the authentication context.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:09.536
The technology at the center
of all of these features

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.972
is your authentication context.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.141
It is what allows customers
to sign-in

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.477
to your TV provider service
at the OS level.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.313
This system-level authentication

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:21.882
is then leveraged to provide
seamless authentication

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.216
to your application

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.319
and any other
TV provider-supported apps

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.087
on device.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.323
The authentication context
is a web service

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:32.192
hosted on your server
that is downloaded to device

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.227
and executed at run time.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.997
It is built using JavaScript
and XML,

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:38.699
and a single
authentication context

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.935
runs on both iOS and tvOS.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.971
With authentication
at the system level,

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:47.307
customers only have to sign in
once with Single Sign-On

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.977
or not at all with Zero Sign-On.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.812
That's authentication context.

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.880
Next is the
VideoSubscriberAccount

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.649
framework.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.517
This framework
is what allows your app

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.820
and any other
TV provider-supported apps

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.422
to communicate with your
authentication context

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:05.959
to request its
app-level authentication.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.027
When integrating with

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:08.495
the VideoSubscriberAccount
framework,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.330
it's important to remember
that you're dealing

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.033
with authentication
at two different levels.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.801
You will need to request
authentication

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.670
from the system for your app.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.971
From that point forward,

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.506
your app's authentication state

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.376
needs to mirror the system
authentication state.

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:24.244
This requires special attention

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:28.015
for all the different UI and
UX flows coming into your app.

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:30.283
Once implemented,
you will deliver your apps

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.620
to the Apple Media Products
video team via TestFlight

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.555
for a final QA sign-off.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.624
This is required before
submitting the app

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:41.661
to App Store review
for approval and release.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.064
That's VideoSubscriberAccount
framework.

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:46.400
Last are the set top box APIs,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.235
they are what enable Apple TV

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.637
to know which TV provider
to feature.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.239
They also allow TV providers

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.941
without an in-home
auto-authentication solution

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.045
to automatically
authenticate customers.

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:01.448
Apple TVs distributed by you
will feature your TV service

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:04.117
to customers
in the setup process.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.486
In this same screen,
customers are informed

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:10.557
of the auto-authenticated
account and app to be installed.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:13.894
The set top box APIs are a
server-to-server communication

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:18.065
used to assign to and remove
profiles from devices.

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.700
The APIs will only work
with Apple TVs

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.438
purchased from Apple
for distribution by you.

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:27.007
So that's the set top box APIs.

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.576
Through Zero Sign-On,
the authentication context,

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.311
the VideoSubscriberAccount
framework

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.146
and set top box APIs,

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.382
the Apple TV
Distribution Program

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.617
enables Apple TV
to become the center

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.353
of your customers'
TV experience.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:43.290
In summary, the Apple
TV Distribution Program

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.158
highlights your TV provider
brand,

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:48.261
it promotes your applications
to the customer,

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:51.198
and eliminates the sign-in
process for your customers

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:54.101
enabling Apple Zero Sign-On.

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.836
The Apple TV
Distribution Program

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.904
and Zero Sign-On are a win-win

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.140
because your customers
get a customized,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.708
streamlined experience

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.343
and you get
more visible promotion

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.579
in the Apple TV experience.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.614
Thank you.
