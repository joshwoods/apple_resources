WEBVTT

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.550
Hi, everyone.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.210
My name is Alex Rofman.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.640
I hope you're all having a good day.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.260
I manage a team of people back in
Cupertino whose responsibility it is to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.580
help you be successful on the App Store.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.760
So I'll kick off our lunchtime
session with some tips and

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.140
tricks to help you do so.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.550
Then I'll pass it off to my colleague,
Steve McGuigan, who will talk to you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.000
about App Store marketing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.190
And then our colleague, Shannon Bruce,
will give you some tips and

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.730
tricks on iTunes Connect.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.950
So let's get started
with a business update.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.080
2013 has been a fantastic
year for the App Store.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.080
In May, the 50 billionth app was
downloaded from the store.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.560
And then in October, at our iPad event,
we announced that the 60

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.960
billionth app had been downloaded,
nearly half of which happened

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.020
in the prior 12 months.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.300
Tremendous momentum behind the business.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.790
2013 has been a fantastic
year for the App Store.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.000
In May, the 50 billionth app was
downloaded from the store.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.120
And then in October, at our iPad event,
we announced that the 60

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.370
billionth app had been downloaded,
nearly half of which happened

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.100
in the prior 12 months.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.100
Tremendous momentum behind the business.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.540
This is a statistic that we're perhaps
most proud of for a number of reasons.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.270
First, none of the competitive
services have announced a single

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.230
figure about how much you,
developers, are making distributing your

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.700
apps on their platforms.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.730
And we understand that for you
to continue to invest in iOS,

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.260
there needs to be a
return on your investment.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.490
So we couldn't be prouder that this
number keeps going up and to the right.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.860
And then in July,
the App Store celebrated

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.500
its fifth birthday.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.750
I joined the team in July of 2009,
59 billion downloads ago and billions

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.820
and billions and billions of dollars ago.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.700
It's really incredible to think
that the business has only

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.260
been around for five years.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.970
We hope you're as excited as we
are about what the next five years

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.660
of the App Store might bring.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.210
There are 575 million accounts
associated with the App Store,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.060
most of which have credit
cards tied to them,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.660
which gives you as developer an
unprecedented opportunity to acquire

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.600
customers from all over the world.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.460
The App Store catalog now stands
at more than one million apps with

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.810
thousands more added on a weekly basis.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.030
And when you look at just games,
there are 180,000 games

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.420
available in the store,
100,000 of which are made for the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.600
beautiful larger palette of the iPad.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.240
Taking a look at the App Store catalog
by content type for games,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.840
we see that 45% of games available
in the store are iPhone only,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.210
13% are iPad only,
and 41% are what we call universal apps,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.580
where one download works on
all of a customer's devices.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.820
The catalog is tremendously active with
more than 90% of all apps available

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.080
downloaded on a monthly basis.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.140
And there's tremendous
velocity in this business.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.060
More than 800 apps are
downloaded every second.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.120
To give you a sense of scale,
by the end of our lunchtime session,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.210
nearly 4.5 million apps will have
been downloaded by App Store customers

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.890
from around the world.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.360
So that's the business update.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.210
Next,
I want to give you a quick overview of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.880
the App Store to help you understand how
the business is structured and managed.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.660
The App Store is a global
business available in 155

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.920
countries around the world.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.560
But this is not just about
a distribution footprint.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.310
There's a real revenue opportunity
for developers to distribute

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.550
their apps all over the world.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.700
61% of Apple's revenue comes
from outside the United States.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.430
And this is a vastly different
percentage than from when

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.690
before the App Store launched.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.380
All across the world we have hand-curated
stores programmed in the local language

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.680
where local currency is accepted.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.800
Here's our North and
South American stores.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.290
Here's our European stores.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:36.800
[ Transcript missing ]

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.600
As I said, the way we do that is by
curating the App Store.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.440
Here's a couple screenshots
from the App Store.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.330
You see the featured page on the left,
the games category page,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.680
which is one of 24 category
pages programmed and curated in

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.600
major markets around the world.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.450
And then on the right,
you see the Design for iOS 7 collection,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.580
which is one of dozens and dozens
of thematic and seasonal collections

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.680
that have every app that someone
might need for a particular topic.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.300
On the iPad, same curation,
just more real estate

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.410
for more great apps.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.280
On a weekly basis,
our editors around the world are choosing

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.740
the best apps and the best games and
denoting them as editor's choice.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.410
Here's a few recent selections.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.770
And also on a weekly basis,
we curate what we call the

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.170
Free App of the Week program,
where a well-localized paid game or

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.020
app that's universal is made available
for free for our customers to download.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.800
Apple waives its commissions
as part of this program.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.640
The developer waives its
royalties as part of this program.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.000
And customers around the world
have really enjoyed getting a great

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.700
piece of paid content for free.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.150
Here's three more pages
from the App Store.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.880
Charts page, recently launched popular
Near Me page in the center,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.550
and a search results page on the right.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.770
These pages are not
curated on the App Store.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.660
The business is five years old.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.500
We work with thousands and
thousands of developers.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.220
Not a week goes by when
we don't get the question,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.040
how do I improve the placement
of my app in search results?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.420
And while keywords have some impact
in where your app shows up when

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.770
a user searches for something,
the most important thing that you as

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.820
a developer can do is build something
great that our customers love and the

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.800
algorithms will take care of the rest.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.540
So to give you a quick overview of
the App Store editorial process,

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.650
first and foremost,
our selections are based on

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.970
quality and quality alone.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.970
There is no paid placement
in the App Store.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.450
We've never accepted any money
for placement in the store

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.810
and we have no plans to do so.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.660
The process of choosing apps to feature
is separate from the app review process.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.640
Apps are approved or rejected
based on their adherence to our

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.530
App Store review guidelines.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.450
Just because your app is approved,
however,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.090
does not mean that it will be featured.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.660
We consider apps from all 24 categories
with a particular focus on new apps

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.800
or apps with significant updates.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.840
And lastly,
while newly approved apps are added

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.980
to the store on a continual basis,
new featured content is added

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.230
to the store on a weekly basis,
typically Thursdays.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.360
So that's the App Store overview.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.380
Next, let's dig into some best practices.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.080
So first, your App Store presence.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.250
This is your app name, your app icon,
your screenshots, your description,

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.340
and your keywords.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.130
In many cases,
the first introduction of your

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.350
brand to App Store customers.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.900
If your head's down in development,
it's very easy to overlook these things,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.090
but with a little bit
of time and attention,

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.150
they're not very difficult to do well.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.740
So let's take a look at
Clash of Clans as an example.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:02.210
The name, short, unique, memorable,
with no keywords or

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.460
descriptives attached to it.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.810
The icon,
incredibly and beautifully designed,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:13.060
stands out on a user's home screen
and is instantly recognizable.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.740
Next,
let's take a look at their screenshots.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.580
Your screenshots should tell a story.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.260
You should avoid distracting
overlays or graphics.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.560
And you can see here,
while the Clash of Clans game has

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.120
a lot going on in the game screens,
they put these nice banners at the

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:33.140
top that explain to the user what
each screenshot is meant to represent.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.790
Wage epic battles.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.070
Coordinate attacks with your clan.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.540
Fight against goblins or other players.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.870
Dominate the realm.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.920
So real concise and clear
messaging to the customer about

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.600
what their experience might be if
they start using Clash of Clans.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.880
Next, let's take a look at
their app description.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.450
Lead your clan to victory.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.240
Clash of Clans is an epic
combat strategy game.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.880
Build your village, train your troops,
and battle with thousands

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.470
of other players online.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.800
So this is taken from the product page in
the iPhone app store for Clash of Clans.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.160
It's optimized for the device.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.510
The first three or four
lines are most important.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.300
You shouldn't require the user to tap on
the more button to learn about your game.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.660
This game has received many,
many accolades.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.960
The game has been named for its success
by the Chinese and American players.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.710
It's a game that's been recognized by
the world for its high performance,

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.220
and it's a game that's been recognized
by the world for its high performance.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.850
It's a game that's been recognized by
the world for its high performance.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.190
It's a game that's been recognized by
the world for its high performance.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.120
It's a game that's been recognized by
the world for its high performance.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.550
It's a game that's been recognized by
the world for its high performance.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.560
It's a game that's and also
be purchased for real money.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.320
If you don't want to use this feature,
please disable in-app purchases

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.980
in your device's settings.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.340
This is not necessary,
but this is just a real great

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.550
message to send to customers who
might not be familiar with the

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.420
free to play model and might not be
familiar with how to turn off in-app

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.030
purchasing in their device's settings.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.430
Next, let's take a look at keywords.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.400
So I can't share with you what
Clash of Clans keywords are

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.870
because they're confidential,
but let's look at some sample

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.150
keywords for a word game.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:17.650
So word, word games, spell, spelling,
letter, letters, and scrabble.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.160
These are not very good keywords for
the App Store for a number of reasons.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.340
So first,
you see the word word is duplicated.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.300
You also don't need to include
the category name as a keyword.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.040
Our system handles that.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.280
You also don't need to include plural.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.080
So you see letter and letters here.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.240
Include the singular,
our system will handle the plural.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.740
And then in terms of using
third-party names like scrabble,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.330
it's only okay to use the name
of a third-party in your keyword

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.320
if your app or game uses an
API provided by that third-party.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.980
So here's a much better,
much stronger set of

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.640
keywords for a word game.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.540
Word, letter, spell, board, dictionary,
friend, family, and alphabet.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.470
So again, that's your App Store presence.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.850
Your name, your icon, your screenshots,
your description, and your keywords.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.600
Not very challenging to do well with
just a little time and attention.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.100
So next I want to talk
about business models.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.700
And the first business model advice we
have for you is to build a universal app.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.950
Yes, this is a product decision,
but it's also a business decision

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.990
as well for a number of reasons.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.250
First,
our customers love the convenience of

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.620
being able to download a single app
that works on all of their devices

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.920
as shown in this animation here.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.700
And looking back at the App Store games
catalog by content type,

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.730
while we see growth in all key metrics,
catalog size, sales,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.280
and downloads for iPhone apps, iPad apps,
and universal apps,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.560
by far we see the highest growth for
universal apps because our customers

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.960
are responding to that convenience.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.750
The data also shows that customers are
not inclined to download or purchase

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.140
two separate versions of the same title.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.190
So next, how do you choose the right
business model for your product?

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.530
So there's no single piece of
advice that I can stand up here

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.070
and give you that applies to every
product you guys are building

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.600
or already have in the App Store.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.860
But my goal is to give you
a few key takeaways to help

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.410
you make a better decision.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.500
So here are three of the
possible business models

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.480
available to you in the store.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.640
On the left, you see a free only product.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.870
Typically,
these are ad supported or meant to

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.800
support broader brand strategies.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.530
And often, very often,
we see developers with ad supported games

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:40.270
put a remove ads in app SKU into their
product and that's their business model.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.620
Well, as you'll see a little bit
later in my freemium discussion,

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.630
that doesn't make your app freemium.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.860
There's no chance for ongoing
monetization if that's

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.180
the only way to do it.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.120
In the center, paid apps.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.100
There's a lot of chatter on the
blogs and in the media that the

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.950
market for paid apps and paid
games on the App Store is dead.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.560
And as someone who looks at this data
every day for the last four plus years,

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.260
I can tell you that's flat out not true.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.890
Paid titles still represent a significant
portion of the App Store business.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.240
There's no shortage of customers
willing to pay and seeking

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.120
out that premium experience.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.460
And then on the right,
you see a model we call Paymium,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.180
where the paymium is a model that allows
you to pay for the app you're using.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:48.400
There's no shortage of customers
willing to pay for the app you're using.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160
And then on the left,
you see a model we call Paymium,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.160
where the paymium is a model that allows
you to pay for the app you're using.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.280
Freemium is a business model where a
product or service is provided for free,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.940
but money is charged
for advanced features,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.150
functionality, or virtual goods.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.750
So to my point about a remove
ads in app SKU in a game,

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.270
that doesn't really fit
with this definition.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.590
And freemium is a model that
many developers are seeing

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.740
success with in the store.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.370
Puzzle games, racing games,
time management games.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.660
But looking at the games catalog
broken down by business model,

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.360
you can see more than 75% of games
available in the App Store have a

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.180
business model that is not freemium.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.770
It is not the right
model for every product.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.170
And while I'm sure you notice the success
of freemium games on the top grossing

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.680
charts on the App Store in particular,
what you don't notice is that the

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:36.680
app store is not a business model.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.060
What you don't see are all the well done,
highly rated games that chose

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.900
the wrong business model and
never made it onto the charts.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.950
So again,
my goal here is to help you make a

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.440
good decision if you're considering
freemium as your business model.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.520
To help you do so,
we've developed a framework that involves

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.210
three questions that you should consider.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:01.820
The first, what are your target
market's expectations?

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.150
So what I mean here is from
a business model perspective,

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.680
don't try to fit a square
peg into a round hole.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.850
To explain what I mean,
let me walk you through a few examples.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.440
So let's take Scrabble.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.310
Scrabble is a brand that has existed
in the physical world for many,

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.400
many decades.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:24.470
The target market expectations
for a brand like Scrabble are

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.370
that it's a premium product.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.360
You pay a single price and you can
play Scrabble as many times as you

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.160
want with as many people as you want.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.600
In contrast, if you look at racing games
or time management games,

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.280
there are expectations among
gamers of those types of games

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.460
that through skill and experience,
they can acquire enhancements

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.440
or expand their game.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.060
So make sure your business
model fits with what your

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.870
target market might expect.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.800
As we walk through this discussion,
let's take a look at the

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.140
funnel for downloads.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.300
So at the top, you see downloads.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.620
This is your target market.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:06.120
Being free will not make everyone
in the world download your app,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.000
but it may expand your reach
within your target market.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.640
The next question in the
framework is can you segment the

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.540
experience between free and paid?

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.490
If as a developer running a
business you decide that you're not

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.250
interested in acquiring free users,
that's completely fine.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.800
Just don't choose freemium as your model.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.070
The most successful freemium products
and apps and games in the store are

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.250
providing a tremendous amount of
value to both free and paid users.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.530
The reason why is that the
path to monetization in

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.010
freemium is through engagement.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.830
And if you throw up a paywall as
soon as a user launches your game,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.200
you're not giving them a chance to get
engaged and you're not giving yourselves

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.500
a chance to monetize that customer.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.240
So the next piece of
the funnel is retention.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.680
This is the percent of your target market
that is getting some kind of value out

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.830
of your product and continues to use it.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.100
So before I move on to the
final question in the framework,

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.770
let's take a look at the typical
game loop for a freemium game.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.780
At the top, you see action.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.790
This is winning a battle
or winning a race.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.950
Next, you see reward.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.660
Typically in freemium products,
this is currency.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.310
And then you see expansion,
which is you use that currency

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.470
to buy a new car or expand,
buy new tires or buy new

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.410
weapons for your battle.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.720
So what's important,
and the reason I'm sharing this with you

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.780
today is to be successful in freemium,
it is very important to

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:36.780
be successful in freemium.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.810
It is very important that you allow
progression through this game loop

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.830
without requiring users to pay.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.030
That might be a hard thing for people
to swallow if you're running a business,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.630
but again, then freemium might not be
the right model for you.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:56.870
So the last piece of the framework is do
you have a plan to create lasting value?

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.340
This is twofold.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.410
This is your plan as a developer
to have a rich plan for updates,

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.000
content and features updates over time.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.270
And this also relates to the
inherent value of the product itself.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.850
If you're building something that only
has 30 minutes or one hour of gameplay,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.200
there's probably not any
lasting value in that for users.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.300
So freemium is probably not
the right model for you.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.650
Which brings us to the
last piece of the funnel,

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.220
which is conversion.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.510
The percent of those who have retained,
who've decided to pay.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.800
So do the math.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.530
It's incredibly important to
determining whether freemium

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.640
is the right model for you.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.480
If you have a niche game,
you might see a higher retention and a

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.030
higher conversion and a higher average
spread so the math can work out for you.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.100
Or in contrast,
if you're building something

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.950
with broad market appeal,
you might see millions

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.960
and millions of downloads,
but maybe a lower retention,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.260
lower conversion, lower average spread,
but the math can still work out

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.320
because the numbers are so big.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.500
So start with your target market and
do the math from that point forward.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.750
So you've gone through the framework,
you've done the math,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.860
and you've decided that
freemium is right for you.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.020
So what are the next steps?

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.820
So again, first,
identify and focus on your target market.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.170
Have a business model that's
consistent with what your

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.110
target market might expect.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.830
Next, prioritize engagement
before monetization.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:27.190
You're not doing yourself any
service if you throw up a paywall as

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.760
soon as a user launches your game.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.800
Give them a chance to get engaged.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.910
Give them a chance to find
some value out of your product.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:40.200
Incorporate the business model into the
early stages of your product design.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.840
If you've built something great
and beautiful without any regard

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.410
for the business model and at the
11th hour right before you launch,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.580
you put an in-app store in there,
it's not going to feel native or

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.720
natural to customers and chances are,
again, they're not going to get engaged.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.900
So consider the business
model from the very,

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.940
very beginning of your product design.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.640
Track your metrics.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:06.990
And the takeaway here is don't be afraid
to tune your economy if freemium is right

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.720
for you or freemium is not right for you.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.760
Don't be afraid to switch to
a different business model.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.840
Treat your game as a service.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.230
The most successful freemium games
in the store really are treated

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.560
as services by their developers
with constant live updates and

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.890
really endless amounts of value,
entertainment value that gamers

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.400
can get from their products.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.510
And then lastly,
protect and respect our mutual customers.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.710
When I say protect our customers,
if you're building a game

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.980
targeted towards kids,
put yourself in the parents' shoes.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.130
Consider A,
whether freemium's right to begin with,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.170
but if it is,
consider the number of in-app SKUs you

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.580
might make available and consider
whether you need that $99 in-app

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.620
SKU in your kids-focused product.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.510
And then when I talk about
respecting customers,

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.480
this ties back to what I've been saying.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.410
Give them a chance to get engaged.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:02.290
Don't put a paywall in front of them
as soon as they launch your product.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.260
So that's my discussion on freemium.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.600
Next, we'll talk about pricing.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.710
So the App Store runs
under the agency model,

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.140
which means that you as a developer have
sole control over the price of your app.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.590
Our guidance here is twofold.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.430
Price thoughtfully and take
a look at the competition.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.460
If you're building a casual game that's
meant to compete with Angry Birds and

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.240
you want to charge $5 or $10 for it,
chances are you're probably not

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.940
going to do well because the market
for that type of game is $0.99.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:34.180
The other key takeaway here is
that there's a misconception out

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.620
there in the market that the only
two price points that work in

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.480
the App Store are free and $0.99.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.400
And again, as someone who looks
at this data every day,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.450
I can tell you that that's
just flat out not true.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.060
We see many,
many developers of apps and games

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.750
seeing success at higher price points.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.860
Next, consider price promotions, sales.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:56.930
Don't do them all the time.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.130
If you do, customers will constantly be
waiting for that next deal and

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.860
they'll never buy your product.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.290
But well-timed price promotions
are a great way to grow your

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:07.980
business on the App Store.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.740
So a couple last steps before you launch.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.900
First, communicate with Apple.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.040
As I said before,
there's thousands and thousands

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.580
of new apps added to the
App Store on a weekly basis.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.810
If you've built something
you're proud of,

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.370
that you think we should
tell our customers about,

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.170
it always helps to let us know.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.240
So that first email address,
appstorepromotionatapple.com,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.560
is something monitored by my team.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.930
Tell us who you are, what you've built,
and why you think our customers

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.380
would enjoy your product,
and we'll take a look.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.700
The second email address,
appoftheweekatapple.com,

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.640
if you have a well-localized paid
product that you'd like to nominate

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.610
for our App of the Week program,
please send us your information

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.130
at appoftheweekatapple.com.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.610
We'll take a look as well.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.190
Next, plan for app review to take time.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.820
Gone are the days of app
review taking weeks and weeks.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.400
Our published guidance these days is
that roughly 95% of apps are reviewed

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.880
within five business days or less.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.110
That being said,
it's better to be safe than sorry.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.780
So plan for at least
two weeks in app review,

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.260
just in case last minute bug
pops up or you have issues with

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.320
launching your marketing campaign,
things of that nature.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.540
And then the last point here,
my colleague Steve will talk

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.160
about in further detail.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.510
Don't rely on your chances
of being featured by the

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.490
App Store as your marketing plan.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.300
There are many,
many things you can do that

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.540
are within your control.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.260
And as I said, Steve will talk about that
more in just a few minutes.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.260
So you've launched your product.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:40.910
Now what?

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.890
Well, first and foremost,
monitor your ratings and reviews.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.700
App Store customers are incredibly vocal.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.700
They'll tell you what you're doing well.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.280
They'll tell you what you're not doing.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.280
So you've launched your product.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.280
Now what?

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.280
Well, first and foremost,
monitor your ratings and reviews.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.280
App Store customers are incredibly vocal.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.280
They'll tell you what you're doing well.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.300
They'll tell you what
you're not doing well.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.150
You may discover some bugs and you may
get some great ideas for future updates.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.910
Speaking of updates,
launching it and leaving it is not a

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.820
strategy for success in the App Store.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.510
The market is too competitive.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.040
Here's some real data
from Clash of Clans.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.380
Each orange star represents a significant
update they've made to the product.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.150
I had to remove the scale
for confidentiality purposes,

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.500
but I'm sure you all are aware that
this game is pretty successful.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.020
What's interesting to note are
not just the spikes that they

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.860
saw when they updated their game,
but in between the updates,

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.760
there's some flatness
and even in some cases,

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:29.710
some decline.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.920
So well-timed updates are a great
way to build momentum in the store.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.660
Test your apps thoroughly so you
can avoid constant bug fix updates,

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.330
but the right timing for feature-rich
or content-rich updates is

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.080
roughly every four to six weeks.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.900
Next, use push notifications and sharing.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.500
On the left,
you see push notification screen.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.180
Avoid using notifications in a way
that might be perceived as spam

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.040
or marketing by our customers,
but well-timed,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.350
well-written push notifications
are a great way to bring

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.400
people back to your product.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.670
And then on the right,
if people love using your game and

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.300
they're proud of their accomplishments,
use our share sheet functionality

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.160
and make it easy for them
to tell others about it.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.590
Next, monitor your sales and trends.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.100
This might seem obvious,
but you'd be surprised at how

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.100
many people don't do this.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.900
There's a wealth of data available
to you in iTunes Connect.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.920
There's a vibrant ecosystem of third
parties whose existence is to help

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.160
you optimize your business on iOS.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.690
You never know what you might discover,
especially a market where you didn't

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.940
think your app was doing well in,
but it is, and there's a great idea for

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.640
a future update to add the
localization for that market.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.780
So that's my discussion
on best practices.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.250
Next, we'll talk a little
bit about localization.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.610
So as I said before,
the App Store is a global business

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.940
in 155 countries around the world.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.320
So as a developer,
you need to think globally.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.520
There really is an unprecedented
opportunity for you to acquire

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.640
customers from all corners of the globe.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.300
But one size doesn't fit all.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.720
There's lots of cultural and linguistic
differences from country to country.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.340
So to be successful,
you need to not only think globally,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.790
but you need to be local.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.080
And what I mean by that is to localize.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.320
And I want to walk you through the
example of Where's My Water To in

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.570
France to help you understand.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.030
So this is the icon.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.030
So their name in French,
Ma Oue est Swampie Deux.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.220
So it would have been very easy for
them to use the English name in France,

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.740
but they decided not to do that.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.710
They localized the name in
a way that's... that speaks

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.900
directly to French customers.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.620
Next, their app description.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.360
As you probably can tell,
my French is a little bit rusty,

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.220
so I'm not going to read this to you.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.710
But here's the description for
Where's My Water To in French,

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.350
optimized for device,
written in a way that speaks

00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:59.930
directly to French customers.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.300
Their screenshots.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.470
Here's the screenshots from their U.S.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:04.180
App Store.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.220
Would have been very easy
for them to do this because

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.740
they're mostly visual in nature.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.260
But they didn't do it.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.020
They changed the text to French to
speak directly to that market.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.620
So again, localize your app name,
your app description, your screenshots,

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.250
and all of the contents of your app.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.940
There's also something
called culturalization.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.220
And to show you what I mean here,
I have a short video

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.010
that I want to show you.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.110
So this is a trailer for
Need for Speed Online in China.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
The tracks that the cars are
racing through are from China.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
The road signage, the billboards,
they're in Chinese.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.200
The audio, they hired Beijing police to
record the audio for this game.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.080
Chinese gamers love competing
against their friends,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.940
so they built a tournament
mode and leaderboards so they

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.640
could track their progress.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.790
And while culturalization doesn't
necessarily apply to every game,

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:08.460
where there's a fit,
it will absolutely make a difference.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.150
So that's culturalization.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.260
So languages.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.000
Here's the list of recommended
languages for localization if you have

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.640
something that's globally relevant.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.340
English, French, Italian, German,
and Spanish.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.320
The Asian languages,
traditional and simplified Chinese,

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.260
Japanese, and Korean.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.250
Brazilian, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish,
and Arabic.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.270
This is not prioritized,
but this is the group of languages

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:39.900
that we recommend you start with if
you have a globally relevant product.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.600
So let's look at some more data
to show you that localization

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.660
actually does have an impact.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.540
Again, we thank Supercell for letting
us share this data with you.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.080
This is Clash of Clans and
their Chinese localization.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.700
And I had to remove the scale.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.890
They were doing pretty well.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.690
That scale on the left is
not an insignificant number.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.070
But there was no growth.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.140
And at the orange star,
they localized into Chinese.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.250
And look what happened.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.460
3% to 400% sales growth.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.340
In Japan, same thing for Clash of Clans.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.660
A little bit of growth,
not doing quite as well

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.600
as they were in China,
but massive growth when they tune

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.500
their product for the Japanese market.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.400
And let's take a look at the charts.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.650
Here's a recent screenshot
of the charts from China,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.200
Japan, and France.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.590
With all but two exceptions here,
Angry Birds and Clash of Clans

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.130
that have gone the branding
route with their app name,

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.850
not their full apps, just the app name,
every app you see at the top

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.230
of the charts here is localized
for these individual markets.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.810
And on top of that,
our local editors in these markets

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:51.090
have a very strong preference
for promoting localized apps.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.900
So again, think globally, but be local.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.900
And Apple provides a number of
resources to help you to do so.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.280
There's the URL at the top.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.630
You'll find some tips and tricks
for localization on this page,

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.250
as well as a list of third-party
localization vendors if you don't

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:10.800
have the linguistic expertise in-house
to localize into dozens of languages.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.940
So that's my talk on localization.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.740
And last but not least, getting featured.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.840
So first and foremost,
focus on what you can control,

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.620
and that's building something great
and unique that our customers love.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.510
Next, have a strong App Store presence.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.320
These things matter.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.420
We put our stamp of approval on
apps and games that we feature,

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.410
and you should well represent who you
are and what you've built and make a

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.760
strong introduction to our customers.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.150
Choose the right business
model and price thoughtfully.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.550
Offer customers a universal binary.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.600
Localize in relevant markets.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.300
And lastly,
communicate with the App Store team.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.080
So that's my talk for today.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.100
Thank you very much.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.780
And now I'll turn it
over to my colleague,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.640
Steve McGuigan,
to talk about App Store marketing.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.440
Good afternoon.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.280
My name is Steve McGuigan and I look
after marketing for the App Store.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.780
You know, we spend a lot of time thinking
about apps at Apple and

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.080
not just on the App Store,
but Apple as a whole.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.340
And we love marketing apps
through our many channels.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.860
Many of the apps come from some
of the audience members here.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.740
The channels we market
through are television,

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.470
print.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:38.550
You'll see us marketing apps on
billboards throughout cities.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:44.140
We market apps through our over 400
retail locations around the globe and

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.980
our thousands of channel partners.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:53.000
We spend a lot of time and energy
marketing apps on apple.com,

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.650
as well as to the hundreds of
millions of emails that we send out

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:58.510
to our customers on a monthly basis.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.710
And then finally,
we speak to nearly 11 million

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.290
fans and followers on social
media every single day.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.320
But as Alex said earlier,
you control much of your

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.320
success on the App Store.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.500
You are not dependent
upon getting featured.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.410
Your success, of course,
starts with a great app,

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.640
but that success will be propelled
by having a great marketing plan.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.350
And that's what I'm here
to talk to you about today.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.370
I'm going to begin by talking about
three programs that we've created

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.220
to help you not only monetize,
but also help you promote your apps.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.720
I'll talk about some of the resources
we've made available to you to

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.080
make your marketing look great.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.910
And then I'll conclude by talking
about the components that make up

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.410
a comprehensive marketing campaign.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.780
So let's begin with the
programs and resources.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.490
I've been hearing for quite some time
that developers have been looking for

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:56.000
a way for them to market their apps
to customers for free without making

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.380
their app free on the App Store.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.460
So I'm proud to announce a
new program that we're calling

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.350
the App Store Code Program.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.480
This program will provide you,
the developer,

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.700
the ability to market free offers to your
customers by using unique 12-digit codes.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.200
Currently,
the program is focused on offering

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.120
your paid apps downloaded for free.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.290
Now, these are different than those
100 promo codes that you can

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.490
request out of iTunes Connect.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:27.020
Those should be used
for your PR purposes,

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.120
which I'll talk about later.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.460
These codes will come
in a much higher volume,

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.360
and they should be used for
large marketing campaigns.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.390
Now it's a completely free program.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:42.030
You as the developer would waive
your 70% royalties and we as

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.990
Apple would waive our 30% commission.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.040
And when you receive these codes,
you can distribute them

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.020
digitally or physically.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.590
And I'll provide some examples
for you in a few slides.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.430
So let's first talk about
the benefits of this program.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.780
First,
you will be able to create an impactful

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.830
and a high-value marketing promotion.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.490
It will not only aid in user acquisition,
but it also can be used in

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.810
an engagement tool with some
of your existing customers.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.210
The beauty of this is
that it's built into iOS.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.290
So the redemption flow is simple,
frictionless, and will produce a

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.400
consistent user experience.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.800
So let me get into a couple of
examples for you so you can understand

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.150
how these codes can work for you.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.640
And the first is a digital
distribution example from our

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.790
friends at Big Fish Games.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.820
They have a paid app called Fairway
Solitaire and they wanted to do a

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.800
marketing campaign targeted at golf
enthusiasts and game enthusiasts.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.930
So they created this banner
or this ad that they presented

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:47.800
through various mobile sites
addressing that targeted audience.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.460
The customer would see the ad
and they would tap on get it free

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.800
where they'd be presented with
this terms and conditions page.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.800
But Big Fish had a great idea.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.850
They said, why don't we leverage this
opportunity to share this

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.700
promotion through social networks?

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.460
So they give the customer
the ability to go share this

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.230
through Facebook and Twitter.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.730
But back to the redemption flow.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.540
The customer would tap on
the "Get it free" button,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.400
at which point the App Store would
launch automatically,

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.170
and the customer would just
simply type in their password.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.640
That 12-digit code is automatically
populated into the redeem field.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.640
So all the customer needs to
do at this point is tap redeem

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:26.960
and the app begins to download.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.500
A very simple experience
for the customer.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.600
But you also have an opportunity to
distribute these codes and activate

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.570
your customers at a physical location.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.440
And Halfbrick came to us,
the makers of Fruit Ninja,

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.460
and they had a great idea.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.730
They wanted to celebrate the anniversary
of Fruit Ninja and they thought they

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.390
would produce a high quality event in
public venues throughout Australia.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.350
So the idea they came to us
with was they'll create a kiosk,

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:56.470
it would have eight iPads around it,
a few flat screens,

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.340
and customers could come
up and play Fruit Ninja.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.850
They would put signage out about town
driving people to this event and they

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.360
would keep track of the high scores
that day as they were trying to find

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.500
Australia's next Fruit Ninja master.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:15.030
Well, they took it a step further and
created four of these kiosks and placed

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:20.320
these in shopping malls and parks
around Melbourne and Sydney recently.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.100
And while customers were
engaging with Fruit Ninja,

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.450
they would provide them a physical
card and each card had its own

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.370
unique 12-digit code on it.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.360
On the back, it explained how to redeem.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.500
It said, launch the app store,
plug in your password,

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.540
type in that 12-digit code that
you saw on the front of the card,

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.500
and tap redeem.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.810
And your app then downloads for free.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:37:04.000
[ Transcript missing ]

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:08.750
We want to make sure that it's a great
experience for our mutual customers,

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.800
so the offer needs to be open.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.470
In other words,
you can't require somebody to

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.420
pay for these codes that you're
eventually giving away for free,

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.480
or you can't require them to give you
a mailing address or an email address.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.180
We want it to be a delightful
experience for everybody.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:26.800
We'd ask that you track
your distribution.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.430
We'd like to know how many codes
you're putting through which channels.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:33.090
And then, of course, you would need our
approval to move forward.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.700
So how do you do that?

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.700
Well, it's quite simple.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.700
Send us an email at
appstorecodes@apple.com.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.650
We will send you back a template.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.630
We'll ask you to fill out that
will describe the campaign

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:47.700
that you're hoping to run,
which countries you want to run it in,

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.560
what kind of distribution you want to do.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.530
And once we approve that,
we'll send you an

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.920
agreement that you sign.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.700
You send us the agreement back,
and then we'll deliver you the codes.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.420
Now, one of the great benefits of this is
that you can track your redemptions in

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.580
the Sales and Trends Report that you
already look at through iTunes Connect.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.280
So you can see the performance
of your campaign and the

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.670
results on a daily basis.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.290
So that's our new App Store Code Program.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:18.740
The second program I want
to discuss with you is iAd.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.550
As you likely know,
iAd is Apple's digital

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.440
advertising platform.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.820
And we know that you spend an enormous
amount of time producing great games.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.050
And we know you don't want
to degrade that experience by

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.050
serving up poor quality ads.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.100
And that's where iAd comes in.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.300
iAd serves compelling, rich media ads.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.940
And it's now available in 14 countries.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:45.400
Just this week we launched in Taiwan,
Hong Kong, and Ireland to round it out.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.070
Now there's two aspects to iAd.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.260
There's the monetization
and there's the promotion.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.490
So let's begin by talking about
the monetization side of iAd

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:58.520
and how you can leverage iAd to
generate revenue within your game.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.160
Well,
by serving up iAds within your game,

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:05.380
you will receive a 70% revenue
share for every iAd that you serve.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.600
And the network is both
flexible and noncompetitive.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.340
What I mean is that while
you're serving iAds,

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:15.800
you are still able to still go out
there and sell your own ads if you want.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.340
You also have the ability to
block your competitors from

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:19.900
showing up within your game.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.890
So if you want to prevent certain apps
or certain brands from showing up,

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.030
you can do that.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:29.800
As I said earlier,
iAd serves compelling rich media ads and

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.790
you can track your results in real time.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.840
You can see the revenue, the taps,
the clicks that are occurring as

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.320
they're occurring within your app.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.440
To get started, it's quite simple.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.630
Simply go into iTunes Connect,
fill out the iAd contract,

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.180
implement the iAd
framework within your app,

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.020
and then submit it for review.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.450
And you should be off and running.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.400
So that's the monetization side.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.440
Let's talk about the promotion
side and how you can leverage iAd

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.770
to drive downloads of your apps.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:03.500
And for that, we introduced iAd Workbench
back at WWDC this past summer.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.660
iAd Workbench is a do-it-yourself
campaign creation and management tool.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.950
And when we announced it this summer,
it was available in the US only.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.020
But as of this week,
it's now available in all 14

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.620
countries that I mentioned earlier.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.320
So I'm going to talk about campaign
creation and the analytics that we serve.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.680
So let's begin by talking
about the campaign creation.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.350
It takes just a couple of minutes
to get your campaign up and running.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.600
It's five simple steps.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.230
You must first, of course,
select the app you want to promote,

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.140
which is your app.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.040
Then you need to select your audience.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.060
And for the non-marketers in the room,
it could not be simpler.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:43.890
By selecting automatic,
we will find the best audience

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:48.260
for you based upon the integration
that iAd has with the App Store.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:52.360
But for the marketers that are out here,
you can do your own manual targeting.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.820
There's eight different
criteria you can select,

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.420
whether it's gender, whether it's age,
whether it's region or

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.210
interest within the App Store.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.320
You can do as much targeting as you want.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:08.060
The third step is to tell iAd how much
you want to spend over what period of

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.000
time and then you upload your creative.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.230
Now if you don't have the creative
resources in your company to do this,

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.530
we actually have four
templates that you can use,

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.550
varying colors and fonts,
to make it look unique for yourself.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:23.100
And then you submit your campaign
and you'll get a response within 24

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.060
hours and you'll be up and running.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.440
Now, once your campaign is running,
we provide a dashboard of analytics.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:33.880
We provide a macro view of the account
that allows you to monitor your

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.990
campaigns but also initiate new ones.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:39.780
But then you can get into the detailed
statistics of the campaign if you want.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:42.200
You can look at specific time periods.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.290
You can look at your spend,
your impressions, your downloads,

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.480
your taps, your tap-through rates,
and then your cost per click

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.190
and your cost per acquisition.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.760
And you can also export this data
as a CSV file that you can import

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.920
then into your own analytics package.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:02.640
Now, we spent over an hour talking about
this at WWDC this past summer,

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.640
so I don't have enough
time to go any deeper,

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.000
but we have resources
available to you online,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.940
and additionally,
there's some folks in the lab from

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.630
the iAd team that can get you up and
running if you have any questions.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.390
So the third program I want
to talk to you briefly about

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.400
is our affiliate program.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:26.440
The affiliate program allows you to earn
a 7% commission when promoting apps,

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.670
including your own games,
and any other content that

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:34.040
we sell through iTunes,
whether it's TV, movies, music, or books.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.180
But what most developers don't know about
is that you can use our affiliate program

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.540
to track your marketing campaigns.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.360
You can track your sales of your
paid apps and your free apps and

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.000
see how they perform by channel.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.910
I'll explain that to you how
to do that in just a moment.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:53.910
So we are now rolling out a brand
new program with a new partner called

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:59.120
PHG that's going to provide a single
partner now for our affiliate program

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.150
in 100 countries around the globe.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.200
And one of the biggest benefits
about this new partner is the fact

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.320
that the URL scheme is much easier.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.970
You simply just select your
URL out of the App Store and

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.940
append your unique affiliate token.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.970
That's all you need to do to begin
receiving that 7% commission.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.460
But that added benefit I mentioned to
you earlier is the campaign tracking.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:28.130
You can append a campaign token to
the end of the URL and append any

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.600
40-character string to the end of that.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.460
So let's say you want to track an email
performance or you wanted to track the

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.550
performance of a particular web campaign.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.600
You can do this and you can
see your results in real time

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.200
to see how they're performing.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:45.190
It's a huge benefit to developers that
don't have a deeper analytics package.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.370
Given that it's a global program,
we've now localized the

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.550
resources into 24 languages,
and we now offer the ability for you to

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.470
receive payment in over 100 different
currencies from around the globe.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.100
We provide a myriad of additional tools.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.680
We can create banners
for any store content.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.000
We provide interactive widgets.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.130
We have a search API, an RSS feed,
as well as an enterprise partner feed

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.680
where you can download all the metadata
for every bit of content for everything

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.680
that we sell to help in your marketing.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.320
So that's our affiliate program.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.580
Now I'd like to briefly talk about
some of the marketing resources

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:25.100
that we have provided to you to
help make your marketing look great.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.620
We provide these on the iOS Dev Center,
but sometimes it's hard to find,

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.290
so you simply have to go to
appstore.com slash marketing

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:34.850
to get directly to this page.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.290
Here, we provide the
App Store marketing guidelines.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:42.070
We provide links to Apple Assets,
which we'll talk about in a second,

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.170
as well as links to a number of tools.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.460
So first, let me touch base on the
marketing guidelines.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.510
We just completely rewrote these.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.120
They are simpler and
much easier to follow.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.630
And the reason we produce these is to
give you advice and direction on how best

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.010
to market your apps using our assets.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.150
And those assets include
the App Store badges as

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.400
well as the device images.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.700
Now we just localized these
guidelines into Spanish,

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.940
Italian, German, and French this week.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.900
And that's in addition
to simplified Chinese,

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.900
traditional Chinese, and Japanese.

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:20.220
And we'll roll out some additional
languages here very soon.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.430
So let's talk briefly
about the App Store badges.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:27.440
And we really encourage you guys to
use this in all of your marketing

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:32.070
because App Store customers understand
this badge as a call to action.

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.800
And it says that your app is
available and ready for download.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.620
So use it in all of your marketing.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.700
But when using it,
it's important that you

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:45.250
lead with your brand,
your title, explaining why your app or

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.400
your game is as great as it is.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.930
And use the App Store badge
in a subordinate position.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:53.910
We want you to lead with
the greatness of your app.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.640
We've also made it easier for
you to market internationally.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.940
And if you follow Alex's guidance
earlier and localize your app,

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.460
we've now provided localized
App Store badges in 38 languages

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.510
for use around the world.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.300
As I mentioned earlier,
we provided Apple device images for you.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.500
So we've provided high
resolution assets for iPhone,

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:19.070
iPad,
and iPod Touch in both white and black.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.380
And when using the device images,
please use actual screenshots from

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:27.190
your app and think about those
screenshots that exemplify really

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:28.820
the beauty and the magic of your app.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:33.240
And avoid covering up the beauty
of your game with these marketing

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.510
messages and these violators.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.040
That really does distract
from the magic of your app.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.760
Put that stuff to the side and
really focus on your content.

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.930
Now, if the creative direction
you're heading down doesn't,

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:49.040
if the assets we provide don't
work for that creative direction,

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.400
you can take your own photos,
your own videography,

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.800
and we provide you some guidance
on how best to do that through

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.030
our marketing guidelines.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.660
So that's it on the
programs and resources.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.530
I'm going to spend the last 15 minutes
or so here talking about the components

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:06.500
of a comprehensive marketing campaign.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.960
Now, I've met with a number of you today
and I understand that the marketing

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.440
budgets of you vary in this audience
from a zero dollar marketing budget

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.380
to maybe millions of dollars.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:21.720
And my goal here is to share with you
various channels that hopefully there's a

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.790
tidbit of information and tips that will
help all of you here in this audience,

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.970
depending upon your budget.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.460
So I've broken it down into two buckets.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.840
Owned channels are more or
less free and paid channels are

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.000
obviously those you have to pay.

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.160
So let's jump in to the
owned channels first,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.240
and we'll start with social media.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.750
Social media is one of the most
effective channels that you

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.330
can use to market your app.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.370
I know you know this,
but it's important that you

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.990
plan that social media strategy
from the very beginning.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.580
How can you integrate social
media into your game experience?

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:58.980
As Alex said earlier,
ShareSheet is one great

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.120
way of doing that.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.290
It's very simple to
share maybe high scores,

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:07.490
milestones,
and achievements through ShareSheet.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.430
But I also want you to think about
how you can leverage social media

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:12.860
to maybe supplement your game.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.360
You know, instead of using social media
just as a broadcast mechanism,

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.500
how can you use it to bring
content back into your game?

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:23.000
See where your friends are at
certain levels or things like that.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.680
Now, while this isn't a game example,
it is a great example,

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.340
and this is with RunKeeper.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:31.630
RunKeeper actually leverages social
media where you can have your friends

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.090
and family motivate you and cheer you
on for a run through social media.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.980
So it's a different way to look at
social media and how to augment your app.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.470
But beyond that,
you need to think about how you're

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:47.090
going to build your brand presence
on social media and what is your

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:48.970
content strategy going to be.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.300
So there's three things
I want to leave you with.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.720
The first, remember that when you
are posting content,

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.870
those posts are going to be nestled
amongst the posts of your customers,

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:00.350
friends, and family.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.920
So be engaging.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.460
Be conversational.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.890
Don't continually just sell, sell,
sell all the time.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.740
Get them to engage with your content.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.620
and think about how you can
get them to arrest the thumb.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.360
We all flip through our
news feeds very quickly.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:19.990
And what gets us to stop is that
compelling image or that compelling copy.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.680
And if it gets you to somebody
to stop and to read it,

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:26.400
your next step is to hopefully
get them to engage and share it.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:28.690
Which takes me to my third point.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.700
People are what they share.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:32.300
They share what inspires them.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.090
They share what is aspirational to them.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.450
So think about that copy that
addresses both of those things,

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.300
inspiration and aspiration.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.890
So that's social media.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:46.700
Let's talk about email briefly.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:51.300
Email is likely your first
opportunity to talk to a customer

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.240
outside of the App Store.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.210
So that first contact
is really important.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.090
Think about how you can be engaging and
useful so that they don't immediately

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.720
put you into their spam folder.

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.650
You want to use email
throughout the lifecycle of

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.170
your customer with your game.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:10.890
So make sure that content is-- it
jumps out and is engaging to them.

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:15.200
and optimize your emails for the
devices it's being viewed on.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:18.700
You need to consider the
image sizes that you're using,

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:22.080
the font types,
and the font sizes so that they're

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.810
both viewable on both iPhone and iPad.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.900
Which brings me to my third point.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.260
You know your customer that
you're talking to here is an

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.260
iPhone or an iPad customer.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.280
So target those communications to them.

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:35.590
Talk to them directly and make
them feel special like they're

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.700
a part of your experience.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.200
Another thing to remember is to
make your entire image clickable.

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.400
When you're providing
an image in your email,

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.800
customers know that as a call
to action and they just want

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.670
to be able to tap anywhere.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:53.750
So don't make them sort of target and
find that really small call to action.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.910
Allow them to click anywhere.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:01.890
Next, use email as a way to test
your marketing strategies.

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:04.420
And one great way to do that
is test your subject line.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.810
So as you're doing an email blast,
segment your audience into two

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:13.800
groups and do A/B testing and see
how the results affect open rate.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.930
Take those learnings and apply
them to your next email and your

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:20.000
next email and you're going to
get smarter and you're going to

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.210
continue to drive great engagement.

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:26.040
You want to be useful in your content?

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:28.660
So you don't, again,
you don't always need to be selling.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:31.660
Maybe provide them tips and tricks
on how to get to that next level or

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:35.220
give them an insight of what the,
you know, level 47 is going to be,

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.150
whatever that's going to be.

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:38.180
Get them to engage with your app again.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.160
And then also use email to
support that social media

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:43.510
strategy we talked about earlier.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:47.060
Get them to follow you on the
popular social media networks.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.760
So that's email.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.660
So now some tips for your website.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:58.600
Back at iOS 6, we launched a technology
called Smart App Banners.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.660
With Smart App Banners,
all you need to do is enter one

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:04.460
line of code onto your website.

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:07.230
And with that,
your website will be able to

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:10.940
detect if a customer is coming
to you from an iOS device.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.360
And when that happens,
a banner is presented

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.690
at the top of your page.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.980
And it's smart because it knows,
in this case, whether or not I have

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.600
Diamond Dash installed on my device.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.100
If I don't, the call to action says View.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.200
And when I tap on View,
I'm taken into the

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.910
App Store to download the app.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.510
But if I do have the
app installed already,

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.470
it says Open.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.320
And I have the ability
to just tap on that,

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.320
and then it launches the game directly.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.100
It's important to optimize
your website for mobile.

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.020
Very similar to what I said with email.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:46.000
Think about your image size and
your font type and your font sizes

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.980
so that you can engage with it on a
smaller form factor like the iPhone.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.090
and provide multiple install points.

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:57.430
Once the customer begins
scrolling through your page and

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.270
they lose that smart app banner,
provide the App Store badge

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.640
on there so they can click
on it and download your game.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.420
Again,
support that social media strategy.

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:09.480
Allow your customers to follow you on
Facebook and Twitter or other networks.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:14.390
And then finally,
provide a link to customer care or

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:19.510
an FAQ so that you can address your
customers' problems directly rather than

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:24.520
them leaving you negative feedback on
the App Store and affecting your ratings.

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:30.100
Now the next channel I want to talk
about briefly is cross promotion.

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:34.200
Many of you in the audience have
multiple apps on the App Store.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.840
And I've seen some good and not so good
ways that you can cross promote apps.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.760
But the thing to remember is to be
thoughtful to your customers that

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:44.110
you've already worked so hard to
acquire and don't be too intrusive

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:46.260
when you're doing that cross marketing.

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.800
So I'm going to provide
you three examples here of

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.730
what I think is thoughtful,
good cross marketing.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.260
The first is the More Apps menu.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.940
And with Cut the Rope,
they've provided this little

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:58.700
window shade pole at the very top.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.370
And by pulling down on it,
it's interactive, it supports gravity,

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.900
what have you,
but you can slip through the other

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.000
games that ZeptoLabs provides.

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:09.480
Another example are tickers.

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.200
These are not intrusive.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.600
So here I am looking
at the Sims Free Play,

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:17.960
and the streaming ticker at the
bottom is talking about FIFA 14.

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.360
It's being thoughtful,
it's talking about the

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.800
benefits of FIFA 14.

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.640
And if I'm interested,
I simply tap on it, and I'm taken to the

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.280
App Store to download it.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.500
And then the third example is
what we call interactive creative.

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:34.180
What the impossible line has done
here is you can take these bubbles

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.530
from the upper right-hand corner,
pull them down,

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:39.350
you can bounce them off one another,
you can interact with it,

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:43.120
but by tapping on it,
it pops the bubble and then it takes you

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.080
into the App Store via a store sheet.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:49.480
And that's my last point I want to
emphasize here is to use store sheet.

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:52.890
By using store sheet,
the customer could engage and

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:56.630
buy this game and then once
that transaction is complete,

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:59.690
they're taken right back into the
game where they were previously

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.750
and you haven't lost that,
their spot in the game.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.310
Next I want to talk about PR.

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.800
I want to remind you that PR does
not stand for press release.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:14.500
Gone are the days where a press release
makes a comprehensive PR campaign.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.290
It stands for public
relations and it takes work.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:18.440
It doesn't cost you anything.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.880
It just takes your energy and
effort to go out there and

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.500
find the influencers out there.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.480
And that's where the promo
codes come into play.

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:29.740
Those 100 promo codes you can pull
out of iTunes Connect shouldn't

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.310
be used for your brother,
your sister, your mom, or your dad.

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:35.500
Give it to the influencers out there,
those people that can

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:36.560
write about your app.

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.190
And please, embargo them.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:43.580
Don't allow them to write about your game
until your app is live on the App Store.

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.540
It really does you very little
good for them to write about you,

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:48.770
for when the audience
is reading that article,

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:49.830
they can't act on it.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.570
There's nothing for them to do.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.880
So wait for them to write about
you until your app is live on the

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.100
store and drive as much PR in a
short amount of time as you can.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.580
Beyond launch,
you want to find an advocate.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:05.580
You want to find somebody that can
continue to talk about your app.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.870
I see some great examples with
racing games where they've gotten

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:11.910
race car drivers to continually talk
about it and show their levels as

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.690
they're progressing through games.

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:18.250
Really consider finding an advocate that
can continue to talk about your game.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.810
Now,
if you do want to write a press release,

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:23.730
make sure you can support
your claims that you make.

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.550
And then finally,
please send them to us ahead

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:28.120
of time for our review.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.240
You can send them to us at
pressreleasesatapple.com and our

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.300
PR team will look at them and give you
any feedback within five business days.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.010
So the last owned channel I want
to talk about are trailers.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:42.630
And I love the trailers I'm
seeing from the audience like you,

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:43.860
game developers.

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:48.330
The production value of trailers nowadays
have really gone to the next step.

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:50.860
But I want to give you a few
tips and tricks of things that

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:52.520
we like to see in trailers.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.960
And the first thing is that you
need to grab somebody's attention.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.550
And with a trailer,
we have found that you have about six

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.410
seconds to grab somebody's attention
of whether or not they want to continue

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:05.460
to watch what your game is about.

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:09.330
But that being said,
they do have a limited attention span.

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:12.120
So keep your trailer to
within 30 to 60 seconds.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.290
As I said earlier,
I know you work really hard

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:18.290
to make your game look great.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:24.000
So use professional capturing tools to
capture digitally your gaming experience.

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:27.140
Don't have your friend look over you with
a camera and record you playing with it.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.080
Use these digital capturing systems.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.560
And then support your trailer
with a great soundtrack.

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.080
You're going to want to provide
a clear call to action because in

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.360
many cases those trailers aren't,
you can't click with them.

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.860
So make sure you provide
the App Store badge,

00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:44.490
a vanity URL,
whatever that may be to get them to go

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:46.870
into the App Store to download your app.

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.080
And the last point I want to
make about trailers is to ensure

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.950
that it's globally appropriate.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:55.200
And there's two aspects to this.

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:56.140
The first is price.

00:57:56.140 --> 00:58:00.700
So if your app or your
game is a paid-for app,

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:04.460
when you talk about it in one currency,
that doesn't really translate to

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:06.200
other currencies around the globe.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.280
You know,
somebody in Japan or China might not know

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.200
what the conversion rate is for a euro,
for example.

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:13.710
Additionally, by talking about your
specific price point,

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.200
it doesn't give you the opportunity
to do price promotions as well.

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:20.250
So we really just encourage
you to leave the price out of

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:21.990
it unless your game is free.

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:26.640
The other aspect to being globally
appropriate is the content itself.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.630
And the level at which people are
offended by maybe violence or other

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.660
types of content varies around the globe.

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.930
So be sure that you err on the side
of caution so that people will want

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.260
to continue to watch these trailers.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:43.050
So the example I have here is from
EA of their trailer for FIFA 14.

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:46.280
And many of you may have seen this,
but those that haven't,

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:49.420
they've done a great job of
really building a great trailer

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.570
using many of these tactics here.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:39.850
So I'll conclude by talking
about two paid channels.

00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:41.980
And the first is mobile ads.

00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:45.450
I won't go too deep into here because
I touched on it with iAd earlier,

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:49.880
but one of the benefits of mobile ads
obviously is that through mobile ads,

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.600
it's the fewest taps
away from an install.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.760
As you're engaging with a
game or an app or a website,

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.850
when you see those banner ads,
it's one tap and you're downloading

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:01.820
the content within the store.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.500
But you can also use mobile ads
not only for user acquisition,

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.970
but also to help build your brand.

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:08.250
We encourage you to do both.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:11.410
And also the benefit primarily
around that you can target

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:14.530
your campaigns by device,
by demographic, by interest,

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.120
whatever that might be.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.240
Now one tip I want to provide you
though is your creative direction.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:25.600
You can't create a single piece
of creative for all the channels

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.800
that you're marketing through.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.000
So make sure that you create custom
creative dependent upon that channel.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.120
We have heard from
developers on Facebook,

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.150
for example,
it's better to use live action photos

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:36.470
like you might see here for Hay Day.

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:40.500
That actually drives higher
engagement for developers.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.500
But it's also important that you test.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.860
So I know some developers that
will create upwards of 50 pieces

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.510
of creative for one campaign.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:53.010
They'll very quickly learn what works
best and what doesn't and continue to

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:55.550
invest in that creative that does work.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:00.600
And now my last point and my last channel
I want to share with you is television.

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:03.460
I understand this might be out
of the budget of many of you,

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.390
but I'm seeing some great
TV campaigns around the globe,

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:09.610
a lot of them here in Europe as well.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.350
And what makes television
work so well is the fact that

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.220
while people are watching TV,
their devices are at hand.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.910
Either their iPhone is in their pocket,
their iPad is on their lap,

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:23.100
and if the television
commercial is engaging enough,

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:27.730
you will see them convert and you'll
actually see results in near real time.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.010
But it's important that you share
the magic moments of your game

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.260
to make sure that it's engaging
and you get people to convert.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.140
You want to support it
with a strong voiceover,

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.020
maybe talking about the key features,
the devices.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.080
But of course, you're going to want to
have a clear call to action.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.190
One way to create a clear call to
action is by having a strong end frame.

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:53.990
By that strong end frame,
what I mean is that the last three

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:57.580
or four seconds of a TV spot,
make sure you have the App Store badge,

01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:59.320
but use your vanity URL.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.450
I should have mentioned this earlier.

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:05.300
Your vanity URL is something that
every one of you in this audience have.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:10.320
You have your own appstore.com URL,
which would be appstore.com slash

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.460
your app name or appstore.com
slash your developer name.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.230
And by using that in offline media,
such as TV or print or

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:21.850
billboard or what have you,
it's a URL that your customers could

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:26.210
easily remember and then go convert
and get them to activate against.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:31.330
So the TV spot I'm going to
share with you is from Wooga

01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:35.160
for their new Jelly Splash game,
or for the Jelly Splash game.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.790
And they've done a great job of
capturing all these tips here

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.430
to produce a really great spot.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.600
Plus they've added a
little bit of humor to it,

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.980
which I think helps
drive engagement as well.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.000
Jelly Splash.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.860
The most addictive puzzle game ever.

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.380
Search Jelly Splash now.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.240

Play Jelly Splash today.

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:14.200
So great example of the badge usage,
great example of the vanity

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.570
URL I mentioned earlier,
all in all a great spot.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:21.700
So I want to leave with
you with an email address.

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:25.840
This is appstoremarketing@apple.com.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.660
This gives you direct access
to our global marketing team.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.340
If you have any questions
about your marketing campaigns,

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.360
your strategies, if you want to send us
your assets for review,

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.030
we would love to take a look at it.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.090
We will respond to you
within five business days.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:42.080
So with that, I want to thank you,
and I'm going to hand it

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.320
over to Shannon Bruce to
talk about iTunes Connect.

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:53.100
My name is Shannon Bruce and I work
on the App Store operations team.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.880
You've been hearing some great tips
on choosing the right business model

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.820
and how to best market your app.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.290
And I'm going to talk some more
about how you can execute on some of

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:04.550
these things through iTunes Connect.

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:07.980
I know that all of you have at
least one app on the App Store,

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:11.000
so you should be very
familiar with iTunes Connect.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.880
And it is the gateway to the App Store.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:17.740
It's the website you use to
create and manage your apps,

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:23.580
check your payments and sales reports,
request your promo codes, and much more.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:26.540
I'm going to cover three
major topics today.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.900
First, I'll go over some recently
launched and valuable features.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.700
Second,
I'll talk about how you can execute

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.380
on your plans to localize your app.

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.580
And finally,
I'll leave you with some tips

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:42.700
and tricks to help manage your
business more effectively.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.160
Let's start with our first feature,
promo codes.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.910
We provide you with 100 promo codes
for your use and they're set up

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:55.670
so that you can request them as
you need them in any denomination.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.440
As Steve mentioned,
we encourage you to reserve these

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:04.840
codes for your media representatives
and influencers who can try out

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.740
your app before it's available
to the general public and write

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.210
about it to help you promote it.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.760
Up until recently,
you were only able to request promo

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.130
codes in the ready for sale state,
but I'm happy to announce that you

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:24.000
can now request promo codes in the
pending developer release state as well.

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:28.660
This is really exciting because it
allows you to request promo codes for

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:33.370
your app updates in addition to your
first version of the app so you can

01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:35.970
promote your new features as well.

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:39.750
The next feature I want to
talk about is app transfer.

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:43.880
This is a very exciting launch
for us this year at WWDC,

01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:46.680
as it was a highly
requested feature by you.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:50.520
And it's the ability to transfer
the ownership of an app from one

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.980
developer account to another.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.820
And what are some of the reasons
you might use App Transfer?

01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:59.600
The App Store has been in
business for five years now,

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.680
and many of you have
seen phenomenal success.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:07.020
You may have had the opportunity to
sell your app to another developer,

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:11.190
or you may have acquired a great
app from another developer.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.240
Or maybe you've registered
multiple accounts with Apple and

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:19.400
would like to consolidate those
accounts to be managed as one.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:24.450
If you're in any of these situations,
App Transfer is a great solution for you.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:26.940
And what are the benefits?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.240
One of the greatest things about app
transfer is that it is completely

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.900
seamless to your customers.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:37.800
What that means is that customers can
continue to use the app and new customers

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:42.910
can continue to purchase the app while
the transfer process is happening.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.800
And you get to retain all
of your chart placement,

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.860
your customer ratings and reviews,
and the ability to update

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.720
the app for your customers.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:57.810
And there are really just very minimal
visible changes to the app on the store.

01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:02.080
The only thing that changes on
the App Store is the seller name.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.480
So let's walk through a flow to
show you what this looks like.

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:10.400
First, as the current owner,
you'll log into iTunes Connect,

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:15.220
select the app you wish to transfer,
and enter in the new owner information.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:21.010
That's the Apple ID of the team agent
and the team ID of the new owner.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:26.180
Then Apple will draw up a contract
agreement between you and the new owner,

01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:32.000
and the app will move into a
substate called Pending App Transfer.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.700
If your app is ready
for sale at this time,

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.110
it remains on the store,
as all of this is

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.410
happening on the back end.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.480
At the same time,
the new owner will receive an email

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.000
letting them know that a transfer
is waiting their acceptance.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:51.020
They'll log into iTunes Connect and
they'll be required to enter

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.540
in some new app metadata.

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:56.560
I'll go into detail about
what this is in a minute.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:00.480
They will also sign the same
contract agreement and once both

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:05.120
developers have signed the contract,
the app moves into processing

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:09.480
app transfer where it's moving
from one account to the next.

01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:12.980
There are some rules
regarding app transfer,

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.040
and I want to go over just a
few of them that you should know

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.700
about before transferring an app.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:23.100
You'll want to make sure you've agreed
to any available contract amendments.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.860
From time to time,
Apple updates the terms of

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.520
the program license agreement
or the paid apps contract.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.280
And we just want to make sure
that you've agreed to these

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.210
terms before transferring an app.

01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:39.780
You also need to have at least
one approved version for your app,

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:43.760
and you won't be able to transfer
an app that is currently in review.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.180
This includes in-app
purchase reviews as well.

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.090
So as the current owner,
what are some things you should have

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.350
ready before initiating a transfer?

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.300
You'll need to collect
the new owner information,

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.040
that is the Apple ID of the team agent.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.160
This isn't their password,
just the username they use

01:09:03.190 --> 01:09:05.560
to log into iTunes Connect.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.890
And the team ID.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:10.760
The team ID is a unique identifier
for your developer account,

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.710
and you can find this
ID in the member center.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.500
We also encourage you to
back up your app history.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:21.030
Once the app is transferred,
it's completely gone out of

01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:23.830
your iTunes Connect account,
so you won't have access

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:25.380
to any of its current data.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:28.340
So if you want to request a
catalog report or just have this

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:31.500
information for your own records,
you should do this before

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.150
initiating the transfer.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.230
And you'll need to arrange the actual
transfer of the source code and

01:09:38.230 --> 01:09:40.640
binary of the app with the new owner.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.480
Because the only thing that the
transfer process does is transfer

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:44.480
the data to the new owner.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.250
So then once the transfer
has been initiated,

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.720
the app is under metadata lockdown.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.810
What this means is that you can
still make changes to the pricing

01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:58.500
and availability of the app,
but you will be locked out of

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.900
making changes to anything else.

01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:07.380
And the recipient has 60 days
in order to accept the transfer.

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.200
If they do not accept
within the 60-day period,

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:13.400
it will automatically be canceled.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.120
So then as the new owner,
what are some things you should have

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.800
ready before accepting an app transfer?

01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:22.440
You'll want to have that new app
metadata that I mentioned earlier.

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:24.480
Since the ownership of
the app is changing,

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.900
we're under the assumption that the
contact information is changing as well.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:33.700
So we require that you enter in the
support URL and marketing URL for

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:37.600
your app so that we can ensure that
customers are directed to the correct

01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:40.770
place as the ownership changes.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.800
This includes your app review
contact information as well.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.280
This information is important so
that if any questions or issues

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.790
arise during the review of your app,
we have a way of contacting you.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.270
And if the app contains encryption,
the previous owner may have supplied

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.410
export compliance documentation
and you'll want to have this

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:04.280
documentation ready as well.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.060
Many of you who acquire an app like
to submit an update in order to

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.880
make any changes to the branding
information within the app.

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:16.170
And we encourage you to have this
update ready so that you can submit it

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.700
as soon as the transfer is complete.

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:22.100
Then when the app moves into the
processing app transfer state,

01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:28.400
the transfer has begun and the pricing is
locked down in addition to the metadata.

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:31.250
This should only take about 30 minutes,
so you shouldn't be

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:33.980
locked out for too long,
but the transfer cannot

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.620
be canceled at this time.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.700
It's literally when the app is moving
from the current owner to the new owner.

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:44.210
So just to show you what this
looks like on the App Store,

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:47.710
Angry Birds was one of our
first apps to be transferred.

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:51.070
And you can see that the only thing
that changes on the App Store is the

01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:55.160
seller name from Chilingo to Rovio.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.440
So that's app transfer.

01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:02.040
The next feature I want to
cover is alternate price tiers.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.900
We recently introduced some
additional tiers for your use.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:10.840
These tiers are available for
developers globally who wish to vary

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.910
pricing in different currencies.

01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:16.400
And they just give you a little
more flexibility to price your app

01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:18.550
thoughtfully and competitively.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.300
There are five additional
tiers for your use.

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:27.220
They are completely market optimized,
which means that they're culturally

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:31.340
relevant and consumer friendly to
the regions using those currencies.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:36.330
And there are no restrictions,
meaning you can choose these for any

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:39.080
of your apps or in-app purchases.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:42.440
And the great thing about the
App Store being on the agency

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.920
model means that you can change
your pricing at any time.

01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:49.080
These new tiers also
map to existing apps.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:53.010
So one thing to note is that we
only support the selection of

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:55.650
these tiers through iTunes Connect.

01:12:55.650 --> 01:13:00.620
We don't support the assignment of
these tiers through any other delivery

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:05.500
method such as the import from file
functionality in Application Loader

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.980
or the XML feed with Transporter.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.940
But I do want to point out where you can
select these tiers in iTunes Connect.

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.480
This is the rights and
pricing page of the app.

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:17.520
And you can see that the
alternate tiers are listed down

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.070
at the bottom of the price tier.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.790
list.

01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:25.440
Just to illustrate what this looks like,
we'll use an example of

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.200
an app priced at tier one,
which is 99 cents in the US dollar

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:34.480
and 69 pence in the British pound.

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:38.240
However,
if you were to select alternate tier one,

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.740
the price remains 99
cents in the US dollar,

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.780
but is now 99 pence in the British pound.

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.940
And 99 pence is just a more
culturally relevant price point.

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:53.220
While it might be slightly
higher for the customer,

01:13:53.230 --> 01:13:58.130
it's just another option for you to be
able to price your app competitively.

01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:01.100
And a few other examples.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:07.500
Tier 1 in the Euro is 89 Euro and
alternate Tier 1 is 99 Euro.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:14.950
And for the Chinese RMB,
6 RMB for Tier 1 and 8 RMB for Tier 2.

01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:18.200
So we encourage you to check out these
new tiers and just see what works

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:20.900
for your app and your business model.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.900
The last feature I want to
talk about is automation.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:27.900
We know that your time as a
developer is very valuable.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.900
And we do all that we
can to save you time,

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.900
especially when it comes to repetitive
actions with iTunes Connect.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.980
So I want to talk about two areas
of automation that I think will be

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.470
very helpful with saving you time.

01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:44.260
The first area of automation
is auto-ingesting your

01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:46.680
reports from iTunes Connect.

01:14:46.710 --> 01:14:50.840
We provide you with a command line tool
that allows you to automate the delivery

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.870
of your reports from iTunes Connect.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.960
This has been available for
your sales and trends reports,

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.440
but we recently expanded it
to include the delivery of

01:14:58.490 --> 01:15:00.050
your payment reports as well.

01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:04.270
And it just allows you to access
your reports without actually

01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:08.480
having to log into the iTunes
Connect interface each time.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.370
In order to use this tool,
you first have to download the auto

01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:16.700
ingestion class file at the URL here.

01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:21.990
And you'll need to change your directory
level to point to the class file.

01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:24.870
And you'll also need to
create a properties file

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.680
for your login credentials.

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:32.200
That is your iTunes Connect Apple ID and
your iTunes Connect password.

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:35.810
The great thing about this properties
file is that it just puts a little more

01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:41.060
security around your login credentials
as you used to enter this information

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.040
directly into the command line.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:48.350
So it just allows your username and
password to be a little bit more secure.

01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:52.000
And I'll walk through what this
command line looks like for each

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.780
of the reports so you know how
to do this for your own account.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.940
This is the command for the sales report.

01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:03.740
And all of the information in the
angle brackets will be your own values.

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:07.320
And the parameters will
be delimited with a space.

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.540
So you'll first start by
entering in your vendor ID.

01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:16.280
And your vendor ID is another unique
identifier for your developer account.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.750
This identifier can be
found in the Contracts,

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:21.030
Tax, and Making module.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.440
Then you'll enter in the report type,
which is sales for the

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440
standard sales report.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.840
Or if you have any newsstand apps and
wish to download the newsstand report,

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.140
you can enter newsstand.

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:40.690
Then you'll indicate the date type,
which is the daily, weekly, monthly,

01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:42.920
or yearly interval.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.130
And the report subtype will be
summary for the standard sales report,

01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:51.710
detailed for the newsstand report,
or if you're using

01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:55.340
auto-renewable subscriptions,
you may be collecting personal

01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:59.000
information from customers who've chosen
to share this information with you,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.080
and you can download
that report using opt-in.

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:07.990
Finally, the date range is optional,
and this is the exact date for

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.860
the report you wish to download.

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:13.180
If you don't include a date,
we'll just provide you with the

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:15.920
latest available report based on
the parameters you've indicated.

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:22.440
Similarly, this is the command for
the payment reports.

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:26.560
And you'll again start by
entering in your vendor ID.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.380
But for the payment reports,
you need to include two leading

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.330
zeros in front of your vendor ID.

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:35.940
Since the payment reports
are broken out by currency,

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:38.500
you'll then indicate a region code.

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:43.240
And a list of the available region
codes is available in the Payments

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.080
and Financial Reports User Guide in
iTunes Connect,

01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:48.290
if you need to access that.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.480
The report type is
always going to be DRR,

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.980
which is the standard report
type for the payment reports.

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:59.880
And finally, you'll enter in the fiscal
year and fiscal period.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.160
And if you need to access a
copy of Apple's fiscal calendar,

01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:06.930
there is one available in the
Payments and Financial Reports module

01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:08.220
in iTunes Connect.

01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:12.560
So that's auto-ingesting your reports.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.480
And the second area of automation
I want to cover is Apple's command

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.020
line tool called Transporter.

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:22.830
Transporter allows you to
deliver your app metadata based

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:25.800
on our XML specifications.

01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:28.990
You can integrate Transporter
with your own content management

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.380
system if you have one.

01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:34.390
And we recently introduced the
ability to deliver your rights

01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:38.260
and pricing changes through iTunes
Connect through Transporter.

01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:40.780
You can request catalog reports.

01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:44.280
And you can deliver your app
metadata through Transporter,

01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:47.940
which can be extremely helpful
when localizing your app.

01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:52.220
This brings me to the next
topic of localization setup.

01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:57.190
You've been hearing a lot about how
you should think global and be local.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.730
And Alex and Steve have talked about
how important App Store localization

01:19:01.890 --> 01:19:07.080
can be for providing your customers
with the best customer experience.

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:09.450
We highly recommend it.

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:15.100
We've talked about how the App Store is
available in 155 territories,

01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:20.080
and we offer you 28 languages
to set up for localization.

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:23.900
We highly encourage you to use
professional localization resources.

01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:26.500
Alex mentioned this resource earlier.

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:30.450
And we advise against using
automated translation services

01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:34.170
you might find on the web,
as they might translate your

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:39.490
content but don't fully localize
it to be culturally relevant.

01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:44.940
We also encourage you to
localize anywhere possible.

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:47.990
Alex showed a great example
of Where Is My Water?

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:51.700
and they localized everything
including their screenshots.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.110
We know that there's a lot of fields in
iTunes Connect that you can localize,

01:19:56.390 --> 01:20:00.070
which is why the XML feed
can be very helpful.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:04.800
One last thing I want to talk about
regarding localization setup is that

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.980
you are required to submit your app for
review when you do add new localizations.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:14.080
So just make sure you leave enough
time for the review process when

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.470
you wish to add new localizations.

01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.660
And for those of you who wish
to cut down on the repetitive

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:23.760
actions that localizing can bring,
we encourage you to adopt the

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.290
automated process of the XML feed.

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:29.960
And the steps for using the
XML feed are fairly simple.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:34.470
You can start by looking up your existing
metadata from the Apple database,

01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:38.800
which will provide you with your
current app metadata in the exact

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.550
format that it'll need to be uploaded.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.600
From there, you can make any edits
that you wish to make.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.180
And once you've made your changes,
you can run Transporter in verify mode,

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:54.530
which allows you to check your changes
against our XML specifications.

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:59.300
Then, you can upload your information
so that it's ready to submit

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.170
with your next update.

01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:08.580
You will still need to create your new
app versions in iTunes Connect and you'll

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:13.390
want to monitor your state transitions
through iTunes Connect as well.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.280
And I'm not going to go over a demo,
but I do want to point out that

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.780
there are a number of resources
available to you within the Manage

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.600
Your Apps module of iTunes Connect.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:27.690
And there's also a great session
video from this year's WWDC called

01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:30.280
What's New in iTunes Connect.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.450
They talk in a little bit more
detail about the XML feed,

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:36.990
and they do a full end-to-end
demo of what this looks like.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.620
So if you're interested in
checking out this video,

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:42.100
you can access it from
the developer portal.

01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:44.960
And we know that once you
set up your localizations,

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.720
you like to see what it looks like
for your customer on the App Store.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.090
This is the Pages app,
and just to show you what

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:55.780
some of this looks like,
one thing that we get a lot of

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:59.590
questions about is the list of
languages that appears in the app

01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:02.040
information section on the app page.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.470
This list of languages is
not the languages that you've

01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:07.260
set up in iTunes Connect.

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:11.280
This list comes from the
lproj folder in your binary,

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.620
and is meant to be the list of languages
that your app is localized into

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.840
once the customer has downloaded it.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:23.140
The languages that you've set up in
iTunes Connect will automatically

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:28.670
be displayed on the App Store based
on the customer's OS and storefront.

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:33.660
So all you have to do is
provide the content in iTunes

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.870
Connect and the localizations
will automatically display here.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.740
And just to show you
a few other examples,

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:47.050
you can see how your localizations
look on the store by changing your

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:48.770
OS and you can see what it looks like.

01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:54.420
So finally,
I'd like to leave you with some tips

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:57.190
and tricks that you can take away today.

01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:02.940
Tip number one is viewing your
App Store localizations on the device.

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.640
We just saw what this
looks like on the desktop,

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:10.920
but it can be a little bit trickier to
view your localizations on the device.

01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:14.120
And we get a lot of questions about this,
so I wanted to walk you

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.990
through how you could do that.

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:19.260
You'll start by entering
multitasking mode in order

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.990
to quit out of the App Store.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:27.610
Then you'll go to your settings
and tap General International.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.540
Then tap Language.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:34.700
And from here, you can select the iOS
language that you wish to view.

01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:38.110
For this example,
I'm going to choose Chinese.

01:23:39.690 --> 01:23:43.280
So tap the language and then tap Done.

01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:46.320
From there,
you'll go back to the App Store.

01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:49.620
And if you're logged into
your personal iTunes account,

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.760
you'll need to sign out.

01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:55.470
Then you'll tap the Sign In button.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:00.100
Here you can see that the language
has started to change to Chinese.

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:03.490
And I don't personally speak Chinese,
but I know that the third

01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:07.720
line here indicates the option
to create a new Apple ID.

01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:09.840
And this is where the trick comes in.

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:12.720
You don't actually have
to create a new Apple ID,

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:15.720
but you will start
walking through the flow.

01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:19.360
So tap Create New Apple ID.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.080
And then you'll be prompted
to indicate a storefront.

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:26.820
This is where you can select
the storefront you wish to view.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:27.990
So tap Store.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.210
And for this example, I'll choose China.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.130
And then at this point,
you can tap Cancel to

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:37.450
exit out of the flow.

01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:41.840
Once you exit out of the flow,
the storefront will automatically

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.780
change to the territory you've selected.

01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:48.680
So now that we have our iOS
language set to Chinese and

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.680
our storefront set to China,
if we search for the Pages app,

01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:58.220
we can now see the Chinese localization
as it would appear for the customer.

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.640
Tip number two is regarding
tracking your customer reviews.

01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:07.300
Alex talked about how great this can
be for your business and that your

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.740
customers leave some great feedback.

01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:12.260
While you can do this on the App Store,
we also encourage you to do

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.200
this through iTunes Connect.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.490
You can access this page
from the app summary page.

01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:23.330
And the great thing about tracking
your reviews through iTunes Connect is

01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:28.720
that you can easily toggle between the
different territories since your customer

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.660
reviews are specific to each territory.

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:34.660
And you can access and
subscribe to an RSS feed,

01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:38.710
which allows you to get instant feedback
when customers post new reviews.

01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:46.010
Finally, tip number three is our
advice for scheduling a sale.

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.200
Since the App Store is
a global marketplace,

01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:54.580
we operate on many international
time zones across the world.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:01.270
And what that means is that pricing
or availability change will go live at

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:06.720
different times in different countries
on different time zones across the world.

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:11.020
And it's what we call a rolling
price and availability setting.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:15.570
Because the change begins propagating
in one area and then rolls across

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.890
the globe over a period of time.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:21.740
So to illustrate what this looks like,
we'll take a look at a map and we'll

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.440
use a price change as our example.

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:29.120
So if I have a paid app and I want
to run a 24-hour sale where customers

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:34.960
can download my app for free,
the price will begin to be free in the

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:41.720
New Zealand and South Pacific region,
followed by the Asia Pacific region,

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:46.840
then Australia, Russia, India,
and the Middle East.

01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:51.780
Next, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:56.070
And finally, the price will drop to
free in North America.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:00.590
And because of this rolling schedule,
what we recommend is that if

01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:05.470
you wish to run a 24-hour sale,
that you actually set it up for

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:08.300
three full days in iTunes Connect.

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:12.120
So this is what it would look like.

01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:18.120
You can see that I've set the sale to
begin on the 10th and end on the 13th.

01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:21.000
And that concludes our session for today.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.720
I want to thank you for your time.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.760
And here are a list of some of the
resources that were mentioned today.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.910
If you have any questions about
marketing or distribution,

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.700
please come visit us in the lab.

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.210
And we're going to take a short break.

01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:36.710
And in about five minutes or so,
we'll start again with

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:38.510
a session on SpriteKit.
