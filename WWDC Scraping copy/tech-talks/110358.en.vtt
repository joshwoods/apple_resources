00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.280
Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.790
Welcome all, and thank you for joining today's presentation

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.863
on app discovery and marketing.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.043
I'm Meghana,

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:13.050
and I'm part of the App Store Scaled Engagement team,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.860
and I'm joined by Chris, part of the Apple Search Ads team.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.590
We've got a lot of great material to share with you today,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.703
so let's dive in.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.840
For today's agenda, I'll start with a brief overview

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.483
of how people can discover apps on the App Store.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.800
Then we'll review the different tabs people can browse

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.383
on the App Store as they look for great apps.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.370
Next, we'll take a look at the role of search

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.600
in app discovery,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
including tips for making your app discoverable

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.163
by your target audience.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.640
And lastly, we'll share ways you can drive

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.370
referral traffic to your product page.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.190
This includes from sources outside the App Store

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.993
and through Search Ads campaigns.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.613
Okay, let's get started with discovery on the App Store.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.690
The App Store makes it easy for users to discover

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
and download amazing apps, games, and more.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.370
Customers find new apps and their favorites on iPhone,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.883
iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, and Apple TV.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.780
The App Store is a safe and trusted place

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.840
for people around the world to discover your app,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.890
reaching customers in more than 170 territories

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.950
on more than 1.5 billion devices,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.143
and in more than 40 languages.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.340
More than 600 million visitors come to the App Store

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.400
every week, giving you a tremendous opportunity

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.783
to showcase your app, or game, and drive downloads.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.590
So how can you get your app in front of the right people,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.290
and encourage them to download it?

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:50.760
Your product page is the place

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.970
where people can get the most information about your app,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.820
or game, and why they'll love it.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.550
Your product page shares a wealth of information

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.730
about your app, and this information can also appear

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.770
in other areas of the App Store,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.100
including the Today, Games, and Apps tab,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.380
as well as in search results.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.480
Let's dive in to see how you can make the most

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.960
out of your product page and help people discover it.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.020
Your app icon is one of the first things people see

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.670
on your product page.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.950
It's also what they'll see on their Home screen

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.930
once they download your app.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.990
It should make a strong first impression with people

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.690
and communicate what your app is all about.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.590
Alongside your app icon, people will see your app name.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.930
When choosing an app name, we recommend something

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.680
that's simple, easy to spell, and memorable.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.410
Make sure your app name hints at what it does,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.013
and isn't too generic, or too similar to other app names.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.280
Next is your app subtitle.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.290
Think of this as your app's tagline,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.843
or a summary of your app in a short phrase.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.690
Below your app icon, name, and subtitle are screenshots

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.550
and app previews.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.950
Screenshots are a powerful way for you

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.460
to visually communicate the most compelling features

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.830
and benefits of your app.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.340
You have the flexibility to display screenshots in portrait,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.270
or landscape orientation, and can include up to 10 of them

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.160
on your product page.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.550
App previews are a great way to showcase the functionality

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.273
of your app in a video format visible on your product page.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.330
When creating app previews,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.180
make sure the first few seconds are visually compelling

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.343
in order to capture people's interest.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.970
When people scroll down your product page,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.920
they'll see your app description.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.840
It should highlight the key features

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.603
and unique benefits of your app, or game.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.620
Promotional text appears at the top of your description,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.200
and is a great place for people to learn the latest news

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.180
about your app, such as new features, or limited time sales.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.700
You can easily include this information

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.670
and make updates without having to submit a new version

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.513
to App Review.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.160
Next are ratings and reviews about your app.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.280
This can help new users understand what features

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.440
and benefits are most compelling,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.390
and encourage downloads.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.240
For ratings and reviews, we offer you APIs

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.110
that you can use to easily request ratings within your app,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.560
as well as ways you can respond to those reviews.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.520
Your product page also displays any active in-app events

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.360
within your app, or game, which can help generate excitement

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.193
and increase awareness about them.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.860
You can create in-app events

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.990
for things like game competitions,

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.740
content premieres, challenges, major updates,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.410
and more that take place within your app,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.800
and you can feature up to five in-app events

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.973
on your product page at a given time.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.660
If your app offers in-app purchases,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.960
such as consumable items, or a subscription,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.420
these will appear in the information section

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.460
of your product page.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.640
You can also promote specific in-app purchases,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.040
which will elevate them on your product page

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.980
with unique visuals and metadata.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.060
You can include up to 20 in-app purchases at any time,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.070
so you can highlight specific content

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.410
based on your business needs.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.770
For example, if you have a limited time price promotion,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.153
or exclusive content.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.830
Promoted in-app purchases can also appear in search results,

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.683
which can help drive additional discovery of your app.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.070
As I shared earlier, the App Store is available

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.570
in more than 40 languages and in 170 territories.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.800
Localizing your app is the best way to reach people

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.780
in more places and grow your business.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.750
When localizing your app in new languages,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.750
be sure to translate all of your product page metadata

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.390
to deliver a high quality experience.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.150
You can also localize your app name by storefront,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.730
and add keywords for each additional market

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.823
to better help your app connect with the local audience.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.390
After you've created your product page,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.970
you can use the product page optimization feature

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.390
to understand how different metadata can improve engagement

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.833
and drive downloads.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.330
By using this feature, you can test different icons,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.300
screenshots, and app previews to find out

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.373
which resonate with people the most.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.320
For additional guidance on creating your product page

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.620
and more detail on many of the topics I just mentioned,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.933
you can visit the Apple Developer website.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.530
Now that we've shared how to create

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.050
an amazing product page experience

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.960
that encourages people to download your app,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.270
let's talk about how the App Store provides

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.853
a relevant browsing experience for people.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.230
The App Store has a global team of editors that focus

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.740
on helping people discover and engage with apps

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.990
and games that fit their needs.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.440
People can browse curated selections on the Today,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.280
Games, and Apps tabs, and they can also use the Search tab

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.543
to find a new favorite.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.990
Our team looks for great apps and games

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.180
across all categories and business models.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.330
While there is no specific checklist

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.220
of requirements for featuring,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.820
when selecting apps and games to highlight on the App Store,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.250
we consider the factors shown here.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.130
Our editors look at design, such as the UI,

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.930
or user experience, and features that may be new, or unique.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.810
Accessibility and localization are also

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.540
important considerations as we look for apps,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.690
or games that provide a high quality experience

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.343
for everyone around the world.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.700
Our team also looks at product pages

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.460
to see how developers showcase the distinct content

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.233
and features within their apps.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.620
You can share your app, or game with us

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.390
by submitting your information

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.253
through the Apple Developer website.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.460
You can use this form to let our team know

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.670
about new launches, major feature updates,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.710
in-app events, and more.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.570
Our editors read every submission

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.420
to help connect developers making great apps

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.250
with people who will love them.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.250
And if your app, game, or development team has

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.100
a unique story that our editorial team should know,

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.050
definitely be sure to tell us about it.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.280
Now, let's talk about one of the most popular

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.543
and powerful ways customers find new apps, search.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.720
In addition to browsing the App Store,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.870
search is a popular way for people to discover

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.330
new apps and games.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.970
Apps can appear on the search landing page

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.100
before someone begins a search,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.690
as well as in search results

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.300
after they've entered a search term.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.810
In addition to apps and games, search results can include

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.770
in-app events, in-app purchases, and editorial stories,

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.983
which offer additional opportunities to drive discovery.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.740
To help you make the most of search,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.010
consider making a strong impression with your metadata,

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.480
such as a compelling app icon, title, and screenshot,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.300
thinking about how you might use in-app events

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.590
to highlight timely content, or activities in your app,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.170
exploring promoting in-app purchases

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.860
to showcase particular purchases within your app,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.593
and finally, being strategic with your keywords.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.140
Let's review some best practices

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.090
for choosing those keywords.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.890
Keywords help determine when

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.340
and where your app appears in search results.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.400
Keywords are limited to 100 characters total,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.740
so here are some best practices

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.523
to help you make the most of them.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.070
Choose keywords based on words

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.240
you think your audience will use to find an app like yours.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.370
You want to specify your app's features

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.700
and functionalities in order to help our search algorithms

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.120
surface your app in relevant searches.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.800
Be sure to separate your terms

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.080
with commas rather than spaces

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.990
in order to maximize your character count.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.750
Don't include your app name, or category,

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.660
as these are already indexed by the algorithm,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.920
and don't use plurals,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.143
as these don't add any additional value.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.640
If offering your app in multiple territories,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.830
be sure your keywords are localized

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.130
in order to help people find your app more easily

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.800
using their preferred language.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.560
Finally, only include trademark terms

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.113
if you have the proper approval to do so.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.040
Now that we've reviewed how people can discover,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.760
browse, and search for apps and games on the App Store,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.560
let's discuss how you can direct people

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.890
to your product page from outside the App Store.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.050
People can be directed to your product page

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.630
from a variety of referral sources,

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.200
including your organic sources, such as your website,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.680
social media efforts, and email campaigns,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.250
as well as paid marketing efforts, such as advertising.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.670
Our App Store marketing tools website offers resources

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.763
to help you promote your apps outside the App Store.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.600
From this website, you can generate short links,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.510
QR codes, and more that direct people

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.090
to your App Store product page.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.610
You can also create custom assets,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.270
which include your app icon and App Store badge,

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.780
and even localize this content in multiple languages,

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.030
so you can more easily promote your app

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.713
in international markets.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.180
This website also links to our App Store Marketing Resources

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.250
and Identity Guidelines.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.880
This provides App Store badges and product images,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.400
as well as guidance on graphic standards,

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.563
messaging, and writing style.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.030
Another way you can refer people to your product page is

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.520
with Safari Smart App Banners.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.800
These banners display on your website,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.460
and have a look and feel that's similar to the App Store.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.980
You can use smart app banners to send people

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.020
directly to your product page,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.170
or if someone already has your app installed,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.240
the View link will change to Open,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.220
and you can even use the feature to link

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.143
to specific in-app content.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.190
Another way to create a great landing experience

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.140
when coming to your product page is

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.510
through custom product pages.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.000
You can direct people outside the App Store

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.550
to a version of your App Store product page

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.270
that showcases specific features, or content.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.620
For example, an app like Forest Explorer might create a page

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.810
highlighting the livestreaming feature

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.350
for people interested in following climbers in real-time,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.050
and create another custom product page that highlights

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.000
the GPS tracking feature,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.490
which might appeal to people interested in planning

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.023
a group climb with friends.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.970
You'll share each custom product page using its unique URL

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.570
in your marketing efforts, such as social media advertising,

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.610
or email campaigns.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.010
Each page is fully localizable,

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.200
and you can submit custom product pages

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.170
independent of an app binary update.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.520
You can have up to 35 custom product pages per app published

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.070
on the App Store at any given time.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.650
You can also use custom product pages

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.400
to create ad variations with Apple Search Ads.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.350
You can learn more about how to create

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.833
and use custom product pages on the Apple Developer website.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.830
We shared a lot of information

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.410
about how people can discover your app

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.540
and tools you can use to market it,

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.970
and now, you might be wondering how you can measure

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.683
how effective your efforts are.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.160
With App Analytics in App Store Connect,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.620
you can get data you won't find anywhere else

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.710
about how many people discover, download,

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.480
and interact with your app.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.850
With App Analytics, you can get data related

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.780
to your App Store performance and marketing campaigns,

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.460
your app engagement and usage, in-app event performance,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.550
proceeds per paying users, and more.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.970
This data helps you understand how people discover,

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.130
download, and use your app,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.220
and can help you improve your app experience.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.140
All data in App Analytics

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.290
and all the other features we covered today are included

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.420
and available to you at no cost

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.213
as part of your Apple Developer Program membership.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.930
To get more information about all the features

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.850
and tools we covered today,

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.310
you can visit the Apple Developer website,

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.820
where we share best practices, feature overviews,

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.460
and video resources to help you make the most

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.890
of your business on the App Store.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.930
And with that, I'll pass it to Chris,

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.790
who will share more about how you can use

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.823
Apple Search Ads to help people discover your app.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.367
Thanks, Meghana.

00:14:41.367 --> 00:14:42.870
Now that we've covered all of the ways

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.420
that people can discover your app, or game,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.430
let's explore how to promote your app

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.280
where it matters the most, throughout the App Store,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.140
the place that these engaged users go

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.513
to discover and download apps.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.700
Available in 61 countries and regions around the world,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.520
Apple Search Ads lets you tap directly into the intent

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.743
that motivates every visit to the App Store.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.490
Our ad placement options drive visibility

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.310
and downloads of your app at key moments

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.710
throughout the user journey.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.920
First, the Today tab is the front page of the App Store,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.020
where millions of visitors start their journey

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.090
to discover new apps.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.380
It's where people find stories

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.443
and collections that inform, help, and inspire.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.890
A prominently placed ad on the Today tab

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.980
helps you maximize visibility of your app.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.290
High impact ad creative is designed

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.670
to capture people's attention

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.160
when they first come to the App Store.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.130
Each Today tab ad is based on a custom product page

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.020
you create in App Store Connect,

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.873
and is thoughtfully integrated into the user experience.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.690
As Meghana mentioned, search is the primary way

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.000
people discover apps on the App Store,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
as 70% of App Store visitors use search to discover apps.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.660
With an ad on the Search tab,

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.130
you can capture users' interest

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.470
right as they begin their search.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.030
Your ad will appear prominently

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.463
at the top of the Suggested apps list.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.220
With search results ads,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.890
you can reach people when they search for something specific

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.223
by promoting your app at the top of relevant search results.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.230
65% of downloads happen directly after a search,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.000
and we match your ad with people

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.580
based on their direct signal of intent,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.980
which is their search query.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.590
Our intelligent technology matches the search term

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.360
with the apps being promoted,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.773
delivering an average conversion rate of 60%.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.690
You can also use custom product pages

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.640
to create ad variations aligned

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.133
with different keyword themes and audiences.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.050
And finally, we saw earlier that app product pages

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.940
give people the information they need

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.593
to decide which apps to download.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.980
Whether a user's journey starts within the App Store,

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.190
or from an external source, such as marketing campaigns,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.680
referral traffic, or any other links,

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.600
they visit product pages to get details

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.300
about the apps that interest them.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.000
Our new product page placements let you reach people

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.680
when they're actively researching apps,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.900
and getting information to help them decide

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.043
whether to download.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.640
Your ad will appear to interested users

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.410
who have scrolled down to the bottom

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.973
of relevant product pages.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.360
Setting up a campaign is simple,

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.810
and it's easy to get started.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.030
You'll choose your app, select your ad placement,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.310
and choose one, or more countries and regions

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.810
where you want your ad to run.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.040
There's no minimum spend for Apple Search Ads campaigns,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.780
which means you can invest as much,

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.030
or as little as you want.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.440
You'll add a daily budget,

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.320
which is the average amount you want to spend each day.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.360
The daily budget is optimized for days

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.000
where there are more more opportunities to get downloads,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.700
and you can change it at any time.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.130
You can also add an optional start and end date

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.260
for your campaigns, where you'll also set

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.840
a max cost-per-tap bid.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.730
Pricing for all of our placements is based

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.260
on a cost-per-tap model,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.940
so you determine the maximum amount

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.463
that you're willing to pay for a tap on your ad.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.870
The actual cost is a result of a second-price auction,

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.700
so you can bid competitively

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.353
without the worry of overpaying.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.280
Apple Search Ads automatically optimizes

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.680
a lot of your campaign settings to help you reach

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.160
more App Store users and drive more downloads.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.060
But you can make adjustments based on your specific goals.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.620
In search results campaigns,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.270
you can choose to use Search Match,

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.550
a feature that automatically matches your ad

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.070
to search queries without keywords,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.473
or you can add keywords to your campaigns.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.930
Keywords are relevant words,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.860
or phrases someone may use to search for an app like yours.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.080
Your keywords and your bids help determine

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.303
when your ad appears in search results.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.680
In product page campaigns, you can choose to have

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.800
your ad run across all relevant app categories,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.653
or in categories similar to, or different from yours.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.940
Within any campaign, you can automatically optimize your ad

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.460
to reach all eligible App Store users,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.620
or you can modify settings to focus

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.500
on specific audiences you choose.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.300
Keep in mind that you'll limit impressions

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.893
if you narrow your audience.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.540
The ad for your campaign is automatically created

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.410
using the assets you already uploaded to App Store Connect.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.800
Search tab and product page ads feature your app name,

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.930
icon, and subtitle.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.930
Search results ads can use default ad creative

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.940
based on your app's product page,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.300
or you can create ad variations from custom product pages

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.050
you've set up in App Store Connect.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.910
Ad variations allow you to align ad creative

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.583
with specific audiences and keyword themes.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.550
And Today tab ads are always created

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.620
from a custom product page.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.810
The custom product page used must include

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.473
at least four portrait, or five landscape assets.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.650
Before your Today tab ad can run,

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.743
your ad creative will be reviewed by Apple Search Ads.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.370
Once your campaigns are up and running,

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.320
reporting options provide rich data

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.973
about your campaign performance.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.020
Use the Campaigns dashboard, Charts dashboard,

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.970
and custom reports to easily view

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.530
campaign performance metrics

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.083
and effectively measure your return on ad spend.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.290
Our customers are seeing great results

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.433
with Apple Search Ads.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.190
For example, Delivery Hero,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.950
developer of the food and drink app foodpanda,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.870
maximized impressions and downloads

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.270
while improving acquisition costs,

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.500

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.640

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.263
while using Apple Search Ads.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.010
With "Marvel Future Revolution,"

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.990
players can transform into superheroes

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.313
in the Marvel universe.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.500
During the app's launch,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.260
publisher Netmarble drove global downloads

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.893
while boosting revenue, retention, and return on ad spend.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.240
They were able to more than double revenue per install

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.760
