00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.490
Hi everyone.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.500
Today, I'm excited to share more

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.440
about App Store pricing capabilities.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.143
I'm Camille and I work on the App Store pricing team.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.350
In this session, we'll start with an overview

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.903
of the pricing capabilities on the App Store.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.180
Then, we'll talk

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.610
about how the App Store global pricing tools

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.950
can help you effortlessly price your content

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.113
in 175 storefronts.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.220
Next, we'll explore the advanced tools available

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.683
to customize pricing for each storefront.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.837
And finally, I'll share some examples

00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:36.960
of pricing configurations

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.560
that can help you make the most out of these new features.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.673
So let's jump in.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.040
With a total of 175 different storefronts,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.830
the App Store makes it easy to distribute your apps

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.663
and games across the world.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.837
In 72 of these storefronts,

00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:58.500
customers can make purchases in their local currency.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.800
For example, Japanese customers purchase in yen,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.350
Polish customers purchase in zloty,

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.753
and Tanzanian customers purchase in shilling.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.030
Altogether, the App Store supports 44 local currencies,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.830
with the United States dollars

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.623
and euro each supporting multiple storefronts.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.000
And in 77 of these storefronts,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.350
Apple collects and remits taxes on sales to customers.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.090
The scope changes every year,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.350
as new taxes are introduced or existing tax rates change.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.090
For example, 27 of these storefronts either introduced a tax

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.003
or experienced a tax change in the last two years alone.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.650
Prices advertised to customers in all countries

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.770
except the U.S. and Canada include taxes,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.230
so changes in tax may affect your earnings

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.623
from App Store sales if prices aren't adjusted accordingly.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.210
To help you stay on top of changes in tax laws

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.520
and fluctuations in exchange rate,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.460
Apple has developed a set of global pricing tools

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.860
that makes it simple for you to price your apps

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.413
and in-app purchases in all storefronts.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.050
Apple also provides a set of tools to let you manage pricing

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.570
and availability by storefront.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.070
Let's walk through these tools,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.013
starting with a deep dive on the global pricing tools.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.000
With Apple's global pricing tools,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.910
you can select a base storefront for each app

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.030
or in-app purchase you offer on the App Store.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.940
This allows you to select a storefront you're familiar with

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.833
as the basis for global pricing.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.190
You'll be able to choose a price for this storefront

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.825
among 900 price point options.

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:44.219
Apple will then automatically generate comparable prices

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.320
across the other storefronts,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.450
taking into account foreign exchange rates

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.683
and certain taxes.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.250
These globally equalized prices follow

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.220
the most common pricing conventions in each storefront,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.410
so customers see prices that's most relevant

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.153
to their region and currency.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.440
Finally, prices other than your base

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.180
will be automatically updated

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.550
for foreign exchange and tax rate changes

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.370
to help ensure your global prices stay comparable

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.933
to your selected base price.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.920
So let's explore how global equalization works

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.003
through an example.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.170
Suppose you select Germany as your base storefront

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.980
and set a base price point of 7.99 euros.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.360
Based on this choice,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.220
Apple establishes similar prices

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.980
in the remaining 174 storefronts

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.023
based on local pricing conventions.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.540
For instance, the US,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.490
the UK and Canada follow a pricing convention ending in .99,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.430
while China has price points ending in 8.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.226
In Japan, we see even, rounded price points,

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:51.330
and in Korea, we see a price like 9,901

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.220
that starts with a repeating digit,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.339
a convention that is commonly used in Korea.

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.550
Prices are globally equalized before tax,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.550
which means customers in each country pay approximately

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.380
the same amount as your base price,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.483
but with local taxes added on top.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.739
As a result, proceeds in each storefront

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.426
are approximately equalized.

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:15.480
In this example, we can see that global proceeds

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.860
are closely equalized

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.713
to our proceeds of 4.70 euros in Germany,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.390
and they range from 4.45 euros in Japan

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.523
to 4.88 euros in Canada.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.930
Additionally, the pricing of your apps

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.080
and one-time in-app purchases will adjust automatically

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.930
to maintain global prices aligned with your base price

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.303
as foreign exchange and tax rates fluctuate.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.400
Thanks to these global pricing tools,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.250
you have an easy way to generate comparable prices

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.110
for customers around the world,

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.243
regardless of where they purchase from.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.380
The automated price updates help you effortlessly stay

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.050
on top of foreign exchange and tax rate changes

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.000
so that global prices stay equalized

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.950
to the base price you have defined

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.480
while making sure that customers

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.107
in each storefront see recognizable prices

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:08.133
that are relevant to their market.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.380
The global pricing tools

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.900
also help your global earnings stay consistent

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.808
and reduces your foreign exchange exposure.

00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:18.990
Finally, it also limits opportunities

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.293
for customers to seek lower prices on certain storefronts.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.590
As we'll see in the second part of this presentation,

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.770
you will always have the option to manually manage prices

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.900
in any storefront if you prefer.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.300
However, if you select your own prices,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.610
you will not benefit from the automatic repricing

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.017
for foreign exchange and tax,

00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:38.196
and you will be responsible

00:05:38.196 --> 00:05:41.013
for reflecting those changes in your prices.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.620
So how to make the most of the global equalization feature?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.593
The first step is to carefully select your base storefront.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.707
Apple will use the price you define in this storefront

00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:55.607
as the basis for generating comparable prices

00:05:55.607 --> 00:05:59.763
in the other 174 storefronts and 43 currencies.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.533
Your base storefront can be any of the 175 storefronts,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.050
and the price in your base storefront

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.913
will never be automatically updated.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.780
Prices in the other storefronts,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.736
however, may be updated for foreign exchange and tax

00:06:15.736 --> 00:06:18.150
to maintain global prices equalized

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.030
with the price you set for your base storefront.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.890
Please note that this does not apply

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.843
to auto-renewable subscriptions.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.910
So how do you decide what your base storefront should be?

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.710
If you cater to a single market,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.870
it may make sense to select that market

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.070
as your base storefront.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.059
If you don't have a single focus market,

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.980
you might consider your user base location

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.290
to help determine a base storefront.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.500
For example, if most of your customer base is in Europe,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.333
it might make sense

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:49.683
for you to choose a European country as base.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.910
Another consideration could be the currency

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.950
in which your earnings are paid.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.000
It might make sense for you

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.760
to align your base storefront and your earnings currency

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.160
in order to keep things consistent.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.290
Note that it's not at all a requirement.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.930
For example, if you have selected your App Store earnings

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.518
to be paid in Canadian dollars,

00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:11.640
but you select the U.S. as your base storefront,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.953
you will still be paid in Canadian dollars.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.900
Another consideration is currency volatility.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.600
If you choose a base storefront with a volatile currency,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.309
it may result in more frequent price adjustments compared

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:26.043
with other storefronts.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.730
In any case, you will define a base storefront

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.800
for each individual purchase.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.270
So depending on your business,

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.280
you could choose different base storefronts

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.595
for different in-app purchases.

00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:38.820
For in-app purchases

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.280
without a base storefront explicitly defined,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.530
the base storefront defined at the app level

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.050
is inherited by the associated in-app purchases.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.690
And if no base storefront

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.630
is defined neither at the app or in-app level,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.213
the U.S. is the assumed base storefront by default.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.180
To illustrate the impact

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.240
of your choice of base storefront on global prices,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.773
let's look at two scenarios.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:03.995
In the first scenario,

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:06.660
Germany is selected as the base storefront

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.840
with a base price of 7.99 euros.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.360
Comparable prices are automatically generated

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.770
for the other storefronts,

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.800
and prices will remain equalized with the German price,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.330
even if there are fluctuations

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.253
in tax or foreign exchange rates.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.130
For instance, if the U.S. dollar

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.380
and British pound weaken against the euro

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.821
and other currencies,

00:08:26.821 --> 00:08:29.723
prices in the U.S. and the UK would increase

00:08:29.723 --> 00:08:32.523
to maintain price equalization with Germany.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.760
Now looking at the same scenario,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.800
this time with the United Kingdom selected

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.600
as the base storefront.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.340
The starting point is the same,

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.775
with a base price of 6.99 pounds

00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:46.620
and comparable prices automatically generated

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.500
for the other storefronts, including Germany.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.231
However, if we consider the same change in foreign exchange

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.965
as in our previous example,

00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:57.047
prices in the U.S. would remain the same while prices

00:08:57.047 --> 00:09:00.240
in the other storefronts would this time decrease

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.683
to reflect the same change.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.160
Once you have chosen a base storefront,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.533
the second step is to choose your base price.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.440
You can choose from 900 price points

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.050
in the currency of your base storefront.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.070
By default, you have access to 800 prices up to $1,000

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.380
and similar prices worldwide.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.390
On request, you can also access

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.713
an additional 100 higher price points as high as $10,000.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.280
Prices start at 29 cents in the US,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.260
with lower priced options available

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.120
in most emerging markets.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.240
For example, the lowest price in India is 9 rupee,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.337
which is about 9 U.S. dollar cents,

00:09:38.337 --> 00:09:41.273
and the lowest price in China is 1 Chinese yuan,

00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:44.073
which is equivalent to 15 U.S. dollar cents.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.580
For all markets, you will be able

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.490
to choose among several common pricing conventions

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.530
and select the one that is the most suited

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.123
to your marketing purposes.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.395
Looking, for example, at the U.S. 900 prices,

00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:02.010
we can see that steps between price points

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.960
are smaller for lower price points

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.440
and gradually decrease as prices increase.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.270
10 cents price steps are supported

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.270
until $10 and 50 cents price steps are supported until $50.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.920
In terms of conventions,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.530
you have the choice between four conventions.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.910
You can opt to use .99 endings, like 9.99,

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.010
or to incorporate different price endings,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.783
like whole numbers or endings in .90 or .95

00:10:29.783 --> 00:10:31.020
that could be useful

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.573
for annual plans or discounts, for example.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.540
Looking at another example,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.150
with the 900 price points available for China,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.690
we see that smallest price steps start this time at 0.5 yuan

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.610
and are supported until 10 yuan,

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.353
then move to steps of 1 yuan, supported until 200 yuans.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.800
You also have the choice between five conventions.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.210
For lower price points,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.449
you can choose whole numbers or endings in .80 or .90.

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:02.280
For higher price points, you could opt for endings in 9,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.823
like 99, or endings in 8, like 98.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.360
You can request access to the 100 price points above $1,000

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.360
by filling out a request form on the developer website

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.983
at the address shown on screen.

00:11:19.124 --> 00:11:22.860
Once you have chosen a base storefront and a base price,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.590
Apple's automated global pricing features provide you

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.540
with a great way to effortlessly price

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.043
your content worldwide.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.000
As we've seen in our Germany example,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.180
Apple automatically calculates worldwide prices equalized

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.820
to your base price before tax,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.799
following common pricing conventions,

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:43.320
so that customers see great prices

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.537
regardless of their region.

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:49.350
Additionally, if you choose automated global pricing,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.230
prices for your apps and one-time in-app purchases

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.910
will automatically be updated

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.510
to keep you on top of foreign exchange and tax rate changes.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.184
Reprices happen only when specific criteria are met.

00:12:01.184 --> 00:12:04.530
Typically, pricing for a storefront will be updated

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.265
if its currency strengthens or weakens by at least 10%,

00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:11.313
and the change is sustained over a couple of quarters.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.760
This keeps global pricing equalized over time,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.650
but it also keeps prices stable

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.743
when foreign exchange rate changes are only short-lived.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.980
Larger foreign exchange rate changes,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.730
like 25% or more, may trigger faster action.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.970
Apple uses publicly available exchange rate information

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.890
from financial data providers

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.443
to evaluate these changes in foreign exchange.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.020
Prices may also be updated

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.220
whenever a country introduces a new tax or a tax change.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.390
It's important to note

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.520
that auto-renewable subscription prices

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.200
are not automatically adjusted

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.050
to account for foreign exchange and tax changes,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.880
but you can update your subscription pricing

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.773
at any time in App Store Connect.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.280
Any price change will be notified

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.452
by email at least 14 days in advance,

00:12:58.452 --> 00:13:01.200
and the new prices will be displayed in App Store Connect

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.453
for your review from the time of notice.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.265
When an automatic price change is scheduled,

00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:11.520
you'll see it appear in the Upcoming Changes section

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.220
of your price schedule on App Store Connect.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.324
New prices will be posted at least 14 days in advance

00:13:17.324 --> 00:13:18.870
to give you the opportunity

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.230
to review the changes to the impacted storefronts.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.410
We'll explore where and how to review the upcoming changes

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.913
in App Store Connect shortly.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.810
For apps and one-time in-app purchases

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.430
that were created before the launch

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.100
of these new features in March 2023

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.380
and that do not have a base storefront,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.270
you may also take this opportunity

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.800
to edit your base storefront

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.350
if you'd like the reprice to be based on your price

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.840
in a storefront other than the US.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.970
You may change your prices at any time

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.263
and in any storefront.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.940
Let's see what these global pricing tools look like

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.554
in App Store Connect.

00:13:55.554 --> 00:13:58.770
I will walk through an example for a consumable,

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.130
but the experience would be the same for any content type.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.980
If you set up a price for a new in-app purchase

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.720
or if you edit your base storefront,

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.340
a screen will prompt you to fill

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.230
in your base country or region.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.053
As in our previous example, let's select Germany.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.814
The next step is selecting a base price.

00:14:19.814 --> 00:14:22.260
In keeping with our previous example,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.245
let's select 7.99 euro and then click Next.

00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:28.784
Apple will automatically generate prices

00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:30.930
that are equalized before tax

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.053
and follow pricing conventions relevant to each region.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.790
By default, Apple will automatically adjust prices for you.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.480
Alternatively, you can use the dropdown next to each price

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.600
to choose different prices for individual storefronts.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.086
If you select your own prices,

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:49.260
Apple won't adjust your pricing

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.123
on those storefronts in the future.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.710
Once you have saved your choices,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.210
you can see your base storefront

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.598
and selected prices in the Price Schedule section.

00:15:00.598 --> 00:15:04.080
You'll see the mention May adjust automatically.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.690
This indicates that prices for listed countries

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.740
other than the base

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.073
may be automatically updated for foreign exchange and tax.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.540
And whenever one of those automatic reprices happens,

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.730
the upcoming changes will be displayed

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.553
at least 14 days in advance on App Store Connect.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.840
In the Upcoming Changes section of the Price Schedule,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.880
you will see the effective date,

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.486
impacted storefront and new upcoming prices.

00:15:30.486 --> 00:15:33.473
In this example, we can see new prices for the UK

00:15:33.473 --> 00:15:37.593
and the U.S. starting on January 15, 2024.

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:40.920
The global pricing tools

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.740
we've just walked through provide you with a great way

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.360
to easily price your apps

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.510
and in-app purchases in all storefronts.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.550
Now let's review the additional tools

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.170
that can help you manage pricing

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.143
and distribution of your content at the storefront level.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.070
Apple's Storefront Management tools enable you

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.260
to manually set prices by storefront

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.053
either on a temporary or indefinite basis.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.190
And you can also set availability by storefront

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.480
for each of your individual

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.463
in-app purchases, including subscriptions.

00:16:12.463 --> 00:16:14.340
Let's see some examples

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.230
of what these storefront price management tools

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.163
can help you do.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.540
First, you might have specific marketing needs

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.554
in some storefronts that may require custom prices.

00:16:24.554 --> 00:16:27.750
For example, you could prefer to market your content

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.701
with a different convention in Japan,

00:16:29.701 --> 00:16:33.783
for example 980 yen instead of 1000 yen.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.140
Or you might prefer to have the same price

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.670
in euro and pounds

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.703
despite the difference in foreign exchange and tax rates.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.430
Storefront management tools

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.500
may also be relevant to your business

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.560
if you need your prices to reflect differences in market

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.086
or competitive conditions in certain storefronts.

00:16:53.086 --> 00:16:56.894
For example, you could want to set up a lower price in China

00:16:56.894 --> 00:16:59.206
to better align with local competition,

00:16:59.206 --> 00:17:03.648
let's say a price of 18 Chinese yuan instead of 48 yuan.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:06.090
There is no limit to the number of storefronts

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.560
you can manually manage

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.310
and you could have manual prices in the UK, Japan and China

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.610
while keeping automatically updated global prices

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:15.903
in the other storefronts.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.990
You can also manually manage prices

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.270
for only a short period of time.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.600
For example, you might want to run a seasonal promotion

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.490
in Korea specifically.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.517
You could set up a price of 1100 yuan

00:17:29.517 --> 00:17:32.850
for a short period of time, let's say a month.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.370
At the end of the month, prices would go back

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.973
to being equalized with your price of 7.99 euros.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.930
To summarize, Apple storefront pricing management tools

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.940
enable you to set up custom prices

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.160
in any number of storefronts.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.630
You can choose your custom price

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.710
among the 900 price point options available

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.770
in each storefront

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.360
and you can set up custom prices

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.380
for a limited period of time only or for an indefinite time.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.360
When a price is manually managed,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.070
it cannot be automatically updated

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.140
for foreign exchange and tax.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.435
You will be solely responsible for updating prices

00:18:06.435 --> 00:18:09.003
as tax and foreign exchange fluctuate.

00:18:10.307 --> 00:18:11.260
Let's see where to find

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.500
these storefront pricing management tools

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.330
in App Store Connect.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.235
When you create a price for the first time

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:19.470
or when you edit your base storefront,

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.390
you can click on the dropdown next

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.453
to each storefront to select another price.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.110
If you choose this option,

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.120
prices in the impacted storefronts

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.910
will not be automatically updated ever again

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.813
unless you reset prices through a global price change

00:18:35.813 --> 00:18:37.653
or edit your base storefront again.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.710
You can also schedule a price change for existing apps

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.955
and one-time in-app purchases.

00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:48.930
You can do so in the price schedule section

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.380
of your in-app purchase by clicking on the plus button.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.900
For apps, you'll find this button in the pricing

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.193
and availability section.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.430
Once you do so, you'll be presented

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.920
with three price change options.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.410
Select the temporary price change option

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.635
if you want to set up a custom price for only a limited time

00:19:10.635 --> 00:19:12.990
and select custom price change

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.943
if you want to make a permanent change.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.380
If you want to go back to automatically manage prices,

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.920
you can always do so by scheduling a global price change.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.650
This will take you back to automatically manage prices

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:26.943
for all storefronts.

00:19:29.552 --> 00:19:32.326
Another feature of Apple's storefront management tools

00:19:32.326 --> 00:19:34.200
is the option to manage your app

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.774
or in-app purchase availability by storefront.

00:19:37.774 --> 00:19:41.190
You can choose different availability settings at the app

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.230
and in-app purchase level.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.110
For example, you can distribute your app globally

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.670
but restrict the availability

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.470
of a particular in-app purchase

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.340
to the storefronts

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.953
where you have secured content distribution rights.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.670
You can manage availability for all content types,

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.893
including auto-renewable subscriptions.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.860
You can choose any number of storefronts

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.421
where you want to distribute your app and in-app purchase

00:20:04.421 --> 00:20:07.953
and you can change the availability at any point in time.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.588
If you decide to change the availability

00:20:10.588 --> 00:20:13.440
of an existing auto-renewable subscription,

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.480
keep in mind to provide advance notice

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.890
to existing customers

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.053
before removing your content from sale.

00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:22.225
On App Store Connect, you can set up

00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:24.024
and change storefront availability

00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:27.930
in the Availability section of your in-app purchase.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.880
For apps, you'll find this button

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.983
in the Pricing and Availability tab.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.140
Now that we've seen the two sets of tools

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.300
you can use to manage your global pricing,

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.123
let's look at a few examples of these tools in action.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.320
Let's say we're a game developer

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.086
and we want to define global pricing for our app, The Coast.

00:20:50.086 --> 00:20:51.960
The Coast is a free app,

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.160
but we sell several different

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.055
in-app purchases, mostly consumables.

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:58.860
Our primary business is in Europe,

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.299
but we have a global footprint

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:04.323
as we market our app to customers in China and the US.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.110
We also acquired content rights

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.293
for a subscription that extends only to U.S. customers.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.985
Let's walk through three examples

00:21:13.985 --> 00:21:17.190
of how we can leverage App Store pricing capabilities

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.663
to serve our pricing needs.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.130
First, we'll see how we can set up a new in-app purchase

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.930
with Germany as our base storefront

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.773
while setting up some custom prices in the U.S. and the UK.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.430
Second, we'll set up a seasonal promotion

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.290
for one of our in-app purchases

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.905
for our customers in China specifically.

00:21:36.905 --> 00:21:39.720
Finally, we'll restrict the availability

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.700
of our auto-renewable subscription

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.833
to customers in the United States.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:49.170
Let's start by setting up a new in-app purchase

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.415
with custom prices in select markets.

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:53.850
We'll select Germany as the base storefront

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.200
for the in-app purchase

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.140
and at the same time, we'll select custom prices

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.420
in the U.S. and the UK.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.910
Once we do so, the prices in the UK

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.880
and the U.S. will not be updated ever again

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.473
while prices in the other storefronts

00:22:07.473 --> 00:22:11.250
will be automatically equalized based on the German price

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.110
and may be updated in the future

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.733
for foreign exchange and tax.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.790
Let's walk through the steps

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.040
to set up our new in-app purchase prices

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.780
in App Store Connect.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.520
In the in-app purchase page,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.560
you can see that the price schedule section

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.743
is not filled out yet, so we'll add pricing.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.903
We'll select Germany as our base storefront.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.700
Next, we'll choose a base price

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.433
of 7.99 euros and click Next.

00:22:42.704 --> 00:22:46.437
On the next page, we see automatically generated prices

00:22:46.437 --> 00:22:48.510
that are equalized before tax

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.990
and follow pricing conventions relevant to each region.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.940
We see a price of $6.99 in the U.S.,

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.200
and 6.99 pounds in the UK.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.120
For this in-app purchase specifically,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.450
we would rather have our U.S. and UK prices aligned

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.590
with the euro price

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.980
despite the difference in foreign exchange and tax rates.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.380
So we'll start by clicking on the dropdown next

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.003
to the U.S. price to select a price of $7.99 instead.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.100
When we do so, we see that the United States

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.570
is highlighted in yellow

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.403
with a callout saying that Apple won't adjust

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:25.185
the prices for you in the future

00:23:25.185 --> 00:23:28.833
to account for changes in tax and foreign exchange rates.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.954
So our price will stay $7.99,

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:34.970
even if there is a significant change

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.293
in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.910
Now let's do the same for the price in the UK

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.223
and select 7.99 pounds.

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:48.870
The same call-out appears for the United Kingdom.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.939
For all the other countries,

00:23:50.939 --> 00:23:54.150
we want to leverage the automated global price tools

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.720
that maintains prices equalized even as foreign exchange

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.250
and tax rate change.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.950
So we are at the end of our edits on this page.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.063
Let's click Next.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.529
Then we can confirm our prices.

00:24:08.529 --> 00:24:12.270
We see our base price of £7.99 listed first

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.500
and this call-out saying that prices in two countries

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.433
will not be automatically adjusted moving forward.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.373
Once we click on Confirm,

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.513
we can see our new pricing in the Price Schedule section.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.838
Germany is the base storefront and prices

00:24:28.838 --> 00:24:33.838
in 173 storefronts are noted as May Adjust Automatically.

00:24:35.598 --> 00:24:39.270
Since prices in a base storefront will never be updated,

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.180
this means that prices in 172 storefronts

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.070
are equalized to the German price

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.750
and may be automatically updated

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.583
for foreign exchange and tax.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.560
And we see that two prices are listed as manually adjusted.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.470
Those are prices in the U.S. and the UK

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.750
where we have defined custom prices.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.200
These prices will never be automatically updated.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.620
Let's now see how we can set up a promotion

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.200
for Chinese customers specifically.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.838
We can do so by scheduling a temporary price change.

00:25:10.838 --> 00:25:13.770
We can schedule a price change in China only

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.257
so that Chinese customers are the only impacted customers.

00:25:17.257 --> 00:25:19.638
During the whole duration of the promotion,

00:25:19.638 --> 00:25:23.940
there can be no automatic reprice for prices in China.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.440
When the promotion ends,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.653
prices in China will again be equalized to the German price.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.900
Let's walk through the steps

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.930
to set up our promotion on App Store Connect.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.310
In the price schedule section,

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.180
we see that all global prices are based on the German price,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.550
with 28 yuan being our current price in China.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.398
Now let's schedule a price change

00:25:44.398 --> 00:25:47.883
by clicking on the plus sign on our price schedule section.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.300
We'll select the option Temporary Price Change

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.250
to set up a lower price in China

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.410
for the duration of the promotion.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.180
On the next screen, we can enter

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.183
when we want our promotion to start and to end.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.090
Then, we'll select the storefronts

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.010
this promotion applies to.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.993
In our case, that's just China.

00:26:09.144 --> 00:26:12.690
We'll then enter the price we want for our promotion.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.570
On this screen, we are asked to enter a price

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.190
in the storefront of our choice,

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.670
and Apple will automatically calculate comparable prices

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.928
in the storefronts we've selected.

00:26:22.928 --> 00:26:26.250
This is different from selecting a base storefront,

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.690
as this step is just here

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.940
to help us price our promotion globally

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.313
when we want to run it in several storefronts.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.180
In our case, we've only selected China,

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.550
so we can directly enter 8 yuan,

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.620
which is the price we want for our promotion,

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.973
then click through this screen, and the next,

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.303
then confirm the change from 28 yuan to 8 yuan.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.040
Now, if we come back to the pricing schedule,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.890
we can see that there is a temporary price change scheduled

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.900
with our price of 8 yuan.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.250
During this period,

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.899
there can be no automatic price adjustment

00:27:03.899 --> 00:27:05.880
to the price in China,

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.543
and you'll notice the price is noted as manually adjusted.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.120
After the end of the promotion,

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.270
the price in China will be re-equalized to Germany

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.190
and may be automatically adjusted

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.023
for foreign exchange and tax.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.590
For our last example,

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.750
let's see how we can restrict the availability

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.350
of our auto-renewable subscription to the U.S. only.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.360
Once we do so, customers outside

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.850
the U.S. will no longer be able to purchase,

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.579
and if we have existing customers,

00:27:34.579 --> 00:27:37.020
they will eventually churn.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.570
As a result, developers need to make sure

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.540
they have provided them with advance notice.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.723
Assuming we've done so, let's navigate to App Store Connect.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.970
Once we've navigated to the subscription page,

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:54.630
we can see that the availability is set for all countries.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:55.953
Let's click on Edit.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.650
We can select any storefront, but in our case,

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.328
we want our content to be available to U.S. customers only,

00:28:05.328 --> 00:28:07.661
so we'll select the U.S. only.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.540
Once we confirm, we can see

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.890
that availability now shows only one storefront, the US.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.336
Any existing subscriber outside of the US

00:28:19.336 --> 00:28:20.973
will eventually churn.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.840
And that concludes our examples.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.970
If you're looking for more information,

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.400
or would like to reference what we discussed today,

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.410
please do visit our developer website,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.880
which is an excellent resource

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.310
that you can reference at any time.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.960
With that, I'd like to conclude

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.870
our App Store Pricing Capabilities session today.
