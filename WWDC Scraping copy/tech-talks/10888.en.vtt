00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.136
Seema Vora: Welcome all
and thank you

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.140
for joining today's session
on product page optimization.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:12.512
My name is Seema and I'm on
the App Store Monetization team

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.615
based out of Cupertino.

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:15.782
Cailin Arena: And I'm Cailin

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:18.886
on the App Store
Operations team.

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:21.889
Seema: Today, I'll begin the
session with a brief overview

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:26.226
of the product page optimization
feature on the App Store.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.828
Then Cailin
will walk you through

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.097
how to set up a product page
optimization test

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:32.399
in App Store Connect.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.002
After which,
I'll share testing strategies

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.771
to help you make the most
of this feature.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.874
With that, let's get started.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:45.412
What exactly is product page
optimization on the App Store?

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.782
Product page optimization
is a new feature

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:52.152
that gives you the ability
to optimize your on-store assets

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.055
across the App Store,
giving you a new way

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.926
to improve your App Store
conversion funnel.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:04.331
Each week, over 600 million
visitors come to the App Store.

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:07.167
Take a moment to let
that number sink in.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.639
You have a tremendous
opportunity to showcase your app

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:17.878
or game to many of them
and drive downloads.

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.147
We designed the product page
optimization feature

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:24.985
to help you maximize
this opportunity.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.488
People visiting the App Store
browse the Apps tab

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:32.059
Games tab, and Today tab;

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:35.095
search for specific apps
on the Search tab;

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.764
or come in through external
referral links,

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.234
such as social media posts
or paid advertising.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.772
Now with product page
optimization,

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:49.710
you can test different versions
of your product page assets

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.079
to learn which ones
are most effective

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.682
at getting App Store visitors
to download or redownload

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.451
your app or game.

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:03.523
In summary, here's an overview
of the feature.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.325
You can test your app icon,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.695
different screenshots
and app preview videos.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.130
You can choose
the percent of traffic

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.468
that will see the treatments
for up to three treatments.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.636
You can also select
specific localizations

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.406
in which to run your test.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.742
You'll be able to submit
your product page test assets

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:24.878
for review, independent
from the app binary,

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.381
except for app icons,
which must be included

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.117
in the binary
of the version being tested.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.521
To help illustrate
these important aspects

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.224
of this feature,
I'll use an example app,

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:39.059
Mountain Climber.

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:43.764
Here you see Mountain Climber's
original product page.

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.899
With the product page
optimization tool,

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.934
the elements that
can be tested are:

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.737
the app icon,
as you see here,

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:53.507
app preview videos

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.342
and screenshots.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:59.112
Any other elements on the page
will appear as they are

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.848
on both the original
and treatment pages

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.785
and are not part of the test.

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:07.521
If you have a banner
on the top of your page,

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:10.857
or you have in-app events
featured on your page,

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.592
they will appear
on both the original

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:16.463
and the treatment pages.

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:18.665
Your product page optimization
treatments

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:22.135
appear across the App Store
to people on iOS 15

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:25.705
and iPadOS 15 and later.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.208
To ensure people have
a consistent experience

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.944
across the App Store,
your icon treatments --

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.013
meaning icons
that you're testing --

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:35.982
will appear when people browse
the App Store,

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:39.719
like you see here on the left
on the Today tab.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.723
Your icon treatment
will also appear in Search,

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.793
and of course,
on your product page.

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.562
Now, if you're testing
screenshots

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.263
or app preview videos,

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:53.834
those treatments
will appear in Search

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.570
and on your product page.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.638
People will continue to see
the same treatment

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:02.175
across the App Store throughout
the duration of your test.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:07.814
Now, in line with
that consistent experience,

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:11.084
if you're running a test
with an alternate app icon

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.420
and someone downloads
your app or your game

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.223
from this treatment,

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:18.692
The app icon
used in that treatment

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:22.095
will appear
on their device.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.030
As with any
optimization feature,

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.899
you need analytics
to help you understand

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:29.169
which treatment
performs the best.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.371
We've expanded App Analytics

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.875
to have a new product page
optimization dashboard

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.543
that'll provide you
with the data

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:41.548
to help you identify which
treatment performs the best.

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:42.782
As part of this feature,

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.085
we've developed
a unique methodology

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:47.554
that enables you to continuously
monitor your test

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:50.557
while it's running,
meaning you can identify

00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:52.926
exactly when it's time
to make a decision

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:56.863
and stop the test at any time.

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.266
The user interface
includes indicators

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:03.436
to help guide your analysis
as your test progresses.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:06.473
These indicators tell you when
a treatment is likely performing

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:10.010
better or worse
than your original product page,

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.745
or whether more data is needed

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:14.548
before you should
make a decision.

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:16.716
We'll cover more detail
on App Analytics

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.785
later in the presentation.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.657
So how does this product
page optimization feature

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.893
benefit you as a developer?

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:30.297
As a start, we've streamlined
the submission process

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:33.500
with a new submission flow
specifically designed

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.969
for this feature,
which allows you

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.806
to submit your product page
test assets for review,

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:43.910
independent of the app binary
in App Store Connect,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.214
except for app icons,
which must be included

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:51.551
in the binary of the version
being tested.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.486
The product page
optimization tool

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.922
makes applying the
better-performing creative

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.491
as easy as possible,

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.794
so you can apply
better-performing screenshots

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:05.131
or app preview videos
within App Store Connect.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:09.836
You can access updated tools in
App Analytics to monitor metrics

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:13.506
like unique impressions,
conversion rate,

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.609
and performance results
of the test

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:19.813
to help you make
data-driven decisions.

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:24.284
As you can see, this feature
benefits you as a developer

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.286
and gives you
the unique opportunity

00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:30.724
to test within the App Store's
native environment.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.493
We've created
a robust set of tools

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:37.330
to help you set up product page
optimization testing.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.499
Now I'll hand it over
to Cailin who'll show you

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:43.470
how to implement this feature
in App Store Connect.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.638
Cailin: Thanks Seema.

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:47.340
Before we begin
the test setup walkthrough,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.442
make sure that your app
is ready for sale,

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.711
and that you have
the account holder, admin,

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:54.080
marketing,
or app manager role.

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:57.817
Start by clicking on
Product Page Optimization

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:03.523
on the left navigation,
under the Features subsection.

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:08.962
Then click Create Test
to begin setting up your test.

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:11.965
Here, you'll start by entering
in some basic information,

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:13.633
starting with reference name,

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:16.636
which is how you'll identify
this test going forward.

00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:19.472
In this example,

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:23.343
we'll give it the name
"Preview Video A/B Test."

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:26.880
Next, you'll choose
the number of treatments.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.915
You can have
up to three treatments.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:32.686
For this example,
we'll go with one.

00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:36.256
For Traffic Proportion,
this is the percentage of users

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:38.591
that will be randomly shown
a test treatment

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.461
instead of your default
product page.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.264
For example, if a test
has three treatments

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:47.267
and you choose
a 30 percent traffic proportion,

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:49.135
each treatment will be shown
to 10 percent

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.805
of the total traffic.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.674
In this example,
since we chose one treatment,

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:58.278
we can pick anything
from one to 50 percent.

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:00.947
We'll choose 50 percent
to allow the test to generate

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:05.151
significant results
in the shortest time possible.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.953
For localizations,

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:09.022
you have the option
to run this test

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:12.392
on only a subset
of your app's localizations.

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:14.828
We'll keep all localizations
selected by default,

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.796
to allow for the maximum
number of users

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:19.966
to participate in the test.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:22.802
From here, you can
optionally get an estimate

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:25.171
of how long this test will take
by expanding

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:31.344
the Estimate Your Test Duration
section.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.512
The estimate is based

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.548
on your app's product page
performance over the last week

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:38.651
and a target threshold
of 90 percent confidence.

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.720
You just need to select
an improvement value

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.955
to get the estimate.

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:47.160
For example,
if we choose five percent,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.529
this will calculate the number
of impressions needed

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.399
and an estimated duration
to get those impressions,

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:56.269
based on the last week's
performance.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:01.207
In this case, it would take
about 174,404 impressions --

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.343
or about two weeks' time --
to conclude

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:05.378
that the treatment results
in 5 percent improvement

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:09.983
over the original product page,
with 90 percent confidence.

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:14.254
After reviewing this,
click on the Create Test button.

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:17.190
Now, you'll be able to set up
your treatments.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.959
By default, the treatment
will be titled "Treatment A,"

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:22.962
but you can edit that name
to anything you like.

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:25.265
The treatment will start off
as an exact copy

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.633
of the original page --

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:29.502
same icon, screenshots,
and preview videos;

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.471
although in this case,
our Mountain Climber app

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.707
currently does not have
an app preview.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:37.444
So we could add an app preview
to Treatment A

00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:41.247
for each applicable device size,
and then click Start Test.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.053
Then click Add for Review.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.057
Here, you'll see a submission
confirmation screen,

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:53.893
showing the app version
that will be used for review,

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.196
and the items
that will be reviewed.

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:58.631
You could choose to add
other items to this submission,

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:00.033
but for this example,

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:04.304
we'll click to submit
just this test.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:08.274
And with that, your test will be
submitted to App Review.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:11.211
All metadata being used
in a test must be accepted

00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:13.379
by App Review before use.

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.883
If you try to start a test
before the metadata is accepted,

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:19.352
the test won't start
and the metadata will be added

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:22.689
to a submission for you
to send for review.

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:25.859
If you already have a submission
for that platform in review,

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:28.328
you'll need to wait until
the first submission is complete

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:32.365
before you can send
the next test for review.

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:34.567
Going back to
product page optimization,

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:38.438
you'd see your test
with the status "In Review."

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.840
Once App Review does approve
the new assets,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.676
the status will automatically
update to "Running,"

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:46.880
and show how long
the test has been running for.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.649
At this point, you could click
View Analytics

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:53.253
to jump over to App Analytics.

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:56.689
Here, you can see
how the test is going.

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:59.125
You'll see the conversion rate
for the original page

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.461
and the treatment page
at the top,

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:06.499
and a conversion rate
trend chart below.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.768
Once the test has reached
enough impressions

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:12.105
to reach 90 percent confidence,
the dashboard will indicate

00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:14.774
how each treatment
is performing.

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:17.243
In this example, enough data
has been collected

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.579
to suggest that Treatment A
is performing better,

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:20.980
with a 1.9 improvement

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.051
over the original page's
conversion rate.

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.287
At this point, you may want
to apply Treatment A

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:29.522
to your original product page.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.257
To do this,
you'd go back to the test

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:34.427
by clicking View in My Apps
in the bottom left.

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.364
Here, you can click on

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.900
Apply Treatment
to Original Product Page

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.337
to add the app preview video.

00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:45.905
You can choose
whether to apply the treatment

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.941
to the version
live on the App Store,

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.176
or another version
in Prepare for Submission,

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:51.578
if you have one.

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:55.448
Then click Apply Treatment.

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:58.217
As a result, the app preview
we had in treatment

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:01.054
is now live in the App Store
with version 3.1,

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:05.825
and it's also been applied
to version 3.2 here.

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:08.995
Now, if you wanted to run
a test on the app icon,

00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:10.763
you'd need to create
a test on that app

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:13.533
that includes multiple icons
in its binary.

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:16.235
If your app has multiple icons
included in the binary,

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:21.941
your treatment setup page
will include an App Icon tab.

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:26.813
And then click Change
to select a different icon.

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:29.349
All app icons included
in the app binary

00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:32.051
for the version of your app
currently on the App Store

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.087
will display in the dropdown.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:37.790
To include them, you must be
using Xcode 13 or later,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.893
which includes the latest SDK
that supports alternate icons

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:43.596
in asset catalogues.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.165
From here,
you could click Start Test

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:47.734
and you'd be able
to start the test

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:49.168
without going through
App Review,

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:51.104
because the icon
has already been reviewed

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.772
when it was included
in the binary

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.875
for the currently live version.

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.244
When it's time to promote
a treatment with an app icon

00:12:58.244 --> 00:12:59.445
to your product page,

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:03.750
you'll need to create and submit
a new app version.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.185
Finally,
the App Store Connect API

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.820
will be valuable
if you want to integrate

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.090
product page optimization
with your own systems.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.825
The API will allow you
to automate

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.494
the creation
and management of tests

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:17.797
outside the App Store Connect
website.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.198
I'll now hand it over to Seema

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:20.900
to share how you can
pull all this together

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.171
with product page
testing strategies.

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.140
Seema: Thank you, Cailin.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.641
As Cailin mentioned,

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.044
I would like to go over
testing strategies.

00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:33.713
Basically, what you should be
thinking about as you plan

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:37.717
your product page optimization
testing and experimentation.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:41.821
As with any
marketing initiative,

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:45.758
we'll start with looking
at the top of the funnel.

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:48.995
Here you see the traffic mix
for the App Store Funnel.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.397
Important to keep
this traffic mix in mind

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:55.668
as you think through
your testing strategies.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.805
As you create your testing plan,
it's important to note

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:02.875
that your optimization efforts
are not a one-and-done.

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:07.580
It is an iterative,
ongoing process.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.082
As you create your test,

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:13.286
start with thinking
of which asset matters the most.

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:17.090
For some, it might be figuring
out the best possible icon;

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.158
for others,
it might be the addition

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:22.161
of an app preview video.

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:23.730
As you configure your test,

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.365
ensure that the testing
variations are notable

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:29.702
and they're significant enough
to make a difference.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:34.373
Minor tweaks tend not
to yield conclusive results.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:39.312
Also, not all experiments
will produce positive results.

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:44.016
If so, reevaluate
the testing plan and test again.

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.452
Be sure to analyze
your test's performance

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:51.591
until you've identified the
treatment that performs best.

00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:53.793
Once conclusive,
use the results

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:56.996
to inform next steps
and update your product page

00:14:56.996 --> 00:15:00.199
with the better-performing
creative.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.769
The product page optimization
tool makes this easy

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:04.971
by letting you update
the screenshots

00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:08.341
and app preview videos
after the completion of a test

00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:12.011
right there
within App Store Connect.

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:15.181
Now, I'd like to share
some ideas to help jumpstart

00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:17.984
your product page optimization
test planning,

00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:19.852
starting with examples
to help you

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:22.822
think through
testing asset testing.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:25.858
First off, we'll go over
testing by feature.

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:28.394
For example,
does testing a screenshot

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:31.464
of an existing feature
drive better conversion

00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:35.034
than a screenshot
showcasing a new feature?

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:36.803
Or say you are a fitness app.

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:39.105
Does highlighting
your primary value proposition

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:42.809
help increase
your conversion rate?

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:44.644
You might test by theme.

00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:45.878
We've heard
that many of you

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.947
want to test seasonal content.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:52.318
Now, you can test to see
if updating your icon or assets

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.920
to reflect seasonality

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.956
improves your download
conversion rate or not.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.959
You could also test by character
or new content.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.261
For example,
an entertainment app

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:05.731
could test to see if showcasing
new content performs better

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:08.267
than classic content.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:11.504
And lastly, you might test
different creatives.

00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:15.208
This one's a bit nuanced
but can be very effective.

00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:18.211
For example, does adding
an app preview video

00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:21.080
help improve
your download conversion rate?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.783
Or testing color variations

00:16:23.783 --> 00:16:26.285
like varying the background
color of a screenshot

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:29.455
to see which background
color performs best.

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:31.157
Keep these examples in mind

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:34.627
as you plan
your product page treatments.

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:36.996
Now that we've discussed
some asset testing ideas,

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.065
here are a few
important considerations

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:41.734
to help you create a test plan

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:44.937
starting with
traffic proportion,

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.874
which is the percentage of
people who will randomly see

00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:50.776
a treatment version
of your product page assets.

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.812
Think about how you want
to distribute this percentage

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:56.315
between your original
product page and treatments.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.351
When allocating
traffic to treatments,

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.153
keep in mind
your conversion rate.

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:03.122
You can choose
to allocate more traffic

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:07.360
to your original product page,
which is your control,

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.295
in case you're concerned about

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:12.798
how a new treatment
might perform.

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:16.502
Do note that no single treatment
can receive more traffic

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:19.238
than your original product page.

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:20.907
Another aspect to consider

00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:24.343
is planning your assets
and treatments.

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.912
Think through
the product page asset

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:27.613
you will include in your test

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:31.017
and number of treatments
you'll create.

00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:33.920
We do recommend testing
one asset at a time

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.822
to ensure that the results
are not cluttered.

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:42.328
As a reminder, you can create up
to three treatments per test.

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:43.629
Localizations.

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.698
The product page
optimization feature

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:49.936
includes testing
for specific localizations.

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:51.370
Think through what localizations

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.106
might be worth
including in your test...

00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:58.210
such as those locales
you're interested

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.248
in expanding your app
or your game's market reach.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.883
Although important
to keep in mind

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:06.419
the traffic volume
from those locales,

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.121
as that could result
in your test taking a bit longer

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:12.425
to get meaningful results.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:16.929
Finally, think through
the duration of a test.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:19.365
When setting up your test
in App Store Connect,

00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:21.200
the tool will give you
an estimate

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.171
based on your app's product page
performance over the last week

00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:30.076
and a target threshold
of 90 percent confidence.

00:18:30.076 --> 00:18:32.211
You just need to select
an improvement value

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:35.214
to get the estimate.

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:37.149
So keep these
considerations in mind

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:40.553
as you plan your testing
to ensure maximum efficacy

00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:43.055
of your product page
optimization efforts.

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:47.994
Let's take a look
at a few sample tests.

00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:52.064
As a developer,
here is my sample test plan.

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:56.002
This sample test plan
includes the title of the test,

00:18:56.002 --> 00:19:02.341
test description, hypothesis,
number of treatments,

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:05.344
expected traffic distribution,

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:09.749
and what localizations
the test should be applied to.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:13.719
The first sample test is an icon
color test where we want to test

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:18.791
three color variations for
the app icon versus the control.

00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:20.493
As icons are universal,

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:24.196
we plan to test this
across all locales.

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:26.866
Our hypothesis here
is that the brighter icon

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:29.869
will perform better.

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:31.804
The second sample test
is testing

00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:33.806
localized
app preview videos

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:37.510
for the Japanese market,
and our hypothesis here

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:42.915
is that locally relevant assets
will drive higher conversion.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:45.418
Since this is
a market-specific test,

00:19:45.418 --> 00:19:51.624
the only localization
we'll select here is Japanese.

00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:55.327
The third sample test is testing
out different screenshots

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:59.131
to see if character-focused
visuals perform better.

00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:01.734
And in this case,
we'll allocate 40 percent

00:20:01.734 --> 00:20:04.770
of our product page traffic
to our treatments,

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.306
leaving 60 percent
to see our control,

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:11.177
which is our original
product page.

00:20:11.177 --> 00:20:13.879
Let's take a closer look
at that first test,

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.916
which is an icon color test
where we will test

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:21.053
icon color variations
across three treatments,

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.089
with a traffic distribution
of 30 percent

00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:27.526
to the treatments
across all localizations.

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:30.596
Let's say we're a game developer
and we want to test out

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:34.400
different icons for our game
The Coast.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.137
Here's what our original
product page looks like.

00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:41.474
On the left, you see
our original treatment --

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:44.176
the one we just looked at --
and on the right,

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:47.246
you see the three treatments
we've created for our test,

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.915
each with a different
color icon.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:53.519
As you saw in the test plan,
we chose to show our treatments

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:56.088
to 30 percent
of App Store traffic,

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.524
which means that each
of our three treatments

00:20:58.524 --> 00:21:02.661
would receive 10 percent
of the total traffic;

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:07.766
and the original will receive
70 percent of the total traffic.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:11.003
Once our test metadata
is approved by App Review,

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:13.272
the test will start.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.875
Let's take a look at what
this looks like in App Analytics

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:17.743
as our test is running,

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:21.747
starting with
the results dashboard.

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:24.750
At the top,
you will see your test name,

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.854
the date your test began, and
the current status of your test.

00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:30.723
Below that,
you'll see an overview

00:21:30.723 --> 00:21:32.391
of your test performance,

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.994
with the conversion rate
for your original product page

00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:39.532
as well as for each treatment
included in your test.

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:41.133
The Conversion Rate Trend chart

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:44.436
visualizes how your test
is progressing over time.

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:46.305
You can see the natural
ebbs and flows

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.275
as your test accumulates data
and begins to determine

00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:52.945
which treatment performs best.

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:54.280
And at the bottom,

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.916
you'll get even more details
about your test,

00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:59.385
including the number
of unique impressions

00:21:59.385 --> 00:22:01.987
each treatment has received,

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:05.191
the conversion rate
for each treatment,

00:22:05.191 --> 00:22:07.326
the improvement
each treatment has achieved

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:09.395
compared to the original
product page --

00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:11.664
also known as the baseline --

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:14.667
and the confidence level
that we have in the results.

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:18.070
During the first seven days, we
will not show a confidence level

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.773
in order to account
for any daily fluctuations

00:22:20.773 --> 00:22:22.908
before providing a result.

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:25.778
After your test has been running
for at least seven days,

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:28.681
you'll see
confidence indicators appear.

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:31.784
Now in this test,
we have 72 percent confidence

00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:34.787
that Treatment A is
outperforming the baseline,

00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:37.590
58 percent confidence
that Treatment B

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.860
is outperforming the baseline,
and very low confidence

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.931
that Treatment C
is outperforming the baseline.

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:48.434
Until a treatment reaches
90 percent confidence

00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:49.802
in the result,

00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:53.606
you'll see "Collecting Data"
for these treatments.

00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:56.542
Now, if a treatment reaches
90 percent confidence,

00:22:56.542 --> 00:23:00.145
relevant indicators will appear
under each treatment.

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:03.616
For example,
at this point in the test,

00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:06.418
Treatment B is performing
worse than the baseline

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:09.388
with at least
90 percent confidence,

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.924
while Treatment A
is performing better.

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:14.994
And Treatment C is performing
so similar to the baseline,

00:23:14.994 --> 00:23:17.329
that it's unlikely
we'll be able to detect

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:21.166
a significant difference
within the 90-day test duration

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:25.938
if the results continue
to accumulate at the same pace.

00:23:25.938 --> 00:23:28.307
If you see this status
for all your treatments,

00:23:28.307 --> 00:23:33.445
we recommend you end
the test and try again.

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:35.381
Now since
the test status indicators

00:23:35.381 --> 00:23:37.816
are a new addition
to App Analytics,

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:42.621
let's go over each one
to understand what they mean.

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:46.225
The original product page
is the baseline by default,

00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:51.130
which is the treatment that
all others are compared against,

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.800
Collecting data means that
we're not yet able to determine

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.202
whether the treatment
is performing better or worse

00:23:57.202 --> 00:24:01.440
than the baseline with
90 percent confidence or more.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.375
"Performing Better" means
that the treatment

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:05.311
is performing better
than the baseline

00:24:05.311 --> 00:24:09.248
with at least
90 percent confidence.

00:24:09.248 --> 00:24:11.850
"Performing Worse" means
the treatment is performing

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:16.655
worse than the baseline with
at least 90 percent confidence.

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:18.891
And "Likely to Be Inconclusive"

00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:21.393
means that the test
isn't getting enough data

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:24.897
to make a determination
within the 90-day limit.

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:29.702
If you want to compare
treatments to one another,

00:24:29.702 --> 00:24:32.037
you can change the baseline.

00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:35.441
For example, here we can compare
each of our variants

00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:39.011
against Treatment A.

00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:41.547
In this case, each variant
is performing worse

00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:45.284
than Treatment A with at least
90 percent confidence.

00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:48.354
This means that you can
be confident that Treatment A

00:24:48.354 --> 00:24:53.926
is indeed the best-performing
treatment out of them all.

00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:55.861
Now going back to our icon test

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:59.798
with the original product page
as the baseline.

00:24:59.798 --> 00:25:01.533
By clicking on the test name,

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:04.336
you can easily swap
between your current test

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.438
and past tests.

00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:10.843
You can also export the data in
the chart or the table as a CSV

00:25:10.843 --> 00:25:13.545
so you can analyze the data
on your own.

00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:15.748
If you want even more details
about your results,

00:25:15.748 --> 00:25:17.649
you can hover over
the conversion rate

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:19.852
to view the credible interval,

00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:21.687
which shows the range
of possible values

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:24.456
that we estimate
for each treatment.

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:26.959
This information helps you
get a deeper understanding

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:28.660
of the results.

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:33.065
Lastly, once you're ready
to promote

00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:37.236
the better-performing treatment
to your default product page,

00:25:37.236 --> 00:25:38.971
you can click on the link
at the bottom

00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:42.608
to navigate back to My Apps.

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:45.244
This wraps up
our sample icon test,

00:25:45.244 --> 00:25:48.213
including interpreting
and evaluating the results

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:50.649
in App Analytics.

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:53.051
I hope that you now have
a comprehensive understanding

00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:55.320
of the product page
optimization feature,

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.425
enough so you can start planning
your own testing.

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:01.827
Before I conclude, I'd like
to go over a few things

00:26:01.827 --> 00:26:05.931
to look out for as you implement
your testing plans.

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:09.601
Not reaching
statistical significance.

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:12.671
It is important to remember
not to apply results

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:17.142
based on early testing
or those with minor uplifts.

00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:19.878
As a reminder, App Store Connect
will let you know how long

00:26:19.878 --> 00:26:22.614
the test will take based on
your traffic distribution

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:25.284
and your current
conversion rate.

00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:28.854
It can be tempting
to act on early results.

00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:32.024
It's important
to not make any conclusions

00:26:32.024 --> 00:26:37.830
until your test has reached
statistical significance.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.098
This ensures that
you can confidently claim

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:42.634
that the winning result
will make a notable

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:46.338
and positive difference
to your conversion rate.

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:47.906
Make sure the testing treatment

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:51.009
has significant enough
variations from the control,

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:55.614
if not, the test could result
in being inconclusive.

00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:58.417
And ensure that the test
is set up to succeed.

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:00.786
Cross-check
that culturally relevant

00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:04.623
or regional assets are applied
to the right localizations,

00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:07.025
and review the estimated
duration of the test

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:09.461
to ensure that the traffic
from these localizations

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:11.697
are sufficient enough
to drive results

00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:14.700
within the 90-day
testing timeframe.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.602
As you execute
your testing plan,

00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:20.472
keep these in mind to help
avoid any delays or any issues

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:23.375
with your product page
optimization testing.

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:26.712
If you're looking
for more information

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:29.014
or would like to reference
what we discussed today,

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:32.551
do visit our Developer website,
which is an excellent resource

00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:35.087
that you can reference
at any time.

00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:37.256
The Developer website
has helpful information

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:39.024
about the feature
and considerations

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:41.426
for when setting up your tests.

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:42.995
Once you start testing,

00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:46.465
we recommend you continue
to identify new conversion goals

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:50.102
and areas where your conversion
rate can be improved.

00:27:50.102 --> 00:27:52.638
With that, I'd like to conclude

00:27:52.638 --> 00:27:56.174
our product page optimization
session today.

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:59.344
We are excited to see how
you all will use this feature

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:03.148
to improve your App Store
conversion rate over time.

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:05.350
Thank you.
