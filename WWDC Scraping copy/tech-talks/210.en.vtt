Jacob Klapper: Hi! Welcome to
What's New in Sharing.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.505
My name is Jacob Klapper,

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.074
and I'm an engineer
on the Share Sheet team.

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.509
Let's dive right in
and take a look

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.746
at the new Share Sheet
in iOS 13.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.182
The Share Sheet features a new
preview header at the top.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.384
This makes it clear
what the user is sharing

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.753
and allows them to customize it.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.555
The new Share Sheet
also makes it easier

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.190
to share quickly
and effortlessly

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.092
with the conversation
suggestions row

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:28.061
that predicts who users
will want to share to.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.496
Finally, the new actions list

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.266
offers a clear delineation
between apps and actions

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:36.203
and puts users' favorite actions
at the top for easy access.

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.971
Now let's talk about
how you can take advantage

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:42.542
of this new design to enhance
your users' sharing experience.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.811
First we'll talk about
customizing the preview header

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.946
in the Share Sheet.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:48.749
Then we'll go over opting in
to conversation suggestions

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.150
for your messaging app.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.186
And finally, we'll review
some best practices.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.822
So, let's talk about how
to configure a preview header

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.224
in your Share Sheet.

00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:00.494
iOS 13 introduces
the LinkPresentation API

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:03.664
that allows you to present
rich links in your app.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.300
UIActivityViewController takes
advantage of this framework

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.902
to display the preview header
in the Share Sheet.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.037
This makes it clear to the user

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:12.239
what they're sharing
from your app.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.808
As an added benefit,
when users share via Messages,

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.376
the link preview
in the transcript

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.378
will match the one
from the Share Sheet.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:22.482
This adds continuity to
the users' sharing experience.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.085
Let's take a look
at the preview header in Safari.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.622
It looks pretty good right now,

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.657
but the Share Sheet had
to fetch the website information

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.726
to be displayed in the header.

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:33.760
Let's watch again.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.397
It's not right
for the Share Sheet

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.066
to have to fetch
this information,

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.301
because Safari
likely has it already.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.636
To accelerate the preview,

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:45.138
Safari can use
UIActivityItemSource

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.541
to give the Share Sheet
LinkPresentation metadata

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.110
to be displayed in the header.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.646
This is an example of the
new ActivityViewContoller

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:56.683
link metadata method
on UIActivityItemSource.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:00.487
First, create
an LPLinkMetadata object.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:04.825
Then set the originalURL
and URL properties.

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.961
Set a title and iconProvider.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.164
And finally,
return the metadata.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:14.134
Let's see what the preview
header looks like now.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:14.901
As you can see,

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.137
all the information
was available immediately,

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.772
and the Share Sheet
didn't have to do

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:22.509
any additional
metadata fetching.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.112
Now let's talk about
the new conversation suggestions

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:26.413
in the Share Sheet.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.884
Conversation suggestions
allow users

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.820
to effortlessly send content
to specific recipients

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.023
without having to type
their names.

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:39.059
While conversation suggestions
utilize SiriKit Intents,

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.595
you do not need to add
a SiriKit UI Extension

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:45.265
or provide Siri support
for suggestions to work.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.101
The conversation suggestions
row is conveniently placed

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.603
at the top of the Share Sheet

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.738
so users will be able to launch
your share extension

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.673
with a simple tap.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.108
Let's talk about how to opt in

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:59.780
your messaging app's
share extension to suggestions.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.350
Donate INSendMessageIntents
on message sends from app

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.452
and share extension.

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:07.954
In order to provide users
with a richer experience,

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.757
make sure to populate
as many fields as possible,

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:14.661
including, but not limited to:
recipients, speakableGroupName,

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.397
and conversationIdentifier.

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:18.932
When your share extension
is launched,

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.401
the intent property
on NSExtensionContext

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.737
will provide information
about the conversation

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:26.173
to populate your UI with.

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:28.909
The final step is to add
INSendMessageIntent

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.310
to the IntentsSupported array

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.647
in your share extension's
Info.plist

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:37.584
Let's take a look at an example
INSendMessageIntent donation.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.752
This function should be called

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:40.587
every time a user
sends a message

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.323
in your app or share extension.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.392
A conversation identifier
helps the Share Sheet

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.461
identify the recipients
or groups

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:49.696
that will be receiving
the message.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.231
The group name
will be used to display

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.567
the conversation
in the Share Sheet.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.368
In this case,
the participants array

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.971
is an array of INPerson objects.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.007
Each INPerson should have
a display name and an image

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.111
so users can easily spot them
in the Share Sheet.

00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:08.115
Finally, create an INInteraction
using the sendMessageIntent.

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:09.449
Set the direction as outgoing,

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.686
because the user is sending
the message in this case.

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:15.555
Finally, donate the interaction.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.624
The IntentsSupported array
should be inserted

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.959
in the NSExtensionAttributes
dictionary

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.562
in your Share Extension's
Info.plist.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.431
Make sure INSendMessageIntent

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.333
is listed as one
of the supported intents,

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.969
or conversation suggestions
will not be enabled

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.271
for your extension.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.939
Once you have completed
all of the steps

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.474
to opt in your share extension

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.143
you will begin to see
suggestions

00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:40.981
for recipients linked
with your share extension.

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:43.216
The suggestion features
a contact or group image

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.819
and display name,
along with your app's icon,

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.523
so your users can easily
identify it.

00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:52.459
Now let's finish up by going
over some best practices

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.627
for the Share Sheet.

00:04:57.197 --> 00:04:59.065
First, let's talk about
how to optimize

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:03.937
your action extension icons
for the new actions list.

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:07.607
First, icons should be
40 by 40 template images.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:09.809
They should be outlined glyphs
without fill

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.312
to match the system icons.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.582
When possible,
use SF Symbols or symbol images.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:18.752
To do this,
add the CFBundleSymbolName key

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:22.822
to your action extension's
Info.plist.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.193
Next, let's talk about card UI.

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.494
New in iOS 13,

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:31.264
share extensions will be
presented as form sheets.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:34.134
If your share extension requires
full-screen presentation,

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:35.335
you can opt in using

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:39.039
the NSExtensionShareWants
FullScreenPresentation key

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.907
in your extension's Info.plist.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.709
Most extensions
shouldn't need this,

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:44.110
but a good example
of one that would

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.613
is an extension
that needs to use the camera.

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:50.784
Finally, I want to go over
some new behavior

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:54.554
for share extensions in iOS 13.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.189
Share Extensions
are now displayed

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.491
using their containing app's
display name,

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.760
not the extension's
display name.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.662
If your app has multiple
share extensions,

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:05.732
it will be difficult for users
to differentiate them.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.601
Because of this,
your app should limit itself

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:10.170
to a single share extension.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.939
If your app had multiple
share extensions previously,

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:16.243
you can consolidate them
into one by adding an options UI

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:19.346
to allow your user to select
which functionality they want

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:22.916
when they launch
your share extension.

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:25.285
Thank you for joining me
for What's New in Sharing.
