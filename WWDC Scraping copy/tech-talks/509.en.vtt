George Karas: Hello,
my name is George Karas,

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:05.471
and I am part of Apple's
Video Partner Operations team.

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:07.040
Welcome to this video
to understand

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.743
the video integration
with the Apple TV app.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.011
For TV providers
that are integrating

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.247
their own video application
with the Apple TV app,

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.349
this video will detail
the client requirements

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.752
and onboarding process
that are necessary to adhere to.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.853
Let's start with understanding

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.289
how your video apps
will integrate.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.492
There are three basic things
that will need to be achieved.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.028
First, your iOS
and tvOS applications

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:28.862
will need to include

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.931
the universal search
extended entitlement

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.100
in your provisioning profile,
so that they can share

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.403
the authentication status
of the customer to the device.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.538
While customers watch content
in your application,

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.174
playback data is reported
to the device as well,

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.377
so that it can be tracked
in the Up Next section

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.479
of the Apple TV app.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.581
And your application
has to support deep-linking

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.516
to properly open content
for browsing,

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.218
play content automatically,

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.855
and resume VOD content
correctly.

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:57.391
Registering subscriptions
correctly is critical to ensure

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.693
your applications work correctly
with the data you are providing

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:02.262
in your catalog
and availability feeds,

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.063
which is controlling
the presentation of your content

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.967
in the Apple TV app
for our customers.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.269
As customers are authenticated
to your application,

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.971
this status is shared
with the device

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:12.172
so that the Apple TV app

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.308
can properly understand
your entitlement data

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:15.909
and show content as playable

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.845
or available as part of
a subscription package.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:21.248
As customers change
their subscription status,

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:22.749
the registration
with the Apple TV app

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.484
must also be udpated.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.087
And the customer's subscription
status and expiration date

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.491
should also be properly adjusted
as your application is launched.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.759
If you are using
restriction tiers

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.262
in your availability feeds
for the Apple TV app,

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.331
then tiered entitlements
must also be presented

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:39.900
in the subscription
registration.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.803
These tier names must match
your availability feeds,

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:44.171
and it's important
that they represent

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.106
consumer-facing
packages of content

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.542
to ensure your applications
perform with a minimum payload

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.978
against the Apple TV app.

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:53.780
To support tracking content
in Up Next of the Apple TV app,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.250
your applications must report
video playback information.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.252
This is done through
the Now Playing API,

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.121
which includes
the contentId value

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.857
used in the catalog feed
for VOD movies and TV shows,

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.626
or the serviceId value used
in the linear availability feed

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.862
for the channel
that is being played.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.197
Video on demand content

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:12.165
also requires
the duration of the video asset

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.434
and the elapsed time
of the customer to be shared

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.870
to understand if a customer has
completed watching a video asset

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.071
or if it has time remaining

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.540
and can be resumed later
from Up Next.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.509
This data is updated
on activity events

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.711
as customers interact
with your video player

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:28.281
such as play, pause,
seek ahead or behind,

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:31.351
and upon any exit
of the video player.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.220
The Apple TV app
also needs to understand

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.821
the content a customer
is browsing

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.491
for it to enable
a nice Siri feature.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.360
This is done through
the NSUserActivity API,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.129
which is present
while a customer is viewing

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.364
a content details page
for a movie or TV show

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.266
in your application.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.702
Again, the contentId values
for your content from the feeds

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:51.071
are used here,
so that a customer can say,

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.840
"Hey Siri,
add this to my Up Next."

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.476
Great for those
save-for-later moments.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.079
And finally,
proper deep-linking is critical

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.014
to ensure your customers
have a pleasant experience

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.350
from the Apple TV app
to your own app.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.619
Your applications
must accept open links

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.521
for all of the content types
you are providing

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.689
in your metadata feeds.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.291
Accepting play links properly
is a requirement

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.161
for movie, TV episode,
and sporting event items,

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.630
and are presented
and used by the Apple TV app

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.732
when the customer
is recognized as entitled

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:20.333
via the subscription
registration

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.402
mentioned previously.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:25.205
Lastly, for your VOD movies
and TV shows,

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.174
Apple will add
a resumeTime parameter

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:29.810
to your play deep-links
with the time value in seconds

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.512
if the Apple TV app recognizes
the customer has time remaining

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.247
to finish watching.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.083
The expectation is then
that your video player

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:39.086
will resume
at the appropriate time.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:40.320
Deep-links from the Apple TV app

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.556
must also meet
the Human Interface Guidelines

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:46.426
to ensure the experience
is elegant for the customer.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.562
Once your applications
include these integrations,

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.797
they're ready for testing
by Apple.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.332
As your development tracks
have begun

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.668
across the metadata feeds
and app integration,

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:57.771
Apple will support you
through the onboarding process.

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:59.873
Part of this is sharing
the necessary data

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:01.374
about your services and brand,

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.910
which is done
through the partner manifest.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.378
This is a collection
of your catalog

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.248
and availability services,
and is shared with Apple

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.784
so that they can
be set up in our systems.

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:13.053
The manifest is a living feed
of your services,

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:15.388
allowing you to manage them
in Apple's systems as well,

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.923
should the feed URLs change,

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:21.128
or you later work with Apple to
graduate to a new spec version.

00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:22.562
Coming onboard
to the Apple TV app

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.831
generally works
in the following fashion.

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.766
When selected to participate
in the program,

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.202
Apple will engage with
your technical development teams

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:30.804
in an official kickoff meeting

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.673
and possibly set up
some workshops to follow later.

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:34.975
Through the partner manifest,

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:37.043
Apple can set up
your video service brand

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:40.147
and register your video
applications in our systems.

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:42.716
This then allows Apple
to begin receiving your feeds

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.985
once that development
and validation exercise

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:47.487
with the Media Feed Validator
has begun.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:50.056
It's often recommended to start
on this work stream first,

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.125
as application testing
requires it,

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.294
and Apple can require
up to a two-week cycle

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.464
to validate and test
an ingestion of your feeds.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.499
App development
can begin in parallel,

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.635
but certain points
of information are required

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.637
on the catalog
and availability feeds

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:05.372
being generated
for full validation

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:07.474
and, of course, testing.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.809
Once the metadata feeds
are fully approved by Apple,

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.511
and applications
with the integrations

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:13.113
described in this video
are included

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.081
and shared with Apple
via TestFlight,

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.450
Apple TV app
test mode can begin.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.752
At this point,
you can simply

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:20.620
install your application
from TestFlight,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.956
and experience it
a part of the Apple TV app

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:25.158
as if it's publicly available.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.426
Apple does the same,

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:29.296
and runs the application through
a formal QA testing process

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:33.033
before the builds are submitted
to the App Store for review.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:35.602
Upon Apple QA approval,
the applications

00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:37.737
can be submitted
to the App Store for review,

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.272
and once live on the App Store,

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.007
Apple can then
enable your video service

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.977
to be a part of
the Apple TV app.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.078
By doing these things,

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.980
your application
and video service will shine,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.049
and customers will
enjoy viewing your content

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:51.051
through the Apple TV app.

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:53.053
Thank you!
