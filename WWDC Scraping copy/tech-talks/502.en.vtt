00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:04.003
With the introduction
of the revolutionary iPhone X

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.139
and Apple TV 4K,

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.642
the video experience
is taken to a whole new level

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.645
with the addition of support
for high dynamic range video.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.850
With HD, you only see
16 million colors.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.320
But with HDR,
you see one billion colors.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.122
HDR allows content creators

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.725
to use a much richer
and vibrant color palette,

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:28.028
which results in unbelievable
and stunning image quality.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.467
To better understand
how HDR works,

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:34.534
let's first take a look

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.304
at the evolution
in color capabilities.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.641
Here is a representation
of the visible color spectrum.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.343
With the introduction
of HD in 1990,

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:46.747
the color space was defined in
ITU Rec 709

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:51.518
and covered about 36 percent
of the visible spectrum.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.588
But, a lot has changed
since 1990,

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:58.292
and since then, the P3
color space was introduced.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:01.395
This color space is widely
supported across our platforms

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:04.298
for all types of app content.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.567
Then in 2012,
Recommendation 2020

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.503
was introduced
to define the color space

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.039
for Ultra High-Definition
television,

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.241
which offers a much wider
color space

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.812
that covers more than 75 percent
of the visible spectrum.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.648
Video content can now be
delivered to supported devices

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.017
in any of these
three color spaces,

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:27.521
enabling far more realistic
and rich color reproduction.

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:32.693
But, the color space itself
isn't the whole story.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.429
The luminance range and settings
of the target display

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.631
is also extremely important

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:41.435
and impacts how a given color
is going to be perceived.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.137
This combination of color space
and luminance range

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.673
is often described
as the color volume,

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:50.377
with the luminance values
on a logarithmic scale.

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.212
With standard
dynamic range content,

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.613
it is assumed that displays

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.183
offer a peak luminance
of 100 nits,

00:01:56.183 --> 00:02:00.921
yielding a relatively modest
color volume.

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:04.291
However, HDR formats
are designed to support displays

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.728
capable of up to 10,000 nits of
peak luminance,

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.529
yielding a much richer
color volume

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.431
for content creators
to work with.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.569
To further understand
the impact of luminance,

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.672
let's take a look
at a 100 percent red square

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:21.274
in the P3 color space.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.745
If the brightness setting of the
display is at about 50 percent,

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:28.115
the red square
might look something like this.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:31.418
However, if the brightness
of the display is turned up,

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.454
the very same RGB value
looks quite different

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.223
and more intense.

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.692
Similarly, if the brightness
is turned down,

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:41.795
it looks much more dull.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.164
As you can see
in this illustration,

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.534
simply utilizing the RGB values
without having control

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:49.936
or context of the luminance
of the display

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:54.007
leads to vastly different
color perception by the viewer.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.876
This also doesn't
take into account

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:59.079
other influencing factors
such as the ambient light level

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.816
or the color temperature
of the ambient light.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:05.585
Another key goal of HDR
is to help improve

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.156
consistency in playback
across different displays.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:12.592
In SDR video, the target display
is assumed to be capable

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:16.263
of up to approximately
100 nits of peak brightness.

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.533
However, the actual capabilities
of modern displays

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.635
far exceeds this value,

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.537
and so each display
then attempts

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.739
to interpolate the appropriate
brightness levels

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.675
to match its own
luminance range.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.610
This leads to
all kinds of variance

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.945
in the appearance
of a given video

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.815
across different displays,
and in many cases,

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:38.452
a very loose interpretation
of the original artistic intent.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.756
Now that you have
a basic understanding

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:45.125
of the key elements
of color and luminance,

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:47.427
and some of the goals of HDR,

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:51.498
let's dig into the types
of HDR video that we support.

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:56.169
We support two HDR standards:
Dolby Vision and HDR10.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.605
These two formats share
some common principles,

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.640
but also differ in many ways.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.478
One of the commonalities
between the formats

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:06.947
is how the luminance values
are encoded.

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.882
Because the human eye
is more sensitive

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.917
in dark ranges
than light ranges,

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.386
the luminance values
are encoded on a curve,

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.255
so that greater detail in darks

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:18.892
can be encoded using
the limited bits available.

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:22.062
In SDR, the gamma curve
was relatively shallow,

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:23.263
but this was sufficient

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:27.434
for the assumed peak target
display luminance of 100 nits.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.936
For HDR, a new
luminance encoding curve

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.204
has been introduced.

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:33.340
Known as
the Perceptual Quantizer,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.042
it can better map these
perceptible luminance changes

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:39.312
across the broader,
10,000 nit range.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:42.949
This curve,
described in SMPTE ST 2084,

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.818
allows for even
smoother gradation

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.620
of dark luminance values,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.256
yielding a far better experience
for the viewer.

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:53.026
This curve is utilized
by both Dolby Vision and HDR10.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.298
In HDR10,
a static set of metadata

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.300
is included in the video stream.

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:04.738
This metadata includes
information about the display

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.907
on which the content
was originally mastered,

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:11.645
such as its effective
color gamut, white point,

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.313
and luminance range.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:18.418
It also includes information
about the content itself,

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:21.588
namely the peak
and average luminance levels.

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:24.658
This metadata can then
be used by the target display

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.394
to tone map the content
to the output capabilities

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:28.662
of the display.

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:33.433
With HDR10,
the metadata is applied

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:36.203
to the entire length
of the program.

00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:38.805
Dolby Vision gives you
even more control,

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:41.341
allowing for metadata to
be conveyed dynamically

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.744
on a scene-by-scene,
or even frame-by-frame basis.

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:48.048
This way, the available
luminance range of the display

00:05:48.048 --> 00:05:50.016
can be optimized
throughout a program

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.853
that might include both very
dark and very bright scenes.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.393
The format also carries
a much broader metadata set,

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.295
further enabling
the target display

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.364
to perform much more detailed
tone mapping

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.199
and detail management.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.606
Finally, Dolby operates
a certification program

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:16.209
to ensure that each Dolby Vision
capable display is consistent,

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.379
so content will always
be displayed as intended.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.919
