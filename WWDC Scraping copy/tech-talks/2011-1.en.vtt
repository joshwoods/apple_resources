Hi, I'm Mark Kawano,
Apple's User Experience Evangelist.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.710
In this video,
I'm going to go through some tips

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.610
to help you with the design and user
experience of your iPhone or iPad app.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.820
The content I've put together comes from
my experience designing apps at Apple,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.240
as well as my experience working
with thousands of developers

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.780
from all over the world.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.420
I will address some of the most
common usability issues in iOS apps,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.280
and will also show many examples of great
user experiences to educate and inspire.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.460
Some of the topics may seem familiar to
those of you who have seen some of my

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.420
previous videos on user interface design.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.280
However,
this is a brand new talk with a lot of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.660
new tips to help any developer create
a more intuitive and engaging app.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.460
So let's get started.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.100
I want to start off by saying
that it would be impossible for me

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.900
to talk about every UI situation
you'll face when designing an app.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.620
And that's not my intention.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.560
Like I said earlier,
the content I've put together

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.180
addresses the most common
usability issues in iOS apps.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.440
To get started,
I want to talk about the importance of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.150
telling a great story with your app.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.890
When designing an app,
you should always be thinking about

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.450
the story you're trying to tell.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.620
Just like the most powerful stories are
able to really captivate an audience,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.160
well, similarly,
great apps are capable of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.770
creating an equally powerful
emotional response for its users.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.960
I know that when I use a great app,
it makes me feel really great,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.600
and as a developer or a designer,
it's inspiring.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.140
So when you design your app,
you should constantly think about

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.950
what it takes to tell a great story.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.870
So to help you tell a great story,
there are a few things to think about.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.080
First, what will your app do?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.490
Think of this as the plot for your story.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.180
It's not enough to just have
an app on the App Store.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.540
It needs to provide value for its users.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.630
Next, who are the users?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.170
When you tell a great story,
it's important to know the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.840
audience you're telling it to.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.630
When you design for a
specific user group,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.940
it will affect every part
of the design process.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.920
From the feature set,
to the visual design,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.560
to the interaction metaphors.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.470
And finally, you also need to think
about the story's settings.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.590
The iPhone and the iPad
are mobile devices,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.300
and they're not used in the same settings
as traditional software or websites.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.690
I know that I use my iPhone
or iPad throughout the day,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.720
wherever I am.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.030
Designing a great product
doesn't start or end with a list

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.970
of features or technologies.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.860
At the end of the day,
people care about how your app makes

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.140
them feel and what it enables them to do.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.670
to do.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.020
And this is why in our ads,
we don't talk about RAM, processor speed,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.410
or all the other technologies.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.920
Instead, we focus on all the great things
that you can do with our products.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.230
The features and technologies
that you include in your app

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.330
should only be there to support
the story you're trying to tell.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.920
And I find it really helpful to envision
a 30-second commercial of your product

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.340
at the beginning of the design process.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.890
And this will really help you focus
on the most important screens,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.280
the most important features,
and the overall visual design that you're

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.110
going to be using throughout your app.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.700
So throughout your design process,
always think about how

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.380
to tell a great story.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.620
And above all else,
your goal should be to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.040
create an experience that
enables and delights people.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.420
And if you're able to
accomplish this goal,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.410
I can guarantee it's one of
the most rewarding feelings

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.100
you'll get as a developer.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:04:48.700
[Transcript missing]

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.440
First of all, entertainment apps
should be highly visual.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.430
If you're designing for the iPhone,
really take advantage

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.950
of the retina display.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.480
If you're designing for the iPad,
make sure you showcase the content

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.460
on the large 10-inch screen.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.130
The layout, graphics, and typography,
they all need to look great.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.590
You're competing with thousands
of other apps on the app

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.950
stores in several categories,
and a lot of people are gonna decide

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.290
to download your app based purely
on how good your screenshots look.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.060
Entertainment apps should also be fun.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.550
Users typically spend a lot
more time in entertainment apps,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.620
and the experience
shouldn't feel like a chore.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.900
This is ShowYou,
an app that lets you explore

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.660
all videos that have been
posted to your social graph,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.090
whether it's Twitter, Facebook,
or your ShowYou network of friends.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.510
And the interface is essentially
a big wall of videos that you

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.300
can browse in any direction.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.160
As you move up, down, left, or right,
more videos come in,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.820
and when something catches your eye,
you can just tap on it to start watching.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.130
It's a really great, fun experience that
doesn't feel so controlled.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.420
Entertainment apps
should also be immersive.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.590
Think about new ways to utilize the
accelerometer and multi-touch gestures.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.180
Because you're trying to entertain,
you can be a little bit more

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.930
gratuitous with animation and sound.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.150
Compared to utility apps,
navigating content can be a

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.320
little bit more exploratory too.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.210
The path to accessing multimedia
doesn't always need to be so linear.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.180
This is the Biophilia app from Bjork.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.660
She describes the app as
an exploration of nature,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.210
music, and technology.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.200
And as you can see on the main screen,
you can explore this

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.000
three-dimensional galaxy of songs.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.740
And choosing a song will load a
unique interactive visualization.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.560
It's really an amazing
audio and visual experience.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.090
If you decide to design
experimental UI like Biophilia,

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.480
just be careful not to confuse
your users as the fun will

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.620
quickly turn to frustration.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.200
So those were some of the tips
I've learned from the app.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.260
Here are some key characteristics
of entertainment apps.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.800
Now, let's talk about utility apps.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.810
By definition,
utility apps need to be useful.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.670
You can't make the assumption
that a strong brand presence

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.770
is enough of a reason for users
to download and use your app.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.070
I'm sure many of you have had the
experience where you discover one of

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.300
your favorite brands on the app store.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.230
And so you download that app only to
discover that it doesn't do anything.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.960
Maybe it just provides some marketing
content or promotional material.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.120
And so usually what happens
is you delete the app.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.920
It's critical that your iPhone or iPad
app provides some value that goes beyond

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.970
what they can get from your website.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.240
For example,
this is the State Farm Pocket Agent app.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.260
State Farm is a large insurance
company and bank in the US.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.800
And when they designed their mobile app,
they really thought about what features

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.290
they could provide that would go
above and beyond their mobile website.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.610
So bank customers are able to
take a photo of the check they

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.800
receive and directly deposit
the funds into their account.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.290
And so they're taking advantage of the
built-in camera and unique technologies

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.020
that are available on the iPhone.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.340
And insurance customers also
have a personalized copy of their

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.810
insurance card right in their app.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.800
If they get pulled over by the police
or get into a traffic accident,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.620
they can easily share this
information with whoever they need to.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.640
So they'll definitely want to
keep this app on their device.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.200
And if you do get into an accident,
this app actually lets you take

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.360
photos of the scene of the accident
and draw out the scene using

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.580
some of their drawing tools.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.000
All of this allows you to file a
claim directly in your iPhone app.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.300
You can even mark the damaged part of
your car to expedite the claim process.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.550
So there's a lot of really useful
features that State Farm thought about

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.280
when they built out their iPhone app.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.560
Another characteristic of utility apps
is that they need to be efficient.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.050
Tasks should be optimized
for speed and productivity.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.450
The path to information
should be clear and direct.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.600
Remember that users aren't
as interested in spending a

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.300
lot of time in utility apps.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.210
They want to complete their tasks
and then move on with their life.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.450
So avoid launch animations
and excessive branding.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.180
Really, the most effective way to promote
your brand is providing a great

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.670
streamlined user experience that
your customers will remember.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.320
And so can you imagine how annoying mail
would be if it had a UI like the app

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.260
Shoyu that I showed earlier or Biophilia
that would get really frustrating when

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.350
you're trying to read your inbox or
compose messages to whoever you need to?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.190
Another characteristic of utility
apps is that they need to be reliable.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.230
People need to know that they
can count on the information in

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.990
utility apps wherever they are.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.310
And they don't want to be surprised when
navigating different parts of the UI.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.450
This is Jeppesen's Mobile TC app.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.500
This app replaces all the flight
map charts in the cockpit for

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.840
pilots flying commercial aircraft.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.220
So it goes without saying that
this app needs to be very reliable.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.250
And this is another app that
would be really frustrating to use

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.530
if there was a launch animation
or some type of exploratory UI.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.140
So those are some key characteristics
of entertainment and utility apps.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.370
Entertainment apps
should be highly visual,

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.580
fun, and immersive.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.890
And utility apps should be useful,
efficient, and reliable.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It's important that your UI is
appropriate for the type of

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.290
app that you're building.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.060
But I know a lot of apps won't
land all the way on one side

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.940
of the axis or the other.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.970
And so if you have a
hybrid app like this,

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.000
just apply these different
characteristics to the part of

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
the app where it makes sense.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.070
So for example,
here's an app like GarageBand that

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.820
allows you to create and mix songs.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.660
But it's also really entertaining.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.700
And so it's a mix of
entertainment and utility.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.650
And so we applied these different
characteristics to the parts of

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.540
the app where it makes sense.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.700
Here in the instrument screen,
it's highly visual, immersive,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.700
and it's a lot of fun.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.250
So you can spend a lot of time
noodling around on the instruments.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.220
But when you go to edit a track,
it's all business.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.180
The graphics still look good,
but the screen is designed for

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.310
efficiency so you can mix up
your song as quick as possible.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.640
Another example of a
hybrid app is iMovie.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.620
For those of you who have used this app,
you know that when you launch the app,

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.540
it's a lot of fun.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.470
You're taken to the movie theater screen,
the neon sign flickers on,

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.940
and there's this nice sound and
animation that lets you really feel

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.620
like you're going to the movies.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.330
And underneath,
there's this marquee with movie posters

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.890
where a user can swipe between the
different movies that they've created.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.420
However, when you're editing a movie,
the view is a lot more serious.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.060
There are multiple levels
of tracks to choose from,

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.230
and the design is optimized to help users
edit their movie as fast as possible.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.880
We could have continued the metaphor of
this old movie theater with film reels

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.910
and maybe a traditional play button,
but that would have gotten

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.150
really frustrating when you're
going to edit an actual movie.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.920
The fun part of this app is
so you can share your movie

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.030
with your friends and family,
not spend a whole lot of time

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.190
editing all the different pieces.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.720
Now let's talk about how to edit a movie.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.880
Let's get to the second question.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.350
What kind of content does your app have?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.940
The characteristics of entertainment and
utility apps should give you a good idea

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.910
of how your app should feel to a user,
but it's really the content that will

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.980
play a much bigger role in the overall
look and visual design of your app.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.930
So what I'm going to do now is go through
a bunch of different types of content

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.670
and give you a good idea of how it will
influence the visual design of your app.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.130
So first, I'm going to talk about
photos and videos.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.440
When you've got photos
and videos in your app,

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.580
make sure that you
fill the entire screen.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.040
Even if the rest of your app only
works in portrait orientation,

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.070
make sure that you support
landscape orientation for watching

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.220
movies and swiping through photos.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.870
This will allow you to
maximize the aspect ratio of

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.560
most media versus the device.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.500
And if the photo or video is part
of a book chapter or news article,

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.680
allow users to pinch on the thumbnails to
let the photos or videos fill the screen.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.900
This is one of the biggest advantages
of these devices over printed media,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.960
and so if you're not letting
users interact with the device,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.740
you're really not doing anything
better than what they could

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.110
get in a book or a newspaper.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.060
If you need to provide caption
information or navigation controls,

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.930
make sure it all disappears
with a single tap of the photo.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.540
Here we're looking at the
Guardian Eyewitness app.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.960
And this is a beautiful app for viewing
amazing photos from all over the world.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.060
And they show caption information
and give some tips directly from the

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.720
photographer on how the photo was taken.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.070
And also they've got a sponsor
graphic in the lower right corner,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.000
and they've got navigation at the top.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.580
But as soon as you tap the photo,
all the controls hide and the

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.370
photo just fills the screen.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.700
Even the iOS status bar should go away.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.760
People will expect to swipe to
navigate between a set of photos.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.960
Make sure you don't clutter the screen
with navigation arrows or a scroll bar.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.130
When people see these interface elements,
they'll know that you simply

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.810
ported a UI from another platform,
like a website.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.570
And with videos,
you should use the native iOS

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.090
playback controls as much as possible.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.550
I've seen a lot of developers build
their own custom playback controls

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.290
just to be unique or to match the
colors in other parts of their app.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.540
And while I admit this looks nice,
it's usually not an area that

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.120
I recommend you spend a lot of
time in in the development process.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.360
This is a part of the interface
that most people won't even notice.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.310
When they go to watch a movie,
they'll focus on the actual

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.040
video that they want to play.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.570
If they have to relearn
where familiar buttons are,

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.960
they'll get frustrated.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.520
When you use the native controls,
you'll get proper built-in support

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.710
for AirPlay and high-speed scrubbing.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.090
You also won't have to worry
about updating your code

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.100
for each time we update iOS.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.300
When you do need to surface
the UI with photos and videos,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.430
you want to make sure that
you're reducing any visual

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.550
noise in the user interface.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.910
Use the translucent navigation bars
and black buttons and really minimize

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.350
any color throughout the interface.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.600
Here we're looking at the
Photos app on the iPad.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.010
As you can see,
we've really reduced the amount

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.530
of color in the interface.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.750
You never want the chrome
to outshine the content.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.600
As an exercise,
let's take a look at what happens

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.300
in this app if we put the piles of
photos and a nice wood background.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.640
At first glance, it may look nice,
and it certainly creates

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.040
a more memorable UI.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.320
Conceptually, it works well as well.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.080
The piles of photos look like
they're on this nice wooden desk.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.380
But the wood is stealing the show,
and it makes distinguishing the

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.620
different photos a lot harder.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.910
So look how much more the photos
stand out on the black background

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.770
that we use in the Photos app.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.240
Photos and videos are a
visually rich type of content,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.570
so be really careful that the
interface doesn't distract the user.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.060
The next type of content that I want
to talk about are large data sets.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.220
Essentially, these are apps with a lot
of information to manage.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.180
Because most data-intensive apps
fall into the utility category,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.680
it's important that accessing
the information is efficient.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.820
Use proper alignment throughout your
app to help increase legibility.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.160
This is very helpful on screens
that need to scroll a lot.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.390
In Mail, we left-aligned the name,
subject, and message preview,

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.120
and right-aligned the dates.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.490
And having this rigid grid makes
finding a message a lot easier.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.930
When you have data that requires
a label in addition to the value,

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.060
like we do in contacts,
make sure that you right align the

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.980
label and left align the values.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.270
And this allows your eye to again
focus on a single part of the

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.120
screen and track a lot of data.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.240
Another typographic consideration
for information dense screens are the

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.500
typefaces and font sizes that you choose.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.600
Rather than mix and match a
lot of different typefaces,

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.820
use subtle shading and
font sizes to distinguish

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.490
different types of information.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.030
So in Mail,
we used the standard Helvetica

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.500
New in several sizes.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.500
The most important
information is the sender,

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.490
and so we made that a
black 17 point bold.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.460
The next important piece of
information is the subject,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.410
and so that still gets black,
but it's 14 point and no longer bold.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.390
The message preview is the next
piece of information we display,

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.500
and that shows up as
gray 13 point regular.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.660
13 point Helvetica New is the minimum
size that you can use in your iPhone

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.490
or iPad app without making users
hold the device closer to their face.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.580
And you shouldn't use this
small size for body text,

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.490
as it's tiring to read in
more than a line or two.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:22.950
And you shouldn't use this
small size for body text,

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.500
as it's tiring to read in
more than a line or two.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.500
And so when we go to show
the messages in Mail,

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.800
we actually use a 15 point Helvetica New,
so that's much easier to read with

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.430
line wrapping and multiple paragraphs.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.200
And depending on how users use your app,
you may need to increase the

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.500
font size above 15 point.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.200
Another consideration for information
dense screens is that you want to

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.680
make sure that navigation is easy.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.500
And what I mean by navigation here
isn't just the movement between

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.430
different parts of your app,
but also for the ability of the

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.770
user to look at a single screen
on your app and find the different

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.880
pieces of information that they want.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.280
This is the Yahoo Market Dash app.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.820
And there's a lot of data on this screen
because the user is tracking all types

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.840
of information on the stock market.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:10.620
But because the Yahoo developers
paid careful attention to typography

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.420
and maintaining a strict grid,
it's not overwhelming to look at.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.260
And you can pretty quickly locate
different pieces of information

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.720
and just tap on the different
informations to get even more details.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.960
And I think this UI looks
really nice as well.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.920
A lot of developers disregard
the importance of visual design

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.680
when building apps that house
a lot of information and text.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.800
Just like we saw in the Yahoo Finance,
not all data-intensive apps need

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.800
to use the standard controls.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.770
This is the
Japanese Major League Baseball

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.710
app from Genesics.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.800
It's called Wonderho Stadium.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.110
And I really like how
clean this app looks,

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.800
so let's take a closer look.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.800
You can tell they put a lot of effort
into making this app look great.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.330
When there's a live game,
there's a lot of information

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.800
that's constantly coming in.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.640
Updated scores, stats, news,
and different Twitter feeds.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.080
And the subtle custom
textures and UI elements never

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.800
get in the way with that.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.740
Bold colors are used
with a specific purpose,

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.800
and text is spaced apart
nicely and easy to read.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.020
They even use this wood texture
in the top chrome to give it

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.800
a little more visual flair.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.750
But it's subtle enough that it
doesn't distract from the data.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.790
With data-intensive apps,
you need to be very careful

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:20.800
about what you're using.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.790
You can be very cautious with realism.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.800
It's easy for rich graphics to
distract from the important content.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.800
But when done properly,
it can make a really great impression.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.800
The next type of content that I want to
talk about are apps with minimal data.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.780
And this is kind of the
opposite as the large data sets,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.800
apps that don't have a lot
of information to display.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.410
And these are the apps that
benefit the most from the use

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.670
of realism and bold graphics.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.800
The built-in compass is
a great example of this.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800
The app doesn't have to deal
with a lot of information.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.020
And so looking like an actual
compass really helps users know

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.800
how to interact with it right away.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.800
This next app is Etude
from Steinway and Sons.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.790
It turns your iPhone into a
metronome to help you stay on tempo

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.800
if you're practicing the piano.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.670
Because the designers
mimicked expensive materials,

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.800
the app feels right at home
on top of one of their pianos.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.580
The graphically rich UI works
well because there isn't a

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.390
lot of information to display,
just the tempo.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.390
Here's another great looking app.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.580
It's called Thermo from Robocat.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.720
And when you launch it,
it's just a thermometer and it's empty.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.360
And as the mercury animates up,
it shows you what the current temperature

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.910
is based on your GPS location.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.810
Again, this is a rich,
highly visual UI that works

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.110
well because there isn't a
lot of information to display,

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.260
just the current temperature and
the temperature of the day before.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.800
Here's DJ,
an Apple Design Award-winning app.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.640
It's got a gorgeous interface
with a realistic rendering

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.660
of a set of turntables.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.110
And again, not a lot of information
is presented in this app.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.870
Most of the time you spend interacting
with the great-looking controls.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.100
The next app is Flight Card.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.660
This is a travel app that lets
you track flight information.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.060
The designers made the
UI look like a boarding pass,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.840
a really nice looking boarding pass.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.240
People might use this app in an
airport holding a suitcase in one hand,

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.180
and the great visual design
will really help them find the

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.010
information they're looking for
even in a distracting setting.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:27.010
The graphics are also a lot more fun and
memorable than a standard table view.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.560
Here's the Voice Memos app.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.080
When you're recording, there's hardly any
information to display,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.460
so it really benefits from this
beautiful rendering of a microphone.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.680
But when you need to
access your recordings,

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.340
the UI is a lot more traditional.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.010
We could have continued the
metaphor and used cassette tapes

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.330
or a digital recording deck,
but that UI would have

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.140
been a lot less efficient.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:55.890
Make sure you use realism only
where appropriate in your app.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.680
I want to revisit the Mail app to
talk more about this important point.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.970
Mail is an app that we could have
created a really realistic graphical UI.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.080
There could be envelopes, postage stamps,
and animations all over the place

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.480
for messages flying into mailboxes.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.850
But all of that would have been
distracting from the content.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.580
Mail has a large data set
that's constantly changing.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.360
In your app, make sure you're using
realism appropriately.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.340
It's a great way to make a memorable UI,
but you need to make sure you're

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.490
not distracting the user from the
information that they care about.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.970
Now let's talk about games.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.010
It goes without saying that the
graphics need to be beautiful.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.400
But make sure you're consistent.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.980
Everything should look great as
soon as the user launches the app,

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.580
even the menus.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.540
This is Zenbound 2.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.980
It's one of my favorite games on iOS.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.720
It's a multi-touch puzzle game
with beautiful 3D graphics

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.290
that you can see here.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.150
And as you can see,
the menu screens not only look

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.640
nice as soon as you launch the app,
but they're also a lot of

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.490
fun to interact with as well.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.980
You want to be consistent
with typography as well.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.000
Make sure the typeface matches
the visual style of your game.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.510
Just as a handwriting typeface would feel
out of place in Mail or the Stocks app,

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.000
the default Helvetica New feels
equally out of place in most games.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.290
So make sure you're using
something a little bit more fun

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.200
and appropriate for the visual
style that you have in your game.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.480
With games,
make sure you customize Game Center's

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.660
leaderboard and achievement
screens to match the visual style.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.720
This is Astronut from The Icon Factory.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.430
They've made the achievement and
leaderboard screens fit right

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.890
into the visual theme of the game.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.260
The default green felt would feel really
out of place with the space-age interface

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.770
that they've created in this app.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.060
Here's another great app with
customized Game Center screens.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.140
It's Flight Control HD.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.130
This is a totally addictive game where
you act as an air traffic controller

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.260
and land planes on different runways.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.740
They've decided to actually
integrate the achievement screen

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.640
right into the game's menu.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.650
And so when you launch the app,
it looks like a pilot flight's logbook.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.460
Because they integrated the
screen right into the menu,

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.800
it looks like they built
Game Center themselves.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.200
Next,
I want to talk a little bit more about

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.180
customization in any type of app.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:28.340
So a lot of developers ask me about how
to deal with the UI in a universal app.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.280
Maybe they've got a UI that
they're happy with on the iPhone,

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.170
but they're struggling as
they transition to the iPad.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.700
Maybe the UI isn't working
as well on the large screen.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.000
Well, even in a universal app,
you want to make sure that you're

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.120
customizing the UI for the specific
device you're designing for.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.720
So here we're looking at the
built-in music app on the

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.520
iPhone and iPad on iOS 5.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.500
And as you can see,
the artist screen looks

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.720
completely different on the
iPhone compared to the iPad.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.730
We're really taking advantage of the
larger screen to show the big cover art.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.110
But the cover art on the small iPhone
screen would really get in the way when

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:07.810
you've got hundreds or thousands of
artists saved to your music library.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.620
One of the best features of iOS
5 is the ability to customize

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.640
the look of UIKit controls.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.870
In iOS 5, most of the UIKit controls
are now skinnable.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.380
You can choose custom colors or images
to make the native controls perfectly

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.840
match the theme of your interface.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:31.040
Things like tab bars, nav bars, buttons,
and segmented controls can all match

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.590
the visual style that you want.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.260
Here you can see Game Center.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.590
In iOS 4,
we had to build all these custom controls

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.940
to get the exact look that we wanted.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.990
A lot of you have had to do
the same thing in your apps.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.080
But in iOS 5,
we were able to throw out all of

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.890
that custom code and just theme
the native UIKit controls to

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.870
have a really custom appearance.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.540
If you're customizing the UI in your app,
make sure you're reading the

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.130
human interface guidelines.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.380
It's a great way to learn
about iOS conventions.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.620
In fact, everybody designing for iOS
should read this document.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.850
I like to think of the
HIG kind of like a cookbook.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.080
At the beginning,
there are a lot of tips on how

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.940
to approach different projects.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.900
And in the back,
there's all these recipes on

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.060
how specific controls work.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.780
But just like cooking,
when you really get to know why

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.660
ingredients work well together,
you'll be able to create a great dish.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.570
Well, when you understand why we
use different controls in iOS,

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.960
you'll be able to go above and
beyond what we provide and create

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.980
appropriate UI for your app.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.960
This is a great picture of the
HIG that a developer sent to me.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.380
It's bookmarked and worn out,
and this is what every

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.120
HIG should look like.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.030
OK, so those were some tips to help
you define your app's style.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.460
Next, I want to talk about touch.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.100
And this is an area that's going to
sound familiar to those of you who

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.440
have heard some of my past UI talks.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.690
But this topic is worth repeating.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:03.500
So many apps have controls and interfaces
suited for a pixel precise mouse cursor.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.840
In your app, make sure you're
accommodating for a fingertip.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.260
In the iOS Human Interface Guidelines,
we recommend controls to be

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.540
a minimum of 44 by 44 points.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.340
And the built-in Calculator app
is a great reference to follow.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.730
Controls are 44 points tall,
and they're nicely spaced apart.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.220
And you'll see that we use
44 points throughout iOS.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.470
It's not just the calculator.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.600
The nav bars and toolbars are 44 points.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.910
And you can notice that the
controls in the toolbars are a

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.650
little bit smaller than 44 points,
but the actual input area that's

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:46.410
going to recognize a touch
gesture will be 44 points.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.830
Rows and table views and grouped
table views are 44 points.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.040
On the iPad,
buttons and popovers are 44 points tall.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:01.360
The device is bigger,
but the size of the finger is the same.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.360
The controls in
FaceTime are 44 points tall.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.480
Okay, so I could spend all day going
through all the apps showing you more

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.300
examples of 44-point-sized controls,
but I hope that I've made my point.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.910
In your app, make sure controls are
at least 44 points.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.110
If your users are using an app
in a hyper-mobile workflow,

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.530
make sure the controls are even bigger.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.390
So with the touchscreen,
you also need to make sure that

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.710
you're thinking about gestures,
not just touch size.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.120
Here's the built-in weather app.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.080
When you launch the app,
you're viewing the weather

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.040
forecast right away.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.040
Users can quickly swipe to navigate
between the different cities.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.470
And by using a gesture,
we're able to fill the

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.820
screen with content.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.840
It's a very fast way
to move between items.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.100
If you use swiping in your app,
here are some things that

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.510
you need to consider.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.470
All the items that a user
swipes between should be equal.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.530
In the weather app,
all cities are the same.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.070
They may be in a different order,
but they're still all cities.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.520
It would be very confusing if the
user was swiping between cities,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.880
and then all of a sudden they
swiped to the settings screen.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.080
So make sure that you
flatten out the hierarchy.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.520
When a user swipes with their finger,
it should feel like they're actually

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.500
grabbing the item on the screen.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.820
I've seen a lot of apps when you
make the swipe motion and then a

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.360
second later the screen animates.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.990
While the delay may be
acceptable on a desktop website,

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.000
it feels very unresponsive
on a touchscreen.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.390
Users will think your
app is slow and buggy,

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.500
so make sure your app is properly
tracking the user's finger.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.130
You also need to make sure you're
providing some sort of visual

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:45.100
indicator letting users know that
they can swipe to see more items.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.120
Paging controls give users a nice
indication that they can swipe and just

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.100
how much swiping they'll have to do.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.880
If those paging dots
don't work in your design,

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.840
consider revealing a little bit of
whatever is to the left or to the

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.100
right of the currently selected item.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:04.090
This way it will always be clear
to users when they need to swipe.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.980
You also want to provide visual
indicators for scrolling in iOS,

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.400
since we don't show scroll bars
until the user starts to scroll.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.520
In all of our built-in apps,
we use non-integral rows to

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.400
provide a little bit of indication
there is more information below.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.550
When a user sees that last cell cut off,
they know that there's more

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.390
information they need to interact with.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.370
With gestures, make sure you're not
hiding key functionality.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.540
Not all users are familiar with
the fact that you can swipe on a

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.300
row to reveal the Delete button.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.490
And users certainly aren't going to
be familiar with any custom gestures

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.710
that you build into your own app.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.610
So you want to make sure that
you provide actual affordance for

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.460
any of the key functionalities.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.410
In the case of mail,
we provide this Edit button so all users

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.140
know how to get to this functionality.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.900
So when designing for the touchscreen,
make sure your controls are sized for a

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.300
finger and you support common gestures.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.300
But I want to challenge you
to go above and beyond that.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.300
I want to show you some apps that
are completely touch-centric.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.300
This is our choice from Push Pop Press.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.720
It's an interactive book
from Al Gore that also

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.260
won an Apple Design Award.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:17.250
Their UI lets users swipe, tap, scroll,
and pinch their way around the content.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.300
And because they use
the standard gestures,

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.300
there's actually no UI.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.300
You always interact
directly with the content.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.300
And so you've really got to see this
app in action to get an understanding

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.140
of how touch-centric this interface is.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.730
So let's take a look.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.460
The designers really paid attention
to all of the details here.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.470
And I don't know if you noticed,
but even when the user

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.470
was pinching the video,
it was still playing

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.800
underneath their fingers.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.730
I want to show another example
of a touch-centric app.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.790
It's called Stock Touch.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:23.790
Like Push Pop Press,
this UI is completely touch-centric.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.410
When you launch the app,
you can see an overview of different

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.440
sectors of the stock market,
whether it's financial information,

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.540
technology, consumer goods.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.800
They've broken the stock market
into nine different segments.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.800
And right away,
you can see how the market is performing.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.890
The green is showing
the stocks that are up,

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.800
and the red is showing the
stocks that have gone down.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.500
And so again,
we need to see this app in action

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.800
to really appreciate how much the
touch comes into play in their UI.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:53.730
The App

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.190
I love this app because the developers
used the touch screen of the iPad to

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:35.600
create a really engaging experience
for viewing financial information.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.420
And if you're designing a game,
take the time to think about how

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.370
to make it touch-centric as well.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.540
I want to tell you about an app called
Mike Tyson's Main Event from Rock Live.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.600
This is version 1.0 of their game.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:52.550
As you can see,
it had a traditional D-pad and buttons

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.600
that mimicked a console controller.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.600
And the game was stuck at
2.5 stars on the App Store.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.600
So clearly,
there was room for improvement.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.090
In version 2 of the game,
they remapped all the

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.600
controls to gestures.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:11.600
And immediately, they saw the number of
users go up by 2.5 times.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.600
And additionally,
the ratings went to 4 stars.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.220
Those of you with apps on the
App Store know how hard it is

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.600
to get your ratings to go up
when you get a lot more users.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.480
The most impressive thing was
that engagement went up as well.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.600
Users are now getting to the 12th level
of the game instead of the 4th before.

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:35.450
And if you think about it,
most of the top selling and popular iOS

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:39.400
games that don't use the accelerometer
have interfaces that completely

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.720
revolve around the touch screen,
whether it's Angry Birds or Plant vs.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.570
Zombies, Infinity Blade or Fruit Ninja.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.240
Okay, so that was touch.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.900
Next up is animation.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.620
Use animation in your app to help
smooth the transitions between screens.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.140
In the real world,
objects don't just appear and disappear.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.610
And if you see this in an app,
it can be very jarring.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.010
So in the Notes app,
we use the page curl animation

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.740
when you're moving between notes.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:13.130
And when you delete a note,
it animates right into the trash can.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.460
So these are really helpful for the
user as it gives them an idea of what

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.770
happened on the way to the next screen.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.540
And it's also a lot more engaging.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.400
Great native apps feel really fast,
and animation is one of the

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.670
tricks we use throughout the
platform to make things feel zippy.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.140
When you tap on controls,
make sure the app responds right away.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.290
If you need to load
data from the network,

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.360
immediately transition to
the screen that will load in.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.280
Don't just leave them on the same screen
and throw up a progress indicator.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.810
If they don't notice it,
they'll think that their

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.240
tap wasn't recognized.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.960
Apps that throw up the progress
indicator right away that don't

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.950
transition feel a lot more like
a web page than a native app.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.390
Use animation to provide
feedback in your app as well.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:03.360
We put all the apps in a jiggle mode
when you press and hold the app icon.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:07.150
This animation is great because we
don't need to display a text alert

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.540
or other interface element that would
get in the way with the operation.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.850
In the iTunes Store,
we use several animations to communicate

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.400
status and let the user know when
something is happening in the app.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.350
When you buy a song,
it jumps into the Downloads tab so

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.220
you know exactly where to find it.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.790
The downloading animation is really
nice because it lets you continue

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:32.050
previewing other songs in the album
without forcing you into a different

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.400
screen or showing an ugly text alert.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.980
We use animations throughout iOS and
it's one of the biggest differences

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.400
between iOS and our competitors.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:46.010
When you interact with the apps,
a lot of time you don't even notice the

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.400
animations because they feel so natural.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.400
But if you were to remove the animations,
I guarantee you would notice it.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.290
Some interactions would get confusing,
the devices would feel slower,

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.400
and it just wouldn't feel
as polished or engaging.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.400
Think about how to use animation in
your app to make things feel natural,

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.400
to provide a more natural experience,
to provide feedback to users,

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.400
and to give them a better
idea of what's going on.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.410
And if you're in an entertainment app,
make sure you use animation

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.400
to make the app more fun.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.390
Okay, so think about how to use animation
in your app to make it more intuitive

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:22.400
and feel like it belongs on iOS.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:27.030
The next topic is focus.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.080
When you build out your feature set,
it's really tempting to add

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.700
items that you may have thought
were cool in another app.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.540
Or maybe they sound interesting
because they utilize a new technology.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:40.040
But keep referring back to the
story you're trying to tell.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:42.840
When you focus on just the
most important features,

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:46.500
you'll have more time to
polish the overall experience.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.800
The key to designing a successful app
is to determine just the essential

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:54.480
features needed to make it great,
and to spend all the time

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.280
polishing just those.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:01.700
All of the things I talked about earlier,
animation, graphics, touch interaction,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:06.710
is hard work, so you'll struggle if
you try to do too much.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.530
To illustrate this point,
I want to talk about a great iPad app,

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.660
Penultimate from CocoaBox Design,
and it's consistently kept

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.090
a four to five star rating.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.180
When you launch the app,
it essentially turns your iPad

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.660
into a notebook of your choice,
and it's got a beautiful UI.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.550
This is what Penultimate looked like
when it first launched in April 2010.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.750
There were three paper
types to choose from,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.780
but only one pen color and tip size.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.600
The app was lacking several features
that other sketching apps had.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.200
Yet it remained popular because
people loved the clean design,

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.500
all the little attention to details.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:50.260
There were a lot of feature requests from
users asking for all kinds of things.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.200
And when this happens,
you know you've done a great job.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.540
It means people like your
product and they want more of it.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.420
A mistake so many developers make is
trying to build everything at once,

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.800
right out of the gate.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:07.390
What often happens is a full-featured app
that's either too complicated or buggy.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.680
So what Penultimate did is
slowly they added the features

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.320
that people were asking for.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.670
In June,
they added the ability to choose a

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:19.030
few different colors and pen tips.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:23.580
A few months later, they added multi-page
selection and AirPrint support.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.940
In May 2011, they added a paper shop to
purchase different paper

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.900
types to use in a notebook.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.670
And this was great for musicians,
designers, writers,

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:37.580
and anybody looking for a specific
paper background in their notebooks.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:41.630
And even their in-app purchase store
looks really great because they were able

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.690
to focus on just this specific feature.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.210
In September, they added the ability to
add photos to a notebook.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.600
This has been a feature that people
asked for from the very beginning,

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.520
but they waited this long because
they really wanted to nail it.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.980
And just recently,
they added a selection tool and

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.980
a few more colors to the app.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:06.540
Since penultimate originally launched,
there have been over 10 feature releases.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.760
And as you can see,
the overall design of the

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.300
app has stayed true to form.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.650
Sure, there may be one or two
more icons here and there,

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:17.440
but the mechanics and the same
appealing visual design are still there.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.450
This isn't a coincidence.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:24.220
CocoaBox Design carefully examined which
features were most important and spent

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.850
a lot of time polishing each one before
they were introduced into the app.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.150
In your app,
figure out the absolute minimum number of

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.760
features needed to accomplish your idea.

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:40.380
Cut everything else out and really spend
your time polishing those features.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.760
So that was focus.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:46.760
Next up is prototyping.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.120
This is the last topic I'm
going to be talking about,

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:52.600
and I can spend an hour just
talking about this area.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.760
But we're short on time,
and I wanted to run through

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.290
just a few quick tips.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.310
The first tip is just to make sure
you're actually prototyping your app at

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.890
the very early stages of development.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.200
Use whatever tool you're
most comfortable with.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.860
Keynote is a great prototyping tool.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.540
The advanced features for builds and
the ability to magic move objects

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.920
between slides let you really play
around with different animations.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:23.270
But use any tool you're comfortable with,
whether it's Xcode storyboarding, motion,

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.190
Quartz Composer, After Effects,
or even pen and paper.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.330
Further on in the design process,
you need to make sure you're testing

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.040
everything on the actual device.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.010
While the iOS simulator is great,
it won't give you a good enough

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.660
idea of how the graphics and text
will look on an iPhone or iPad.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.290
There are now several great
apps to help you test the UI on

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.260
the device as you design it.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.690
LiveView is one of the oldest,
but there is also Xscope from the Icon

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:55.340
Factory or ScalaView from Bidjango.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.970
When you run the
companion apps on the Mac,

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:02.590
they will broadcast the UI over
Wi-Fi to an iPhone or iPad,

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.790
and this makes designing really easy.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.370
Another good way to do this
is using PhotoStream on iOS 5.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.420
Just save PNGs of your mockups
to your PhotoStream in iPhoto,

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.570
and they will automatically
show up on your iPad or iPhone,

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.070
ready to preview the UI.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.520
It goes without saying that you need
to have a great app icon for your app,

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.130
and this is a topic that
I could talk about in depth.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.590
But I just want to give you one quick
tip to test how great your icon is.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:33.370
Just put it inside of a
folder to test legibility.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.320
When you look at the
icon in the small size,

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.250
you'll be able to tell how
distinct the shape and colors are.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.600
The best iOS app icons are still
distinguishable at the small size.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.110
Sure,
you won't see all the great details,

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:50.530
but icons that get all muddied
up are usually too visually

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.760
complicated even at the large size.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.510
The last thing I want to talk
about is something that you

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:01.590
should constantly ask yourself,
and that is, is it Apple quality?

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:05.440
Is your app at the same level as
something Apple would release?

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.660
This is a question we ask
ourselves all the time when we're

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:12.650
working on our own products,
and there's no reason you shouldn't have

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.970
the same high standards for features,
beauty, and intuitiveness.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.000
Okay, so those were just a few
quick tips for prototyping.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.500
I covered a lot of material today,
so I just want to review

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.770
some of the key points.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.210
Make sure you've got a clearly
defined style for your app.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.990
Take into consideration the type
of app you're building and the

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.810
kind of content you're displaying.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.130
Design your app for touch.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.600
Everything needs to be
designed for a fingertip,

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.630
and you should support
the appropriate gestures.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.220
But try to go above and beyond that
and build a touch-centric experience.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.340
Use animation in your app
to make it feel faster,

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.630
more intuitive, and more at home on iOS.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.340
Always focus your feature set.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.670
Determine the essential features
needed and spend all of your

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.640
time just polishing those bits.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.610
And make sure you prototype your
app from the very beginning.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:16.290
This will help you save valuable time
throughout the development process.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.140
And always remember that one of your
main goals is to tell a great story.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.140
Really think about what your
app will enable users to do.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:30.290
Make sure that every part of
the experience is delightful.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.300
So that's it.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.360
Thanks for listening to my talk.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.780
Whether you're just getting
started with a new app or

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.860
are updating an existing app,
I hope you can use many of the

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:43.230
tips that I went through to improve
the overall user experience.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.200
iPhone and iPad users expect apps
to be intuitive and beautiful.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:51.140
When you put in the extra effort to
craft a well-designed experience,

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.610
your app will have a much
better chance for success.
