00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.030
Hi, I'm Mark Kawano,
Apple's User Experience Evangelist.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.700
I spent many years as
a designer at Apple,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.630
and I've also helped thousands of
developers improve the design and user

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.620
experience of their iPhone and iPad apps.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.560
From this experience,
I've put together a list of tips

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.620
that address some of the most
common design issues I've seen.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.670
The tips I go through today will
help make your app more useful,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.460
intuitive, and beautiful,
and this should be your goal.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.960
If you can design your app to
have these three qualities,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.760
it will be more memorable
and more successful.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.960
More people will purchase
or download your app,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.900
talk about it to their
friends and family,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.040
and they'll be more likely to give
it a good review on the App Store.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.730
It doesn't matter what type
of developer you are or what

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.000
type of app you're building.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.920
The goal should be useful, intuitive,
and beautiful.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.640
Tips are split into
seven different sections:

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.800
focus, touch, animation, sound, language,
typography, and graphics.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.810
And throughout,
I'm going to be showing examples of many

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.160
of the apps that we designed at Apple,
and I'll also show examples of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.800
apps that other developers built.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.790
So let's get started with focus.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.820
First,
I want to talk about focusing your app.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.100
Whatever type of app you're building,
whether it's for productivity,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.020
media consumption, communication,
or entertainment,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.990
your app should provide a
useful and elegant solution.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.550
And the feature set should be
focused on whatever problems

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.670
your app helps to solve.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.390
The reason people love using the
iPhone and iPad isn't because they

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.600
come with every feature in the world.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.590
People love these devices because they
solve a targeted set of problems in the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.740
most innovative and elegant way possible.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.710
Similarly,
your app should be highly focused

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.760
on just the tasks that are
most important for your users.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.040
In the iOS HIG,
we describe a tool called the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.790
Application Definition Statement.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.290
Essentially,
the Application Definition Statement

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.960
is the answer to two questions:
What does the app do?

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.640
And who will use it?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.930
And it should be clear and concise.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.560
So let's take a look at an example:
an alarm clock for business travelers.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.040
Nice and simple.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.030
And immediately,
you get a mental picture of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.790
what the app might look like
and what features it will have.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.880
You probably want a recurring
alarm so the user doesn't

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.100
have to set it every day.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.500
And lullabies might be a nice way
to help some users go to sleep.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.740
GPS-based weather, moon phases,
or ocean tide charts would be cool.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.380
And maybe farm animal sounds as
the buzzer might be kind of funny.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.880
But after you've listed out
your potential features,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.180
continually refer back to your
application definition statement.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.290
An alarm clock for business travelers.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.620
As an exercise,
let's take a look at what happens

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.100
when you change just a single word.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.660
Instead of an alarm clock,
now you have a weather clock.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.430
And right away,
a different mental picture comes to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.010
mind with a different set of features.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.440
Or what if you stick with an
alarm clock but change the user?

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.020
So instead of an alarm clock
for business travelers,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.320
you have an alarm clock for children.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.530
Again,
you get a completely different picture

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.000
of what the app might look like and
what features would be appropriate.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.520
But let's stick with
our original statement,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.800
an alarm clock for business travelers.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.340
When we look at the original feature set,
it's clear that many items

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.940
don't directly relate to our
application definition statement.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.410
Weather information is interesting,
but there are several weather apps that

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.180
have some really beautiful interfaces
that would be hard to compete with.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.660
And animal sounds and
lullabies might be cute,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.150
but they probably aren't
appropriate for most business users.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.890
Use your app definition statement
to refine your feature set to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.080
just the most important tasks
for the users you've identified.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.480
If you try to solve too many problems,
people will get confused about

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.450
what the app is for and it will be
extremely difficult to come up with

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.310
innovative ways to solve each problem.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.880
By focusing on just the
right set of features,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.270
you can ensure that each and every one
of them is designed and built in the

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.370
most intuitive and elegant way possible.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.320
Now I want to talk about
focusing your user interface.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.080
Your UI should only contain the options
that matter most for any given task.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.720
As you design each screen,
you should ask yourself,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.710
"What's important now?" Examine every
element and question whether it's really

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.070
necessary for the user's primary task.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.320
In the Photos app, each screen has a
clearly defined purpose:

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.010
choosing an album, or choosing a photo,
or viewing a photo.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.920
And there can be controls
for other options,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.790
but when you look at each screen,
it should be very clear

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.190
what the primary task is.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.880
Once you've identified what's important,
you can showcase the content

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.190
that users care about most.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.280
Look how the photo fills
the entire screen here.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.410
Even the controls that do appear
are placed on a translucent bar,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.950
and after a slight delay,
the controls fade away.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.000
Here's the Maps app.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.730
There's one bar at the
top and one at the bottom,

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.670
but the map dominates the screen.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.600
And here's iBooks.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.780
The entire screen is a book page.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.320
Just like the Photos app,
the controls fade out over time

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.660
so the user can concentrate on the
content that they care about most.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.260
Here's photos on the iPad.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.940
Use the bigger screen to make the
content look that much better.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.480
The fact that the content fills the
entire screen makes the iPad one

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.340
of the best ways to view photos.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.960
And here's Maps on the iPad.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.340
Notice that there aren't more
controls all over the screen.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.370
Instead,
the bigger map gives you more awareness

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.070
of the places you want to explore.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.400
And this is Pages from our iWorks suite.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.810
This is an app with many features,
but the document fills almost

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.380
the entire screen with just a
single command bar at the top.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.080
This really allows you to
focus on whatever flyer,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.180
report,
or brochure you might be working on.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.040
The features that aren't as important
should be placed on a different screen.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.470
In Photos, we put all of the sharing
options in an action sheet.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.120
If we had tried to put each of these
features on the previous screen as

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.440
additional icons of the command bar,
you would see a lot less of the photo.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.870
And also the tab targets would
be really small and you wouldn't

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.870
get the nice clear text labels.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.070
So look how much nicer that is with
just the photo filling the screen.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.000
And on the iPad,
you can place additional options

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.120
in popovers rather than taking
the user to a different screen.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.940
Many people think that because
the iPad is much bigger,

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.930
all the options will fit in
bars along the top and bottom

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.180
and just be one tap away.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.720
But if you do this,
you'll create an app that's

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.340
complicated and confusing.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.720
Users won't be able to find
commands that they care about

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.940
most and efficiency will be lost.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.000
In photos for the iPad,
we placed all the sharing

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.820
options in a single popover.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.190
And popovers are nice
because they're contextual.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.490
You can see the commands while continuing
to view the content that they apply to.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.680
And in Pages on the iPad,
we've placed a lot of

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.560
functionality in popovers.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.400
When you tap on an item in the document,
the popover updates to provide

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.400
just the options that make
sense for the selected item.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.490
In iBooks, there are display and typeface
options and popovers so the book

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.680
page can fill the entire screen.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.960
So that was focus.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.540
Remember, focus your app.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.060
Create an application definition
statement so you can spend your

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.880
time on a targeted set of features.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.680
And focus your UI.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.430
Don't overcrowd the screen and
expose every feature at once.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.000
Instead,
showcase the content that people care

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.800
about most and place secondary options
in popovers or a separate screen.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.560
When you design for clarity rather
than the minimum number of taps,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.610
your users will be much more efficient at
whatever task they're trying to complete.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.100
So the next topic is touch.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.480
Optimizing your UI for the touchscreen
is one of the biggest shifts

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.690
you'll have to make if you've been
designing for the web or desktop

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.240
where there's a keyboard and mouse.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.640
It's really important that you design
controls with a finger in mind.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.770
Having buttons or other controls
that are too small is one of the most

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.700
common problems I see in iOS apps.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.640
Imagine trying to use an elevator
that was designed to be used

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.450
with a mouse instead of a finger.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.200
The buttons would be very
small and close together,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.920
and when you tried to tap one,
you'd probably select all

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.230
the floors above and below
the one you wanted to go to.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.870
It sounds ridiculous,
yet so many apps don't provide

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.020
controls sized for a finger.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.140
In the iOS HIG,
we recommend tap targets to be

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.010
44 by 44 points at a minimum,
and the built-in calculator app

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.500
is a great reference to follow.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.140
But remember,
not all apps are used the same

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.420
way or by the same people,
so it's important to consider the usage.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:11.200
This is the Nike+ GPS app for runners,
and it connects to a pedometer in

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.300
Nike+ sneakers and tracks distance,
time, and location.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.420
It even gives you audio feedback
when you listen to your iPod

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.420
music to encourage you as you run.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.100
And notice how they made the pause
button nice and big so it's easy

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.140
to tap when you're on the go.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.100
And this is an app that plays songs
for kids called Kids Song Machine.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.680
Since it's targeted at
very young children,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.100
the exit and lyrics
buttons are nice and big.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.290
On a touchscreen,
it's also important to provide a good

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.340
amount of space between controls.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.770
When you put controls
right next to each other,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.420
you increase the chance that your users
will accidentally tap the wrong item.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.530
Here's Cut the Rope.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.140
It's one of the most popular
games on the App Store,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.820
and it's incredibly addictive
and consistently ranked in

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.920
the top most paid-for apps.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.760
And Cut the Rope does a great job spacing
the different buttons in the pause menu.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.420
Usually, you've paused a game because you
were distracted by something.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.930
Providing the extra space ensures
that you won't accidentally quit

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.110
the game and lose any progress that
you may have made on that level.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.080
And here's Cut the Rope for the iPad.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.200
All the same rules about
spacing and sizing still apply.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.750
The screen may be much larger,
but remember that your

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.080
fingertip is the same size.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.130
Users also expect immediate
feedback when using a touchscreen.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.020
So take a look at the passcode screen.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.840
Every button has visible tap states
and other parts of the UI update.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.650
When waiting outside an elevator,
you've most likely interacted

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.040
with a button that doesn't
provide good feedback.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.560
So you press the button
and nothing happens.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.340
So you press it again and again.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.960
Sometimes you keep holding the button
down until the elevator arrives.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.300
That's a bad user experience.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.080
You don't want your users waiting and
wondering as they interact with your app.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.270
Remember,
the iPhone and iPad's touchscreen

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.340
doesn't know where your finger is.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.610
Unlike a computer that always
knows where the cursor is,

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.950
your app won't be able to provide
rollover states or tooltips to indicate

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.340
when an element is interactive.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.250
Designing buttons with shine, texture,
and depth will make

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.080
controls look tappable.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.340
Let's take a closer look
at the Calculator app.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.840
The slight gradient and border treatment
on each button makes them look raised.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.750
And the area displaying the numbers,
which isn't interactive, appears flat.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.860
And notice the way our switch
controls look like an actual switch.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.490
Right away,
users know how to interact with the

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.560
screen after they turn on the device.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.450
Another good way to make controls
look tappable is by following

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.440
standard iOS conventions.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.520
So this is the iTunes app.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.250
And throughout iOS,
we use rounded corners to

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.900
indicate interactive elements.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.010
And chevrons are another
convention to let users know they

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.000
can tap on an item in a list.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.760
By using these conventions,
you're often able to reduce the

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.320
amount of visual noise in the UI,
and users will recognize these

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.870
subtle indicators to understand
which items are interactive.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.670
If you're designing an immersive game or
you just have a UI that's highly themed,

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.780
make sure the interactive elements
stand out from the background.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.860
Here's Nova.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.180
It's a first-person shooter game
with controls surrounding the screen.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.600
And they've got everything
you need to look around,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.290
steer, jump, shoot, change guns,
throw grenades, and freeze aliens.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.000
And notice how they use a translucent
overlay to separate the controls from the

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.150
background art so you know where to tap.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.880
So those are some great tips for touch.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.920
Make sure your buttons are properly
sized and spaced on how your app is used.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.350
And provide immediate feedback
so the user isn't left wondering

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.540
if a gesture was recognized.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.280
Give your controls a tactile look and
make sure the interactive elements

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.880
stand out from the background.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.840
The next topic is animation.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:11.020
Using animation in your app makes
it more realistic and engaging.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.110
And when done well,
animation can provide useful feedback

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.640
to help inform and educate your users.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.620
When a user creates a new
note in our Notes app,

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.200
we use animation to curl back
the page like a real notepad.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.460
And when a user deletes a note,
the trash lid opens up and the

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.700
page slides into the trash bin.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.480
Not only does this add a
heightened sense of realism,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.700
but it also helps smooth the
transition from one view to another.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.150
In the real world,
objects don't just appear and disappear,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.920
and if you see this in an app,
it can be very confusing.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.070
Animation is also a great way to
acknowledge a user's action and assure

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.180
them that something is happening.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.500
In the iTunes app,
we use animation to let a user know

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.900
when a song preview is being downloaded,
and if they buy a song,

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.690
an animation lets them know
where to find their purchases

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.300
without forcing them to leave the
screen or read a modal dialogue.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.410
So let's take a look.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:12.960
You can see them previewing,
and purchasing, and then downloading.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.700
Unless you're building a game,
it's important that your

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.880
animation is not gratuitous.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.700
The velocity and position of
the animation should directly

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.550
match the user's gesture.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.860
In Keynote, when a user moves a
slide in the Navigator,

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.300
we use animation to let
them know they've got it.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.870
And when they drop it,
the other slides ripple

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.300
away from that area.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.990
And because the animation
follows actual physics,

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.820
it makes the experience
feel very realistic.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.990
And in iBooks,
as your finger slides across the screen,

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.150
the page curls back and directly
tracks the user's movement.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.430
Matching the user's gestures
really makes you feel like you're

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.850
turning a real page in a book.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.360
Be realistic.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.700
If your animation isn't realistic,
it can be distracting

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.370
and confuse your users.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.220
If you flip an item to show settings
like we do in the Weathers app,

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.980
users will associate the
widget with a physical card.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.280
They will assume that there's
only two sides to the card,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.000
and to view the original content,
the card must be flipped back over.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.450
And in the Photos app,
the user can pinch a pile of photos

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.400
to preview what's inside an album.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.770
And the actual photos
expand out while you pinch.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.000
It feels like you're really picking
them up and fanning them out on a table.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.860
You don't see the same photo twice
because that wouldn't be realistic.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:42.780
So to summarize animation:
use animation to smooth transitions

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.900
and give users feedback about
what's going on in your app.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.670
And don't be gratuitous.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.090
The animation should match the
user's gesture as much as possible.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.920
And unless your app's
a game or game-like,

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.220
be realistic.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.560
Animation, when done well,
can make your app much easier to

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.270
use and really bring things to life.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.900
So now I'd like to talk about sound.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.340
It's really a shame that so many
developers forget to consider

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.050
sound when developing their app.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.850
Like animation,
sound can add a heightened sense

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:21.030
of realism to your app and create
a much more memorable experience.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.860
A great audio cue can help
your brain better associate

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.740
an action with its result.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.540
Those are some familiar sounds
to anybody who's used an iPhone.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.180
You want to be careful not to
rely on sound as your only form

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.640
of feedback because the user
may have muted their device.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.460
But when you do utilize
sounds to communicate status,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.450
you're often able to reduce
the visual noise in your UI.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.810
In the real world,
you hear sounds all the time when

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.980
interacting with physical objects.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.920
And when you add sounds to
interactive objects in your UI,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.100
they feel more realistic.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.940
For example, when a user changes a value
in their standard picker UI,

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.470
they hear a click at each setting.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:11.020
This subtle but realistic sound
reinforces the visual concept that

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.900
a user is spinning an actual wheel.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.140
And in the Camera app,
we play a traditional shutter

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.930
sound when a user snaps a picture.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.330
Not only does this make the
action feel more familiar,

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.480
but it provides useful feedback
that a picture was taken and

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.100
it's being saved to the device.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.800
If you're building a game,
sound is an absolute must.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.280
Playing a game without sound is like
watching a movie without a soundtrack.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.830
You can do it, but you won't be able to
build drama and tap into the

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.390
user's emotions the same way.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.590
So this is Angry Birds.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.830
It's one of the most
popular games on iOS,

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.640
and it's been consistently in the
first spot of all paid apps on the

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.670
US App Store for a long time now.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.890
And those of you who have
played Angry Birds know how

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.350
powerful sound design can be.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.180
The background music is catchy,
but it's really the sound effects that

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.890
tease and challenge you to conquer levels
and seek revenge on the green pigs.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.640
So that was Sound.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.530
Don't forget about Sound.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:15.040
Think about how it can be used to provide
feedback and status to your users.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.870
And if it makes sense,
use Sound to reinforce

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.640
interactive concepts.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.730
It's an extremely efficient
way to make your app stand out

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.530
and be remembered by users.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.300
Having clear language is one of
the easiest things you can do

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.040
to make your app more usable.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.380
Yet so many developers gloss
over this area just like sound.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.910
Remember, most users aren't as familiar
with your app's features or the

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.140
technologies that support them.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.220
When using an app that has clear,
natural language,

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.180
you don't even think about the text.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.950
But when you use an app with
ambiguous or overly technical wording,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.800
the first thing that you often say is,
"This app is too complicated."

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.530
An easy tip to remember is to label
buttons by their resulting action.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.770
When you get a text message,
the buttons in the alert are

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:08.150
clearly labeled "Close" and
"View." There's no ambiguity about

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.280
what either of these buttons do,
even if you don't read any of

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.680
the other text in the alert.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.290
If you just label buttons "OK" and
"Cancel" or "Yes" and "No," users will

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.660
always have to read the entire text,
and it will be much easier for them to

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.080
accidentally select the wrong option.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.200
Here's the alert confirmation
sheet for deleting a photo.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.480
Because the buttons are clearly labeled,
the user doesn't need any

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.920
extra text in the sheet.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.960
Just delete photo and cancel.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.400
Nice and clear.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.180
It's also important that the
navigation bars at the top of

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.140
the screen are clearly labeled.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.840
And this is especially helpful if
your app has a deep hierarchy or many

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.950
screens that the user might navigate to.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.520
Avoid placing your logo
at the top of every view.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.160
This is a common mistake a lot of
developers coming from the web make.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.680
Users won't be able to clearly
identify the screen they're on

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.190
and it will get very confusing
as the user navigates around.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.630
There are also a lot
of apps with two bars,

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.180
one for the logo and a second
for the nav bar and back button.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.540
This not only limits the amount
of content that can be displayed,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.200
but it also makes it harder to
navigate in and out of levels.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.020
Remember,
users launch the app from your icon.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.200
They didn't stumble upon the screen
from a search engine or other web link.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.430
And the best branding for your
app is to create an experience

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.170
that's great for your users.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.200
So label your nav bars.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.770
It's also important to label
back buttons by the name of

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.070
the screen that they go to.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.590
Remember,
this is a mobile device and a user

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.020
might have received a phone call
or been distracted by something

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.990
else after getting to this screen.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.860
In these scenarios,
it's really nice to have a visual

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.820
cue of where the user came from.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.610
The fact that it's a left-pointed
button in the upper left corner

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.370
already indicates to users
that it'll take them back,

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.810
so just labeling it with the
word "back" isn't that helpful.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.410
And you want to be clear and
concise with your labels.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.230
It doesn't matter if the full
name of the previous screen

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.000
doesn't fit in the back arrow.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.560
You just need to give users some sort of
clue of where that button will take them.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.540
This is a screen from our iPod app.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.980
Look how we just used the word "more" in
the tab bar and "edit" in the nav bar.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.780
We use these labels in
several of our built-in apps.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.730
There's no need to add extra
words and say "more items" or

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.240
"edit display view." Because these
controls are in a consistent,

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.620
logical place, we're able to have nice,
short labels that tell the

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.880
user all they need to know.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.340
Most users care about getting stuff done.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.900
They aren't as interested in what
technology is used in your app.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.960
So make your language
understandable to your target users.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:50.760
Here in our Settings app,
you can turn Airplane Mode on and off.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.760
And this could have easily
been labeled something like

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.720
Disable Cellular Baseband Radio.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.280
But most users wouldn't
know what that meant.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.320
And also in Settings,
we have Wi-Fi networks.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:07.880
We don't say anything such as 802.11 N,
G, B, or A, or SSID.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.510
Just Wi-Fi networks,
something that all users can understand.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.970
In the Maps app,
we say "drop pin," not "add

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.070
new GPS indicator to map."
Just "drop pin," because that's

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.860
what the interface is doing,
and that's what will

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.480
make sense for users.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.760
And throughout iOS,
we abstract the underlying file system.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.840
We talk about sharing photos or
playing songs or watching videos.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.560
And when we do talk about
files in our Numbers app,

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.320
we simply refer to them as
what they are-- spreadsheets.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.220
Nowhere will a user see a
command like new numbers file or

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:48.660
something labeled untitled.xls,
just spreadsheets or the

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.700
title of the spreadsheet.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:55.000
Remember that the goal is to use
terms that make sense to users.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.600
So that was language.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:02.460
Make sure you have helpful labels
in your buttons and other controls.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.760
And keep it simple and make
the text clear and concise.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.100
Use language that your
users will understand.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.200
These are some simple rules that will
go a long way towards making your app

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.290
easier to understand and to navigate.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.860
So now onto typography.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.820
Once your language is clear,
you need to make sure that the

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.400
actual text is legible and beautiful.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.410
So here we have our built-in mail app.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.800
When you're browsing through
messages in your inbox,

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.760
the thing that you care about
most is who the message is from.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.220
So the sender is listed in big,
bold text.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.100
And as you scroll through messages,
the sender's name

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.290
remains clearly legible.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.680
The message's subject is
right below the sender's name.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.000
And since this information is important,
it doesn't have the same visual weight.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.820
However, it is more important
than the message preview,

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.890
which is a lighter gray text.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.660
If the subject and message
preview were the same color,

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.460
it would be really hard to tell that
there are different bits of information.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.830
But by visually distinguishing them,
there's no need for an extra

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:13.720
text label on each line,
such as subject: or message preview:.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.170
Another alternative would have been
to make the message preview a smaller

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.500
font than the subject or a different
typeface or color altogether.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.620
If we did this, it would be visually busy
and too hard to read.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.560
When there are too many different
typefaces or font sizes in a small area,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.640
the most important text won't stand out.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.000
All this text is left aligned so
as the user browses their messages,

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.500
they can keep their eye in one area and
quickly find what they're looking for.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.420
Proper alignment really helps
make the text easier to read.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.940
When you don't have items aligned,
the user is forced to read every

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.050
word on the page and their eye will
have to zigzag across the screen.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.410
Even though this is a standard list view,
lots of thought and consideration

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.040
went into the design.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.240
When you design your list views and
other screens with lots of data,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.100
spend the time to make sure the
information is organized in a way that

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.680
makes sense and the text is easy to read.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.620
So while the Mail app gives
you a good reference point

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.800
for what we consider legible,
you must adapt type sizes

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.370
for how your app is used.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.590
In the Maps app,
where we display turn-by-turn directions,

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.300
the fonts are much bigger because
we assume the user is on the go.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.000
And in the Stocks app,
the user might be checking their

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.350
portfolio under a table in a
meeting or at a restaurant,

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.480
so you want to make the
text very easy to read.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.260
If the user has to scroll
to see additional items,

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.380
that's fine.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.340
Fitting all the content in one
screen really isn't important.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.680
Scrolling is one of the most
intuitive gestures in iOS,

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.020
and users won't mind scrolling
to see additional items.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.070
However, they'll get quickly frustrated
if they have to squint to read

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.510
something or physically bring
the device closer to their face.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.690
If your app is highly themed,
the typeface should

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.380
match the rest of the UI.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:08.260
In Notes, we use a handwriting font since
the app looks like a real notepad.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:12.090
And using the default Helvetica and
a highly immersive game like Cut the

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.480
Rope wouldn't feel as playful as the
custom font that they've embedded.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.440
But if you saw either of
these fonts in the Mail app,

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.360
they would feel really out of place.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.280
If you do use a custom typeface,
just make sure that all the

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.750
text remains very legible.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:34.400
So those were a few tips to help you
improve the typography in your app.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.440
Make sure the text is easy to
read in all usage scenarios.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.600
And make it appropriate.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:44.240
Good typography and information
design often goes unnoticed,

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.370
but it really makes a huge difference
in the overall beauty of an app.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.000
So remember, screen densities vary.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:55.040
You need to test for legibility
on every device your app supports.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.500
The iOS simulator isn't a good
enough tool to let you know

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.050
whether your text is legible.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.400
So last but not least, we have graphics.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:10.610
One of the best ways to wow your
users is to build rich graphics that

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.080
give a sense of realism to your app.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.040
Take advantage of the fact that
when a user launches your app,

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.320
the iPad or iPhone can turn
into whatever you want it to be.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.260
And when you mimic high-end,
expensive materials,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.880
the perceived value of
your app will go up.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.040
Here we see the built-in Voice Memos app.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:32.680
It's a beautiful studio microphone where
every detail has been paid attention to,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.380
even the light source
and the shadow behind it.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.740
And underneath,
there's even a realistic level meter

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.860
and Chrome buttons to control it.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.680
And you can tap on the
microphone just to test it.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.860
Lots of details were
paid attention to here.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.130
This is the Compass app.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.300
Here you can see some polished
wood and some brass fixtures.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.440
So when you hold it in your hand,
it feels like a real compass as you

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.060
move around in different directions.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:01.060
So here's a metronome app
from Steinway and Sons.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.720
And you can use it to keep track
of the rhythm and tempo when

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.980
you're practicing an instrument.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.130
Because they're using really
expensive looking wood and the bottom

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.840
area looks like a precise tool,
it would feel right at home on top

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.700
of one of their fancy grand pianos.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.520
So this is Hipstamatic.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.700
It's an app that comes with
all sorts of filters to give

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.320
your photos a vintage look.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.540
And their app looks like a real toy
film camera made out of plastic.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.530
On the back, it's even got a film slot,
a flash switch,

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.820
and a viewfinder to compose your shot.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.650
Every pixel was paid attention to here.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.890
This is Notes on the iPad.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.310
Just like the iPhone,
it looks like a real notepad.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.190
But in landscape view,
it's sitting on top of a nice

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.650
executive leather binder.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.500
If there was just a standard
list view on the left side,

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.170
the whole association with a real
world object would be diminished.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.990
When you model your app after an object,
you need to go the full distance

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.940
and make sure every pixel on
the screen feels authentic.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.170
And this is Mathboard,
an app that mimics a classroom chalkboard

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.530
to help students learn basic arithmetic.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.050
They really paid
attention to every detail,

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.970
from the different chalk colors
to the wood trim to the eraser.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.750
And they even left some chalk residue
on the slate to make it really feel

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.460
like you're in a classroom setting.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.530
And here's a really great
app called DJ that looks like

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.350
a real set of turntables.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.830
Right away,
you know how to interact with the app.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.740
The records really spin,
and the fader and level meters are

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.380
right where you'd expect them to be.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.440
This app lets DJs feel right
at home mixing music from their

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.460
iTunes library right on their iPad.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:40.000
So not all apps have real-world
objects to get modeled after.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.240
And depending on what
your app is used for,

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.170
it's not always appropriate.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.040
Still,
your users will appreciate it if you put

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.160
the time into the graphics and layout.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.410
Most of the functionality in
our Weather app could have been

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:56.190
built using standard list views,
but the use of custom graphics

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.370
makes it more useful and engaging.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.130
And many people I know add cities
to their iPhone right when they

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.060
get it just to see the graphics.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.000
And here's a cookie baking
app from Martha Stewart.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.760
This could have easily been a
list or grid view of cookie names.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:17.700
Instead, all of the recipes are showcased
as photos on what their design

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.310
team calls the cookie runway.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.650
And as you swipe in either direction,
you can see more and more cookies.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.480
And when you tap on one,
it zooms up and you can view the recipe.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.310
They've done a great job making
users want to interact with this app.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.430
If you're utilizing Game Center,
try to integrate the leaderboard

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.940
and achievement screens
with the theme of your game.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:45.410
Astronut is a fun arcade game
where you try to jump from planet

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.680
to planet and explore the galaxy.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:51.720
As you can see,
it's got a futuristic space-age UI.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.010
And since the standard green felt
of Game Center would feel really

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.890
out of place inside this app,
they've customized the

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.700
leaderboard and achievements
to fit right in in outer space.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.160
And here's Flight Control on the iPad.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.550
This is an Apple Design Award winning
game where you act as an air

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:11.000
traffic controller and try
to land planes on the runway.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.050
They've incorporated the
Game Center achievements with

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:18.190
the rest of the UI and made it
look like a pilot's logbook.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.060
It's absolutely critical that
your app has a beautiful icon.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.430
Your icon gives users the first
impression of your app and right

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.620
away they'll judge how much
care and consideration you put

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.010
into the overall experience.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.400
On the App Store,
users are much more willing to purchase

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:38.630
and download an app with a better icon
if there are several other similar apps.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.620
Designing an app icon
is a specialized task,

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.850
so I recommend hiring a professional
designer if you don't have the

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.210
proper experience yourself.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.350
The app icon should give users
a clue of what your app does.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.540
It doesn't need to be literal or
even match the UI of the app itself.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.820
It just needs to relate to the general
functionality of what your app does.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.240
Our YouTube icon looks like
an old wooden television set.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.490
And when you see this icon,
you automatically assume that

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.400
it's an app for watching videos.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.360
It doesn't matter that you
watch user-submitted videos

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.400
rather than television programs.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.580
What's more important is that
users associate the graphic with

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.240
a concept they're familiar with.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.220
The iPod app icon shows
a click wheel iPod,

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.250
even though it's really the iPhone
or the iPad that's going to be

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.800
the device playing the music.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.710
However,
the graphic is so recognizable that

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:37.220
it immediately clues the user of
what the app's functionality will be,

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.950
accessing your iPod library.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.470
Most iPhone and iPad users have
downloaded many apps from the App Store.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.900
To stand out on the springboard,
your icon needs to be

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.760
instantly recognizable.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.440
Using bold colors and limiting
the complexity will help make

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.620
sure your app stands out,
even if it's placed inside of a

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.950
folder where a user has to page
between many different screens.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.700
If you use too many shapes
and try to do too much,

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.750
it won't read well at the small size.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.190
Here's the icon for Things.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.830
This is a great task manager app,
and it's also an

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.240
Apple Design Award winner.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.880
The big check is clearly visible,
and it's easy to find when swiping

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.790
through pages of apps on the device.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.680
The bright blue color
matches their app's branding,

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:25.760
and the concept of a check
references a common to-do list.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:30.360
Instagram's icon looks
like an old instant camera.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.740
This is another app that lets users apply
vintage film effects to their photos.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.420
But this app lets you instantly
share the photos with your friends.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:42.190
And their icon uses basic
shapes and has distinct colors,

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:46.930
but doesn't look overly complex,
even though when you look at it closely,

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.490
there's quite a bit of detail inside.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:53.920
Cosmos Spin is a fun and addictive game
where you spin a little character around

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.040
a planet eating all kinds of objects.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.150
And their app icon simply
features the main character.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.570
They didn't try to incorporate all
of the really beautiful artwork

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.290
you see when you play the game.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.970
If they did,
it would be too busy and wouldn't

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.860
read well at the small size.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.870
Instead, it's nice and simple,
and by placing the

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.060
character at a slight angle,
it gives a sense of playfulness.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.660
So that was graphics.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.490
Whatever type of app you're building,
whether it's a serious productivity

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:26.110
tool or an immersive game,
your users will appreciate it

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.860
if you spend the time and effort
to create engaging graphics.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.690
And when it makes sense,
consider adding physicality and

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:37.730
realism to your app so it makes a
great first and lasting impression.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.990
And have a beautiful app icon.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.510
Not only will more
users download your app,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.470
but they'll probably end
up using it more as well.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.080
So in each of these topics,
I covered a lot of material,

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.330
and I want to leave you
with some final thoughts.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.940
Ultimately, your goal should be to
make your app useful,

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.800
intuitive, and beautiful.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.100
And hopefully you can use many
of the tips I went over today

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.490
to get started with this goal.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.180
I've only touched the surface of
designing for iPhone and iPad,

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.090
and there's so much more ground to cover.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.070
The first step for anyone
is to read the iOS HIG.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:16.380
Finally, it's really important to not
sacrifice quality for anything.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:20.560
Every part of your app,
from the feature set, to the text labels,

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.160
to the app icon, needs to be polished.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.560
And the performance needs to be great.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.930
If your app is confusing or
has features that are buggy,

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.130
hold off from releasing it
until these things are fixed.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.170
If you don't address these
issues and instead release

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.180
your app before it's ready,
users won't wait for you

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.850
to fix them with an update.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.740
They'll simply delete your app.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.200
So that's it.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:46.140
I've shared many design tips
to help make your iPhone,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.520
or iPad app, really great.

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:52.560
Be sure to go above and beyond
what your customers expect,

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.550
and do everything you can
to delight and impress them.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.900
Use these tips to design a product
that you're really proud of,

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.520
and that stands out from the crowd.
