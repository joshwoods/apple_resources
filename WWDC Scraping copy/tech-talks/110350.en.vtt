WEBVTT

00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.536
Thank you for joining
our session.

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:05.038
Today, we'd like to provide
step-by-step guidance

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.275
to show you some of the ways
you can manage price changes

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.377
for your auto-renewable
subscriptions

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.779
in App Store Connect.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.749
I'm Bryan and I'm part of
the App Store Monetization team

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.585
based in Cupertino.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.388
App Store Connect provides
many tools to help you manage

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.491
your subscriptions pricing
on the App Store.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:28.128
To name a few examples,
you can use App Store Connect

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:32.132
to create subscription offers
to help you acquire, retain,

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:35.335
and win back customers.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.572
You can also use it to set
the price of your subscription

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.142
across all available
territories.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.812
It gives you the ability to
increase or decrease the price

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.448
of your subscription
for new customers

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.618
as well as manage
price increases for customers

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.087
on preserved pricing.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.589
And today's presentation

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.360
is focused on these
last two capabilities.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.362
Today we'll walk through
the necessary steps

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:06.166
to create and manage
your price increases.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.769
We'll show you how
to remove preserved pricing

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:11.238
from specific cohorts,

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:14.708
how to initiate
a price decrease,

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.311
and finally,
we'll discuss how you can edit

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:21.148
upcoming price changes
before they go live.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:23.617
So let's get started
by simulating the steps

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:26.787
you would take in order
to initiate a price increase

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.990
on your subscription.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.193
This process will begin in
the subscription pricing section

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.462
of App Store Connect,
which can be found

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:39.700
within the details of your
auto-renewable subscription.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.436
Start by clicking
on the plus button.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.372
Then, click on
Plan Subscription Price Change

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.941
from the drop-down menu.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.677
You'll then be prompted
to select the territories

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:53.780
where you want to edit pricing.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.285
Once you've made your selection,
click Next.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.354
You'll then choose the date
you'd like to begin

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:05.826
your price increase, followed
by the currency and new price.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.196
Then, click Next.

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:12.966
Apple automatically calculates
the prices for all territories

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.369
based on your
chosen price point,

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.038
determined by the most recent
foreign exchange rates

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:20.007
and taxation.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.342
However, you still have
the option to set

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.345
different price points
per territory in the event

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:30.183
it's more appropriate to your
services value in those markets.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.185
Once you've completed
your review of pricing

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:35.622
in each region, click Next.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.058
Then, you'll be prompted
with the option

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:42.029
of how to manage pricing
for your current subscribers.

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.033
You can either keep the current
price for existing subscribers

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.835
so that anyone who has
subscribed before the start date

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.805
of the price change
won't be affected,

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:56.943
or apply the new price
to your existing subscribers.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:03:01.281
Let's review that
first scenario more closely.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.483
If you don't want to apply
your price increase

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.386
to your existing subscribers --
for example,

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:10.157
to keep existing customer
commitments or reduce churn --

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:14.895
select Preserve current price
for existing subscribers.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:17.864
Then, click Next.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.167
You'll then be prompted
to review and confirm

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.203
the list of planned
price changes.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.573
Now, let's discuss how you would
apply your price increase

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:29.776
to your existing subscribers.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.112
By selecting
"Apply price increase

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:34.981
to existing subscribers,"
you will have the option

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.151
to apply the price change
to existing subscribers

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.287
who are paying the price
of your subscription

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:42.923
currently displayed
on the App Store.

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:45.592
Any subscribers
on previously preserved prices

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.795
won't be affected.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:52.399
The App Store will automatically
communicate to any customer

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.367
impacted by the price increase

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.703
that a change is
scheduled to occur.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.805
Depending on certain criteria,

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.442
customers will either be
notified or asked to consent

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.579
before renewing
at a higher price.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.815
Customer consent is
required in certain markets

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.817
as well as in scenarios
when large

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.453
or frequent price
increases occur.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:16.723
In the event your price
change meets these criteria,

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:19.726
App Store Connect
will provide an indicator icon

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.928
noting consent is required.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:25.298
Apple will then inform affected
customers through email,

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.268
push notification,
and in-app messaging

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.238
to ask them to agree
to the new price.

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:32.939
You also have
the option to use

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.842
the showPriceConsentIfNeeded()
method

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:40.046
to surface the in-app
consent sheet at specific times.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.149
In the event
of the notification flow,

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:45.252
Apple will send an email to all
customers and provide

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:50.056
an in-app message to customers
on iOS 13.4 and later,

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:53.560
at least 30 days prior
to the price increase.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.563
Then, seven days prior
to the price increase,

00:04:56.563 --> 00:04:59.966
if a customer has not yet viewed
an in-app message

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.235
and has push notifications
enabled,

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:06.072
they will also receive
a push notification on iOS,

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:08.642
iPadOS, and macOS.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.510
The price will then
automatically increase

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.246
on day 30,
unless a customer chooses

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:16.583
to cancel their subscription
before then.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.152
Now jumping back
into App Store Connect.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.454
When choosing to apply
your price increase

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.391
to existing subscribers,
you'll be prompted to select

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:27.994
the regions where you would like
to schedule your price change.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:31.064
Once selected, click Next.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:32.165
As mentioned,

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.468
Apple automatically calculates
the prices for all territories

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:38.004
based on your
chosen price point.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.740
But you again have the option
to set different prices

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.211
for specific territories.

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:50.083
Once you've set any specific
territory prices, click Next.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:51.518
You'll again
be prompted to review

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.721
the list of planned
price changes.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:57.457
And in the event
you want to export the list,

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:01.928
click Export as CSV
in the top right.

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:04.531
And once you're ready
to initiate your price increase,

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.833
click Confirm.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.568
In both scenarios,

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.037
once a price change
has been scheduled,

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:14.040
you'll be able to review it
until it goes into effect,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.043
alongside your current prices.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.813
And you can view details about
your upcoming price change

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:24.150
by clicking on the drop-down
next to the date of the change.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.587
However, note that once
a price change goes into effect

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:32.058
on your scheduled date,
it cannot be edited or undone.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.794
If you initially decide
to preserve prices,

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:39.032
you have the option to undo
this action at a later time.

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:41.668
Now let's talk about how
you would initiate this

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:43.236
in the event
you have subscribers

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.972
on multiple
preserved prices.

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:48.108
Keep in mind that
if you have subscribers

00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:51.278
on multiple preserved prices
in the same territory,

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:53.413
you can only increase
a preserved price

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.049
to the next highest price.

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:59.419
So if you decide to bring all
subscribers on preserved prices

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.422
to the current price,
start with the preserved price

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.258
closest to the current price
and unpreserve it,

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:09.696
then unpreserve the next
highest price, and so on.

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:12.299
Let's take a look at an example.

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.134
This developer
is looking to increase

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:19.072
multiple preserved customer
cohorts to the 3.99 price point,

00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:21.274
which is the price
they currently have displayed

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:24.511
on the store.

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:28.648
They'll start by increasing
the price of their 2.99 cohort

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.751
since it's the closest group
to the current price.

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:35.055
As you can see here,
the new price of 3.99

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:38.892
goes into effect on February 1.

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:41.494
Next, they'll bring
the 1.99 cohort

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:45.365
up to the current price
of 3.99 on March 1,

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:48.435
and all of their customers will
now be paying the same price

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.637
for their subscription.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.006
While this example shows
price increases occurring

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:56.409
on the first of the month,
note that you have the ability

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:00.780
to choose whatever date
works best for your business.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.050
To initiate a price increase
on a preserved cohort,

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.252
click the date
of the price change

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:10.190
that occurred closest
to your current price.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.626
Then, click Edit Price.

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.161
And select the territories

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.798
where you want
to unpreserve the price.

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:21.101
Click Next.

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:25.138
Review the changes
and click Confirm.

00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:27.006
You'll then repeat these steps

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:30.310
for subscribers
on other preserved prices,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.115
starting with the next price
closest to the current price.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:39.719
Now, let's look at how
to plan a price decrease.

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.355
We'll start again in the
Subscription Pricing section

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.758
of App Store Connect.

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:48.461
Click on the plus button,
then click on

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:53.566
Plan Subscription Price Change
from the drop-down menu.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:57.904
Select the territories where
you want to decrease the price.

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:01.708
Once you've made your selection,
click Next.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.942
You'll then choose the date

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:05.178
you'd like to begin
your price decrease,

00:09:05.178 --> 00:09:08.148
followed by the currency
and new price.

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:11.084
Then, click Next.

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:14.053
Again, you'll be prompted
to review the price changes

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:17.891
in each territory and optionally
set different prices

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.592
per territory.

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:21.628
Once you've completed
your review of pricing

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:25.298
in each region, click Next.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.999
You will then be prompted
to confirm

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:31.337
your upcoming price decreases
by clicking Confirm.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.540
In the event that
any current subscribers

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.842
are paying higher
than the new price,

00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:39.913
they will automatically
renew at the lower price.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.248
Your price decrease
will then go into effect

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.184
on the scheduled date.

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.085
Note that if you want
to decrease the price

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.455
of your subscription,
the price will decrease

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:50.957
for all subscribers
and you can't preserve

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:55.328
any higher-priced cohorts.

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:58.765
Let's take a look
at another example.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.267
Here the developer has chosen
to reduce the price

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:06.105
of their subscription
to 99 cents starting on March 1.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.440
Since that price is cheaper

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.510
than all of their existing
pricing cohorts,

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.145
all customers will be
brought down

00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:17.517
to the new price
starting on March 1.

00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:20.186
Finally, let's talk about
how you can edit

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:24.524
your upcoming price changes
before they go into effect.

00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:28.027
If you decide you no longer
need the price change to occur,

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:33.466
click Delete Price Change
or click Edit Price Change

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:37.170
to make your necessary
modifications.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.872
You'll then be able
to make edits

00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:42.108
to the regions where
your price change will occur,

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:44.944
the date your price change
will begin,

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:48.014
and your new
subscription price.

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:50.450
You can also automate
many elements

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:56.489
of subscription price management
with the App Store Connect API.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:11:00.326

And that concludes
today's presentation.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:12.171
We hope this has helped you
understand the necessary steps

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.841
to take when choosing
to initiate a price change

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.709
for your business.
