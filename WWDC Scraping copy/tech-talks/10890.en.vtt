WEBVTT

00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.936
Alexandre Morin: Hello,
my name is Alexandre Morin,

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:04.538
and I'm a senior
consulting engineer

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:07.541
supporting enterprise and
education customers worldwide

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.343
and sometimes just beyond.

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.712
I specialize in device
and content management

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.114
and I'm excited to tell you
about deploying iOS 15

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:18.218
and iPadOS 15
in your environment.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.721
iOS 15 brings new ways
to stay connected,

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.190
powerful tools to help you
focus on tasks,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.758
exciting updates for Maps,

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.194
and new privacy features
improve transparency

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:30.330
and give you more control
over your data.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.200
With iPadOS 15,
it's easier to get things done

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.202
and find and organize
information,

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.071
and multitasking is also
easier to use and discover.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.974
You can now place widgets among
the apps on your Home screen

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.144
and jot down a comment or idea
on any app or screen

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.147
with Quick Note.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:50.550
iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 also
bring updates specifically

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.052
for device management,

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.655
which improve the way you deploy
and manage devices

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:58.292
in an education
or enterprise environment.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:01.929
At WWDC 2021, a number
of sessions brought you details

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.564
on these updates
and new capabilities.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.466
"What's new in managing
Apple devices"

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.835
is a great starting point
for these sessions.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.971
My colleagues Graham
and Nadia introduce you

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.040
to the refreshed device
management experience

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.575
in Settings and essential
new management controls

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.778
like Managed Pasteboard.

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:20.113
In this session, we'll go
through fundamentals

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.216
of deploying iOS and iPadOS
devices at scale

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:29.056
and a few new device management
updates since WWDC 2021.

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.892
The technology underlying
all the management capabilities

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:34.428
we will discuss today
is Mobile Device Management,

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.629
or MDM.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.198
It is a framework we made
available to developers

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.767
to create
device management solutions.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.571
These solutions may differ in
user interface and market focus,

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:49.142
but they all work from the same
set of Apple-defined APIs.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.813
The first key decisions when
bringing iOS and iPadOS devices

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:56.016
into your organization
are the device ownership model

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:58.585
and the connectivity options.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.654
Who owns the device
has a big impact

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:03.890
on the device management
capabilities available to you.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.159
If you choose to purchase
devices and provide them

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.661
to your employees or students,

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.364
you'll have the most complete
set of management capabilities

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.865
for those devices.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.267
You might choose to provide
one to each user --

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.069
referred to as
a one-to-one deployment --

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.572
or devices can be
rotated among users,

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:21.541
which is referred to
as a shared deployment.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.044
If you're instead supporting
user-owned devices,

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:26.680
you'll have a more limited set
of management capabilities

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.417
that provide more control
to the owner of the device.

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:33.453
The second initial decision
is the type of connectivity

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.355
to provide to those devices.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.758
Whether the devices
are organization-owned

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:38.892
or user-owned,

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.861
you may choose
to provide cellular service

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.697
for those devices
in addition to Wi-Fi.

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:46.666
You may even be interested
in a private cellular network

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.736
or an emergency services option.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.073
On iPad, providing cellular
connectivity can transform

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:55.776
the usage patterns
of your employees or students,

00:02:55.776 --> 00:03:00.147
such as with the new iPad mini
which supports 5G.

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:02.282
When deploying
cellular-enabled devices,

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:05.352
you'll need to consider the type
of SIM that will be used:

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:08.789
a physical SIM or an eSIM.

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.223
Unlike physical SIMs,

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:13.260
which are easily removed
and are prone to theft or loss,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.430
eSIMs are software based
and can be locked on the device

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.498
with an MDM restriction.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:21.201
They are also much easier
to deploy at scale

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.071
since they can be installed
on hundreds, thousands,

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.940
or tens of thousands
of devices using MDM.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.242
This is much more efficient
and cost-effective

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:31.645
than physically inserting SIMs.

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:33.647
Another advantage
of eSIM technology

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:37.284
is that you can use MDM
to try out or change carriers

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:40.287
in your environment without
having to get new SIM cards

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:43.023
and physical access
to each device.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.859
Because of these benefits,
eSIMs are ideal

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.031
for deploying large numbers
of cellular-enabled devices.

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.333
Recent iPhone models
support Dual SIM,

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:57.604
which allows you to have
two voice lines active at once.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.940
This could be a business
and a personal line,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.309
or two business lines
with different carriers

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.710
for employees out in the field,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.313
like first responders
or field workers.

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:10.917
Typically, this is enabled with
a physical SIM and an eSIM.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.121
iPhone 13 has support
for dual eSIM,

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:17.858
giving you even more flexibility
in your cellular deployment.

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.827
You can provision one or both
for your users with MDM

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.663
or let users manage
one of those two eSIMs

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.099
as their needs change.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.168
Once you've selected
an ownership model

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:30.036
and device connectivity options,

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:33.874
you need to deploy
and manage these devices.

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:36.543
Since all aspects of your
deployment will be driven

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:39.279
by whether you or the user
owns the device,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.982
we will cover those
two scenarios separately.

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:44.084
First let's review
deploying devices

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:45.852
that your organization
has purchased

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:49.823
and will provide
to the employee or student.

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:51.491
We will cover these four areas,

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.761
which come together to form
a great deployment strategy:

00:04:54.761 --> 00:05:00.934
enrollment, ongoing management,
content, and redeployment.

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:02.135
Let's start with enrollment

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.871
for your
organization-owned devices.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.408
The best enrollment experience
for organization-owned devices

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.877
is Automated Device Enrollment.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.913
It allows for zero-touch
deployment workflows

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:15.782
for your devices.

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.984
Devices going through
Automated Device Enrollment

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.654
are automatically supervised,
which gives you access

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.822
to the entirety
of the management options

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.124
defined by Apple.

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:26.359
This method allows you
to customize enrollment

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.661
based on your needs.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.997
You can display custom branding
or consent text.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.133
You can also secure
the device setup process

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:36.570
using modern authentication
services such as Azure AD,

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.139
Okta, Ping, and others.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.175
Finally you can choose to skip
some setup assistant screens

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.445
including the screens shown
after a software update --

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:46.947
which, I should note,

00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:50.517
will also skip those screens
for any future software updates,

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:54.087
a great feature for
unattended devices like kiosks.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.289
Note that this is
the only enrollment method

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.093
that prevents users
from removing management.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:02.796
This process is all enabled
with a web-based portal

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:05.966
called Apple School Manager
or Apple Business Manager.

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:07.634
The devices you purchase
from Apple

00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:09.603
or authorized resellers
appear there

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:12.939
and can be automatically
assigned to your MDM server.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.375
When your devices are
unboxed and activated,

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.411
this portal will instruct them
to enroll to your MDM

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:22.816
and apply the enrollment
settings you define in MDM.

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.551
If you have devices
that you acquired

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.020
outside of Apple
or authorized resellers,

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.457
you can manually add iPhone,
iPad, and Apple TV devices

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:32.826
to Apple School Manager
or Apple Business Manager

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:35.262
with Apple Configurator 2
on Mac.

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.097
When manually adding devices,

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:39.165
there is a 30-day
provisional period

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.334
during which the user
may opt out

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.470
and remove the device
from management.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.241
After the 30 days expire,
the device is permanently added.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.343
Once the devices are
in Apple School Manager

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:51.845
or Apple Business Manager,

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:54.114
they'll follow enrollment
settings that you've defined

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:55.582
in your MDM.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.751
A one-to-one device
will typically be set up

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.987
by the end user
right out of the box.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:02.722
This is where
the ability to skip

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.759
specific setup assistant screens
makes the setup smoother

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.227
for the user.

00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:09.596
After selecting language
and country,

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.564
enrollment to MDM is integrated

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:15.302
right into the familiar
setup assistant experience.

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:17.737
For a device that will rotate
between users,

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:21.107
you may use enrollment settings
to enable Shared iPad.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.043
This feature enables you
to provide

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:26.112
a personalized experience
to each student or employee

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.447
who uses
the shared device,

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.984
much like they would have
on a one-to-one device.

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:32.519
For all deployment types,

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.820
Apple Configurator 2

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.556
helps to make initial
device-provisioning operations

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.024
smoother and faster.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.460
You can provision dozens
of devices at a time

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.431
without ever having
to touch the glass.

00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:46.733
If you do not have access
to Apple School Manager

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:49.002
or Apple Business Manager
in your area,

00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:51.638
there is an alternative to
Automated Device Enrollment

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.840
which is called
Device Enrollment.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.909
It can allow you to still
be able to deploy

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.346
the devices you own
in a strongly managed way.

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:01.948
To achieve this,
you use Apple Configurator 2

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.085
to enable supervision
on your devices over USB

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:08.321
and use Device Enrollment
to enroll them to MDM.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.423
Both can be done
as a single operation

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:12.258
with Apple Configurator 2.

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.861
You will not benefit
from the lock MDM feature

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.563
that comes with
Apple School Manager

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:18.164
or Apple Business Manager
enrollments,

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.467
but you will still benefit
from most of the features

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:22.402
we're reviewing.

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:24.537
Now that devices
you own are enrolled,

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:27.407
let's talk about
ongoing management.

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:29.909
As we discussed earlier,
MDM management is built

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:34.381
right into the operating system
of every iOS and iPadOS device.

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:37.450
The Settings app makes it clear
to both your users and yourself

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.486
as to the management state
of the device

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:43.423
and what MDM capabilities
are in use.

00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:46.393
Those capabilities can be
classified as payloads,

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:50.563
restrictions, tasks, or queries.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:53.800
Configuration profiles consist
of payloads that load settings

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.003
and authorization information
onto Apple devices.

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:59.606
This automates the configuration
of settings, accounts,

00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:02.275
restrictions, and credentials.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.110
With these different
payload types,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.146
you can enforce
passcode policies,

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:09.082
restrict access to the Camera
in sensitive environments,

00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:10.850
or deploy custom fonts.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.420
Mail, Contacts, and Calendar
account information

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.488
can be configured for users.

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:18.057
Network information like Wi-Fi
and VPN can be set up

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.192
for your devices,

00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:23.496
as well as the certificates
required for those connections.

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:26.399
Some of the most important MDM
payloads for your deployments

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.634
are restrictions.

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:30.303
They allow you to enforce
your security policies

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:34.441
and help users
stay focused on their task.

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.610
Commonly used restrictions
allow you to lock device names,

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.647
disable iCloud services
or the App Store,

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:43.550
which prevents users from
installing third-party apps.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.353
But even then, you are still
able to deploy apps with MDM.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.722
You can even hide or show
any apps you want

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:50.824
on the Home screen,

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:53.693
be they third-party apps
or most system apps.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:56.129
At WWDC we announced
a new restriction

00:09:56.129 --> 00:10:00.366
called Managed Pasteboard that
supplements Managed Open In.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.902
Managed Open In prevents
attachments or documents

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:05.605
from managed sources
from being accidentally opened

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.209
in unmanaged destinations
and vice versa.

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:12.045
For example,
a confidential email attachment

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:16.049
is not allowed to be opened
in a user's personal apps.

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:17.550
And mirroring that behavior,

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.686
you may also prevent
their personal document

00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:24.357
from accidentally entering
the organizational data stream.

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:26.993
We announced
iCloud Private Relay at WWDC

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:28.828
as a way to enhance user privacy

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:32.131
and help users' traffic
stay private.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.133
And new since WWDC,

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.102
we introduced
a supervised restriction

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.505
to allow you to disable
iCloud Private Relay

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:40.006
on your devices.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.742
At the time, we also let
network administrators know

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.611
that they could
restrict this feature

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.813
by returning
a negative DNS response

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.082
for mask.icloud.com.

00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:51.451
Since then,
we added a second host:

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:54.687
mask-h2.icloud.com.

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:58.024
Let's detail a few more
helpful restriction examples.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:01.294
Managing USB pairing
is important for securing access

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:03.463
to a device over
a physical connection

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:05.932
but also to allow access
for IT tasks

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:07.500
like gathering logs.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.403
Historically, IT admins have
used an enrollment setting

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:13.006
to prevent any connections
of USB.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:16.075
This method is deprecated
and there is a more modern

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:18.311
and flexible method
available to you:

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:21.381
the supervised
allowHostPairing restriction.

00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:24.384
With this restriction in place,
only computers that possess

00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:28.621
the same supervision identity
as your iOS and iPadOS devices

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:31.024
will be allowed access over USB.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.993
The main advantage to this
method is that you do not need

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:36.229
to restore devices
to change these settings.

00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:39.866
If you need access,
you're not locked out.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:43.069
Finally, you've likely already
had users ask for help

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:46.072
in clearing their device
passcode after they forgot it.

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:48.741
If the user has restarted
their Wi-Fi-only device

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.411
since the last time
they successfully unlocked it,

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.713
the Wi-Fi credentials
remain encrypted,

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.983
the device is off-network,
and MDM cannot reach it

00:11:56.983 --> 00:11:58.785
to send a clear
passcode command.

00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:02.455
An Ethernet adapter can be
quite useful in this scenario.

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:05.992
If you have previously disabled
USBRestrictedMode,

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:08.962
the Ethernet connection
will be active at this stage

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:10.396
and the clear passcode command

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:13.499
will reach the device
successfully.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:14.767
This is one example

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:17.337
of weighing the security
benefits of a restriction

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:20.239
versus the related
support considerations.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:24.611
Sometimes full lockdown
can be detrimental.

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:27.547
A device enrolled in MDM
can also be administered

00:12:27.547 --> 00:12:30.249
through a number
of direct management tasks,

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:34.487
giving you powerful
remote capabilities.

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:37.657
Management task can take
specific actions on devices

00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:41.628
like installing apps,
remotely wiping a device,

00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:43.596
or installing a software update.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:48.935
Tasks to highlight here are
Lost Mode and Activation Lock.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.638
For locating
lost or misplaced devices,

00:12:51.638 --> 00:12:53.573
you have Managed Lost Mode.

00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:57.477
You use MDM to place a device
directly in Lost Mode.

00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:58.544
During this time,

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:01.547
MDM can collect location
information for the device

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:03.883
or make it emit
an audible alert.

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:06.552
The device is locked
with a customized message

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:09.355
with contact information
for your organization,

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:13.092
so anyone finding the device is
aware that it is being tracked.

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:16.062
And after MDM takes the device
out of Lost Mode,

00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:19.165
the Lock Screen displays
a message informing the user

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:22.468
that this device has been
geolocated and when.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:26.005
Most importantly, Lost Mode
does not require the user

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:29.842
to use iCloud or to grant access
to Location Services.

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:32.178
Actually, Location Services
can be turned off

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.213
and Lost Mode will still work.

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:37.050
The privacy notifications
of Lost Mode strike a balance

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.320
between user privacy
and IT control.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.922
Theft deterrence is made easy

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:46.092
for Apple School Manager or
Apple Business Manager devices

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.695
with device-based
Activation Lock.

00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.064
By leveraging device-based
Activation Lock,

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:53.833
MDM enables or disables
Activation Lock

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.401
directly with Apple's servers

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.537
without the need to interact
with the device

00:13:57.537 --> 00:13:59.605
or a user's iCloud account.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:03.209
For devices you own,
you should use this exclusively

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:06.045
and not allow users
to Activation Lock your devices

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:07.280
with their iCloud account.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.049
If you do let users leverage
user-based Activation Lock,

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.552
MDM can still gather
a bypass code

00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:14.287
and use it to clear
Activation Lock

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:17.957
with a command
sent to the device.

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:19.992
MDM can query
your managed devices

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:21.327
so you can check their status

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:25.198
and ensure they meet
your compliance standards.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.533
The inventory updates
sent to your MDM

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.769
enable you to get the name
of your devices,

00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:32.472
which can also be
remotely set and locked.

00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:34.507
Battery level data
can help you get a sense

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:37.744
of your user's ability to get
all-day battery life,

00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:39.612
and roaming status
can help alert you

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:42.448
to potentially costly
cellular charges.

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.751
And of course, compliance
through passcode requirements

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:46.686
helps ensure that
your devices and data

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:49.722
are secured
with data protection.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.991
Many of your device
management goals are achieved

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:54.794
when your MDM solution
combines a set of restrictions,

00:14:54.794 --> 00:14:57.630
queries, and tasks,
such as in the critical case

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.733
of managing and deploying
software updates.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.402
In "Manage software updates
in your organization"

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:06.005
my colleague Lucy covered
software update management.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.508
Let's review and add
a few additional details

00:15:08.508 --> 00:15:11.744
as you prepare to deploy iOS 15.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.746
When a beta software update
is released,

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.915
you use AppleSeed for IT
to obtain it

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.884
and test it in your environment.

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:20.052
AppleSeed for IT
is a great way to access

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.588
IT-specific release notes
and test plans

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.590
and file direct feedback.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:30.329
Learn more about AppleSeed
for IT in a WWDC 2020 session.

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.965
If you require more time
to validate the software update

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.667
in your environment
than the beta cycle,

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:37.436
you can defer updates
for up to 90 days.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:38.905
On iOS and iPadOS,

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.174
all updates have
the same deferral value

00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:42.208
applied to them.

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:44.377
Deferral means that updates
that would otherwise

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:47.413
be shown to the user in Settings
are instead hidden

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:50.283
until the deferral window
expires.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:53.519
Deferral does not affect
the ability to update a device

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.088
using MDM commands,
Apple Configurator 2,

00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:57.557
or the macOS Finder.

00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:00.126
You can use MDM
to install the latest OS

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:03.863
or a specific OS version
on your supervised devices,

00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:07.466
even while the deferred update
is hidden from the user.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:11.771
And new since WWDC 2021,
you can now defer beta updates

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:14.907
to test your deferral workflow
during the beta cycle

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:18.077
instead of needing to wait
for a public release.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:19.745
When you're ready
to update devices

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.948
and you send an MDM
install command,

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:24.483
the device prompts the user
with the update

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:28.087
and describes it as required
by your organization.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:31.691
All updates sent by MDM
are treated as required updates

00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:35.328
and can only be delayed
by the user up to three times.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.663
After the third time
the user delays,

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:40.132
the device will require
the user to update

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:42.501
in order to continue
to use the device

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:45.304
with the exception
of emergency calling.

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:47.440
Any update on a device
with a passcode

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.944
requires the user to enter it
for authorization.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.780
Starting with iOS and iPadOS 15,

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.184
users running iOS
and iPadOS 14.5 and later

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.786
may now see
the option to choose

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:02.922
between two software update
versions.

00:17:02.922 --> 00:17:06.092
This allows users to update
to the latest version of iOS

00:17:06.092 --> 00:17:08.995
and iPadOS 15
as soon as it is released.

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:12.765
Or they can continue on iOS
and iPadOS 14

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.534
and still get important
security updates.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:18.971
The choices will be available
for a period of time.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:21.407
MDM can control
which options are offered

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.643
with the new
RecommendationCadence key

00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:24.844
in the Settings command.

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:26.746
And of course,
these update options

00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:31.584
will respect the software update
deferral window you have set.

00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:33.619
With a RecommendationCadence
of 0,

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:36.088
the user is presented
with the option to update

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:40.159
to iOS 14 or iOS 15 releases.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.328
With a RecommendationCadence
of 1,

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:44.430
the user is only presented
the option to update

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.199
to iOS 14 releases.

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.402
And with a RecommendationCadence
of 2,

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.570
the user is only presented
the option to update

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.639
to iOS 15 releases.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:58.444
In each case, any deferral
policy you set is respected.

00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:00.746
While your MDM solution
works to add support

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:02.114
for these update options,

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:05.584
you may also be able to send
a custom command provided here

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:09.655
to set the RecommendationCadence
on your devices.

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:12.358
I mentioned Shared iPad before
and wanted to give you

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:14.060
a little more detail
on what to consider

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.896
when enabling Shared iPad.

00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:19.799
Users sign in with the
Managed Apple ID that you create

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:22.234
in Apple School Manager
or Apple Business Manager,

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.337
If you're
an education organization,

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:26.872
you can sync with
your student information system

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:29.742
to automatically create
the Managed Apple IDs,

00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:32.745
or if you use
Azure Active Directory,

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:35.581
you can federate to leverage
existing credentials.

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:37.616
For users without credentials,

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:40.252
temporary session provides them
a way to log into Shared iPad

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:41.954
and leave no data behind.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.023
Shared iPad works
with content caching,

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:45.391
which we'll describe soon

00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:48.127
when we review
getting content on the device.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.096
You can also use
tethered caching

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:52.465
where a Mac is providing
content caching

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.967
and Ethernet connectivity
over USB

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.936
to a cart of
Shared iPad devices,

00:18:56.936 --> 00:18:58.804
offloading your Wi-Fi network

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:02.074
from app and iPad OS
update traffic.

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:04.410
Now that your devices
are enrolled and managed,

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.313
let's look at deploying content.

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.682
You'll provide apps and books
to your employees or students

00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:12.218
using Apple School Manager
or Apple Business Manager,

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:15.721
where you obtain
content licenses.

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:19.458
You can purchase licenses
for third-party App Store apps,

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:22.194
books from Apple Books,
and custom apps.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:24.230
Custom apps are made
specifically for you

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.799
by internal
or external developers,

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.934
only you can purchase them
in Apple School Manager

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:30.403
or Apple Business Manager,

00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:31.871
and these apps
are hosted by Apple

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:36.542
but they're not available
to the general public.

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:40.479
Apple provides both device-based
and user-based app distribution.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.481
For organization-owned devices,

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:45.051
you should use
device-based app distribution.

00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:48.521
Once you acquire the licenses,
you use MDM to assign

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.757
and distribute apps
directly to a device.

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:54.560
This does not require you
to configure an Apple ID

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.097
on each device or send
an invitation to each user.

00:19:58.097 --> 00:20:00.466
You maintain full ownership
of the app licenses

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.368
and can revoke them
from the device

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.837
and reassign them
to different devices.

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:09.208
To provide your users
with a great experience

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.910
and reduce network slowdowns,

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.245
enable content caching
on your network.

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:15.714
This service is built
into macOS

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:19.952
and allows you to cache commonly
downloaded assets locally.

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:22.988
You can cache assets
such as App Store apps,

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:25.958
books, or iCloud content,
which is helpful

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.994
when Shared iPad
is syncing user content.

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:31.664
And perhaps the most helpful
is the ability

00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:34.066
to cache software updates
for when MDM

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:37.069
or users update devices
on your network.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.172
To have a successful
and scalable

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:42.441
one-to-one deployment,
limit the number of apps

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:45.177
deployed initially
to one or a few.

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:48.247
This way, you provide initial
access and productivity

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:51.584
quickly for your users
while giving them control

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.153
of installing additional apps
on their device

00:20:54.153 --> 00:20:55.788
as the need arises.

00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:58.791
This also moves the majority
of your app deployment traffic

00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:00.559
out of band,
distributing that traffic

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:03.662
over time
and different networks.

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:05.197
For Shared iPad deployments,

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:07.566
user-driven app installs
are not recommended.

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:10.669
You want to install all apps
to all Shared iPad devices

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:14.006
and then use the MDM
show/hide apps payload

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:17.042
to tailor the app selection
for the needs of each user,

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.544
based on group membership.

00:21:18.544 --> 00:21:21.647
This avoids delays caused
by the need to install apps

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:24.116
each time users log in.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.685
Now that you know how to manage
content for your devices,

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:29.622
let's review how to redeploy
or repurpose devices.

00:21:31.257 --> 00:21:33.626
When redeploying
or repurposing devices,

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.861
you want to ensure that
your organization's data

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:38.631
and user data are
securely erased.

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:41.367
With the device in hand,
you or the user can use

00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:43.569
the Erase All Content
and Settings option

00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:46.405
in Settings to obliterate
all of the encryption keys,

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.607
rendering all user data
on the device

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.709
cryptographically inaccessible.

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:53.646
It's an ideal way to be sure
all personal information

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:56.715
is removed from a device before
giving it to somebody else,

00:21:56.715 --> 00:22:00.719
returning it for service,
or turning it in for an upgrade.

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:03.489
This can also be done
using Apple Configurator 2,

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:07.426
the macOS Finder,
or the remote wipe MDM command.

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:10.763
So far, we've reviewed
four key areas of deployment

00:22:10.763 --> 00:22:13.265
for devices that
your organization purchases

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:15.901
and provides to employees
or students.

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:18.370
You may instead need to manage
user-owned devices

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.805
or have a mix of both.

00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:22.508
Let's examine these same
four deployment phases

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:24.843
for user-owned devices.

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:28.447
As before, it starts
with enrollment.

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:31.383
For user-owned devices,
there's User Enrollment.

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:33.586
User Enrollment is
designed specifically

00:22:33.586 --> 00:22:36.455
for when employees or students
bring their own devices

00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:38.624
to use inside your organization.

00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:41.126
You use User Enrollment
to protect the privacy

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:43.429
of personal data
while still securing

00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:46.899
your organization's data
on the device.

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:49.935
My colleagues Timm and Melissa
introduced major improvements

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:52.805
to the onboarding
and authentication capabilities

00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:53.973
of User Enrollment

00:22:53.973 --> 00:22:56.442
in the "Discover account-driven
User Enrollment" session

00:22:56.442 --> 00:22:58.544
at WWDC21.

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:00.713
Let's go over the basics
of User Enrollment

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:04.183
and add some more details
to that session's great content.

00:23:04.183 --> 00:23:06.652
User Enrollment requires
Managed Apple IDs.

00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:09.455
These IDs are owned and managed
by the organization

00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:11.357
and provide access
to Apple services

00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:12.658
such as iCloud.

00:23:12.658 --> 00:23:14.760
You can use federation
or SIS sync

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.629
to provide these
to your users.

00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:18.931
In User Enrollment,
Managed Apple IDs are used

00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:21.166
in addition
to a personal Apple ID.

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:24.536
Managed and unmanaged apps
use the correct iCloud account

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:25.537
automatically.

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:28.440
Data separation ensures
your data and the user's

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.742
are isolated from each other

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:33.979
in distinct, cryptographically
separated APFS volumes.

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:36.749
In iOS and iPadOS 15,
there are new updates

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:38.984
to User Enrollment that make it
better than ever

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:41.153
to support personal devices.

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:43.188
Much like in Automated
Device Enrollment,

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:46.325
where we leverage the familiar
setup assistant experience,

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:49.295
iOS 15 and iPadOS 15
use a similar approach

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:51.730
to streamline
the User Enrollment process.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.433
Users are used to setting up
accounts and settings,

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.403
so initiating User Enrollment
will be intuitive for them.

00:23:58.904 --> 00:24:01.907
If you are unable to provide
Managed Apple IDs to your users,

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:04.209
or do not have access
to Apple School Manager

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:05.544
or Apple Business Manager,

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.880
another option for enrolling
user-owned devices

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.348
is Device Enrollment.

00:24:09.348 --> 00:24:11.583
This enrollment type offers
less user privacy

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.453
than User Enrollment,
so users may be more careful

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:16.689
in their decision
to enroll to your MDM

00:24:16.689 --> 00:24:18.290
on their personal devices.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.559
When given the option
between the two,

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.895
choose User Enrollment.

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:26.065
Once your users have chosen
to enroll their personal devices

00:24:26.065 --> 00:24:27.032
to your MDM,

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:29.735
you then have a specific set
of management capabilities

00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:31.937
available to you.

00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:34.406
User Enrollment management
capabilities are curated

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:37.242
specifically for BYOD,
so you can configure

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:39.311
your corporate accounts
and VPN settings,

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:41.847
and you may require passcodes
on the user's device,

00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:44.083
but the policy may not
require very long

00:24:44.083 --> 00:24:46.251
and overly complex passcodes.

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.653
You can deploy managed apps

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:50.656
but cannot take over
a user's own apps.

00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:52.858
With these capabilities,
you can get details

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:55.994
about MDM-installed apps
but not about personal apps.

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:58.097
You cannot access
personal information,

00:24:58.097 --> 00:24:59.498
a user's location,

00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:02.034
or remotely wipe
the user's entire device.

00:25:02.034 --> 00:25:04.903
But you do have the ability
to remove your organization's

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:07.306
apps, accounts,
and data at any time.

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:09.942
This is how User Enrollment
balances user privacy

00:25:09.942 --> 00:25:12.678
with the need
to secure your data.

00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:14.980
User Enrollment fully supports
Managed Open In

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.082
so you benefit from
the same strong

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:18.751
data flow management
capabilities

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:21.186
offered on
organizational devices,

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.188
including the new
Managed Pasteboard

00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:25.591
to help users avoid
mistakenly moving data

00:25:25.591 --> 00:25:27.926
across the Managed Open In
boundaries.

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:31.630
User Enrollment allows
the user to log in

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.965
with their personal Apple ID

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:34.933
alongside their
Managed Apple ID.

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:37.503
So encourage users
to enable Find My

00:25:37.503 --> 00:25:40.973
for them to personally manage
a lost or misplaced device.

00:25:40.973 --> 00:25:43.008
And the same goes
for Activation Lock.

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:45.144
They own the device
and they control the keys

00:25:45.144 --> 00:25:47.479
to locking their device.

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.114
Those were
the management capabilities

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:51.083
that you get with
User Enrollment.

00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:54.853
Let's discuss content
deployment for these devices.

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:57.990
As with the devices you own,
you can purchase licenses

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.292
in the apps and books section
of Apple School Manager

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:02.628
or Apple Business Manager.

00:26:02.628 --> 00:26:04.496
For organization-owned devices,

00:26:04.496 --> 00:26:06.932
you have device-based
app distribution;

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:09.568
for User Enrollment devices,
you assign licenses

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:12.704
to the user's
Managed Apple ID.

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:14.640
The user will need
to approve the installation

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.909
on their device,
but as the Managed Apple ID

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:20.045
and licenses are from the same
Apple School Manager

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:21.380
or Apple Business Manager,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.016
there are no additional
Terms and Conditions prompts.

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:26.585
You still retain full ownership
of the app licenses

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:29.254
and can reuse them at will.

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.123
To help with getting
a key app installed

00:26:31.123 --> 00:26:32.958
on your user-owned devices,

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:36.528
at WWDC21, we announced
Required App.

00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:39.364
If you have one app that you
want to ensure is installed --

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:41.400
like an app catalog
or a VPN app --

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.235
Required App allows you
to specify

00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:45.838
that you would like it
to be installed silently

00:26:45.838 --> 00:26:47.606
on these unsupervised devices,

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:51.143
and this also works
with custom apps.

00:26:51.143 --> 00:26:53.679
And to keep key
managed apps installed

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:55.581
on user-enrolled devices,

00:26:55.581 --> 00:26:57.616
you can mark them
as nonremovable.

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.017
The user will be alerted

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:01.153
when attempting
to remove these apps.

00:27:01.153 --> 00:27:04.122
Consider this for self-service,
MDM-agent apps,

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:06.558
or other critical apps

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:09.495
and to complete the deployment
for user-owned devices,

00:27:09.495 --> 00:27:12.798
or scenarios such as when users
are upgrading their device

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:15.501
or leaving the organization.

00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:17.703
Whatever the reason,
there will come a time

00:27:17.703 --> 00:27:20.272
where user-owned devices
will need to be removed

00:27:20.272 --> 00:27:21.373
from management.

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:23.675
The user can process
this unenrollment themselves

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:25.410
on their device in Settings.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.314
You can also process
this unenrollment using MDM.

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:32.017
Additionally, a device being
repurposed might be erased

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:34.019
with Erase All Content
and Settings,

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:36.154
Apple Configurator 2,
or Finder,

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:38.290
which will effectively
unenroll the device.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.360
If the employee or student is
instead moving to a new device,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.896
only their personal data
will be migrated.

00:27:43.896 --> 00:27:45.564
Once their new device is set up,

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:48.267
they will proceed to do
a fresh MDM enrollment on it,

00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:51.570
and they are back up
and running.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.472
We've now covered
the four key areas

00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:57.276
for both organization-owed
and user-owned devices.

00:27:57.276 --> 00:27:59.645
Now let's review some resources
that may be helpful

00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:03.682
in your iOS and iPadOS 15
deployment.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:06.818
As a reminder, AppleSeed for IT,
which we covered earlier,

00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:08.520
allows you to access
and download

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.757
prerelease Apple software
for testing in your environment,

00:28:11.757 --> 00:28:13.692
includes detailed test plans,

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:15.227
and puts your feedback
submissions

00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:18.997
into a dedicated queue
for enterprise and education.

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:21.266
Apple School Manager and
Apple Business Manager guides

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:24.903
are available to help you manage
users' devices and content.

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:27.039
The Apple Device
Deployment Reference

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:29.975
is a technical document on
the topics we covered today

00:28:29.975 --> 00:28:32.644
and supporting information
about MDM, infrastructure,

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:34.880
and services integration.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.848
The Apple Platform Security
documentation

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:39.418
provides security information
about all software,

00:28:39.418 --> 00:28:42.321
hardware, and services
across the Apple platforms.

00:28:42.321 --> 00:28:44.856
And the AppleCare
Professional Support website

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:46.258
hosts program information

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:48.694
for each of the AppleCare
OS support offerings

00:28:48.694 --> 00:28:51.196
for IT departments
and IT help desks,

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:53.899
including AppleCare
for Enterprise.

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:56.635
We're excited to see you
successfully deploy iOS

00:28:56.635 --> 00:28:58.570
and iPadOS in your environment.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.572
Thank you for watching.
