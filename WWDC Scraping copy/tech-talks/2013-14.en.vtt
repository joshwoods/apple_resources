WEBVTT

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.720
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.940
My name is Alex Rofman.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.540
I hope everyone's having
a great day today.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.710
I manage a team of people back
in Cupertino whose responsibility

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.750
it is to help you as developers
be successful on the App Store.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.020
So I'll kick off our lunchtime
session today with some tips

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.000
and tricks to help you do so.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.950
And then I'll pass it
off to my colleague,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.180
Steve McGuigan, who will talk to you
about marketing your apps.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.370
And then our colleague, Shannon Bruce,
will conclude the session with some

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.440
tips and tricks on iTunes Connect.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.530
So let's get started.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.630
First thing I want to cover
is a quick business update.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.980
2013 has been a tremendous
year for the App Store.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.540
In May,
the 50 billionth app was downloaded.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.730
And then October,
just a short while ago at our iPad event,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.030
we announced that our 60
billionth app has been downloaded,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.590
nearly half of which happened
in the prior 12 months.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.550
So there's tremendous momentum
behind the App Store business.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.780
In June,
at our annual developers conference,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.340
we announced that $10 billion
had been paid out to developers.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.300
And then again,
at our iPad event in October,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.820
we announced that that total
had grown to $13 billion.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.300
And this is probably the statistic we're
most proud of for a number of reasons.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.370
First, none of the competitive platforms
out there have announced a single

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.800
figure about how much you as
developers are making distributing

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.610
your apps on their platforms.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.190
So this is something that
we're extremely proud of,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.690
as I said.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.050
and we hope you are as well.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.440
And then lastly, the App Store celebrated
its fifth birthday in July.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.560
I joined the team in July of 2009.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.360
That was 59 billion downloads ago and
billions and billions of dollars ago.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.080
It's really incredible to think that this
business is only five years old and we

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.800
hope you're as excited as we are about
what the next five years might bring.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.810
The App Store has more
than 575 million accounts,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.140
most of which are tied to credit cards.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.820
This offers you unprecedented
opportunity to acquire

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.400
customers from around the world.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.710
The catalog, we're proud to say,
now stands at more than one

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.310
million apps with thousands
more added on a weekly basis.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.680
475,000 of those apps are made for the
beautiful larger palette of the iPad.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.850
Taking a look at the
App Store catalog by content type,

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.560
you see that 54% of apps
available are iPhone only,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.040
13% of apps available are iPad only,
and 33% are universal apps,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.030
where one download works on
all of a customer's devices.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.770
The catalog is tremendously active with
more than 90% of all apps available

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.330
being downloaded on a monthly basis.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.200
And there's tremendous velocity
in this business with more than

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.950
800 apps downloaded per second.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.760
That means at the end of
our 90 minute session here,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.960
nearly four and a half million apps will
have been downloaded from the App Store.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.740
Tremendous, tremendous velocity.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.550
So that's the business update.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.940
The next thing I'd like to cover
is an overview of the App Store so

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.120
that everybody understands how the
business is structured and managed.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.960
First,
the App Store is a global business.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.220
We're in 155 countries around the world,
but this is not just about

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.470
a distribution footprint.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.920
This is also about a revenue opportunity.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.940
61% of Apple's revenue comes
from outside the United States,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.320
and this is a vastly different
percentage than from when

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.460
before the App Store launched.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.200
We have hand-curated stores across the
world that accept local currency and

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.540
are programmed in the local language.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.930
Here's our North and
South American stores.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.440
There's an additional grouping
of Latin American countries.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.730
Here's our stores in Europe.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.290
There's also a grouping here of
additional European countries.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.720
And lastly,
our stores in the Asia Pacific region,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.390
and there's a grouping there that
covers additional Asian countries.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.460
And our mission as a global
team is to help our customers.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.690
And our mission as a global team is
to help our customers find great apps.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.910
And this is a mission that we
feel grows in importance as the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.800
catalog grows and as the number of
customers in the App Store grows.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.710
And as I said, the way we do that is by
hand-curating the App Store.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.340
Here's a couple pages from the App Store.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.330
On the left, you see the featured page.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.470
On the center, you see the recently
launched kids category page,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.890
which is one of 24
categories in the App Store,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.800
many of which are
hand-curated around the world.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.060
And on the right,
you see the design for iOS 7 collection.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.170
And on the left,
you see the latest version

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.880
of iOS 7 collection,
which is one of dozens and dozens

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.020
of thematic or seasonal collections
that have all the apps that you

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.400
might need for a particular topic.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.470
On the iPad, the same curation,
just more real estate

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.120
for more great apps.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.400
On a weekly basis,
our editors around the world are choosing

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.490
the best apps and the best games and
denoting them as editor's choice.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.870
Here's a couple recent selections.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.660
And the last bit about curation
that I'd like to cover is our

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.560
weekly free app of the week program.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.670
Every week, a well-localized, paid,
universal app is made available

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.810
for free for our customers to
download all over the world.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.640
Apple waves its royalties
for this program.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.520
The developer waves their
royalties for this program.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.030
And our customers have shown they
absolutely love getting free access

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.820
to a great piece of paid content.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.680
Here's three additional
screenshots from the App Store.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.430
A charts page on the left,
the recently launched popular

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.190
Near Me page in the center,
and a search results page on the right.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.680
These pages are not
curated on the App Store.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.270
The business has been around for
five years and we work with thousands

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.790
and thousands of developers and
not a week goes by that we don't

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.790
get the question from a developer,
how do I improve the placement of my app

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.170
in search results or how do I get my app
to show up in the popular Near Me page.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.800
Well, while keywords can have an
influence in where your app

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.340
shows up in search results,
the most important thing that you as

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.640
a developer can do is build a great
app that our customers love and the

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.770
algorithms will take care of the rest.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.640
So I want to conclude this part of
my presentation with an overview

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.240
of the App Store editorial process.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.840
First and foremost,
our selections are based on

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.120
quality and quality alone.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.230
We do not accept money for paid
placement in the App Store.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.640
We've never accepted a single penny
and we have no plans to do so.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.820
The process of choosing apps to feature
is separate from the app review process.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.580
Apps are approved or rejected based
on their adherence to our publicly

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.590
available App Store review guidelines.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.930
Just because your app is approved,
however, does not mean that your

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.220
app will be featured.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.100
We consider apps from all 24 categories
with a particular focus on new apps or

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.130
evergreen apps with significant updates.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.640
And then lastly,
while newly approved apps are added

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.280
to the store on a continual basis,
new featured content is published

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.930
by our team on a weekly basis,
typically Thursdays Pacific time.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.520
So that's the App Store overview.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.790
The next thing I'd like to dig
into are some best practices

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.660
to help you be successful.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.270
And the first one we'll talk
about is your App Store presence.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.120
This is your app name, your icon,
your screenshots, your description,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.800
and your keywords.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.910
These are things that if you're
heads down in development

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.170
are very easy to overlook,
but they're not difficult to do well

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.170
with a little time and attention.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.990
So to help explain what I mean here,
let's use the popular music

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.060
identification app Shazam as an example.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.130
First, the name Shazam.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.960
It's unique, it's short, it's memorable,
and there's no keywords or

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.140
descriptives attached to their name.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.330
And the icon,
it's beautifully designed and

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.460
instantly recognizable by a
user on their home screen.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.300
Next, let's take a look at Shazam's
current screenshots in the App Store.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.210
Your screenshot should tell a story and
you should avoid distracting graphics or

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.080
text overlaid on top of your screenshots
because your App Store presence is in

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.090
many ways your first introduction to our
customers of your brand and your product.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.130
So Shazam, their first screenshot.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.760
Identify music in as
little as one second.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.060
It's very clear, it's very concise,
and it gives the core function.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.280
It explains the core
function of your app.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.550
It's the core function of
the Shazam app to customers.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.330
The next screenshot shows you what a song
looks like after it's been identified.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.280
You see the artist name,
you see the track title,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.900
you see the artwork,
and you see a download on iTunes link.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.920
The last two screenshots for Shazam
point out important features of the app.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.980
The explore screenshot with the
thumbnails overlaid on top of

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.140
the map indicate that users can
find popular tracks by region,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.900
and on the right,
real-time top tracks indicate that

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.000
users can find popular tracks by region.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.730
It's self-explanatory.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.100
Explain to the user that they
can discover tracks popular

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.390
across the entire Shazam system.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.140
So next, let's take a look at
Shazam's app description.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.700
Shazam recognizes music and
media playing around you.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.000
Tap the Shazam button to
instantly match and then explore,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.160
buy, and share.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.350
You can Shazam as much as you want.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.680
So this is taken from Shazam's
product page in the App Store.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.580
And you can see it's
optimized for device,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.540
where our customers shop.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.870
App Store customers are not
shopping on the desktop.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.840
They're shopping on the iPhone,
the iPod Touch, or the iPad.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.480
And it's clear and concise.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.060
They avoided listing all the
accolades that their app has received.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.880
And they take advantage of those
first three or four lines to explain

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.100
in simple terms what their app does.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.140
Next, let's take a look at some keywords.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.630
I can't share with you exactly
what Shazam's keywords are

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.330
because they're confidential,
but let's look at some sample

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.600
keywords for a music app to help
you understand the difference

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.470
between bad keywords and good ones.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:25.470
So, music, music discovery, track, song,
album, albums, and iTunes.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.340
These are not very good keywords.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.530
So, first, music.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.020
If you don't need the category name
that your app resides in as a keyword.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.320
Next,
you see album and albums are repeated.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.980
Our system handles plural.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.650
So, by inputting album as a keyword,
we would cover albums.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.500
And then iTunes is not a good keyword
for Shazam because it's only okay

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.880
to use the name of a third party in
your keywords if your app uses an

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.100
API provided by that third party.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.560
So here's a much stronger set
of keywords for a music app.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:04.370
Artist, album, song, track, discovery,
new, streaming, and lyrics.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.870
So that's your App Store presence.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.730
Your name, your icon, your screenshots,
your description, and your keywords.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.680
Again, these are not things
that are hard to do well.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.810
You just need to give them
a little time and attention.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.560
So next, business model.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.580
How do you choose the right
business model for your app?

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.110
The first thing I want to talk
about is build a universal app.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.400
And I can imagine that
you might be questioning,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.100
well, isn't this a product decision?

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.240
How is this a business decision?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.380
Well, it's absolutely a business
decision for a number of reasons.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:38.690
First, our customers love the convenience
of being able to download one binary

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.490
that works on all of their devices,
as shown in this animation here.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.510
And looking back at the pie chart,
breaking down the

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.690
App Store catalog by content type,
while we see growth in

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.250
all of the key metrics,
catalog size,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.900
downloads and sales for iPhone apps,
iPad apps and universal apps,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.880
by far we see the highest
growth for universal apps.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.130
And the data shows that customers
are not inclined to purchase two

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.900
separate versions of the same product.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.160
So next, choosing the right business
model for your product.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.070
So there's not a single prescription
that I can stand up here and say that

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.500
applies to everybody in this room,
every product that you're building.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.360
But I want to leave you with
some key takeaways that will

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.000
help you make a good decision.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.660
So here are three of the
potential business models

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.260
available to you in the App Store.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.590
On the left you see free apps,
which are typically ad supported

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.000
or support external services
like brick and mortar stores.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.640
We see a lot of developers
taking their ad supported app and

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.000
adding a remove ads in app item.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.150
And the key takeaway here is
that does not make your app

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.000
a freemium business model.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.560
I'll spend some time talking about
freemium in just a few minutes,

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.790
but just keep that in mind.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.000
Next we have traditional paid apps.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.940
There's a lot of chatter in the
blogosphere these days that the market

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.000
for paid apps on the App Store is dead.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.430
And I can tell you as someone who
looks at this data every single day,

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.500
that's completely not true.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.400
Paid apps still represent
a very significant portion

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.970
of the App Store business.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:16.000
There's no shortage of customers who
are willing to pay for the premium

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.140
experience and actually prefer
the premium experience where they,

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.030
for a single purchase price,
they get your entire app's

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.500
features and content.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.930
And then lastly we have
what we call Paymium.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.690
Paymium is a model where the parent
app is paid and there are in-app

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.250
skews for additional features,
content, services that give you an

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.440
opportunity for ongoing monetization
after that initial purchase.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.000
Paymium is an excellent model,
especially for those developers

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.480
who've been asking for a path to
paid upgrades from the App Store.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.230
So next I want to spend some
time talking about freemium.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.650
Freemium is a big buzzword in
the App Store world these days.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.730
Lots of press written about it.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.650
And I want to give you some key
takeaways to make sure you make the

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.680
right decision if freemium is the
model that you're going to pursue.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.800
So let's start with the definition.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:11.440
Freemium is a business model where a
product or service is provided for free,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.050
but money is charged
for advanced features,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.510
functionality, or virtual goods.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.600
So to my point about a remove
ads in app skew in your free app,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.830
that would not classify
as a freemium app.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.600
Freemium is a model that's been used by
a lot of developers who've seen success

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.680
with it from media distribution apps,
newsstand apps, social and dating apps,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.500
and business productivity and finance
apps like the ones you see here.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.760
But there's no pot of gold at
the end of the freemium rainbow.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.810
It is not the right model for
every product in the App Store.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.100
And if you look at the breakdown
of the catalog by business model,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.080
you can see that nearly 90% of apps
available in the store are free.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:06.230
And if you look at the breakdown
of the catalog by business model,

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:18.150
you can see that nearly 90% of apps
available in the App Store have a

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.080
business model that is not freemium.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.080
And I'm sure many of you spend a lot
of time in the App Store and you see,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.080
particularly on the top grossing charts,
there are a lot of freemium games in

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.080
particular on the top grossing charts.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.080
But what you don't see
are all the well-made,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.080
highly rated products that
chose the wrong business model,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.080
freemium in particular,
and never made it to the charts.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.080
So my goal here, again,
is to help you make the right

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.080
decision for your product.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.800
And we've come up with a free,
framework that involves three questions

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:55.060
that you should consider as you assess
whether freemium is right for you.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.060
So first, what are your target
market's expectations?

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.060
What I mean by this is don't try to
fit a square peg into a round hole

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.060
from a business model perspective.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.060
Don't have a business model
that's inconsistent with what

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.060
your target market might expect.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.060
So let's take an aviation app,
for example.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.060
If you're building an app to
replace the heavy briefcases,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.240
that pilots have been carrying
onto planes for decades,

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:02.550
the pilot's expectation is that
they're not going to be prompted to

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.280
pay for every different route or every
different emergency procedure or every

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.080
time there's an update to the content.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.480
The expectation of a pilot for
that type of app is they'll pay

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.020
one price and they will get full
access to all of the content,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.160
features, and services in that app.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:25.040
In contrast,
if you're building a cloud storage app,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.900
there is a target market expectation
for users of cloud storage services that

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:35.040
some amount of storage and some basic set
of features will be available for free.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.310
And if you use that storage up or
you want more comprehensive features,

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.760
you'll be prompted to pay.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.780
So there is a freemium model
does fit with the expectations of

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.630
users of cloud storage services.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:55.020
So as we walk through this framework,
I want to also walk through the funnel,

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.020
the download funnel for freemium apps.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.340
So at the top of the funnel,
you have downloads.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.100
Being free will not make
everybody in the world,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.690
every single app store customer,
download your app.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.970
But it may expand your reach
within your target market.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.680
The second piece of the framework is,
can you segment the experience

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.980
between free and paid?

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.650
If as a developer, you say,
you know what,

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.710
I don't care about free users.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.850
I only want paid users.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.310
That's completely fine.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.680
That might be the right
decision for your business.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.520
But if that's the case,
100% do not choose

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.940
freemium as your model.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.420
Because the most successful freemium
products in the App Store are

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.630
providing a tremendous amount of
value to both free and paid users.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.170
And the reason why is that
the path to monetization in

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.350
freemium is through engagement.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.880
And that means if the first
time a user launches your app,

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:51.080
the first thing that they see is your
in-app store prompting them to pay,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.950
they're going to delete your app
and move on to something else.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.880
You're not doing yourself any
service at all by doing that.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.390
You need to give users
a chance to get engaged.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.150
And the way to do that in
a freemium product is by

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.160
providing them value for free.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.860
Which brings us to the
next part of the funnel,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.620
which are your retained users.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.430
Obviously, this is a smaller percentage
than the number of users that

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.650
download your app initially.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.350
And then the last piece of
the framework is do you have a

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.540
plan to create lasting value?

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.590
Again, the most successful freemium
products in the store are providing

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.850
long-term value to their users via
the inherent qualities of the app

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.390
themselves and as a developer through
a long-term roadmap to add features,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.230
content, or services.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.570
So if you've built something that is
only for periodic or one-time use,

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.820
chances are freemium is not
the right model for you.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.680
Which again brings us to the
last piece of the funnel,

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.560
conversion.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.700
The number of your retained
users that you convert.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.900
And the math really is crucial to whether
you can be successful in freemium.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.700
If you're building a niche product,
for example, that does not have a chance

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.200
to be downloaded millions
and millions of times,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.360
you might see higher retention and
conversion and a higher average

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.340
spend and the math can work out.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.930
In contrast, if you're building a product
that has potential to reach

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.480
millions and millions of people,
you might see a lower conversion

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.600
and a lower average spend,
but the math can still work out for

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.140
you because the numbers are so big.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.520
So do the math.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.000
It's important and will help
you determine whether freemium

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.190
is the right model for you.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.650
So you've gone through the framework,
you've done the math, and you've decided,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.300
yes, freemium is the right model for you.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.600
So what are the next steps?

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.410
So a lot of this is just
reiterating what I've said earlier.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.560
First, identify and focus on the
product that you're building.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.600
Second,
identify and focus on your target market.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.600
Again, being free will not make
everyone interested in your app,

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.600
but it may expand your reach
within your target market.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.380
And make sure your business
model is consistent with what

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.560
your target market might expect.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.460
Next, prioritize engagement
before monetization.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.600
This speaks for itself.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.600
Happy customers are the
ones that are likely to pay.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.060
And if you have a paywall that
a user sees within a few seconds

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.600
after launching your app,
you're not giving them

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:09.600
a chance to get it.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.520
So you're going to have
to be very careful.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.230
And if you have a paywall that
a user sees within a few seconds

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.600
after launching your app,
you're not giving them

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:11.600
a chance to get it.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.460
get happy and start getting
some value out of your app.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.710
Next,
incorporate the business model into the

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.380
very early stages of your product design.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.270
If you've built something
great and beautiful without any

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.330
regard to the business model,
and at the 11th hour you decide, oh,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.140
this should be freemium,
and you put a paywall up,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.750
chances are that's not going to
feel native or natural to the users.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.680
And again,
they're not going to get engaged

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.130
and you're not going to give
yourselves a chance to monetize

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.480
that user in the long run.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.620
So consider the business model from the
very early stages of your product design.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.960
Next, track your metrics,
as I said earlier.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.940
If freemium is not working for you,
don't be afraid to change the model.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.740
Or if freemium is the right model
but the economy isn't quite right,

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.570
don't be afraid to tune your
economy after you've launched.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:22:02.700
[ Transcript missing ]

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.870
So that's my discussion on freemium.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.010
Next we'll talk a little
bit about pricing.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.280
So the App Store runs
under the agency model.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.890
That means you as developers
have full control over what

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.460
the price of your product is.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.290
And the guidance we have is two-fold.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.190
Be thoughtful.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.630
Take a look at the competition.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.210
The App Store is a very,
very competitive space.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.030
There are lots of apps that do very,
very similar things.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.610
And your pricing should be in line
with what your competition charges.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.200
And then the key takeaway that I want to
leave you with is that you should be in

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.980
line with what your competition charges.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.560
The only two successful price points
in the App Store are free and 99 cents.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.430
And that's just not true at all.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.970
Many,
many developers are seeing success at

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.360
higher price points in the App Store.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.370
Consider price promotions.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.980
These are sales.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.650
Don't do sales all the time.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.190
If you do that, customers will not be
inclined to buy your app.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.100
They'll just be waiting
until the price gets lowered.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.110
But well-timed price promotions
are a great way to grow your

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.620
business on the App Store.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:24:17.000
[ Transcript missing ]

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.520
And then lastly,
don't plan on being featured by the

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.560
App Store as your marketing plan.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.040
There are a lot of things that you
can do within your control to generate

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.940
momentum for your app in the App Store.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.260
And my colleague Steve will
talk about that momentarily.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.220
So you've launched your app.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.940
Now what?

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.660
Well, first and foremost,
monitor the ratings and reviews.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.300
We have extremely vocal
customers in the App Store.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.060
They'll tell you what you're doing well.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.100
They'll tell you what
you're not doing well.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.210
You may discover some bugs and you might
get some good ideas for a future update.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.090
So this might be a little bit
hard for some of you to read,

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.110
but this is a well-rated cooking app.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.280
And this reviewer says that
the app is very well done,

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.950
but it's not useful for American cooks
because it's only in the metric system.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.040
So through this review, there's a great,
easy-to-implement idea for

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.700
a future update to this app.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.660
Add the imperial measurement
system so that it becomes a useful

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.020
product for the American market.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.580
Next, update your apps.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.840
Launching it and leaving it is not a
strategy for success in the App Store.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.130
The market is too competitive.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.150
Here's some real data from Evernote,
a popular productivity app,

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.010
and each orange star indicates a
significant update that Evernote

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.950
has made to their product.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.190
They've had great momentum since
they launched on the App Store and

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.210
the additional investment that
they make in their product has

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.190
helped to build on that momentum.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.180
Test your apps thoroughly so you
can avoid constant bug fixes.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:48.280
The right timing for feature-rich
or content-rich updates is

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.680
roughly every four to six weeks.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.200
Next, use push notifications and sharing.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:00.850
Push notifications are a tremendous
way to bring people back to your app.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:05.730
Avoid using them in ways that customers
may perceive as spam or marketing,

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.320
but well-timed,
well-written push notifications

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.440
are very effective to get
people engaged with your app.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:15.060
And then on the right,
use our share sheets.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.350
If people love using your app,
make it easy for them to

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.360
tell others about it as well.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.760
Next, monitor your sales and trends.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.140
This might seem obvious,
but you'd be surprised at how

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.340
many people aren't doing this.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.020
There's a wealth of data available
to you in iTunes Connect,

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.030
and there's a vibrant third-party
ecosystem of services whose sole

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:38.070
existence is to help you optimize
your business on the App Store.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.590
In particular,
you might find out by monitoring

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.740
your data that your app is doing
well in a market that you had no

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.780
idea that it was doing well in,
and there's a path for a future

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.440
update by adding a localization
for that particular market.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.340
So that's my discussion
on best practices.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.720
Next thing we'll talk
about is localization.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:28:31.400
[ Transcript missing ]

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.890
So what should you localize?

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.310
Your app name, your app description,
your screenshots,

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.790
and all of the contents of your app.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.190
Recommended languages.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.310
So if you have a product,
not every product is globally relevant,

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.680
but if you have a product that has
a chance for that global relevancy,

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.630
this is the group of languages
we recommend you start with.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.630
English, French, Italian, German,
and Spanish.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:56.300
The Asian languages, Korean, Japanese,
traditional and simplified Chinese,

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.480
and then Brazilian, Portuguese, Russian,
Turkish, and Arabic.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.500
This list is not prioritized.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.990
It's not in alphabetical order.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.750
It's just the set of languages
you should start with if your

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.720
product has global relevancy.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.360
So it's all well and good for me
to stand up here and tell you to

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.950
localize that this is a global
business and you're missing out on

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.500
dollars to be made by not localizing.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.480
I imagine you guys want some proof
that this actually makes a difference.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.190
Well, today's your lucky day.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.440
I do have some proof.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.070
This is one of thousands and
thousands of examples I could

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.640
have shown you from the App Store.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.640
I'm going to show you a
little bit of the results.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.880
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.740
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.880
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.770
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.880
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.780
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.880
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.880
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.500
So this is a little bit of
a preview of the results.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.320
that show that localizing your app
makes a difference in local markets.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.200
And let's take a look at the charts.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:12.450
Here's some recent charts from China,
Japan, and France.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.080
With all but two exceptions here,
Clash of Clans and

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.580
Angry Birds Star Wars that have gone
the branding route with their app name,

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.950
every single app at the top of
the charts here is localized.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.800
And on top of that,
our editors in local markets

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.100
around the world have an extremely
strong preference for promoting and

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.700
featuring apps in the local language.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.730
So again, think globally, but be local.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.620
And Apple provides a number of
resources to help you to do so.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.200
There's the URL at the top.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.420
On this page, you'll find some tips and
tricks for localizing,

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.160
as well as a list of third-party
localization vendors,

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.760
assuming you don't have the
linguistic expertise in-house to

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.180
localize into dozens of languages.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.040
So that's my discussion on localization.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.260
Last but not least,
and this is more or less a summary of

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.880
everything I've talked about today,
how do you get featured in the App Store?

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.640
First and foremost,
build something great,

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.240
build something unique
that our customers love.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.420
Next, have a strong App Store presence.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.720
These things matter.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.530
When we feature an app,
we're putting our stamp of approval

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.920
on it and we want everything,
not just the app itself,

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.390
to look good and send a strong and
clear message to our customers.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.710
Choose the right business
model and price thoughtfully.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.760
Don't choose a business model or
a price that's out of line with

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.590
a competitive marketplace for
apps that you're competing with.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.810
Offer your customers a universal binary.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.590
Again,
we've sold a lot of iPads and unless

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.630
you're building something that
really is iPhone specific only,

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.050
like a running app or a jogging app,
we strongly encourage you

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:50.600
to build a universal app.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.540
Localize in relevant markets.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.600
And then lastly, let us know about it.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.880
It always helps to hear from the
developer what you've built and why

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.600
you're proud of it and why you think
we should let our customers know.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.190
So that's my discussion.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.600
Thank you very much.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.080
Now I'll turn it over to my
colleague Steve McGuigan who will

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.600
talk about App Store marketing.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.600
Steve McGuigan Thank you, Alex,
and good afternoon.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.670
My name is Steve McGuigan and I'm the
head of marketing for the App Store.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.640
And you know, at Apple,
we spend a lot of time

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.240
thinking about apps.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.040
And we think about the channels
that we can market them through.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.080
And it varies from television to print

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.370
You'll see apps being marketed
through billboards throughout cities,

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.940
on bus stops.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.980
You'll see them marketed through our over
400 retail locations around the globe

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.010
and our thousands of channel partners.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.840
We spend a lot of energy marketing
apps on Apple.com or through the

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.880
hundreds of millions of emails
that we send on a monthly basis,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.230
as well as through social media,
where we speak to nearly 11 million

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.160
fans and followers on Facebook and
Twitter on a daily basis.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.420
But as Alex mentioned earlier,
you control much of your

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.340
success on the App Store.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.200
Your success is not dependent
upon getting featured,

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.980
but of course it needs to
start with a great app,

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.200
which you've been learning
about how to build today,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.160
but that success will be propelled
by having a great marketing plan.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.790
And that's what I'm here
to talk to you about today.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.990
I'm going to begin by talking about
three programs that we've created

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:28.170
to help you not only monetize,
but to help you promote your app.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.570
I'll share with you some of the
resources we built to help you

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.560
make great marketing campaigns.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.180
And then I'll conclude by talking
about the components that make up

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.480
a comprehensive marketing campaign.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.840
So let's begin with the
programs and resources.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:46.590
Now I've been hearing for quite a while
that developers have been asking for a

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.860
method to give away their paid apps for
free without making their apps freely

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.910
available to everybody in the App Store.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.140
So I'm pleased to announce the
new App Store Code program.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.050
The App Store Code Program provides you,
the developer,

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:08.930
the ability to market free offers to
customers using unique 12-digit codes.

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:11.800
Currently,
the program is focused on offering

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.990
paid apps downloaded for free.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.690
Now these codes are different
than the promo codes that you can

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.600
request out of iTunes Connect.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.090
Those, which we'll talk about later,
should be used for PR.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:28.010
These codes should be used for
high volume marketing campaigns.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.600
It's a completely free program.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:34.900
You as a developer will waive your
70% royalty and we as Apple will

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.750
waive our 30% commission.

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:40.280
And when you receive these codes,
you can distribute them

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.200
digitally or physically.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.060
I'll give you some examples
of this in a moment.

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:48.360
So what are the benefits
of such a program?

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.600
Well, first,
this will allow you to create

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.130
an impactful and a high value
marketing promotion that's going to

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:59.620
aid in not only user acquisition,
but also engagement.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.360
The fact that these codes
are integrated into iOS,

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.370
it will create a simple, frictionless,
and a consistent user

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.970
experience for those redeemers.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.620
So let me give you an example of what
one of these promotions could look like.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.200
And this is a test we did with
Big Fish Games where they wanted

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.510
to distribute this offer digitally.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.430
Big Fish Games has a popular
game called Fairway Solitaire,

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.570
and they wanted to target game
enthusiasts and golf enthusiasts,

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.010
so they went after a few popular
websites that addressed that market.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:54.800
[ Transcript missing ]

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.190
So back to the redemption flow.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.870
The customer taps on Get It Free,
at which point the App Store launches

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.790
and the customer enters in their
password for the App Store.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.400
And that 12-digit code is automatically
populated in the redeem field.

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.110
So all that the customer has to do
is tap redeem and the app begins

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.320
downloading and the offer is complete.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.860
So that's an example of
a digital distribution.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.900
But here's an example of
a physical distribution.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.600
And this was great.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.310
Halfbrick came to us and they said,
we want to celebrate the

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.290
anniversary of Fruit Ninja,
obviously a very popular game.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:37.090
And they wanted to do this by creating a
public event with a really high quality.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.300
And what they came to us
with is this idea of a kiosk.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:45.520
Where on this kiosk they had eight
iPads around the four corners of it

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.290
with a flat screen and customers could
come up and play with Fruit Ninja.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.270
Now they would create signage
drawing people to this event.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:56.760
They would keep scores of the
day trying to find who was

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.400
the best Fruit Ninja master.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.780
Well, we love this so much.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:04.020
They loved it so much they
created four of these kiosks and

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.900
put them in public venues around
Melbourne and Sydney and shopping

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.400
malls and parks and what have you.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:14.400
And it created a ton of PR buzz
and a lot of great engagement.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:20.170
Well, as people were playing Fruit Ninja,
they were given this little business

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:25.400
card size collateral that each card
had its own unique 12-digit code on it.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.850
On the back, it explained to go into
the App Store and log in,

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:33.340
type in that unique 12-digit
code and tap redeem.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.170
And again, the offer is complete.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.520
So this is a really great example of a
great physical campaign that drove live

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.580
activation and Halfbrick really loved it.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.050
So if you have an idea
for such a campaign,

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.940
we do have some requirements.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.920
First,
we're looking for you to create a high

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.860
impact marketing campaign that's going
to drive a high redemption opportunity.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.080
So somewhere in the neighborhood
of 100,000 codes or more.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:13.800
[ Transcript missing ]

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.680
We want you to track your distribution
so we know how many codes you're

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.610
putting through which channels.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.890
And then of course
you'll need our approval.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.120
So in order to gain this approval,
drop us an email at

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.650
appstorecodes@apple.com and you'll
receive a template back from us that

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:35.290
will ask you to fill out describing
your campaign and what you want to do.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.360
Once you receive our approval,
we'll send you an agreement.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.990
You guys sign the agreement,
you send it back to us,

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.660
and then we'll provide you the
list of the unique 12-digit codes.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:48.370
What's great about this program is
that you can track the performance of

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:52.380
it on a daily basis through the sales
and trends report you guys use today.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.450
So you'll know the effectiveness
quite quickly of these campaigns.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.900
So that's the App Store code program.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.820
The second program is iAd.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:02.030
iAd is Apple's digital
advertising platform.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:05.110
We know you work very hard
to create a beautiful app,

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:09.640
and we don't want to see your experience
degraded with a poor ad experience.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.590
And that's where iAd comes in.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.050
iAd is now available in
14 countries worldwide,

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.790
where we just launched in three
new countries this week in Taiwan,

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.700
Hong Kong, and Ireland.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:32.860
Now, there's two aspects to iAd.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:32.860
There is the monetization side of iAd
and there's the promotion side of iAd.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:32.860
So let me begin by talking
about the monetization side.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:38.570
With iAd, you can monetize your app by
serving up iAds within your app.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.120
By doing so,
you'll receive a 70% revenue share

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.860
for all the ads that you serve.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.460
Now the iAd platform is both
flexible and noncompetitive.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.140
And what I mean is that you can
go out and sell your own ads to

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.460
render in addition to those that
are being presented with an iAd,

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.700
but you also can block your competition
from showing up in your app.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.460
If you don't want certain apps
to be marketed in your app or

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.700
certain brands to be marketed,
you have the ability to blacklist those.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.600
The ads that will be served to you,
you can be assured that

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.030
they will be compelling,
rich media ads, as I said before,

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.700
not to degrade your own app experience.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.700
And you can track the results in
real time through iTunes Connect.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.110
You can look at the
impressions being served,

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.700
your clicks,
and the revenue being generated.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.700
So that's the monetization side.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.690
But in order to get started here,
there's only three things you need to do.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:31.700
First, go into iTunes Connect and
complete your iAd contract.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:35.690
Second,
enable the iAd framework within your app.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.680
And then third, you just submit your app
into the app review team.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.490
So let's move over to the promotion
side and how you can use iAd

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.700
to drive downloads of your app.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.700
And with that, you use iAd Workbench.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.590
We announced iAd Workbench
at WWDC this last summer,

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:53.700
and it's your do-it-yourself campaign
creation and management tool.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.400
When it was announced this summer,
it was only available in the US,

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.960
but as of this week,
we now have iAd Workbench available

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.700
in those same 14 countries.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:06.000
Again, there's now two sides of
the iAd Workbench product.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.690
There's the campaign creation
and there's the analytics.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.680
So let me explain to you quickly how to
create a campaign within iAd Workbench.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.700
create a campaign within IAD Workbench.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:18.260
There's only five steps.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.190
First, you need to select the app
that you want to promote,

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.660
which is your app.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.110
Second, you need to select your audience.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.620
Now for the non-marketers in the room,
we make it very simple.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.450
You can select the automatic
targeting and the integration

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:36.180
that iAd has with the App Store,
we will automatically find

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.260
the best customers for you.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.150
Now for you marketers here in the room
that want to do your own targeting,

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.550
there's eight different criteria at
which you can target your campaigns,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:48.280
whether it's gender or sex or
city or interest with various

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.660
categories within the App Store.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.300
A number of different criteria.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.650
Next, you need to set your budget.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.620
Tell iAd how much you want
to spend over how many days.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.360
And then upload your creative.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.350
Again, if you're not the creative
type and you don't know how

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.190
to create a great banner ad,
we provide four templates

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.200
that you can use.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.520
And there's various iterations of that
with color and font that can make it

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.320
look really unique to your own campaign.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.050
And then finally, submit it.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.770
You'll get response within
24 hours whether or not your

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.450
campaign's been approved and
then you can begin to run it.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.340
Now, we provide a dashboard where you can
get a macro view of your account.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.500
You can monitor your campaigns
or initiate new ones.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.300
But you also can get detailed
statistics of your campaign.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:35.390
You can look at specific time periods
and metrics such as your spend,

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:39.840
your impressions, your downloads,
your tap-through rates, your CPC,

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.500
all this various stuff.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.710
And then you can also download
these metrics as a CSV from any

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:48.440
screen if you want to integrate it
into your own analytics package.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.450
There was an entire hour-long
session about iAd presented.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:52.730
So, we have a lot of resources online.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:52.980
We have a lot of
resources online at WWDC,

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.490
which I don't have time to go through.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.500
But we have plenty of resources online.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.130
And in the lab next door,
we have the iAd staff available to

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.900
you so you can ask any questions
about either getting set up or

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.500
launching your own campaign.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.470
So, that's iAd.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.380
Let me talk about the third program,
which is our affiliate program.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.040
Now,
our affiliate program allows you to earn

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:16.600
a 7% commission when promoting content,
whether it's your own apps, other apps,

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.870
or other content we have
in iTunes such as TV,

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.500
movies, music, and books.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.360
But what many developers don't know is
that you can use our affiliate program

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.500
to track your marketing performance.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.500
I'll explain how to do
that in the next slide.

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.670
But along those lines,
you have the ability to track the sales

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.060
of both your paid and your free apps.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:42.850
So we are just now launching
a new program partner in PHG.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.800
So we'll have a single partner for
over 100 countries around the globe.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.480
And one of the big benefits of
this new partnership is that

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.940
there's a new easy link structure.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.300
So gone are the days of that
very long affiliate URL.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.030
You simply just take the URL of your
app from the App Store and append

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.520
your affiliate token that you receive
once you're approved into the program.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.480
That's all you really need to do to
begin generating that 7% commission.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.740
But what I would love you guys to use
is the new campaign tracking we have.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.910
And this will tell you a lot
about your campaign performance.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.510
By appending the campaign
token at the end of the URL,

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.420
you have a 40-character
string you can enter in.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.510
So whether you want to measure the
performance of an email or measure

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.870
the performance of a web campaign,
whatever it is,

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.890
you can append it to the end of
that campaign and get those detailed

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.940
statistics of how that campaign is doing.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.420
With this new partnership with PHG,
we've now localized our

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.730
resources into 24 languages,
and you now can receive payment

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.720
in the currency of your choice
of over 100 different currencies.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.200
Now the affiliate program offers
a number of additional tools.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.430
We can create banners for any
of the store content for you.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.260
We can create interactive widgets
so your customers can search

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.080
for content within the store.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.230
We provided a search API, RSS feeds,
and even our enterprise partner feed,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.890
which allows you to download
all the metadata for any bit of

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.560
content we have in the store.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:04.920
So that's it for this
episode of the App Store.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:04.920
Thanks for watching.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:04.920
We'll see you next time.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:04.920
Bye.

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.950
That's the affiliate program.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:12.640
Next, I want to talk about the developer
marketing resources we're providing you.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:17.440
A simple way to get there is to
go to appstore.com/marketing.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:21.090
Within there, we have the
App Store marketing guidelines,

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.740
high resolution assets of
our device images and our

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.880
badges for you to download,
and then a link to a number of tools.

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.660
So first, what is the
App Store marketing guidelines?

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.900
Well, we just revamped these,
and this week we've now

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:38.000
localized it into Spanish,
Italian, German, and French.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.110
Additionally,
we've done simplified Chinese,

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.890
traditional Chinese, and Japanese,
and we're going to be launching

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.000
some additional languages soon.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.170
But these guidelines were created
to give you advice and direction on

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.790
how best to market your apps using
the assets that we're providing you.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.000
These assets include the
App Store badges and our device images.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.930
So let me talk about both
of those very briefly.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.590
The first is the App Store badge.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.520
We now have a single App Store badge,
which is downloaded on the App Store.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:10.340
And the App Store customer
knows this as a call to action,

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.610
that when they see it,
that your app is live on the

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:15.000
App Store and to use this
to go download your app.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.900
And we encourage you to use
it in all of your marketing.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.720
But when you're doing so,
place it in a subordinate position.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.260
The most important thing for you
to do is to talk about your app.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:26.690
Lead with your app name.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.320
Talk about the features.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.460
Talk about the devices that it's
on and can conclude with the

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.900
App Store badge as that call to action.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.170
We've localized the badge
now into 38 languages.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.110
So as you follow Alex's advice
and work on localizing your app,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.040
you now have the ability to create
this call to action in all of

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.910
your marketing around the globe.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.560
Now the Apple device images.

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.240
We have now provided the
white versions of the devices.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.120
So now you have black and
white for both iPhone,

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.490
iPad and iPod Touch.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:58.100
And we encourage you to use
it in all of your marketing.

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.770
But when you're using
this in your marketing,

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:03.100
I encourage you,
please use actual screenshots.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.120
Don't use iPad as a
frame for your trailer,

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.460
you know, unless you're a trailers app.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:14.190
But find the most inspiring screenshots
that describe what your app is and

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:16.420
place those in the device images.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:21.310
And please do not cover up your beautiful
apps with marketing violators such

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.230
as download today or available now.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.730
Just really let the app speak for itself.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:29.940
Now if the creative direction you're
going down doesn't allow for you to

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.320
use the device images we provide,
you have the full right to take your

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.400
own photography and videography.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:38.730
And we provided you some great tips
and tricks on how to do that within

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.540
the App Store marketing guidelines.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.460
So I'm going to conclude my
talk this afternoon about the

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.130
components of what makes up a
comprehensive marketing campaign.

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.520
Now there are a number of
channels that I want you to

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.280
consider in marketing your app.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.710
But I've bucketed them into
two different buckets for you.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.340
The first are owned channels.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:02.540
And in many cases,
these are free channels to you.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:07.080
So independent of your marketing budget,
you can be successful in these channels

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:11.920
as long as you put enough energy and
do some great work to support those.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.820
And I'll conclude by talking
about some paid channels.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.760
So let's begin with social media.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.560
Now, through each of these channels,
I'm going to provide you some real

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.150
great tips to really help you be
successful in these various areas.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.300
But with social media,
it should not be an afterthought.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.140
You need to think about how
you're going to integrate social

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.810
media into not only your app,
but what your content

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:33.290
strategy is going to be.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:36.000
So we'll start with the
integration with your app.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.800
And Alex touched on this first earlier.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.300
Use the share sheet that
we provide in iOS 7.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.050
That's probably the simplest way you
can get people to share content from

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:47.380
within your app on Facebook and Twitter.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:50.770
But also think about how you can
leverage the social media networks

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:53.300
to drive content back to your app.

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:55.020
And I really like what
RunKeeper has done here.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.600
They give RunKeeper's customers,
their friends,

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:01.210
the ability to cheer them on
as they're going for a run.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.490
By posting on Facebook or Twitter,
you can hear that as you're going for

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.530
your run to help motivate you as you run.

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.190
But then you need to think
about your content strategy.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:11.450
As you build out your
brand on social media,

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.040
there's three things
I want you to think about.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.060
First, remember,
the content that you're putting

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.330
out there is going to be nestled
amongst the content of your

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.560
customers' friends and family.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:27.550
So be conversational, be engaging,
don't just continually try to sell, sell,

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:28.170
sell.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:32.070
Make sure that your content would flow
within the newsfeed of your customers.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.570
And then think about how you can get
the customer to arrest the thumb.

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.150
We all do this.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.460
We go through our newsfeeds very,
very quickly.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:40.830
But what is that bit of content?

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:41.820
What is that copy?

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.960
What is that photo that's going
to grab somebody's attention?

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.530
And when you see something
like this from RunKeeper,

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.180
you're thinking,
why is there a heart on here?

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.080
Well,
you realize that you can go out there,

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.550
this was celebrating a holiday,
but the fact that you can go

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.560
out there and run this route,
I thought was a really engaging post.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.760
And when you're looking
for that engagement,

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.320
you're trying to get your
customers to share your content.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.020
You want to drive that virality.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.220
But what do people want to share?

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:10.200
Well, they share what's inspirational
to them or what's aspirational.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.040
So think about that copy
that does both that,

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:14.730
inspires and aspires.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:16.140
So that's social media.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.160
Let's move forward to email.

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.860
Email, in many cases,
is the first time you're going

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.660
to be communicating with your
customer outside of the App Store.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.810
So think very hard about what that
first communication is going to be.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:30.240
You don't want to offend them.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.660
You don't want them to think
it's just a sales channel.

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.220
You want them to keep you
out of their spam folder.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.770
So that first email is
extremely important.

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:42.500
That second email, that third email,
put together a strong email campaign.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:45.940
and target your communications.

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.720
There's two things you can do here.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:51.230
One, segment your subscriber base.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.100
Think about those emails you want to
send about maybe account management

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:58.120
separately from those about app updates
depending on where you know your customer

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.580
is in the life cycle of your app.

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:03.060
But you also can target your
communications by platform.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.400
You know this is an
iPhone or an iPad user,

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:08.140
so speak to them as an
iPhone or an iPad user.

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.290
Alex Rofman

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:12.080
Be useful.

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:13.320
Don't continually try to sell.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.690
Think about the kind of content
you can provide in an email that's

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.430
going to want that person to engage.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.410
I love this one from Trippet because
this is an email I definitely want.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:25.130
If my flight is going to be delayed,
I want to know that.

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:29.260
Think about how you can support
your social media strategy.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.720
Provide links in your emails
allowing people to follow you on

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.180
Facebook and Twitter or other networks.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:39.630
Optimize your email for the
devices it's being viewed on.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.840
Don't try to cram that large
desktop email into the small

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.390
form factor in an iPhone.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:46.920
Use proper image sizes and font sizes.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.310
Next, let's talk about your website.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.870
I know you all have them,
but we introduced a technology in

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.180
iOS 6 called Smart App Banners.

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:58.320
I would love to see more of
you take advantage of this.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.260
You simply have to add one
line of code to your website.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.080
With that line of code,
it will detect when customers are

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.630
coming to you from an iOS device.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.320
When that happens,
a banner ad is presented

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.880
at the top of your page.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.770
And the call to action varies depending
upon where your customer is as far

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.590
as their relationship with you.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.220
So in this case, if the customer does not
have Sky Guide installed,

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.400
the call to action says View in
the upper right-hand corner.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.020
And when they tap on View,
they're taken into the

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.840
App Store to download your app.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.630
Now if the customer does
have your app installed,

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:32.470
it says Open.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.110
And when they tap on Open,
it launches your app.

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:44.480
It's important to optimize
your website for the smaller

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:44.480
form factor of the iPhone,
again, by using the proper image

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:44.480
sizes and font sizes.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:47.480
And we encourage you to use
multiple install points.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.860
Again, use the App Store badge as a
call to action to get people to

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.280
tap on it to download your app.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.700
Support that social media
strategy by allowing people

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:57.500
to follow you on social media.

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.470
And then finally,
include an FAQ and links to your customer

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:04.440
care center so that customers can contact
you if there's an issue rather than

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.780
leaving you bad reviews on the App Store.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.690
So the next channel is cross promotion.

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:13.940
Now for you developers in the audience
that have multiple apps on the App Store,

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:17.820
you are at a severe advantage to those
that don't because you already have

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.970
an audience that you can speak to.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:24.460
But please, be thoughtful when you're
cross promoting your apps.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.200
The More Apps menu is a
popular way of doing it,

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.060
and I like how Yahoo has done this.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:33.070
By tapping on the hamburger menu,
they are then presenting

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:36.640
all the Yahoo apps,
which then the customer can then tap on,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.280
and then they're taken directly
into the App Store to download.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.920
It's a very thoughtful implementation.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.680
We also see the use of tickers now.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.420
And this is an example
with the Sims Free Play.

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.900
This is not an intrusive ad in any way.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.040
The streaming ticker at the
bottom is talking about FIFA 14,

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.110
the benefits of it.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.570
You can tap on it and then
you can be taken into the

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:00.300
App Store to download that app.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:55:31.800

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.580
Now,
if you do want to write a press release,

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:37.530
make sure you can support and
substantiate your claims and

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:38.720
please send us your press release.

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.270
We'd be happy to review it.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.270
If you send it to
pressreleases at apple.com,

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.530
we'll get to you within five
business days and give you our

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:46.040
thoughts on the press release.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.000
So the last own channel that
I want to talk about is trailers.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.020
And I got to tell you,
I really like what I'm

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.380
seeing with app trailers.

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:55.730
They are really been taken
to the next level with a

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:57.580
really high production value.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:00.890
But because I'm seeing so many of them,
it's really important that you

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:02.440
follow a few tips and tricks.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:07.440
The first thing is to think about those
first six seconds of your trailer.

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.600
You don't need to open your trailer
with your company logo and your

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.740
license source logo and various things.

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.020
Get into the beauty of your app to get
people to want to watch your videos.

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.000
And then watch the rest of your trailer.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:19.500
Keep your trailer to
about 30 to 60 seconds,

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.170
because that's about all the
time you have to keep somebody's

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.800
attention span on a trailer.

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:29.130
And then use professional
capturing tools.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.490
Gone are the days where your friend
sits over your shoulder with a

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.920
camcorder trying to watch you record
your experience on the iPhone.

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:37.730
Use digital capturing tools,
and there's a number of really great

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.380
ones out there in the market today.

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:43.640
And support that capture
with a great soundtrack.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.310
Whether it's music or a voiceover,
that is really going to

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:49.090
add a lot to your trailer.

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:51.740
You're going to want to
provide a clear call to action.

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:55.830
And then finally,
ensure that your trailer

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.560
is globally appropriate.

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.600
And there's two aspects of this.

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:01.850
First is price.

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:04.440
If you market the app here
and saying that it's in so

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.880
many euros or what have you,
that doesn't mean a lot to an American or

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:11.050
somebody in Japan or what have you,
because they don't understand

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.300
the currency conversion.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:16.120
But also, that's going to limit you to do
any price promotions in the future.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.650
So I just recommend leaving pricing
out of your trailer unless your app

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:25.170
The second component to globally
appropriateness is the content.

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:28.200
The levels of offensive
content vary around the globe,

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:32.760
so just err on the side of caution and
make sure that it's okay for all to see.

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:37.740
Now the example I'm going to show
you here of a great trailer that's

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.320
really done an exceptional job of
doing all these things is from an

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.340
Italian developer called Music Match.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.880
So I'll play it here.

[ Transcript missing ]

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:55.030
So I guess a little humor
doesn't hurt either.

00:58:55.040 --> 00:59:00.510
These guys did a great job.

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:03.410
We shared it on our Facebook page
and it had one of our most highly

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:05.540
engaged posts in quite a while.

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:06.990
So great work there.

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:12.620
So I'm going to conclude by talking
about three of the paid channels.

00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:14.140
And the first are mobile ads.

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.180
Now I touched on a lot of
this in the iAd discussion,

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:19.320
but briefly,
the reason mobile ads work so well,

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.610
as many of you know,
is that with mobile ads,

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.040
it's the fewest taps
away from an install.

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.020
As you're engaged with an app or
engaged with a mobile website,

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.730
you can simply tap on the banner ad and
be taken directly into the App Store.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.150
You can use mobile ads not
just for your user acquisition,

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.650
but also to help build your brand.

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:42.380
And one of the big benefits about mobile
ads is the targeting capabilities.

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:46.930
You can target by device, by demographic,
by interest, by gender, many,

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:48.350
many different things.

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:50.340
So that's a real benefit to mobile ads.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:52.870
But I want you to think about
is you're creative when you're

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:54.740
doing your mobile ad campaigns.

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.730
And not the same piece of
creative works everywhere.

00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:00.720
So think about the channel
at which you're putting this

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.700
creative through and customize it.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.930
It works on Facebook.

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:06.650
It works great to use live action photos,
maybe versus screenshots

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:07.450
and what have you.

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:12.050
And then the last thing
is to test your creative.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:15.140
I know of some developers that
will create upwards of 50 pieces of

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:17.640
creative for one single campaign.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:20.920
And they quickly test in real time how
it's performing and they'll continue to

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.730
invest in those pieces that work well.

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.230
The second channel is print.

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:28.150
And I know print can get expensive,
but for those that do engage within it,

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:30.100
I want to share with you a few tips.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.060
And I feel the New York Times has
really done a great job with

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.500
this print campaign here.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:45.690
First, they're connecting visually by
using our devices in their campaign.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:45.690
They're speaking to the iPhone and iPad
customer by providing those images.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:01:01.900
[ Transcript missing ]

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:07.200
The second is they're using an action
verb such as download or search.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.390
And then finally,
they're using their App Store URL.

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:13.620
And this is something that every one
of you in this room have access to.

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:18.640
You have your own vanity URL,
which is appstore.com/yourappname

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.270
or appstore.com/developername.

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:25.360
And we encourage you to use these
URLs in any of your offline marketing,

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.290
whether that's print, broadcast,
whatever that might be.

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:29.740
It's very memorable.

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:32.040
And if somebody sees it,
they can remember to go to

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.560
that URL to download your app.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:37.230
So the final channel I want to
chat with you about is television,

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.730
which I know is extremely expensive,
but I'm seeing some great campaigns

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:44.210
around the world and some great
ones here in Europe particularly.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.330
What makes television so effective is
the fact that the devices are at hand.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.470
While you're watching television,
your iPhone's in your pocket,

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:55.070
your iPad is on your lap,
and if it's a compelling enough piece,

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.720
you will get people to convert.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.010
It's important to share
those magic moments with

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:00.720
television more than anything.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.680
What are the most magical things
about your app that you can tell

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.730
your customer in those 30 seconds?

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.390
What makes television so effective is
the fact that the devices are at hand.

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:11.970
While you're watching television,
your iPhone's in your pocket,

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:14.390
your iPad is on your lap,
and if it's a compelling enough piece,

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.980
you will get people to convert.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.700
It's important to share
those magic moments with

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.970
television more than anything.

01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:25.810
While you're watching television,
your iPhone's in your pocket,

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:32.270
your iPad is on your lap,
and if it's a compelling enough piece,

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:35.970
you will get people to convert.

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:40.350
Now you can watch your favorite
Travel Channel shows anywhere,

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.780
anytime on your iPad and iPhone.

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.300

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:40.430
I'm going to hand things over to
Shannon to talk about iTunes Connect.

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:41.080
Thank you.

tips about choosing the right business

model and how to best market your app.

tips through iTunes Connect.

least one app on the App Store,

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.100
so you should be very
familiar with iTunes Connect.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:10.550
And you should understand that it
is the gateway to the App Store.

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:14.380
It's the website you use to
create and manage your apps,

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:19.140
request your promo codes,
check your sales and financial reports,

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.460
and much more.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.760
I'm going to cover three
major topics today.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.860
First, I'll go over some recently
launched and valuable features.

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:32.080
Second, I'll show you how you can execute
on your plans to localize your app.

01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:35.760
And finally,
I'll leave you with three tips and

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.260
tricks that can help you manage
your business more effectively.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.440
So let's start with our
first valuable feature,

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.200
promo codes.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.640
We provide you with 100 promo
codes for each app version.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.110
This was recently increased from 50.

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:52.610
And they're set up so that
you can request them as you

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:54.720
need them in any denomination.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.700
As Steve mentioned,
we encourage you to reserve these

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:01.550
codes for your media contacts,
journalists, influencers,

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:06.840
who can try out your app before it's
available to the general public and

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.310
write about it to help you promote it.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.740
And up until recently,
you were only able to request promo

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.040
codes in the ready for sale state.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.220
But I'm happy to announce today that
you can now request promo codes in the

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.200
pending developer release date as well.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:26.060
This is very exciting because now you
can promote the new features of your app

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:31.800
updates before they're released instead
of just the first version of your app.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.760
The second feature I want
to cover is app transfer.

01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:39.390
App transfer was a very exciting
launch for us this year at WWDC.

01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:44.960
And it's the ability to transfer an app
from one developer account to another.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.420
So what are some of the reasons
you might use app transfer?

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.030
The App Store has been in
business for five years now.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.800
And many of you have
seen phenomenal success.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.380
You may have had the opportunity to
sell your app to another developer

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:03.490
or to Or you may have acquired a
great app from another developer.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.490
or maybe some of you have registered
multiple developer accounts with

01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:12.150
Apple and you'd like to consolidate
those accounts to be managed as one.

01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:17.480
If you're in any of these situations,
app transfer is a great solution for you.

01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:21.000
And what are some of the
benefits of app transfer?

01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:24.400
One of the greatest things about app
transfer is that it is completely

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.300
seamless to your customers,
which means that there's no interruption

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:32.140
in the ability to use the app,
and new customers can continue

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.610
to purchase the app as well.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.460
You get to retain all
of your chart placement,

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:41.250
your customer ratings and reviews,
and the ability to update

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.900
the app for your customers.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:48.630
And there are really just minimal
visible changes to the app on the store.

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:51.890
The only thing that changes on
the store is the seller name.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.800
So I'd like to walk through a flow
just to show you what this looks like.

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:59.900
First, as the current owner,
you'll log into iTunes Connect,

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:03.900
select the app you wish to transfer,
and enter in the new owner information.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:09.830
That is the Apple ID of the team agent
and the team ID of the new owner account.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:15.900
Then Apple will draw up a contract
agreement between you and the new owner.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:19.240
And once you've signed this agreement,
the app moves into a sub-state

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.760
called Pending App Transfer.

01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:23.490
If your app is ready
for sale at this time,

01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:28.900
customers can continue to purchase as all
of this is going on in the background.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:32.900
Then as the new owner,
you'll receive an email letting you

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:32.900
know that a transfer has been made.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.650
letting you know that a
transfer is waiting acceptance.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.940
You'll log into iTunes Connect and
you'll be required to enter

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:43.240
in some new app metadata.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.390
I'll go into detail about
this in just a minute.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:51.470
You'll then sign the same agreement and
the app will move into processing app

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:56.120
transfer where it's literally moving
from the current owner to the new owner.

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:59.970
Now there are some rules regarding
app transfer that I'm just going to

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:03.460
go over a few of them that you should
know before transferring an app.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.230
You want to agree to any
available contract amendments.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.850
From time to time,
Apple updates the terms of

01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:13.460
the program license agreement
or the paid apps contract.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:17.590
You just want to make sure that
you've agreed to these terms

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:19.580
before transferring an app.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.540
And the app will need to have at
least one approved app version.

01:08:24.730 --> 01:08:28.900
You will not be able to transfer an app
that is currently in review and that

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:31.070
includes in-app purchase reviews as well.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.800
So as the current owner,
what are some things you should have

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:37.500
ready before initiating an app transfer?

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.040
You'll need to collect
the new owner information.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.780
As I mentioned,
that is the Apple ID of the team agent.

01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:49.140
This is not the password,
just the username they use to log in.

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:51.830
And the team ID of the new owner.

01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:55.440
The team ID is a unique identifier
for your developer account.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.590
We also encourage you to
back up your app history.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.850
Once the app is transferred,
it's completely gone out of

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:05.250
your iTunes Connect account,
so you won't have access

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:06.970
to this information.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:11:27.100
[ Transcript missing ]

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:31.500
The second feature I want to talk
about is alternate price tiers.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.500
We recently introduced some additional
tiers for you to assign to your

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.680
paid apps or in-app purchases.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.360
And these tiers are great
for being able to vary your

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.380
pricing in different currencies.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.770
There are five new tiers for your use.

01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:48.830
And these new tiers are
completely market optimized,

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:53.630
which means they're culturally
relevant and consumer friendly to

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:56.060
the customers in those markets.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:00.360
And there are no restrictions,
meaning that you can assign

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.930
them to any of your apps.

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:05.340
And the great thing about the
App Store being on the agency

01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:09.010
model means that you can change
your pricing at any time.

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:13.820
These tiers also map to existing
US dollar tiers as they are today.

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.390
Something to note is that we currently
only support the selection of

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:19.460
these tiers through iTunes Connect.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:22.830
We don't support the assignment
of these tiers through any other

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:26.180
delivery method such as the
import from file functionality.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.510
And we also support the
application loader or the

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:31.070
XML feed through Transporter.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:35.180
But I do want to point out where
you can select these tiers.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.980
This is the rights and
pricing page of the app.

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:41.400
And you can see that the alternate
tiers are listed down at the

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.180
bottom of the price tier list.

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.920
And just to illustrate
what this looks like,

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.760
for an example,
if my app is priced at tier one,

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.460
you can see that that's 99
cents in the US dollar and 69

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.520
pence in the British pound.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:00.380
However, if I select alternate tier one,
the price remains 99

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:04.500
cents in the US dollar,
but is now 99 pence in the British pound.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.670
This may be a little bit of a
higher price for the customer,

01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:11.520
but it is a more culturally
relevant price point.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.860
And to give you some more examples,
tier one in the Euro is 89 Euro,

01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:19.360
but alternate tier one is 99 Euro.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.520
And in the Chinese RMB,
tier one is six RMB.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.850
And alternate tier one is eight RMB.

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.200
So we encourage you to check out
these new tiers and see what works

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.860
for your app and your business model.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.860
The last feature I want to
talk about is automation.

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.620
We know that your time as
developers is very valuable,

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:41.830
and we do all that we
can to save you time,

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:44.840
especially when it comes to
repetitive actions in iTunes Connect.

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.010
So there's two areas of automation that
I want to cover that I think will be

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:50.850
very helpful in saving you some time.

01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:53.860
The first area of automation
is auto-ingesting your reports.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.790
We provide you with a command line tool
that allows you to automate the delivery

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.860
of your reports from iTunes Connect.

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.190
And it's been available for
your sales and trends reports,

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:01.850
but we recently expanded it to
include the payment reports as well.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.720
And it just allows you to download
your reports without actually having

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.860
to log into iTunes Connect each time.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.650
So in order to use this tool,
you'll first download the auto-ingestion

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:11.860
class file at the URL here.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:14.660
Then you'll change your
directory location to the one

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:15.800
that you're using for your app.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:20.710
You'll first download the auto-ingestion
class file at the URL here.

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:25.670
Then you'll change your directory
level to point to the class file.

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.940
And you'll need to create a properties
file for your login credentials.

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:35.140
That is your iTunes Connect Apple ID and
your iTunes Connect password.

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.470
The great thing about this
properties file is that it allows

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:41.790
you to put a little more security
around your login credentials as

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:45.620
you used to enter this information
directly into the command line.

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:49.220
So it just allows your password
to be a little bit more secure.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.330
And I'll walk through what this command
looks like for each of the reports so you

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.200
know how to do this for your own account.

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.800
This is the command
for the sales reports.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:00.480
And all of the information
in the angle brackets will be

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.640
replaced with your own values.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.350
And the parameters will be
delimited with the space.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.350
You'll start by entering your vendor ID.

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.980
This is another unique identifier
for your developer account.

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:13.710
And this one in particular
can be found in the contracts,

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.150
tax, and banking module.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.200
Then you'll indicate the report type.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.100
For this standard sales report,
you'll enter sales.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.540
Or if you're a newsstand developer and
you're looking for a new sales report,

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:24.540
you'll enter sales.

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.870
Or if you're a newsstand
developer and you wish to

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:27.680
download the newsstand reports,
you'll enter newsstand.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:31.070
Next,
you'll indicate the reporting timeframe.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:37.140
That's going to be the daily, weekly,
monthly, or yearly interval.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:42.200
And the report subtype will be
summary for the standard sales report,

01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:45.450
detailed for the newsstand report,
or if you're using

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:48.740
auto-renewable subscriptions,
you may be collecting personal

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.030
information from your customers
who have chosen to share

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.670
this information with you,
and you can download these

01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:55.080
reports using opt-in.

01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:59.760
Finally, you'll indicate the date range,
and this is the exact date for

01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:01.960
the report you wish to download.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.100
This field is optional,
and if you do not indicate a date,

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.550
we'll just provide you with the
latest available report for the

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:10.490
parameters you've indicated.

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.010
Similarly, this is the command for
the payment reports,

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:17.050
and you'll start by
entering the same vendor ID,

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:20.760
but for the payment reports,
you need to include two leading

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.020
zeros in front of your vendor ID.

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:23.940
Then, since the payment reports
are not available,

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.340
you'll need to include two leading
zeros in front of your vendor ID.

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:28.640
Finally, you'll indicate the
reporting region code,

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.790
and if you need to access a
list of these region codes,

01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:35.660
there is one available in the
Payments and Financial Reports user

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.380
guide in iTunes Connect.

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:40.080
And the report type is
always going to be DRR,

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.670
which is the standard report
type for the payment reports.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.880
And finally, you'll enter the fiscal
year and fiscal period.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.120
If you need to access a copy
of Apple's fiscal calendar,

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.320
there is one available in the
Payments and Financial Reports model.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.910
module on iTunes Connect.

01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:00.220
So that's auto-ingesting your reports.

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:03.910
And the second area of automation
I want to cover is Apple's command

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:06.200
line tool called Transporter.

01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:11.100
Transporter allows you to automate
the delivery of your metadata,

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:14.570
and it gives you the ability to
integrate with your own content

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:16.640
management system if you have one.

01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:20.700
We recently introduced the ability
to deliver your rights and pricing

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.600
changes through Transporter.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:28.520
You can request catalog reports,
and you can deliver your app metadata,

01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:32.460
which can be extremely helpful
when localizing your app.

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:35.880
This brings me to the next
topic of localization setup.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.520
We've been talking about how you
should think global and be local.

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:45.060
And you know that the App Store is
in 155 countries worldwide,

01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:51.360
and we offer you 28 languages for setting
up localizations with your metadata.

01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:54.860
We highly recommend using
professional localization resources.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:57.000
As Alex mentioned earlier.

01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:00.360
And we advise against using
automated translation services

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.360
you might find on the web,
as they may translate your content,

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.260
but don't fully localize it
to be culturally relevant.

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:11.560
We also encourage you to localize
your app wherever possible.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:15.300
Alex showed a great example of Evernote,
where they localized everything,

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.040
including their screenshots.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.690
And we know that this can be a lot of
fields to enter into iTunes Connect,

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.380
but it's really important to do so.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:30.200
And that's why the XML feed
can be very helpful as well.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.340
Before I go into detail about that,
I do want to point out one other

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:35.560
thing about localization setup.

01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:38.910
And that's that you are required
to submit your app for review

01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:41.140
when you add new localizations.

01:18:41.190 --> 01:18:43.680
So just make sure that you
leave enough time for the review

01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:46.940
process if you do wish to add
new localizations for your app.

01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:49.790
So for those of you who wish
to cut down on the repetitive

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:53.530
actions that localizing can bring,
we encourage you to adopt the

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:57.580
automated process of XML feed delivery.

01:18:57.590 --> 01:19:02.660
And the steps for using Transporter
and the XML feed are fairly simple.

01:19:02.670 --> 01:19:07.420
You can start by looking up your existing
metadata from the Apple database.

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:11.740
And that will provide you with your
current app metadata in the format

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.460
that it will need to be uploaded.

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:17.800
Then you can make any necessary changes.

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:22.100
And after making your changes,
you can run Transporter in verify mode,

01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:27.060
which allows you to check your changes
against our XML specifications.

01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:29.090
Then you can upload your content.

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.840
And it's ready to be delivered
with your next update.

01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:37.100
You will still need to create your
new app versions in iTunes Connect.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.680
And you'll want to monitor
your state transitions,

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.840
as this cannot be done
through Transporter.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.880
And I'm not going to walk through a demo.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.410
But I do want to point you to some of
the documentation available in the Manage

01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:49.820
Your Apps module of iTunes Connect.

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:55.330
And I want to encourage you to check out
the WWDC session video from this year

01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:57.940
called What's New in iTunes Connect.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.440
They go in a little bit more detail.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.940
And they do a full end-to-end
demo of what this looks like.

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.620
So if you're interested in
watching this session video,

01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.790
you can access it from
the developer portal.

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.180
And we know that once you've set
up localizations in iTunes Connect,

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:14.620
you like to see what this looks
like for your customer on the store.

01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:17.830
Because we get a lot of questions
about what this looks like.

01:20:18.130 --> 01:20:21.920
One thing I want to point out,
this is the Pages app for an example.

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:25.700
And we get a lot of questions about the
list of languages that appears in the

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.900
information section on the app page.

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:32.090
This list of languages is not
the list of languages you've

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.320
set up in iTunes Connect.

01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:38.630
This list of languages comes from
the lproj folder in your binary and

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:43.410
is meant to be the languages that
you have localized your app into for

01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:45.590
when the customer has downloaded it.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:49.600
The localizations that you set up
in iTunes Connect are automatically

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.900
displayed on the App Store based on the
customer's OS language and storefront.

01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:57.780
And they'll automatically display here.

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:00.820
So just to take a look at what
a couple different localizations

01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:06.220
look like on the App Store,
here are a few examples.

01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:09.710
And you can see how great
this looks for the customers.

01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:17.190
I'd like to leave you with a few
tips and tricks that will help you

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:20.050
run your business more effectively.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:28.940
Tip number one is regarding viewing
your localizations on the device.

01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:31.540
We just saw what this
looks like on the desktop,

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.540
but it can be a little bit trickier
to view this on the device.

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.940
So I'll walk you through how
to change your iOS language

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.290
and storefront on the device.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.440
You'll start by entering
multitasking mode in order

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.090
to quit out of the App Store.

01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:53.290
Next, you'll go to General in your
settings and tap International.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.770
Then tap Language.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:01.490
And then this is where you can select the
iOS language that you wish to change to.

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:05.230
For this example, I'm choosing Chinese.

01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:08.790
So select the language, then tap Done.

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:13.060
After that,
you'll go back to the App Store,

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.340
and if you're logged into
your personal iTunes account,

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:19.520
you'll want to sign out,
and then you'll tap the

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.710
Sign In button again.

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:26.500
Here you can see that the language
has started to change to Chinese.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:30.980
And I don't personally speak Chinese,
but I know that the third line here is

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.920
the option to create a new Apple ID.

01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:36.000
And this is where the trick comes in.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
You don't actually have
to create a new Apple ID,

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.340
but you will start
walking through the flow.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.570
So tap the option to
create a new Apple ID.

01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:47.500
And then you'll be prompted
to select a storefront.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.230
This is where you can select
the territory that you wish

01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:51.960
to change your store to.

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:55.700
And for this example, I'll choose China.

01:22:55.700 --> 01:23:00.690
At this point, you can tap cancel to
exit out of the flow.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.840
Once you exit out of the flow,
your storefront will automatically

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.640
change to the territory you've selected.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.720
So now that we're in
the China App Store with

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.200
our iOS set to Chinese,
if we search for the Pages app,

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.800
we'll see the localization
set up for Pages.

01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:26.240
Tip number two is regarding
tracking your customer reviews.

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:30.840
Alex talked about how important tracking
your reviews can be for your business.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.130
And while you can do
this on the App Store,

01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:36.620
we also encourage you to check
this out on iTunes Connect.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:41.310
This page can be located
from the app summary page.

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:45.300
And the great thing about viewing
your customer reviews in iTunes

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:48.810
Connect is that you can easily toggle
between the different territories.

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.180
Since customer reviews are specific
to each of the different territories,

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:51.180
you can easily toggle between
the different territories.

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:57.040
And you can access and
subscribe to an RSS feed,

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.480
which allows you to receive instant
feedback when customers post new reviews.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:05.230
And tip number three is our
advice for scheduling a sale.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.940
The App Store is a global
marketplace and we operate in

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:11.840
different international time zones.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:16.410
What this means is that pricing and
availability changes happen at different

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:20.940
times in different countries in
different time zones across the globe.

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:25.730
And it's what we call a rolling price
and availability setting because

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:30.560
the change begins propagating in
one area of the world and rolls

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:33.060
across over a period of time.

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:35.620
So to illustrate this,
let's take a look at a map.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:40.060
And I'll use a price
change as an example.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:45.570
Let's say my app is paid and I wish
to run a 24-hour sale where customers

01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:47.970
can download my app for free.

01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:52.370
When the change begins,
the app will first fall to free in the

01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:58.880
New Zealand and South Pacific region,
followed by the Asia Pacific region.

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:04.500
Then, Australia, Russia, India,
and the Middle East.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.480
Next, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.

01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:13.110
And finally,
the change will happen in North America.

01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:18.190
And because of this rolling schedule,
we recommend that if you

01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:22.150
wish to run a 24-hour sale,
that you actually set it up for

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:24.240
three days in iTunes Connect.

01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:28.240
This will ensure that the change
will fully propagate for a full

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.160
24 hours in each territory.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.980
And just to show you what this
looks like in iTunes Connect,

01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:40.440
you can see here that I've set the change
to begin on the 10th and end on the 13th.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.640
So that concludes our session for today.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.100
I want to thank you for your time.

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:47.160
Here's a list of some of the
resources we went over today.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:52.960
And if you have any questions,
I encourage you to come ask us

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.720
in the lab about any of your
marketing or distribution questions

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.160
or to visit any of the others.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.680
We're going to take a short
break and we'll start up again

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.310
in about five minutes with more
on architecting modern apps.
