WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.660
Hi, everybody, and thank you for joining us.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.910
Today we'll talk about how you can measure

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.690
and improve your acquisition efforts with App Analytics.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.590
My name is Nick

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.170
and I'm the product manager for App Analytics

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.840
and I'm excited to share more about all the value

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.250
that App Analytics can bring

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.203
to your user acquisition strategy.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.500
In this video, we'll start with an overview

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.670
of the data and tools available to you in App Store Connect.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.100
Then we'll walk through the key metrics

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.920
that are important to monitor and understand.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.780
We'll then talk about how evaluating

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.390
different acquisition sources can give you clues

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.050
about what's driving performance

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.760
and we'll talk about how to use peer group benchmarks

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.950
to put your performance into context

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.920
so you can understand what you should focus on next.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.890
Finally, we'll talk about taking action,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.380
where we'll show you how you can improve your results

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.453
using tools in App Store Connect.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.253
Let's get started.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.190
The App Store makes it easy

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.580
to distribute your apps and games across the world.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.360
You can reach customers in 175 territories

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.360
on more than 1.5 billion devices and in over 40 languages

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.340
and this gives you a huge opportunity

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.760
to attract new users, engage your current users

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.103
and encourage monetization within your app.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.600
In order to help you measure how well your app is doing,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.630
App Store Connect includes three different tools;

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.210
App Analytics, Sales and Trends,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.013
and Payments and Financial Reports.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.760
Today we'll focus on App Analytics

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.710
and show you how you can use data

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.143
to improve your user acquisition strategy.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.400
App Analytics provides you with insightful data

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.570
about your downloads, redownloads, proceeds and more

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.650
and this data enables you

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.480
to use many of the different features

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.160
that the App Store offers

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.320
including product page optimization,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.080
custom product pages, and in-app events,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.233
and allows you to find out which ones work the best for you.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.670
App Analytics also provides you with helpful data

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.280
while respecting user privacy.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.790
Data is aggregated across a minimum number of users

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.620
in order to provide you with insights

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.143
about your performance in a privacy friendly way.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.890
To begin learning about how to use App Analytics,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.320
let's start by walking you through key metrics

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.033
related to user acquisition.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.960
When you first log into App Analytics

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.790
you'll be taken to an overview page

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.540
with a number of different metrics,

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.950
and the four metrics along the top

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.860
are the primary user acquisition metrics

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.160
and these are the metrics that we'll talk about most today.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.480
First, let's walk through

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.120
what impressions and product page views are

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.970
so we can understand how to use them.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.430
An impression represents anytime

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.103
someone sees your app icon on the App Store.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.160
This includes when they see your app icon

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.130
on your product page, on the today games

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.383
or apps tabs or in search results.

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:04.350
A product page view represents

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.740
the number of times someone views your product page.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.170
Keep in mind that because your product page

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.450
also includes your app icon,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.903
any product page views are also counted as impressions.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.570
In App Analytics

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.080
you can view how many impressions you've received each day

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.640
and view the data over time

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.090
to see how you're performing.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.410
To see your product page views instead,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.263
open the metrics drop down and select that metric.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.490
App Analytics also has two variations

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.640
of the impressions and product page views metrics,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.313
unique impressions and unique product page views.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.060
To give you a better idea of what these metrics are,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.233
we can use an example.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.890
Let's say someone sees your app in the search results

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.603
and taps into your product page,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.990
that would be two impressions

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.063
because your app icon was viewed twice,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.070
one product page view and just one unique impression

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.240
because both impressions

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.373
were made by the same user that day.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.630
Now that we understand unique impressions

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.663
and product page views, let's talk about conversion rate.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.890
We define conversion rate as the percentage of people

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.683
who download your app after seeing it on the App Store,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.640
and this is calculated by dividing your total downloads

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.173
by your unique impressions.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.310
If you click on conversion rate from the overview page

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.263
you can view your data over time.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.860
Conversion rate is one of the main areas

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.800
that you can improve using the tools in App Store Connect

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.450
and so we'll talk about how you can improve it

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.863
throughout the presentation.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.673
Next, let's take a look at total downloads.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.100
Total downloads include

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.640
both first-time downloads and redownloads.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.740
On the App Store, first time downloads

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.210
represent the number of times

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.343
people tap the get or buy button,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.280
and redownloads are the number of times

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.740
people redownload the app after deleting it

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.453
by tapping the cloud icon.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.150
Please note that if a user's settings

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.990
are set to automatically download apps across their devices,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.870
these auto downloads are not counted.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.850
The redownloads number in App Analytics

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.500
only includes redownloads

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.573
made directly on the App Store itself.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.880
If you click on total downloads from the overview page,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.170
you can see how many people

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.973
have downloaded your app over time.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.850
And if you want to break down your results

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.150
by first-time downloads versus redownloads,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.070
you can select first-time downloads

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.233
or downloadable from the metric dropdown.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.100
To recap this section,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.920
by closely monitoring these four metrics

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.650
you can understand how many users you're acquiring

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.750
and how effectively you're acquiring them.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.930
Next, let's dig a little deeper

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.363
to understand where your users are coming from.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.600
App Analytics enables you to learn

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.790
about how people discover your app

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.873
including insights by territory, source type and page type.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.620
Let's first look at how you can use territory information

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.390
to understand what parts of the world

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.740
your users are coming from.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.270
On the overview page, you can scroll down

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.550
to view a list of which territories

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.133
are driving the most downloads for your app.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.300
To view the full list, you can click see all

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.363
and see how many downloads we're getting across the world.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.950
To view a different metric by territory,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.993
you can open the metrics dropdown.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.600
Let's look at conversion rate.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.890
Here you can identify territories

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.073
where you may be able to improve your conversion efficiency.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.450
If we scroll down to the bottom of this list,

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.120
we can see how this app has a low conversion rate

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.450
in China, Japan, and Korea.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.210
To address this, the developer of this app

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.920
might review their product page

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.830
to make sure it's properly localized for these territories

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.040
and that people are able to understand the value of the app

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.573
in their respective language.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.750
You can view territory performance

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.450
in App Analytics across many metrics,

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.760
enabling you to get a full understanding

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.880
of how well you're acquiring and engaging people

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.783
around the world.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.933
Next, let's talk about source type.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.340
You can view source data in app analytics to get more detail

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.950
about how people discovered your app.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.310
The four most common ways are through App Store browse,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.313
App Store search, app refer and web refer.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.870
App Store browse refers to when someone finds your app

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.190
when browsing the App Store

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.890
on the today apps and games tabs.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.130
So if you get featured or appear in the top charts

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.030
then you'll likely see a lot of people coming from browse.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.900
Search refers to when someone finds and downloads your app

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.780
after performing a search on the App Store.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.230
App refer is counted when someone discovers your app

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.720
inside another app on the App Store,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.213
for example through an in-app advertisement.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.750
And lastly, a web refer occurs

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.900
when people tap on a link on a website in Safari

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.670
and download your app from there,

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.220
such as through a web advertisement.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.410
Keep in mind that if your app is discovered

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.690
through a browser other than Safari,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.690
it will show up as an app refer for that browser

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.103
rather than a web refer.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.550
And just like with territories

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.220
you can evaluate different metrics by source type

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.753
by clicking see all.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.660
You can then look at how each source type

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.600
is performing over time for different metrics

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.800
and use this information

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.460
to refine and customize your user acquisition strategy

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.533
to fit your app's specific needs.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.223
Next, let's talk about page type.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.120
Page type refers to the kinds of pages

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.270
from which your users view and download your app.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.610
The three most common page types

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.353
are the App Store product page;

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.280
the store sheet, which looks similar to your product page

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.560
but exists outside the App Store

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.360
and pops up from the bottom of the screen

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.790
from an external source, and this sheet

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.660
is also known as SKStoreProductViewController.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.970
And lastly, no page.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.370
When you see no page in the dashboard,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.590
it's referring to when people download your app

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.860
directly from the today games or apps tabs

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.030
or from the search tab

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.980
without tapping into your product page.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.350
As we'll see, by combining page type with source type

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.030
you can get valuable insights

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.643
about how people discover and download your app.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.750
To dig into this, let's go to the metrics page

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.060
and look at your conversion rate.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.390
By selecting page type from the dimension dropdown,

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.490
you can see what your conversion rate is

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.920
across these different page types.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.450
With this app, you can see

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.973
that the product page is converting people best.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.220
You can also filter this data for even more information.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.740
For example, you can filter by app refer

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.140
to see which type of page converts people

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.630
who are coming from a different app.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.460
And the reason why this is important

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.860
is because when you're running an ad campaign

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.680
you have a choice about whether you send your users

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.680
to the App Store product page or to the store sheet

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.530
using SKStoreProductViewController,

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.580
and the choice you make

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.370
may meaningfully impact your conversion,

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.650
so feel free to look at this data

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.173
to decide which method is best for your app.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.890
You can also look at page type data

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.843
filtered by App Store search.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.500
This lets you see what your conversion rate is

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.390
for people who downloaded your app

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.310
directly from the search tab

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.710
compared to people who viewed your product page

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.213
and then downloaded your app.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.380
In this case, people are more likely to convert

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.930
after they viewed your product page.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.610
By monitoring this data,

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.380
you can see how effective you are

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.570
at converting people from search

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.250
and whether any changes you make

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.173
lead to improvements in performance.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.670
Overall, viewing your data by page type

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.950
can be a valuable way to get more clarity

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.410
on user conversion on the App Store

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.270
and help you measure your acquisition efforts

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.203
more effectively.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.450
Now that we understand how to analyze our metrics

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.083
and sources, let's take a look at peer group benchmarks.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.040
Peer group benchmarks help you put your app's performance

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.530
into context by comparing your data

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.873
to that of similar apps on the App Store.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.830
To help you get an accurate comparison,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.840
Apple places your app in a peer group

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.940
based on your App Store business model

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.790
like Free, Freemium or Paid;

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.740
your App Store category;

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.250
and the amount of App Store download volume you receive

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.523
which enables you to get specific comparisons for your app.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.060
Let's look at how the Forest Explorer app

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.270
compares to other travel apps with the same business model

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.223
and similar levels of download volume.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.520
To access your benchmark results

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.230
you can click the benchmarks tab

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.573
at the top of the App Analytics dashboard.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.470
From this page, you can see how your app is performing

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.823
compared to its peers.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.150
You can see information about your peer group at the top,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.460
including which category and business model

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.710
your app is being compared to.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.020
Since Forest Explorer is a travel app

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.700
with a Freemium business model,

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.770
the peer group benchmarks include data

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.263
from other apps with these characteristics.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.260
You can view how your app's performance

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.870
compares to its peer group across metrics

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.330
including for App Store conversion rate,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.473
proceeds per paying user, crash rate, and retention metrics.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.770
Within each metric, you can see detail

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.480
about the group's 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.603
as well as how your app compares to each percentile.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.190
To add a little more context on what a percentile is,

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.670
a percentile represents what percentage of apps

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.653
in the peer group are performing below a certain level.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.120
For example, 25% of apps in this peer group

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.620
have a day one retention rate below 13.4%,

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.420
50% of apps in this peer group

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.020
have a retention rate below 21.3%,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:24.020
and 75% of apps have a retention rate below 27.4%.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.480
You can see that this app's day one retention

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.400
is between the 50th and 75th percentiles

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.540
which means it's performing better than 50% of similar apps

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.010
but not as good as some of the most successful apps

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:38.910
in its peer group.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.510
If you scan across metrics

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.820
you can see that this app is underperforming

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.240
on conversion rate and day seven retention.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.453
Let's uncover more detail by clicking view trends.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.330
In the trends view,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.100
you can see how your app is performing

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.993
against its peer group over time.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.120
For this app, you can see

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.620
that even though you're performing

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.723
below the 25th percentile,

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.870
your app's performance has been improving

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.940
compared to the benchmark.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.280
If you wanna evaluate how your app is doing

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.960
against a different peer group,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.900
you can customize which group you compare your app to

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.343
by clicking the dropdowns.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.880
For example, you can select peer groups

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.220
with different levels of download volumes

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.180
and see which download volume group your app belongs to.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.410
As a best practice,

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.980
consider selecting a more specific download volume grouping

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.330
if it's available to you

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.750
but please know that it may not be available in all cases

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.253
in order to maintain privacy.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.340
If your app belongs to both a primary

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.470
and secondary App Store category,

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.380
you can also compare your performance to either one

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.233
or against apps from all categories combined.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.340
You can use the compare to dropdown

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.180
to change which percentile you compare yourself against

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.070
and you can also adjust to the date range

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.533
to view shorter or longer periods of time.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.070
Consider exploring the different options

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.570
to determine which comparison

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.943
might make the most sense for your app.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.510
Next, let's see how you can use data

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.360
to take action on everything we've learned so far

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.030
to help improve your performance.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.600
The App Store offers many tools to help you improve,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.660
and today we'll focus on product page optimization,

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.303
custom product pages and in-app events.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.573
Let's start with product page optimization.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.090
With product page optimization,

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.150
you can test up to three alternative product pages

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.580
against your original product page assets

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.563
to see which one performs best.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.370
Test setup is done in App Store Connect

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.340
and once your product page optimization test begins,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.520
you can view your results by going to the acquisition tab

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.033
in App Analytics and selecting your individual test.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.390
On this page, you can view details

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.580
about how each treatment is performing

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.220
compared to your original product page.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.190
At the start of your test, you'll see indicators

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.130
that let you know the test is collecting data

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.440
and once enough data has been collected

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.670
the indicators will let you know

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.803
which treatments are performing better or worse

00:16:13.803 --> 00:16:15.663
than the original product page.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.100
You can scroll down the page to get more detail

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.870
about each treatment's performance,

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.940
including the number of impressions,

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.550
conversion rate, percent improvement,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.700
and the level of confidence in the results.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.720
We recommend waiting until you see at least 90% confidence

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.390
before making any decisions about the test

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.730
or applying any changes so you can be sure

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.500
that the changes you see are real

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.693
instead of just due to random chance.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.943
Next, let's talk about custom product pages.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.700
Custom product pages enable you

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.090
to create additional versions of your App Store product page

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.620
and drive specific audiences to each page using a unique URL

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.870
based on what you think might appeal to them.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.170
This customization gives you an opportunity

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.930
to drive a significantly higher conversion rate

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.763
than what you'd get

00:17:07.763 --> 00:17:10.830
by using the same product page for everyone.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.660
You can easily view the performance

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.723
of your custom product pages on the acquisition tab as well.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.720
By clicking on one of your product pages,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.730
you can view a variety of metrics

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.650
including product page views,

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.693
total downloads and conversion rate.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.230
You can also scroll down to view additional metrics

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.630
including average retention and sessions

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.733
to help you understand user engagement.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.520
For even deeper insights,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.220
you can go to the metrics tab and view the performance

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.343
of all of your product page views together in a single view.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.400
You can choose different metrics

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.560
and see how each page is performing

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.770
so you can find out which pages are working the best

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.930
and you can also add additional filters

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.850
like territory or source type

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.623
to drill down into the results.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.063
Lastly, let's talk about in-app events.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.500
In-app events are a great way to help drive more acquisition

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.690
and engagement with your app.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.690
You can use in-app events to promote app experiences

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.060
happening within your app or game

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.510
such as a game competition or new movie premiere,

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.693
and this can draw new and existing users into your app.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.830
Once you run your first in-app event,

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.720
you'll start seeing event metrics

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.520
including event impressions,

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.373
app opens, reminders and page views.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.700
You'll also see an in-app event section

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.413
appear on the acquisition tab.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.320
By clicking on one of these events,

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.420
you'll be able to see key metrics

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.460
including event impressions,

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.510
total downloads, notification taps, and app opens,

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.400
which allows you to get a better understanding

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.440
of what types of actions people take

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.090
when they engage with your event.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.600
You can click on these metrics,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.000
for example, event impressions,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.070
which will bring you to the metrics tab

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.440
and enable you to view even more data
