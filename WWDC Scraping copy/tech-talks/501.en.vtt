00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:03.770
With the introduction of
the revolutionary iPhone X

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.572
and AppleTV 4K,

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:08.542
the video playback experience
is taken to a whole new level

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:09.576
with the addition for support

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:12.846
for high dynamic range
and 4K video.

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:19.386
4K typically refers to
frame sizes up to 3840 by 2160,

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.188
offering an exceptionally
detailed

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:24.291
and high resolution image
when compared to HD.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:31.198
Wide color is supported across
iOS, macOS, and tvOS,

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.835
and the media frameworks support
up to the rec 2020 color space,

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:38.205
which covers about 75 percent of
the visible spectrum.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.441
The addition of support for HEVC

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.977
enables the delivery of
higher quality video

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:48.615
at about a 40 percent lower
bit rate compared to H.264.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.752
HDR video must be
delivered using HEVC.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.957
There are two HDR formats
that we support:

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.126
Dolby Vision and HDR10.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.263
HDR10 utilizes static metadata

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.800
that is applied to
the entire program.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.937
This metadata should be in
the HEVC configuration box

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.873
and not stored in
individual sample data.

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:18.745
For Dolby Vision content,
we support Profile 5,

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.214
which is single-layer,
10-bit HEVC,

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.984
and up to level 7.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.119
For both HDR formats,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.723
the content must be encoded
using HEVC.

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:32.893
You should include HDR variants
of less than or equal to

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:34.594
30 frames per second.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:37.197
And you must always provide
SDR variants

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.166
for both your
primary media content

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.568
as well as your
I-frame playlists.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:47.040
In order to help devices
select compatible variants,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.142
we have added
a new video range tag

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.945
to the HLS specification.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.848
If you include any
HDR variants in your playlist,

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.617
you must include this tag.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:01.221
Declare SDR for any
standard dynamic range variants

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:05.692
and PQ for HDR10
or Dolby Vision variants.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.694
This tag is an advisory
to the client

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.795
so that it will not attempt
to play streams

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:11.631
that it cannot support.

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.637
In order to support
HDCP TYPE-1 content protection,

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:22.309
the new TYPE-1 value has been
added to the HDCP level tag.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.411
This value is typically
applied to content

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:28.181
with a resolution of
greater than 1920 by 1080.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.384
This tag is also
advisory in nature

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:33.020
and prevents the client from
attempting to playback content

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.257
that can't be supported by
the currently attached display.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.160
To finish up, let's take
a quick look at a few examples

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.630
of how a playlist differentiates
the different types of content

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.234
and how the tags we just
discussed are applied.

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.971
This is an example of a standard
dynamic range HEVC stream

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:54.241
that does not require HDCP.

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.310
This second example
describes a 4K HDR stream

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.715
as indicated by the PQ value
of the "VIDEO-RANGE" tag.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:05.552
The "CODECS" tag describes it
as a Dolby Vision stream,

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.522
and the "HDCP-LEVEL" tag
indicates that TYPE-1

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:09.823
will be required in order to

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:13.393
successfully
playback the stream.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:16.163
This 4K HDR10 example
only differs from

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:19.299
the Dolby Vision example
by the "CODECS" tag.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.936
The "VIDEO-RANGE" and
"HDCP-LEVEL" tags are the same.
