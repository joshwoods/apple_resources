00:00:01.268 --> 00:00:03.003
iPhone X's super retina display

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.005
gives you more space
to display content

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.108
and create
deeply immersive experiences.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.776
This video will help you
get started

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.679
designing apps and games
that look and feel great

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.249
across all iOS devices.

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.618
First, let's review
some key aspects

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.353
of the new display.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:23.490
iPhone X 's display
has a 3x image scale factor.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.093
When producing and delivering
image assets,

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.730
we recommend using PDFs because
they're resolution-independent

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.133
and may significantly reduce
the size of your app.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.102
When rasterized images
are needed,

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.672
be sure to include
both 2x and 3x resolutions

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.974
in your app's asset catalog.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.143
To streamline
your production process,

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.212
we suggest using
the templates included

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:48.081
in the Apple UI Design
Resources.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.984
They're available to download
on the Resources page

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.553
of the Apple Human
Interface Guidelines.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.823
The iPhone X's
display dimensions

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:01.662
are 375 points wide
by 812 points tall.

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:09.770
On a 3x display,
this equals 1125 by 2436 pixels.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.676
375 points is the same width
as the 4.7 inch displays

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:19.680
of iPhone 6,
iPhone 7 and iPhone 8.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.281
So there shouldn't
be any difference

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.383
in the amount
of information presented

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:27.521
along the narrower dimension
of these devices.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.725
The 812 point height
is 145 points taller

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.860
than a 4.7 inch display.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.828
This additional height

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.532
provides about 20 percent
more space for content.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.934
Of course,
the most notable feature

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.704
of the super retina display
is its shape.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.206
The display follows
the design of the product

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:50.777
around all four rounded corners
for a symmetrical look.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.780
Updating your app to work
on the new display

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.149
involves extending
visual elements

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.685
to fill the display's view port,

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.688
while also keeping controls
and critical information

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.657
from getting clipped
in the corners

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:06.493
or covered
by the sensor housing.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.794
On iPhone X,

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:11.331
people access the app switcher
and the Home screen

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.233
by swiping up anywhere

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.003
along the bottom edge
of the display.

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.005
An indicator
at the bottom of the screen

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.774
offers a hint
about this interaction.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:24.311
This indicator is displayed
over your app's interface.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.514
You'll need to account for this
when designing your app.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:32.686
If your app uses UIKit controls
and auto-layout,

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.955
designing and developing
for iPhone X

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:38.592
and our other devices
should be straightforward.

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:39.993
Standard UIKit elements

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:44.164
such as navigation bars,
tables, and collection views,

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:48.335
automatically adjust
when viewed on iPhone X.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:51.071
Navigation bars,
tab bars, and toolbars

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.473
are positioned
and scaled appropriately

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.176
on all iOS devices.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.278
The navigation bar's
background material

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.548
is extended
to the display's top edge,

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.785
and the background material
of the tab bar and toolbar

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:07.721
is extended to the bottom,

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.423
while the elements they contain

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.825
are positioned
to prevent underlapping

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.028
or clipping
by other elements.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.763
In landscape orientation,

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:20.567
table views will span
the full width of the display,

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:24.905
while the table cell's
content view is inset.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:29.242
If your app uses auto-layout,
views can automatically adapt

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:32.312
to the iPhone X's
larger display size.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:36.583
For iOS 11, a new layout guide
was added to auto-layout

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:39.352
called a Safe Area layout
guide.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.854
The Safe Area layout guide

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:44.057
helps avoid
underlapping system UI elements

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.527
when positioning content
and controls.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:48.895
On iPhone 8,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.965
the Safe Area
is the same size as the viewport

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.434
if no bars are visible.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.703
If a status bar is visible,

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:59.106
the safe area's top edge
is lowered

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:01.708
to account for
the status bar's height.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.211
The Safe Area is further inset

00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:09.649
to accommodate a navigation bar
and toolbar or tab bar.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.184
On iPhone X,

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:15.689
the Safe Area layout guide
provides an additional benefit.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.892
It's inset from the top
and bottom of the screen edges

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:20.494
in portrait orientation,

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:23.897
even when no bars
are visible on screen.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:26.733
This helps you to prevent
interface elements

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.502
fromÂ getting clipped or covered

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:31.404
by positioning them away
from the sensor housing,

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:33.440
the display's
rounded corners,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.742
and the Home indicator.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.244
In landscape orientation,

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:40.480
the Safe Area is inset
from the sides of the screen

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.117
and the Home indicator
for the same reason.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.052
So, for example,

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:49.456
the width of the content view
in these table row cells

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.658
is constrained by the Safe Area

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:55.162
to keep them from underlapping
the sensor housing

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:56.196
or getting clipped

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:59.299
by the display's
rounded corners.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.102
And the table's top edge
has been inset

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:04.938
to avoid underlapping
the navigation bar.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.209
On iPhone 8, where occlusion
and clipping is not an issue,

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:12.379
the Safe Area width
matches the display's width

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.582
and the table is allowed to run
edge-to-edge.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.484
You'll notice
that text and controls

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.754
are actually inset
from the safe area.

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:23.623
This inset is achieved
using another layout guide

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.659
called a layout margin.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:26.860
Layout margins provide

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.596
consistent content margins
across apps

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:32.666
and help you to align content
to other controls

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:35.669
like navigation bar buttons.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.771
Even if you're not using
auto-layout,

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:41.007
UIView provides
the Safe Area insets

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.711
and layout margin values
as properties.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.148
Now, one final note
about auto-layout.

00:05:48.148 --> 00:05:51.384
iPhone 6, 7, 8, and X

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:55.021
all belong in
the compact width size class.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.791
This essentially means
that your app's layout

00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:02.162
should be consistent
on all these devices.

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:04.431
If your app
has custom controls

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.533
or non-standard layouts,

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.635
you may need to make
slight alterations

00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:12.772
to your app's interface
to work well on iPhone X.

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.208
There are two aspects to this.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.143
First, your app or game

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:20.580
should always fill the display
that it runs on.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.284
Placing black bars at the top
or bottom of the screen

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.453
makes your app
feel small, cramped,

00:06:26.453 --> 00:06:30.423
and inconsistent
with other apps on iPhone X.

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.425
When designing
background graphics,

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.394
or rendering background scenes,

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.896
keep in mind
that iPhone X's display

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:41.835
has a different aspect ratio
than a 4.7 inch display.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:46.940
Background graphics designed
for iPhone 8's 16:9 aspect ratio

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.278
will be cropped along the left
and right edges on iPhone X

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:53.313
if they're scaled to fill,

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:57.284
or letter-boxed
if scaled to fit.

00:06:57.284 --> 00:07:01.154
Similarly, background graphics
designed for iPhone X,

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:02.289
will either be cropped

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:05.859
along the top and bottom edges
on iPhone 8

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.761
or pillar-boxed.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.296
It's best compose images

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:12.465
so that critical visual
information remains visible

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:16.836
regardless of the display's
aspect ratio.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:20.373
The second part of updating
your layout involves insetting,

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:26.046
or repositioning interactive
elements and key information.

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:27.480
Any element that's positioned

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.517
too close to the viewport's
edges or corners

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:33.486
may get clipped
by the display's rounded corners

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:36.423
or covered
by the sensor housing.

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.158
So be sure to inset controls

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:40.493
and other elements
to avoid this.

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:44.931
Again, Safe Area layout
guides and layout margins

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:49.202
should be used for determining
proper inset values.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:50.503
It's also worth noting

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:53.373
that controls placed
along a device's edge

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:55.008
could be more difficult to reach

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:57.577
depending on how
the device is held.

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:00.847
Insetting controls can make
interacting with them faster

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.849
and more comfortable.

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:06.286
Visual elements
that appear tucked into corners

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:09.723
or under screen edges
may need to be revised

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:13.526
since insetting them
probably won't look right.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.661
In some cases,

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.397
a different visual treatment
may be necessary.

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:22.402
Please also note
that status bars are taller

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:24.137
on iPhone X.

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:25.972
Content views
that have been inset

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.741
by a fixed point value

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.444
will have their top edges
covered by the status bar.

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:35.014
On iPhone X, the status bar
no longer changes height

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.515
when background tasks,

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:39.119
like a phone call
or location tracking,

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:40.587
are running.

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:44.124
This helps create a more
consistent user experience

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.426
regardless
of the status bar style.

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:54.067
On iPhone X, the status bar
occupies an area of the screen

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:57.837
that your app
probably won't fully utilize.

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:59.706
If you have hidden
the status bar

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.509
to claim more space
for your app's interface,

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:06.446
you may want to reconsider
if that's still necessary.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:10.383
Now, one quick note
about landscape orientation.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.685
Most apps look and function best

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:16.790
when controls and visual
information are centered.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.058
Asymmetrical layouts
that shift around

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.294
based on how
the device is rotated

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:24.431
will lead to an inconsistent
user experience

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.399
and can undermine
people's ability

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.234
to build muscle memory.

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.305
Finally,
a few key considerations

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.740
related to the indicator

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.842
that lets people know
they can swipe up

00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:39.479
to access the app switcher
and Home Screen.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:42.248
Because this interaction
is core to the experience

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.250
of using an iOS device,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.654
the indicator should always
be clearly visible.

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:49.422
To help accomplish this,

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.692
iOS dynamically adjusts
the indicator's appearance

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:57.297
to maintain sufficient contrast
relative to the background.

00:09:57.297 --> 00:10:00.767
The indicator appears dark
against lighter backgrounds,

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.703
and light
against darker backgrounds.

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:05.505
When designing
your app's interface

00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:07.774
to work well
with the Home indicator,

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.710
it's best to avoid
placing interface elements

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.414
in close proximity
to the indicator.

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:17.617
Simply leave some negative
space around the indicator

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:22.355
by placing all non-scrollable
content within the safe area.

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.990
It's also not desirable

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.259
to draw special attention
to the indicator

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:28.328
through visual adornments

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:31.865
such as brackets,
bezels, or other means.

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.901
As mentioned earlier,

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:37.904
people will access
the app switcher and Home screen

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:39.272
by swiping upward

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:41.841
from the bottom edge
of the display.

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:42.942
In most cases,

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:46.679
swipe gestures tend to occur
in the center of the display,

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:49.349
so this interaction
is unlikely to conflict

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:52.051
with interactions in your app.

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:55.255
However, if your app or game
encourages people

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:58.391
to swipe along the very
bottom of the display,

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:01.261
you may want
to turn on edge protection

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:04.063
for the bottom edge
of the display.

00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:07.166
This will give the indicator
a more subtle appearance

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.701
and change it's behavior

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:12.872
so that two swipes
are required to exit your app.

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:14.774
The first swipe, or drag,

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:18.945
lifts the indicator
and enables the control.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:20.380
While swiping a second time

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.883
allows people
to exit your app or game.

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:28.154
Because edge protection leads to
an inconsistent user experience,

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:32.358
it should be used only
when it's absolutely necessary.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.660
Unlike swipes,

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.828
tapping the bottom edge
of the display

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:39.032
will only affect
your app or game.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.367
For example,
tapping a table row cell

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.769
has the same result

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:45.071
whether or not
it's behind the indicator.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:48.041
Vertically scrollable views,

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.577
such as tables
or collection views,

00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:53.880
should extend all the way
to the bottom of the display

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.417
rather than being constrained
by the Safe Area.

00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:00.987
Lastly, you can enable
an auto-hide behavior

00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:05.124
when presenting
full screen visual content.

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.560
Auto-hide causes
the indicator to fade out

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.797
if the display hasn't been
touched for a few seconds

00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:14.434
and fade back in
when the display is touched.

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:18.538
Use auto-hide sparingly
and only for passive experiences

00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:23.309
where people are unlikely
to touch the display frequently.

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:26.379
