00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:05.372
Welcome to this video on
QR code recognition in iOS 11.

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:10.377
Quick Response code is a type
of two-dimensional barcode

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:13.981
used to embed information,
such as URLs.

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.352
In iOS 11, we have added
system support

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:23.123
to automatically detect QR codes
in both Camera and Safari.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.058
First, let's look at Camera.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.396
Camera automatically
scans for QR codes

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.665
in Photo and Square modes.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.568
This works even from
the Lock screen.

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:38.772
Telling Siri to scan a QR code
will also take you to Camera.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.409
Here's how it works.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.879
Simply point the camera
at a QR code.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.547
A notification will drop down,

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.384
describing the action
that you can perform.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.455
Tapping on the notification
will perform the action,

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.725
which in this case
navigates to apple.com.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.060
It's that simple.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.732
iOS supports many data types
for QR codes.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.102
Next, I'll go through each type
in detail.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:13.907
Feel free to grab your
iOS device and scan these codes.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.777
Here's an example
of a location QR code

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.612
that uses the geo scheme

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:22.516
that lets you encode
a point on the Earth.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:26.019
Tapping on the notification
takes you to the Maps app

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.422
with a pin dropped
at that location.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:33.694
You can accomplish the same
thing with an Apple Maps URL,

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:38.065
which gives you more flexibility
in describing the location.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:41.868
For example, you can specify
the actual address this way.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.142
For text message QR codes,
you can encode an SMS URI.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.511
Tapping on the notification
brings you

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.514
to the message compose window
for this phone number

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.116
in the Messages app.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:01.054
The SMSTO format
is also supported

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.057
for describing
a text message action.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.059
This format allows you
to prepopulate

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.961
the text message content.

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:11.765
For email addresses,

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.801
you could just encode
the address directly.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.804
But to ensure it's treated
as an email address,

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:22.476
it is recommended that you
create a mailto URI for it.

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.145
Tapping on this notification
takes you

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.314
to the new message window
in Mail

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.816
with the recipient's
email prefilled.

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:33.987
Similarly for phone numbers,

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.790
a tel URI should be used
to ensure it's recognized

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.192
as a phone number properly.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.896
Tapping on the notification will
initiate a call to that number

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.498
in the Phone app.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:50.837
For contact QR codes,
iOS supports the vCard format.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.775
These codes could be useful
on business cards.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.611
Tapping on this notification
shows you a preview

00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:02.516
of the contact card with options
to save to your contacts list.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.684
You can also encode
contact information

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.319
with the MeCard format,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.023
which is usually less verbose
than the vCard format.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.461
iOS supports event QR codes

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:17.297
encoded with
the iCalendar format.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:21.201
Tapping on this notification
adds the event to your calendar

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.537
and shows you the event details.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.208
Lastly, iOS supports QR codes

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:31.044
containing Wi-Fi
configuration information,

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:35.015
such as the authentication type,
the network SSID,

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:36.683
and the password.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.820
Hidden SSIDs are not supported.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.190
This type of QR code
is useful for quickly connecting

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.993
to a Wi-Fi network in
an Internet cafe, for example,

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.229
where the user
no longer needs to type in

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.099
all the information themselves.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.935
When the user taps on
the Wi-Fi QR code banner,

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:57.938
they'll be prompted
to connect to the Wi-Fi network.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.508
I've just shown you
examples of QR codes

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:04.344
that are handled
by other system apps.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.179
But what about your app?

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.448
How can you direct a user
to your app

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.518
after scanning a QR code?

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:13.887
You can support universal links
so your users

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:16.555
can be seamlessly directed
to your installed app

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:17.824
when they scan a QR code

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.360
containing a link
to your website.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.028
Here's an example.

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:25.265
Let's say you manage
both pizza.example.com

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.634
and also the PizzaFinder app.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.237
You publish a QR code
with a link to your website

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:34.074
so the user can access it
with a quick scan.

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:36.843
But you'd also like
to direct your users

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:39.045
to the PizzaFinder app
seamlessly

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.348
if they have the app installed.

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:44.718
Adding support
for universal links is simple.

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:47.988
First, create an
apple-app-site-association file

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.590
that you'll place
at the root of your server

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.030
or in the .well-known
subdirectory, served over https.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.432
In this file,
you specify your app ID

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.535
along with the paths
from your website

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:04.738
that should be handled
as universal links.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:09.709
The value of the app ID key
is the team ID or app ID prefix,

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:12.679
followed by
the bundle identifier.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.815
Then include the list of domains
that your app wants to handle

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:19.186
in your app's
Associated Domains entitlement.

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:20.787
To do this in Xcode,

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:24.457
open the Associated Domains
section in the Capabilities tab

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:29.262
and add an entry for each domain
that your app supports.

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:33.600
Now, with universal links set up
between the website and the app,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.536
scanning a QR code
with a URL to the website

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:40.473
can take the user
directly to your app.

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.309
You can even set up
universal links

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:46.947
to link to specific areas
within your app.

00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:50.550
If the PizzaFinder app
is not installed on the device,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.020
then the URL
will be loaded in Safari.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.856
That's why it's important
to provide an App Store link

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.359
to your app from that page
so your users

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:04.097
can easily install your app
for future QR code scans.

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:07.667
The best way to do that
is by adding a Smart App Banner.

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.369
This is useful
even if you integrate

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.905
your own QR code scanner
in your app

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:14.874
since it's very easy
to launch Camera on your phone,

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.043
even from the Lock screen.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:20.547
Now your users can quickly open
QR codes that you publish

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:24.451
without launching your app
first.

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:27.053
To add a Smart App Banner
to your website,

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.522
include this meta tag
in the head of each page

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:32.325
where you'd like
the banner to appear.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:35.295
You can search for your app
on the iTunes Link Maker page

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:38.331
to get the app ID.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.768
Now, let's say over time
pizza.example.com

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.371
has been extended
to allow people to post stories

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:46.973
about their pizza experiences.

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.975
A separate app called
PizzaStories

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:52.646
has been developed to handle
that functionality, too.

00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:55.882
You can use universal links
to associate that app

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:57.550
with the website as well.

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.322
To set up universal link
for PizzaStories,

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.424
you just need to add
another entry

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.960
to the
apple-app-site-association file

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.831
with the application's
bundle identifier.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.433
You also need
to set PizzaStories'

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:19.339
Associated Domains entitlement
just like in PizzaFinder.

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.108
Now, with universal links
set up for both apps,

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.744
when your user scans
your QR code for the first time

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.113
and both PizzaFinder
and PizzaStories

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.782
are installed on the device,

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:32.152
they will see an app QR code
notification like this.

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:36.222
When they tap
on the notification,

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:39.125
an alert will appear prompting
them to pick the application

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.861
to open the URL in.

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:44.831
Let's say the user picks
the PizzaStories app.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:47.400
Their preference will be saved.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.337
The next item the user
scans that QR code again,

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:52.672
the preferred application
will be offered

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:56.276
as a default application
to open the URL in.

00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:59.012
The user can still change
their preferred application

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:00.547
by using 3D Touch

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:03.883
or by pulling down
on the notification.

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.151
In addition to Camera,

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:10.990
we've also added QR codes
support to Safari on iOS 11.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.692
Here's how it works.

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:15.995
When you use 3D Touch to
preview an image on a web page,

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.765
Safari will check the image
for a QR code,

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:22.135
and if it finds one,
adds extra menu actions

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:24.137
related to the contents
of the code.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.509
You can also long press
on the QR code image,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.179
and the extra menu actions
will appear in the context menu.

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:38.183
To summarize, in this video
we have shown you

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:42.121
how your users can more easily
scan QR codes directly

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.691
from Camera and Safari.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.526
By adopting universal links,

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.062
your users will have
a more seamless experience

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:52.365
by being directed
straight into your app.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.368
And for those who don't have
your application installed yet,

00:08:55.368 --> 00:09:00.106
Smart App Banner is the best way
to show them where to get it.

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.274
For more information

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:03.476
about what we've covered
in this video,

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:05.879
including how to adopt
universal links

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.581
and promote apps
with a Smart App Banner,

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.550
use the links
in the resources section

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.886
associated with this video.
