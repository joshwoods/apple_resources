00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:02.369
Jacob Clingerman: Hi, I'm Jacob.

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:04.771
I'm part of the Enterprise
and Education team

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.073
and I'm here to talk about

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:07.541
existing app distribution
methods

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.610
for business and education
customers

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.845
and to introduce
a new option for getting apps

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.282
to your institutional customers.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.385
As a developer for business
or education institutions,

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.088
you have different audiences
who use your apps.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.056
These could be
company employees,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.026
affiliated partners,
students and teachers,

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.794
and the general public.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:31.431
Each of these audiences have
different ways they get apps.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.134
Let's review the current
app distribution options

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:38.238
and what methods are available
for each audience.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.340
If you're developing
and distributing an app

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.142
for a consumer audience,

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.177
you publish the app
in the App Store,

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:48.515
and customers install it
on their own personal devices.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.818
If you're building a general
productivity app for consumers,

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:55.122
students, teachers,
and business professionals,

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:59.893
the public App Store is
how you'd distribute it.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.663
Now if you're building apps
for institutional customers

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.032
in the enterprise
and education space,

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:08.302
you have additional distribution
options to consider.

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:11.371
This audience could include
company employees,

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.740
school teachers, and students.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.176
You can still publish
these apps to the App Store,

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.812
like the productivity apps
example.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.514
You can also make
these apps available

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:23.684
for private distribution,
using custom apps

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:27.254
or the Apple Developer
Enterprise Program.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.857
Customers in this audience
will use Apple Business Manager

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.260
or Apple School Manager
to purchase apps

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.495
on behalf of their employees
and students

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.431
and manage these apps
on corporate

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:39.499
or institutional devices

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.468
using a Mobile Device
Management --

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.437
or MDM -- solution.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.175
Use the App Store
if you're developing an app

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.844
that is intended
for the general public.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.880
Organizations will also be able
to distribute these apps

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.616
as managed through
Apple Business Manager

00:01:56.616 --> 00:02:00.587
or Apple School Manager
and MDM.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.556
This means the app
can easily be used

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:05.392
by both consumers
on unmanaged devices

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:08.862
and employees or students
on managed devices.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.331
Numbers is a good example
of this kind of app.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.934
It has functionality
for the general public,

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.103
consumers can get it
through the App Store,

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:18.505
and institutional customers
might install it

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.508
as a managed app on all
corporate-owned devices

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:25.612
as part of a baseline
productivity suite.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:29.116
App Store distribution is what
you're used to as a consumer.

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:31.918
Employees can choose apps
they want to install themselves

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.554
on personal
or unmanaged devices,

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.224
and institutional customers
can purchase licenses

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:40.527
in Apple Business Manager
or Apple School Manager

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:46.566
and assign those licenses
to managed devices using MDM.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.102
In contrast,
custom apps are designed

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.872
for private distribution
to organizations

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.474
who manage apps
on behalf of their employees,

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:57.344
staff, and students.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.179
These can be apps
that you develop in-house

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.181
for distribution
to your employees,

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.017
or they can be apps that you
develop and make available

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.454
directly to specific
business and education customers

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:09.056
that you designate.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:13.026
You can create custom apps
for iPhone, iPad, Mac,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.228
and Apple TV.

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.098
Custom apps are purchased
using Apple School Manager

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:22.436
and Apple Business Manager
and deployed using MDM.

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.838
Many business developers
follow this model.

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.040
They make standard versions
of their apps available

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.508
on the public App Store

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:31.945
and also design tailored
versions for specific customers

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:35.015
that are only available to them.

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:37.384
For more information
about custom apps,

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.754
refer to the WWDC 2020 session

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:45.659
"Custom app distribution
with Apple Business Manager."

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.195
And if you're distributing apps
internally,

00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:51.364
and your organization meets
the eligibility requirements,

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.968
you can use the Apple Developer
Enterprise Program.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:58.371
This allows large organizations
to develop and deploy

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:03.009
proprietary, internal-use apps
to their employees.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.779
This program is
for specific use cases

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.714
that require
private distribution

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:11.084
using secure internal systems.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.819
You need to have
systems in place

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.090
to ensure only employees can
download your internal-use apps,

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.994
and to protect membership
credentials and assets.

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.530
And you must
participate in and pass

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.365
Apple’s verification interview

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:30.403
and continuous
evaluation process.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:33.306
The last type of audience you
might want to distribute apps to

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:36.176
is third parties affiliated
with your customers

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:39.279
but who aren't direct
employees or students.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.947
These could be
business partners,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:44.050
franchise employees,
or other end users with devices

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.419
that aren't managed
by the organization,

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.223
like higher education students
or part-time employees.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:53.360
This audience isn't eligible
for managed distribution

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.997
through Apple Business Manager
or Apple School Manager.

00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:59.766
Currently, your only option
for distributing apps

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.269
to this audience is
through the App Store,

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.704
but that might not work
in all cases,

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:07.807
for example, when your app
doesn't meet the requirement

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.876
for broad public interest

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:13.246
and it wouldn't be
a good fit for the App Store.

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.115
One example of this use case

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.918
is an app for auto sales
and service.

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:20.554
An auto manufacturer wants
to develop and distribute

00:05:20.554 --> 00:05:23.089
a single app
to their dealer network,

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.358
and their end users
are the affiliated

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.661
independent auto dealers.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.996
The only way to distribute
an app like this

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.565
has been through the App Store,

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:35.802
even though it is intended
for a select, limited audience.

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:39.639
I’m happy to share more about another distribution option:

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.575
unlisted apps.

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:43.610
This addresses the need
to distribute an app

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.478
to a more limited audience

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:48.848
that includes both unmanaged
and managed users.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.617
We're going to spend
some time reviewing

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:56.389
how you can incorporate
unlisted apps into your toolkit.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.860
First, I'll give an overview
of what unlisted apps are.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.064
I'll talk about when you would
consider using them.

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:06.933
I'll cover how you can make
these available,

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:10.036
and how to apply
and get started.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:13.206
Let's meet unlisted apps.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.176
Unlisted apps are distributed
through the App Store

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:19.312
just like public App Store apps.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.647
You use your existing

00:06:20.647 --> 00:06:24.184
individual or organization
developer program account

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:27.988
to submit and manage the app
on App Store Connect.

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:31.491
The app can be paid or free
and goes through App Review

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.995
like a standard App Store app
or custom app.

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:37.330
You can make your app
available in all regions

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.533
where the App Store
is available.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:43.837
The primary difference is
that your app is not searchable

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:46.039
and the only way
end users can get it

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.042
is if they have
the unique app URL.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:51.811
It also doesn't show up in
"More by this developer"

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.347
when browsing
the standard App Store.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:56.116
One important thing to note,

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:59.386
while in-app purchase is
available for unlisted Apps,

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.221
in-app purchases
are not supported

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:04.357
for managed app distribution
through Apple School Manager

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:07.327
and Apple Business Manager.

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:10.163
With unlisted apps,
you get an App Store page

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:14.901
with a URL
which you can share as needed.

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:18.238
This gives you the ability
to develop and deploy an app

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:21.174
that otherwise wouldn't be
eligible for the App Store

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.109
because it has
a limited audience

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:26.546
or a specific functionality.

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:28.648
Unlisted Apps
are a great solution

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:32.118
if you have an app that you need
to deploy to a limited audience

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:36.956
that includes unmanaged users
and managed users.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:41.428
For unmanaged users,
you can send the user the URL;

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:44.998
and for managed audiences,
you can assign the app licenses

00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:49.402
through Apple Business Manager
or Apple School Manager and MDM

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:53.206
resulting in a managed app.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:58.845
Approval is requested, reviewed,
and granted on a per-app basis.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.814
We'll go into more details
on this process

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:04.651
during the Submission
and Review section.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.220
Now, let's talk about
some specific examples

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.490
of when you'd use unlisted apps.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.525
Let's say you're developing
an app that's intended

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:15.428
for shift workers
or part-time employees

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:17.364
using their own devices.

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:20.300
Maybe a timecard app
or a shift-scheduling app

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.702
that's specific
to their company.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.071
Unlisted apps would be
a great option here,

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.341
because the app is intended
for a limited audience:

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.577
specific store
retail employees

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:33.880
who aren't using
managed devices.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.815
And back to the automotive
example,

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.084
where an auto manufacturer
wants to distribute

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:39.986
an app to its dealerships;

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:43.223
many separate business entities,
potentially with a mix

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:45.825
of managed
and unmanaged devices.

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:49.028
Unlisted apps make it possible
to distribute this app

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:53.500
to third parties in a simple
and effective way.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.603
And we see Volvo Cars
is doing just that.

00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:59.072
With a strong emphasis
on customer service,

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:02.742
Volvo Cars wants to empower
its dealership network in Sweden

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.477
with an app
that lets them provide

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:08.882
an excellent service experience
to their shared customers.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.618
The app enables Volvo Cars'
service technicians

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:14.888
with key features like alerts
when a customer arrives,

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.991
insight into a car’s
entire service history,

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:22.061
and prompt reminders to carry
out crucial follow-up calls.

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:25.498
Volvo Cars uses unlisted apps
to publish this app

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:28.268
through the App Store
without it being searchable,

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:31.171
as it's intended
for only a limited audience --

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:33.406
dealership employees.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.142
Volvo shares the link
with their dealerships

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:41.714
who then provide it
to their own employees.

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.783
Unlisted apps are a new option,

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:46.886
but this doesn't replace
existing distribution methods.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.622
If your app is intended
for the general public,

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:52.459
continue to use the App Store
for your app.

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:56.529
If you or your customers are
deploying just to employees,

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:59.566
Custom apps are likely
the better option.

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:02.335
Unlisted apps are intended
as an alternative

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.237
when existing
distribution methods

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:08.675
aren't the right fit for you
or your customers.

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:13.680
Next, let's take a look at how
end users get these apps.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.883
There are two methods
for distributing unlisted apps.

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:21.554
The first is sharing the app URL
using email, website,

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.690
or some other private method.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.758
Once the user gets the URL,

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.560
they are directed
to the App Store,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.263
where they will download
and install the app

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:33.533
just as they normally would
with an App Store app.

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:36.469
The second method
is managed distribution

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.873
through Apple Business Manager
and Apple School Manager.

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:42.842
A content manager
or other authorized user

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:45.411
enters the URL
in Apps and Books,

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.948
then purchases or requests
the number of licenses they need

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:51.150
for their organization.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:58.024
After that, the app is installed
on managed devices using MDM.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:00.593
Because unlisted apps
use the App Store,

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.328
you can make
these apps available

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.197
for unmanaged distribution

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:06.666
in all regions where
the App Store is available

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.701
and for managed
distribution in regions

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.403
where Apple Business Manager

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:13.606
and Apple School Manager
are available.

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:17.176
These are publicly available
if the user has the URL.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:21.614
Unlisted apps should not be
used as a security feature.

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:24.551
Consider implementing
a mechanism within your app

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.553
to prevent unauthorized use

00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:30.356
if your app contains
sensitive information.

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:33.760
Now, let's talk about how to get
started and how to make sure

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.331
your unlisted app gets through
app review smoothly.

00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:40.533
First, you’ll need
to submit a request

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.869
for unlisted app distribution.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.971
This is a conditional
approval process

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:47.040
and each request
will be reviewed

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.009
to make sure your app
meets the requirements.

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:52.145
For new apps,
you can submit the request

00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:53.980
as soon as you have
an app record

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.384
with “Prepare for Submission”
or later status.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.852
If your app was already approved

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.988
for public download
on the App Store,

00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:03.523
simply submit the request

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:05.959
and include information
about your app.

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.728
This allows you to convert
an existing Public app

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.197
to unlisted
if it meets the criteria

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:15.735
and if it would be better suited
to unlisted app distribution.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:18.805
If your app was already approved
for private distribution,

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:22.141
you’ll need to create a new app
record in App Store Connect,

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:23.576
upload your binary,

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.778
and set the distribution method
to Public

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:28.815
before completing
the request form.

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:30.550
If you have additional apps,

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.654
you'll need to submit
a separate request for each one.

00:12:34.654 --> 00:12:38.524
For more information and
to apply for an unlisted app,

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:41.461
review the "Unlisted
app distribution" article

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:45.531
on developer.apple.com.

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:48.501
Once your app is approved
for unlisted app distribution,

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.436
you'll see the distribution
option change

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.305
in App Store Connect.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:54.941
Once the distribution method
is set to Unlisted,

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.344
this will persist across
all future app updates.

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:02.181
If this is an existing app,
the app will now be unlisted.

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.616
If this is a new app,

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:07.954
you will then continue
with app submission as usual.

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.290
Even though unlisted apps are
intended for a limited audience,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.926
you still need to follow
app review guidelines.

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.828
Use only public APIs,

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:18.564
make sure your app runs
on the currently shipping OS,

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.299
and adhere to privacy guidelines

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.969
for collecting and storing
user data.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.837
You want to make it easy
for your audience

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:25.972
to use your app.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.940
Review the human interface
guidelines

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.575
for in-depth information

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:33.246
and UI resources
for designing great apps.

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:35.548
Provide demo account
and credentials

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:38.317
if your app requires
authentication.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:42.121
This demo account should be able
to access all functions.

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:45.525
The intent is to make sure the
review team is able to inspect

00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:49.862
all the functionality
and features of your app.

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:52.832
Submit good metadata
such as description,

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.834
keywords, and screen shots,

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.936
that show details
about your app.

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.337
Because you are providing
your app

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.940
to a specific audience
or market segment,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.742
it's useful to include
those details

00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:06.479
in the notes for App Review.

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:08.781
Wrapping up,
you have decisions to make

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:12.819
when you determine how your app
will get to end users.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.420
Choose the public App Store

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.290
if your app is
of broad public interest.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.760
Enterprise and education
customers can deploy these

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.431
as a managed apps
to their employees and staff.

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:28.468
Choose custom apps when
you are privately distributing

00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:32.305
to a select group of customers
or internal employees

00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:34.974
who are assigning the app
as a managed app

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:37.443
to their end users.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.979
The Apple Developer
Enterprise Program

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:42.815
is only for the internal use
and distribution

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:46.152
of proprietary apps
and specific use cases

00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:48.955
that are not adequately
addressed with public apps

00:14:48.955 --> 00:14:52.492
on the App Store
or custom apps.

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:56.062
And now, unlisted apps allow you
to distribute an app

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.364
to a limited audience
when you need to your app

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.466
to go through
public distribution

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:05.838
for both an unmanaged
and managed audience.

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.775
Unlisted apps are available
for use today.

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:09.976
Thanks for watching,

00:15:09.976 --> 00:15:13.212
and we look forward to seeing
what you do with unlisted apps.
