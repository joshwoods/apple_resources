00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.770
Mike Stern: The new iPad Pro
features an all-screen design

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.373
so people can focus
on what matters most:

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:09.543
immersing themselves
in your app or game.

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:11.478
And the second generation
Apple Pencil

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.513
includes
a new double-tap feature

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:17.184
that makes it even more capable
and convenient.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.820
Let's talk about
how to update your app's design

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.624
to take advantage
of these new features.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.792
The 11-inch iPad Pro display

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:32.332
is 1,194 by 834 points
at 2x resolution.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.835
The 12.9-inch iPad Pro's display

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:41.675
is 1,366 by 1,024 points
at 2x resolution.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:46.380
In pixels, that's 2,388 by 1,668

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.084
and 2,732 by 2,048.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.554
The 12.9-inch display
is the same width and height

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.490
as the previous generation.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.492
The 11-inch iPad Pro display

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:01.728
has the same height
as a 10.5-inch iPad Pro,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:07.100
while being 82 points,
or 164 pixels, wider.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.070
The new iPad Pros
feature a thin bezel

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.638
and rounded corners.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.341
As with current generation
iPhone displays,

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:17.377
avoid placing
critical information or controls

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.781
into the extreme corners
of your interface.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:25.085
For many apps, the status bar
and UIKit navigation bar,

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.020
toolbar, and tab bar

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.757
will automatically
inset elements correctly.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.493
And, as with iPhone,
a Home indicator

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.362
lets people know
they can swipe up

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:39.132
to return to the Home screen
and switch apps.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.269
To make sure your app or game
looks great on iPad Pro,

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:44.805
you'll want to follow
three best practices

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:47.374
when laying out your interface.

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:50.010
First, use safe area
layout guides

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.746
to prevent interface elements
from getting clipped

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:54.881
by the display's
rounded corners,

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.883
or covered
by the Home indicator.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.385
Safe areas are determined

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:01.888
by insets from each edge
of the screen.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:04.992
With nothing on screen,
all insets are zero,

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:06.660
except for the bottom.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.762
The bottom safe area inset
keeps elements

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:11.365
from getting covered
by the Home indicator.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:15.002
The inset is 20 points
in portrait orientation

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.504
and in landscape.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.007
While it may be tempting
to put UI elements

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.009
on either side
of the Home indicator,

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.543
it's not recommended.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.879
The Home indicator
is centered in the display.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.217
In a split view, its position
relative to your app will change

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:33.286
and may cover
interface elements.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.888
When a status bar is displayed,

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.657
the top inset value
is 24 points.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:41.762
That's slightly taller than
the 20-point top inset on iPhone

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:44.664
and previous generation iPads.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.034
A quick but important side note.

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:49.870
Apps running in Slide Over
will have zero height

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.973
top and bottom
safe area insets.

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:56.276
The safe area is further inset
to accommodate

00:02:56.276 --> 00:03:00.747
a navigation bar
and tab bar or toolbar.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.215
In both orientations,

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.385
the left and right
safe area insets are zero.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:08.522
That's different from iPhone,
where left and right insets

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.290
keep elements
from getting covered

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.126
by the device's sensor housing.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:16.363
Next, use layout margins
to inset content

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.566
from the left and right
screen edges.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:23.270
Layout margins provide
breathing space between content

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.106
and the display's
left and right edges.

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.741
They're great
for aligning content

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:29.509
to elements
in the navigation bar,

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.513
toolbar, and status bar,
and they keep content

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:36.750
from scrolling into
the display's rounded corners.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.987
The width of layout margins
varies based on size class.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:46.693
They are 20 points for regular
and 16 points for compact.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:49.229
Finally, be ready
to accommodate

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.631
multiple aspect ratios.

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:55.435
All previous iPads
had a 4:3 aspect ratio.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:04:00.373
The new 11-inch iPad Pro
has a wider aspect ratio.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.242
If your app
is designed and built

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.878
for a 4:3 aspect ratio only,

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:07.347
you'll need to allow
for more flexibility

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.382
in your design and code.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:14.221
For example, a game that's only
designed for a 4:3 aspect ratio

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:17.690
may wind up having black bars
along the smaller screen edges

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.026
if it's scaled
to fit the display.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.229
If the game were scaled
to fill the display,

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.198
parts of the UI
could wind up off screen.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:28.368
So take care to thoughtfully
position and scale

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.137
individual interface elements

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.772
so that your app and game
looks great,

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:37.077
regardless of the display's
aspect ratio.

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.813
Alongside our latest
generation iPad Pro,

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:43.517
we're introducing a new,
more powerful Apple Pencil.

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:46.686
The new Pencil has
all the same capabilities

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:48.788
as the previous generation.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.259
This includes the ability
to use pressure, or force,

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.096
to control things like
brush opacity and size,

00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:59.900
and the ability to sense
altitude and azimuth,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.769
two properties that,
when combined with each other,

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:05.305
deliver a fantastic
tilt experience

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.275
for expressive
and realistic shading.

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:11.711
The new Apple Pencil
adds a double-tap gesture.

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.014
In the Settings app,
people can choose

00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:16.783
one of four behaviors
for double-tap.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:18.518
These system-wide behaviors

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:22.055
offer people a consistent
and predictable experience.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.590
People can switch between

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.893
the currently selected
tool and eraser,

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:30.397
switch between the
current tool and last used tool,

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:32.566
show a color palette,

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:39.172
or if they prefer,
turn the double-tap gesture off.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.007
Because every
app is unique,

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.510
you'll need to give some thought
to what double-tap does

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.678
in your app.

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.379
To help you make the right call,

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.249
please consider
the following best practices,

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.751
starting with the most basic.

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.554
If a person has turned
double-tap off

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.022
at the system level,

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:59.960
your app should do nothing
in response to double-tap.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.663
If someone using your app
has turned double-tap off,

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:07.300
they'll expect every app
to respect that choice.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.037
More generally, your app
should follow the system setting

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.440
whenever possible.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.076
Apple Pencil
is a mark-making tool

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.411
and the system settings
reflect that.

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.780
If your app
has multiple drawing tools,

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.018
an eraser, and color palette,
people will expect your app

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:28.622
to mirror whatever choice
they've made in Settings.

00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:32.092
Being inconsistent will make
your app less intuitive,

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:34.427
especially when multitasking
with another app

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.630
that supports Apple Pencil.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.866
If you decide to offer
another behavior for double-tap

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.968
beyond the choices shown here,

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:44.638
make that custom behavior
opt-in,

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:48.842
meaning it should be optional
and not enabled by default.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:51.911
Display the option
to enable your custom behavior

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.481
within your app's settings.

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:55.615
This will require people

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:58.285
to make an explicit
and deliberate choice

00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:01.388
to override
the system-level behavior.

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:04.057
It will make it more clear
why double-tapping Apple Pencil

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:07.093
leads to a different behavior
in your app.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.730
And if they decide to turn off
your app's custom behavior,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.466
they'll be more likely
to remember how.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.903
Now, there are apps that work
great with Apple Pencil

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:20.173
but do not have multiple tools
or a color palette.

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:21.875
If that describes your app,

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:25.111
it won't be possible
to follow the system settings.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.381
However, you can still
provide a double-tap behavior

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:31.551
that's consistent with
the spirit of these settings.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:34.554
Meaning, double-tap should
modify the behavior

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.156
of Apple Pencil.

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:39.259
So, for example, a photo app
may include effects

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:42.896
with masks the user can
paint onto their images.

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:44.531
Double-tapping Apple Pencil

00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:47.133
could toggle between
two painting modes:

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:51.371
Adding to or subtracting
from the effect mask.

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.239
What double-tapping
should not do

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:57.143
is perform an action
that directly modifies content.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.379
An action performed
with double-tap

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.047
could be done accidentally

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:03.883
and cause significant
workflow issues.

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:07.153
Now, whatever double-tapping
does in your app,

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:11.257
always be sure to provide clear
and immediate visual feedback

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:13.760
about what double-tapping did.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.562
It's important
that people realize

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:18.164
they've changed
the behavior of their pencil

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:21.167
before they resume
drawing or writing.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:25.572
And, finally, be prepared
to deliver a great experience

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.974
to existing Pencil users.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:30.410
More specifically,
double-tapping

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.812
shouldn't provide
special functionality

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:36.916
that isn't easily achievable
through your app's interface.

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:40.919

download the latest version of
the iOS Apple Design Resources.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:58.138
We've updated the iPad templates
for Sketch and Photoshop.

00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:00.140
Thank you!
