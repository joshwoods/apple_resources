WEBVTT

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.600
Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.180
Today, we'll discuss how you can make the most

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.310
of custom product pages.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.260
We've designed this presentation

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.780
for people who are familiar with this feature

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.930
and hoping to enhance their custom product pages

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.730
on the App Store.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.340
If you need a refresher on what this feature is

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.260
and how to set it up, you can check

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.040
our Get started with custom product pages video

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.740
on the Apple Developer website.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.190
Now, let's get into today's presentation.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.990
I'm Savannah and I'm part of the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.360
App Store Business Management team,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.753
and I'll be joined by Chris from the Apple Search Ads team.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.260
Today, we'll start with a quick summary

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.660
of what custom product pages are.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.540
Then, we'll share some success stories featuring

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.110
developers who have effectively used this feature.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.960
Then, Chris will share how custom product pages

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.240
can be used with Apple Search Ads

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.150
along with some developer success stories.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.240
Then, we'll conclude with some general takeaways

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.820
to keep in mind as you continue to create

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.713
your custom product pages.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.773
First, let's briefly recap what custom product pages are.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.490
Custom product pages allow you to create

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.700
additional versions of your App Store product page,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.570
each of which highlights a specific feature or content

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.540
that might appeal to a particular audience.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.700
So for an app like Mountain Climber,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.860
you could create one page to highlight

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.300
the live streaming feature

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.160
for people interested in following

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.890
their favorite climbers in real time,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.400
or another page highlighting the GPS tracking feature

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.983
to help people find their friends on a hike.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.400
For each custom product page,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.740
you can customize your screenshots,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.830
app preview videos, and promotional text,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.790
and you can create up to 35 different custom product pages

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.380
in App Store Connect.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.450
Just like your default product page,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.973
each page is fully localizable.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.840
You can submit custom product pages to App Review

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.180
independent of an app binary,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.453
and they will remain active if you submit a new build.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.330
Lastly, you can direct people

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.170
to a particular custom product page using its unique URL

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.143
for the marketing efforts outside of the App Store.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.890
You can use App Analytics in App Store Connect

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.190
to view the performance and a variety of metrics

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.850
for each custom product page, including product page views,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.183
total downloads and conversion rate,

00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:37.860
as well as additional metrics

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.620
like average retention and sessions,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.583
to help you understand user engagement after a download.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.930
Under the Acquisition tab in App Store Connect,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.940
you can easily view the performance

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.000
of all your custom product pages at a glance

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.123
as well as comparing them against the default page.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.900
The key metric here is conversion rate,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.090
which is defined as the percentage

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.730
of unique product page visitors that convert

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.070
to downloads and re-downloads.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.920
It's the main metric to evaluate the performance

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.633
of your custom product page.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.420
You can also view the same data by product page

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.600
under the Metrics tab with more flexibility

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.673
to view the trend over time.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.540
To dive more deeply into the performance

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.540
of one specific custom product page,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.940
you can filter by the page name,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.823
for example, the competitive hiking page,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.713
and view additional metrics associated with that page.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.670
For example, you can view the total proceeds

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.480
and paying users from this competitive hiking page

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.190
and calculate metrics like average proceeds per paying user

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.620
which can be a key metric to optimize

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.603
for post-install performance.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.730
Next, let's look at some examples of developers

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.980
that successfully leveraged this feature

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.513
in their marketing efforts.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.550
We've seen developers utilize custom product pages

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.470
in a variety of ways.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.443
For today, we'll focus on three use cases:

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.220
reaching specific audiences,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.340
showcasing seasonal updates and events,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.850
and highlighting specific content and features.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.030
We'll showcase developers' referral success stories

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.220
for the first two use cases,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.830
and Chris from the Apple Search Ads team

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.730
will go through the last use case in the next section.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.733
Starting with reaching specific audiences.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.850
State of Survival is a top strategy game made by FunPlus

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.660
where players build shelters, upgrade their equipment,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.000
and make allies in order to survive

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.923
the post-zombie apocalypse.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.870
With custom product pages, FunPlus wanted to improve

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.760
their referral conversion rates

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.090
and reach more role-playing gamer audience

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.723
on their marketing channels.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.780
They partnered with IronSource to create audience segments

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.480
based on IronSource's different source apps

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.523
focusing on role-playing gamers,

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.210
and customize all five screenshots

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.313
tailoring to this audience group.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.810
To evaluate success, they looked at conversion rate

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.353
and cost per install as key performance indicators.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.460
Let's see what this looks like.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.550
On the left, you can see their default product page

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.160
where they highlight different aspects of the game

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.823
in their screenshots to appeal to a broader audience.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.240
On the right is their custom page

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.160
with a new set of screenshots

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.460
highlighting different characters within the game.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.550
When FunPlus included this custom product page

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.380
in more focused marketing efforts

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.470
tailored to RPG audiences,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.950
they saw a 33% higher conversion rate

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.923
and a 14% lower cost per install.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.570
So what can we learn from FunPlus?

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.380
FunPlus segmented players who enjoy RPG games

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.840
and highlighted these aspects of the game

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.730
in their screenshots along with their

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.160
off-store marketing creatives.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.190
This has resulted in improved conversion rates

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.500
and lower cost per install.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.900
When you are designing your custom page,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.270
think about your different audience groups,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.180
and how you can identify these audience segments

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.930
in your marketing campaigns, and share the specific content

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.703
throughout their user journey.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.050
Let's take a look at another developer example

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.363
for seasonal updates and events.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.380
CBS Sports is a free app which gives people

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.443
front-row access to the latest in sports.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.460
They want to improve their marketing efficiency

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.740
for their mobile users who are visiting

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.450
the CBS Sports website

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.050
during the March Madness basketball tournament.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.540
They customized all five screenshots

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.930
on their custom product page to highlight the tournament,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.850
and they measured success by looking

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.490
at their conversion rates, as well as signups

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.190
for the tournament year over year.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.590
Here's what the seasonal page looks like

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.540
compared to the default.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.320
In their default page, CBS Sports focused

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.400
on more evergreen features

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.000
like watching live sports and track the game score.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.220
On the right is their seasonal page

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.320
highlighting March Madness.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.210
They customize their screenshots

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.520
to call out limited-time features

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.790
like the ability to enter and follow your bracket

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.650
and play with friends.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.560
The imagery in these screenshots also showed

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.260
the relevant UI within the app.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.170
This message helped reinforce the product features

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.210
specific to that event.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.430
As a result, the custom product page

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.670
saw a 20% uplift in conversion rate

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.250
as well as a 48% improvement

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.553
in March Madness tournament signups year over year.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.780
CBS Sports has provided a great example

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.350
for seasonal content, which was thematically consistent

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.440
with their overarching brand campaigns.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.810
You can consider what seasonal content

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.170
or limited time features you might highlight for your app

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.293
and reinforce those for your specific audiences.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.460
In the previous two success stories,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.520
developers are using external marketing channels

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.460
to drive people to the custom product page.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.070
If you wish to use custom product pages

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.360
on paid media campaigns, here's the ecosystem flow.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.780
You'll have the URL approved in App Store Connect

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.100
which needs to be shared

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.323
with your marketing partner of choice.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.860
The marketing partner needs to update the setup

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.130
in their StoreKit integration so that the source app

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.700
can properly display the custom product page.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.610
If the marketing partner supports the update,

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.630
customers will see the custom product page as intended.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.240
If the marketing partner hasn't supported yet,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.630
the customers will fall back to see the default page.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.840
Remember that if you engage in any tracking activity

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.400
with any of your partners,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.400
you must use app tracking transparency framework

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.323
to ask for user permission.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.740
Now that we've discussed how you can use

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.940
custom product pages to refer people from external sources,

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.820
let's look at how you can use custom product pages

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.770
with Apple Search Ads.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.960
I'll pass it over to my colleague, Chris,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.173
to walk you through the integration and learnings there.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.320
As Savannah mentioned, Apple Search Ads

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.110
is seamlessly integrated with custom product pages,

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.530
which means you can use approved custom product page assets

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.110
to set up search results ad variations

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.413
or Today tab ad campaigns in Apple Search Ads.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.820
With Today tab campaigns, you can promote your app

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.680
on the first tab of the App Store

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.630
and capture people's attention with creative

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.973
that animates from right to left.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.970
To run ads on the Today tab,

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.410
you'll need a custom product page

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.160
with at least four portrait or five landscape images

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.293
that adhere to our creative guidelines.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.700
The assets from custom product pages you select will be

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.820
showcased with a darkened and blurred visual effect.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.170
That background is automatically generated from your assets.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.650
And the high impact design and prominence of this placement

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.130
make it a great option to reach more users on the App Store

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.743
and drive awareness and interest in your app.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.560
For your search results campaigns,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.830
you can use custom product pages to create ad variations

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.293
that align with your different keyword ad groups.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.440
This is a great way to showcase app content

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.890
that connects with what people are searching for.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.163
Let's explore a few examples, starting with Baidu.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.430
As a leading search engine platform in China,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.680
Baidu helps people find a wide variety

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.260
of content, products, and services

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.513
to manage and enhance their daily lives.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.540
Everybody knows Baidu in China.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.273
Or actually, everyone thinks they know Baidu.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.660
But to demonstrate that they are much more

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.600
than a search engine, Baidu wanted to raise awareness

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.260
of in-app features other than traditional search.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.570
To do this, they used ad variations

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.930
based on custom product pages to align ad creative

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.790
with specific keyword themes

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.803
in their Apple Search Ads campaigns.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.670
For example, photo and image recognition related keywords

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.120
were aligned with custom ads, showcasing app features

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.130
like translating words in a photo

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.863
or identifying objects within a photo.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.250
This helped the Baidu team to fully demonstrate

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.130
various in-app features with custom creatives,

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.960
increasing awareness and adoption

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.673
of their app's many features.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.270
The optimized ad relevancy and user experience

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.630
enabled by ad variations with custom product pages

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.743
increased the install rate by 10%.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.070
In a totally different industry,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.823
German retailer Otto adopted a similar approach to Baidu.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.910
For an app that features a broad assortment

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.580
of shopping categories, growing their customer base

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.950
meant reaching a diverse range of shoppers

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.923
interested in everything from fashion to furniture.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.190
To better connect with a wide range of potential customers,

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.930
the Otto team created a new set

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.300
of custom product pages in App Store Connect

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.970
adding different app previews, screenshots,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.213
and promotional text beyond their default product page.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.200
They created ad variations

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.300
based on these custom product pages

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.700
and focused on three key ad groups

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.003
related to furniture, fashion, and electronics.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.900
These new ad creatives visually highlighted

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.330
specific app content clearly related

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.340
to what customers in these three verticals

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.443
were searching for on the App Store.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.030
For instance, images like a chair or a coffee table

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.923
were used for the furniture theme.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.670
With these even more relevant ad variations,

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.380
Otto created a better alignment

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.200
between what people were searching for on the App Store

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.603
and what people were seeing in their ads.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.700
The result?

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.063
An install rate 12% higher than their default ad.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.960
These are just two of many examples

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.780
of developers who have leveraged custom product pages

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.710
to showcase their feature or content on the App Store.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.720
We have also seen other advertisers

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.670
leverage custom product pages to create

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.090
relevant custom tailored ads that capture people's interest

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.730
during seasonal and promotional periods,

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.930
promote app content features or in-app events at launch,

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.560
remind past customers what your app has to offer,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.840
or include screenshots and previews that will

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.693
more likely resonate in a certain country or region.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.897
Thanks, Chris.

00:14:09.897 --> 00:14:12.990
Now that we've shared some developer success stories

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.500
from both external referrals and Apple Search Ads,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.530
let's discuss some general takeaways to help you

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.113
make the most of custom product pages.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.070
Before you implement the custom page URL,

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.050
if you work with a marketing partner,

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.710
check with them to make sure they support this feature.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.750
It's best to test the URL

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.140
before directing anyone to your page.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.010
For best results, make sure to have a large enough audience

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.940
to reach enough installs and meaningful conversion rates.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.070
And lastly, if you like to measure

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.400
any post-install performance across campaigns,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.370
consider creating separate custom product pages

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.523
for each campaign or channel you plan to use.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.070
Looking at some takeaways

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.100
around submitting your custom product pages,

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.390
we recommend being thoughtful on when you plan to submit.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.810
As a reminder, custom product pages can be submitted

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.030
independent of your app release,

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.390
but be sure to consider any upcoming app releases

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.120
to avoid coinciding any new submissions

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.010
with your app release.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.140
If you frequently update your app,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.380
it may be faster to submit your custom product page

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.580
along with your app as a single submission to App Review.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.150
And lastly, to ensure a smooth submission process,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.320
be sure to follow the App Review Guideline Section 2.3

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.410
for accurate metadata and avoid including

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.190
any promotional information in your product page metadata

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.223
including pricing, offers, or sales.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.270
Now, let's review some creative considerations

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.333
to help you create great custom product pages.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.480
We've noticed that distinctive visuals

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.550
that highlight specific features

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.320
and appeal to specific audiences tend to be more effective.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.920
Consider customizing at least the first two screenshots

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.100
as these are the first few visuals someone sees

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.980
when browsing your custom product page.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.990
From the previous success stories,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.110
we've seen that aligning your custom product page assets

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.150
and your off-store marketing assets

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.820
to include similar visuals and messaging

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.750
can lead to an improved conversion rate on the App Store.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.510
And as always, be sure to keep their likes,

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.210
interests, and preferences in mind

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.403
when designing your custom product page.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.290
For more information, check out the Apple developer website

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.140
which has helpful information about this feature

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.490
including the use cases, technical details, and more.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.663
Thanks for watching.
