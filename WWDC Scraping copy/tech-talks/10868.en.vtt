00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.003
[Bryan Eisenstadt]
Thank you all for joining today's session.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.039
We're excited to introduce you
to subscription offer codes,

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.442
which add new subscriber
growth opportunities

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.512
for your auto-renewable subscriptions
on the App Store.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.882
First, let's introduce ourselves.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.283
I'm Bryan Eisenstadt,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.919
and I'm on the App Store
Monetization team.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.621
Hi, I'm David Wendland,

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.891
a global technical advocate
with the App Store Commerce team.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.960
I'm Kenny Elmore, and I'm on
the App Store Operations team.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.831
[Eisenstadt] Today,
I'll briefly introduce you to offer codes.

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:33.500
Then David will discuss
engineering of the feature,

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.371
and Kenny will walk through setting up
your code campaigns in App Store Connect

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.573
and measuring offer code performance.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.210
Let's begin with our first session.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:45.679
I'll introduce you to
subscription offer codes,

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:49.016
explain how they work, and describe
the ways you can start using them

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.084
to grow and retain your business.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:55.022
We're excited to share that
offer codes are now available,

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.325
and you can begin generating codes
in App Store Connect.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:01.695
Offer codes are complementary
to our other offer types

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.864
that you may already be familiar with

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.099
but provide even more flexibility,

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:10.404
giving you the ability to merchandise
subscription offers outside of your app.

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:15.943
Offer codes can help you acquire,
retain, and win back subscribers.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:19.780
They are unique,
one-time use alphanumeric codes

00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:24.151
that you can choose to distribute across
both your online and offline channels.

00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:26.186
Once distributed,

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.957
your customers can seamlessly redeem
offer codes in the App Store

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:33.327
or directly in your app
when using the StoreKit API,

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.096
which David is going to
talk about more shortly.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.065
At the end of the offer period,

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.834
the subscription auto-renews
at the standard price,

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.137
unless a subscriber cancels
or turns off auto-renewal.

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:48.008
There are a number of different ways
offer codes can be used,

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:51.545
and you have the flexibility
to distribute them however you like.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.148
Codes can be distributed
in your digital marketing channels,

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.986
such as email,
to acquire or win back subscribers.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:02.256
For example, a sports league
might email an offer code

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:05.158
for an extended free trial
to season ticket holders.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.794
As an add-on where a subscription service

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.564
complements a physical good or service.

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.267
For example, an exercise bike company

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.170
could include an extended trial
for virtual classes

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.838
with the purchase of a bike.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.307
In physical retail or at events,

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.676
including industry conferences.

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:26.513
For example, a music service
could hand out flyers with offer codes

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.382
at concerts or festivals.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:31.318
Distributed via third-party partners

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:35.222
as part of co-marketing campaigns
and partner-marketing initiatives.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:38.458
A mobile phone carrier
might distribute offer codes

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.828
for a video streaming service
to its customers via email.

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:46.900
Codes can also be distributed by
customer support teams

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.102
who might give a customer
with a service issue

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.904
a free or discounted period

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:54.308
in lieu of sending the customer
to AppleCare for a refund.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.078
You will create codes in App Store Connect

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:01.148
and have the ability to configure
your offer code campaigns

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:04.117
for new, existing,
and/or lapsed subscribers.

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.555
You can create up to 10 active offers
per subscription SKU

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:13.794
and have the ability to create batches
of between 500 to 25,000 codes,

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:17.764
up to a maximum of 150,000 per app,
per quarter.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:21.602
You'll be able to choose
each batch's expiration date,

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.005
up to a maximum of six months
from the date of creation.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:29.743
After you've configured
and distributed your codes,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.546
customers can redeem directly
on the App Store

00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:35.949
through the Redeem Gift Card flow
found in the account page

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:39.486
or within your app
by using Apple's provided UI.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.190
The Apple UI
handles the full redemption experience,

00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:45.592
and if an app isn't already installed,

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.729
the user will first be prompted
to download the app.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.265
Let's look at that customer journey
in more detail.

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.635
If you're distributing
your offer codes offline,

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.704
such as at an event
or with a physical product,

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:01.108
the customer can seamlessly redeem
the code from within your app

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.977
when you use
the presentCodeRedemptionSheet.

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.381
You might consider adding
a Redeem Code button

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.184
to your app's paywall,
like the example here.

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:14.288
After a customer taps
your custom Redeem button,

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:18.959
the system automatically provides
a series of code-redemption screens,

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:21.461
the first being the code input page.

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:25.732
Once a customer types in the code
and that code is valid,

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.035
the offer details page is shown.

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.271
If for any reason the code isn't valid,

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:33.473
the customer will see
a clear error message

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.176
explaining why the offer
is unavailable to them.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:41.281
Now, if you're distributing on
digital marketing channels,

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:42.683
such as email,

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.352
each code will have
an associated deep link URL

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.421
for distribution on these channels.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.791
You'll be able to use a unique URL

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:55.062
to seamlessly deep link the customer
from your email to the redemption flow.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.697
So, in this example,

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.267
Ocean Journal is offering
a one-month free trial via email,

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.836
and once the customer taps Try It Now,

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.305
they're deep linked
into the redemption flow.

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:09.209
If the app isn't already installed,

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.679
the customer will first be prompted
to download the app.

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:17.851
Once the app has downloaded,
the offer details sheet will appear

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:20.487
and the customer
can then redeem and subscribe.

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:24.057
You'll notice the code input step
isn't required here,

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:26.193
as the code is part of the URL.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.963
However you decide to distribute
your offer codes,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.033
we recommend communicating
the code expiration date

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.270
alongside other eligibility
or availability limits

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.338
in your marketing communications.

00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:43.210
Offer codes can also be utilized
to cross-promote subscription apps.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.379
In this example,

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:48.382
offer codes are used
to assist with migrating customers

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:51.218
from an app that's being sunset
to a new app.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.755
ZenWell clearly communicates
that it is closing

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.624
and the customer's current subscription
will expire.

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.827
ZenWell then uses an offer code deep link

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:05.098
to give those customers a special offer
to a new app, Serenely,

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:09.369
and since they're using a deep link URL
associated with each code,

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:12.472
the customer
can seamlessly download the new app

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.608
and then redeem and subscribe.

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.846
Additionally,
offer codes can be used offline

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:21.481
at events or industry conferences.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:25.385
In this example,
the unique offer code is printed on flyers

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:27.788
which are handed out at a music festival,

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:30.591
giving attendees
a three-month free subscription

00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:32.492
to a music streaming service.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.963
Later, the same app
sends lapsed subscribers

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:40.901
an offer code via email for an additional
one month free to retry the service.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:46.240
Offer codes are complementary to
our other offer types

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:48.842
but now give you much more flexibility.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.578
Each offer type has a distinct use case.

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:56.416
So let's quickly summarize
the three different offer types.

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:59.520
Offer codes can be used for acquiring new,

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.855
retaining, and winning back subscribers.

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.725
Offer codes give you the unique ability

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:09.796
to merchandise your subscription offers
outside of your app, online and offline,

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:12.432
but with a seamless customer experience.

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:17.271
You can configure
10 active offers per subscription,

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:21.241
with a limit of 150,000 codes
per app, per quarter.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:25.946
And customers can redeem
one code per active offer.

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:28.949
Offer codes are available now,

00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:31.485
and we can't wait to see
how you use this new feature

00:07:31.552 --> 00:07:33.820
to acquire and retain subscribers.

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:38.959
Next, my colleagues David and Kenny
will cover some of the finer details

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:41.795
around implementing
an offer code redemption flow

00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:45.132
and how to set up offer codes
in App Store Connect.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:49.803
So I'll hand it over to my colleague David
to talk about engineering offer codes.

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:53.841
[David] Thank you, Bryan.
Hello, everyone.

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:56.410
I'm David Wendland,
a global technical advocate

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.279
for the App Store Commerce team
based in Cupertino.

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:01.815
Today, I'm going to discuss offer codes

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:05.319
and give you things to consider
when planning and implementing offer codes

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:08.922
into your products, application,
and back-end systems.

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:11.892
I'm going cover this in three sections:

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.694
configuring your offer codes,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.763
then dive into the redemption experience
and things to consider,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.767
and lastly, the updates
to subscriber status with offer codes.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.037
Let's begin with configuring your offers.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:27.307
So, to get started,
the first thing to review are

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:29.543
the different configurations available.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.513
You can see the product durations
listed in the far left column,

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:35.916
and then the corresponding offer durations
to choose from on the far right:

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:38.585
pay as you go, pay up front,
and free trial.

00:08:39.086 --> 00:08:40.721
These options should be familiar,

00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:45.526
as these are the same choices available
for introductory or promotional offers.

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:47.661
For example,
if you have a monthly subscription,

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:50.063
then you can configure
a pay-as-you-go offer

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.832
from 1 to 12 months long.

00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:54.501
Or you can choose
a pay-up-front or free-trial offer

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:56.570
with any of the durations listed.

00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:01.175
Now, a configuration
that is unique to offer codes

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:04.578
is that you can restrict redemptions
by customer cohort:

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:07.080
new, existing, or expired.

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:08.649
The important thing to know here

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.152
is that each cohort only applies
per subscription group,

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:14.121
meaning it is only checking
if the customer

00:09:14.188 --> 00:09:16.223
is new, existing, or expired

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.359
to that subscription group
that the offer code is for.

00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:24.264
With that, it's a best practice
to use your existing products and groups.

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:28.001
This will have long-term benefits
by leveraging what you already have.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.371
Lastly, when configuring your offers,

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:33.574
you will be asked
if you want to allow customers

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.644
to receive the introductory offer
along with the redeemed offer code.

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:41.715
If allowed, the intro offer
goes into effect immediately,

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:43.450
followed by the offer code.

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:45.786
Or if you choose to not allow,

00:09:45.853 --> 00:09:48.922
then subscribers will begin
their offer code period immediately,

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:50.524
as you would expect.

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:53.927
But they will retain their eligibility
for an introductory offer.

00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:56.263
I will illustrate this behavior
a little bit later

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.032
so you have a more thorough understanding
on this choice.

00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:03.437
Now, note that this configuration
only applies to subscribers

00:10:03.504 --> 00:10:07.040
that are eligible for
the introductory offer in the first place.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.977
Subscribers that have already received
an introductory offer

00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:12.112
for a product
in the same subscription group

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:13.780
will not receive another.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:16.650
They must be coming from
an inactive state,

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.886
so only new or an expired subscriber

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:22.022
can receive an introductory offer
in any manner.

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:24.691
And I wanted to note
that this configuration

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:26.727
cannot be changed or reverted.

00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:30.430
And remember, this does not change
the customer's eligibility.

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:33.700
It only determines the behavior
at the time of redemption.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.802
So, a subscriber could be eligible

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:38.672
to receive the introductory offer
in the future.

00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:42.709
Now, let's discuss implementation.

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:45.078
I've broken it down into four pieces.

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:47.481
To start, in App Store Connect,

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:50.184
you will create
your offer campaigns per SKU

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.685
and then generate the codes

00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:54.721
and download them
to distribute to your subscribers.

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:57.257
Next is code management.

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:59.826
Ideally, you have a system
to manage these codes.

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:03.664
It is important that you keep track
when your codes are distributed,

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.265
digitally or in print,

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:08.936
as once they are out of your control,
you should treat them as used.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.406
Also consider
a real-time distribution method,

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:14.208
where codes are only given to customers

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:16.276
once you have verified
their subscriber status

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.579
or eligibility criteria.

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:20.480
Next is your client application.

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:23.684
Ideally, you optimize your app
to support the in-app redemption sheet

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.586
for the best customer experience

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.889
and ensuring your app handles
external transactions gracefully

00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:30.724
and offers onboarding.

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:33.794
Because offer codes
can be redeemed outside of your app,

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.697
initializing the TransactionObserver
on app launch

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:39.099
ensures no transaction is missed.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.270
Now, if you have eligibility logic,
that will be client and server.

00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:45.772
And this logic can take into account

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:48.575
any info you have
on your customer's journey,

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:50.978
such as
their offer-type consumption history

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.546
or current status.

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:55.983
This can be used to determine
which SKUs and subscription offers

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.119
to merchandise to customers
for the best experience.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.023
Lastly, there is
the offer code consumption history

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.392
available in
the subscriber's App Receipts,

00:12:05.459 --> 00:12:06.727
and this data can be used

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:09.730
when determining eligibility
for future campaigns.

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:13.600
Now let's discuss some redemption topics.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:16.937
I will cover some restrictions and limits
to be aware of

00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:20.807
and then discuss the redemption experience
and how those work with your app.

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:22.743
And then illustrate customer experience

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:25.946
with the intro and offer code
configuration choices.

00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:29.216
Some restrictions to be aware of

00:12:29.283 --> 00:12:33.620
is that subscribers are limited to
one redemption per configured offer code

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.790
and are uniquely identifiable
by the name added

00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:38.859
when set up in App Store Connect.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.696
Also be aware that subscribers
cannot redeem an offer code

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:46.433
that will result in a downgrade
from their current level of service.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.502
It must be for a higher-tiered SKU

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:51.371
or the same SKU
that they are currently subscribed to.

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:54.308
Ideally, this is taken into account

00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:58.045
with your eligibility logic
when targeting subscribers with an offer.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:02.416
Now let's discuss
some specifics on code redemption,

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:05.919
as there are three primary methods
for customers to use.

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:07.988
As noted, right out of the box,

00:13:08.055 --> 00:13:12.125
subscribers can just go to the App Store
directly to redeem their offer code.

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:14.361
Now, this will be an external transaction.

00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:15.929
So when your app launches,

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:18.298
you will need to be monitoring
the payment queue

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:20.534
in order to initiate
your onboarding experience

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:22.402
for an optimal experience.

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.540
Another way is through the in-app
redemption sheet that you saw earlier.

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:28.308
This is the ideal experience,

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:32.312
where subscribers will have the ability
to redeem an offer directly in your app

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:34.815
using the presentCodeRedemptionSheet.

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:37.951
This will be the only scenario
where the redemption occurs

00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:40.487
with your app
actively running in the foreground,

00:13:40.554 --> 00:13:43.323
as the sheet will open
right on top of your app.

00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:46.193
Note, if you are displaying codes
within your app,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.731
it may be beneficial to make it easy
for subscribers to copy and paste.

00:13:52.366 --> 00:13:53.600
And here's that flow.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:56.270
That Redeem button
can be put anywhere in your app.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.473
Here, ours is just below
the Sign In button.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.976
Once tapped, the sheet opens up
on top of your application,

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:06.180
and the subscriber
will enter their code and tap Enter.

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:10.217
The customer can review the terms
and proceed through.

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:14.288
Once completed, you will find
a new transaction in the payment queue.

00:14:15.656 --> 00:14:18.458
The third redemption option
is the redeem URL,

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:22.496
where you will pre-populate it
with the subscriber's unique offer code.

00:14:22.563 --> 00:14:25.332
It is comprised of two values
to be aware of.

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:28.101
The ID represents your application's ID,

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:31.738
so it will be a static value
for each of your applications.

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:35.075
The second value is the code,

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:37.744
where you will dynamically populate
the URL

00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:40.647
with the subscriber's
unique alphanumeric value.

00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:44.718
If that URL was embedded in an email,
then tapping it

00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:48.355
would take the user into the app store
to complete the transaction.

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:50.524
Some things to note:

00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:53.727
The subscriber here
never sees the code during this flow,

00:14:53.794 --> 00:14:57.197
and when it is completed,
it would be another external transaction

00:14:57.264 --> 00:15:00.934
that your app will need to fulfill
when the customer launches your app.

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:04.705
As noted, redemptions can occur
outside your app,

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:08.709
so it's important you initialize
the TransactionObserver at launch.

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:10.110
This is a best practice

00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:13.981
and important for Ask to Buy,
PSD2, and offer codes.

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:18.285
So, with proper initialization,
it ensures no transactions are missed.

00:15:19.186 --> 00:15:23.357
On the other side, finishTransaction
removes the transactions from the queue

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.827
and tells us the customer
has received their items or service.

00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:29.696
Between these two,
when implemented correctly,

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:32.499
you will provide
an optimal customer experience.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:37.638
Let's move back to the intro offer
and offer code configuration.

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:41.141
As mentioned, I wanted to visualize
the subscriber experience

00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:42.543
with either setting.

00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:45.679
So let's take a simple scenario.

00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:47.681
We have a standard monthly subscription,

00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:51.318
and we've configured it
with a one-week free introductory offer

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:54.988
and also created an offer code
for one week free.

00:15:56.156 --> 00:16:00.327
So let's show what happens
if we do not allow the redemption of both.

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:03.664
When the subscriber redeems
their offer code,

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.400
the offer code
goes into effect immediately.

00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:11.405
After the offer period, the subscription
renews at the regular price.

00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:15.342
Now, at some point,
the subscriber may expire in the future.

00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:17.177
If they resubscribe,

00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:20.147
since they are eligible for
the introductory offer,

00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:23.217
they would then receive
their one-week free trial.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.619
So, this configuration just determines

00:16:25.686 --> 00:16:29.089
at what point they will receive
their introductory offer.

00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:31.625
This experience
is just something to keep in mind

00:16:31.692 --> 00:16:34.862
when creating offers for a given group
that you are targeting.

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:38.232
But what if you choose to allow?

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:40.534
Let's use that same example scenario.

00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:45.105
But this time,
when subscriber redeems their offer code,

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:48.175
the intro offer goes into effect first,

00:16:48.242 --> 00:16:50.878
followed by the offer code period,

00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:54.081
and then the subscription
renews at the regular price.

00:16:54.715 --> 00:16:57.651
I hope this helps illustrate
and provides more clarity

00:16:57.718 --> 00:17:01.188
on what the configuration means
from a subscriber's experience

00:17:01.722 --> 00:17:03.023
and helps you determine

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.593
when you want to allow or not allow
this redemption behavior.

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:11.131
To finish up, here are the updates
to subscriber status

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.200
in respect to offer codes.

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:16.737
There are two ways to get
a subscriber's current status:

00:17:16.803 --> 00:17:20.874
from the App Receipt
or real-time server notifications.

00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.076
Let's start with App Receipt.

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:25.879
In the App Receipt,
you will find the new field,

00:17:25.946 --> 00:17:27.748
offer_code_reference_name.

00:17:27.814 --> 00:17:30.784
This is the unique string
you added in App Store Connect

00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:33.687
and will be unique
for all your offer codes.

00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:36.890
This data is only available
when validating an App Receipt

00:17:36.957 --> 00:17:39.293
with our verifyReceipt service.

00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:43.897
Now let's discuss server notifications.

00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:47.801
In case you are not familiar
with our server notifications,

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:52.005
these are real-time updates
sent from our servers directly to yours

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:55.342
when a subscriber event
has changed their status.

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:57.911
You can find
all the supported subscriber events

00:17:57.978 --> 00:17:59.980
in our developer documentation.

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:05.652
The field name in our notifications
is the same, offer_code_reference_name,

00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:06.920
and it is available in

00:18:06.987 --> 00:18:09.990
a unified_receipt.Latest_receipt_info
object.

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:13.060
The notification types
that you would receive

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:16.363
when a subscriber redeems an offer code
are INITIAL_BUY.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:20.200
This is sent when subscribing to
a subscription group for the first time.

00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:24.838
So if a subscriber redeems an offer code
that results in a new subscription,

00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:27.741
then the INITIAL_BUY notification type
is sent.

00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:33.313
Next, is a notification type
specific for existing subscribers.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.551
If they redeem an offer code that results
in them resubscribing or upgrading,

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:40.754
then an INTERACTIVE_BUY notification
will be sent.

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:45.492
And lastly, subscribers
that are redeeming an offer code

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:47.227
after they have canceled,

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:50.564
that will generate a
DID_CHANGE_RENEWAL_STATUS notification,

00:18:50.631 --> 00:18:54.635
as this redemption re-enables
the subscriber's auto-renew status.

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.204
Now I'll hand it off to Kenny

00:18:57.271 --> 00:19:01.074
to share more insights on setting up
offer codes in App Store Connect.

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:04.044
[Kenny] Thanks, David.

00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:07.748
Hi, I'm Kenny Elmore,
and I'm on the App Store Operations team.

00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:10.851
Subscription setup has two parts.

00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:12.753
There's the setup in App Store Connect

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.722
as well as the work
that needs to be done on the back end.

00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:18.759
This includes the things
David went over earlier,

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:22.362
such as server-to-server notifications,
receipt validation,

00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:25.499
and implementation
using the correct StoreKit APIs.

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:27.935
What we will focus on today

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.671
is the App Store Connect portion
of this setup.

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:32.372
Required roles are:

00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:33.740
Account Holder,

00:19:34.508 --> 00:19:35.742
Admin,

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:39.012
App Manager, Developer, or Marketing.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.749
Offer code configuration has three parts.

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:46.386
First, you'll need to set
customer eligibility,

00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:49.623
territory availability, pricing,

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.793
and intro offer eligibility
in App Store Connect.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.728
You'll do this by creating an offer.

00:19:55.295 --> 00:19:57.564
Then you'll need to generate
batches of codes

00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:00.267
attached to that offer
to share with your users.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.971
Finally,
you'll need to download those codes

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:06.707
and either distribute them
to users directly

00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:10.544
or create unique redemption URLs
to share with users.

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:15.015
From My Apps, select your app.

00:20:16.817 --> 00:20:20.087
In the sidebar, under In-App Purchases,
click Manage.

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:25.626
Select your auto-renewable subscription
from the list.

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:31.932
In the Subscription Prices section,
click the "plus" icon.

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:37.571
From the drop-down menu,
click Create Offer Codes.

00:20:39.806 --> 00:20:42.042
Enter a reference name for your offer.

00:20:42.109 --> 00:20:45.512
You'll use this reference name
to manage the offer in App Store Connect

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:50.584
and to identify sales associated
with offers in Sales and Trends reports.

00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:54.688
First, select the customer eligibility
for your offer.

00:20:55.355 --> 00:21:00.360
You can choose any combination
of new, existing, or expired users.

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.797
New users are users
who have never subscribed

00:21:03.864 --> 00:21:06.366
to any subscription product
within the group.

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:10.003
Existing users are users
who are currently subscribed

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.738
to a product within the group.

00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:14.942
Expired users are users
who were previously subscribed

00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:18.512
to a product within the group
but whose subscription has expired.

00:21:19.546 --> 00:21:22.015
Here is where you'll choose
your introductory offer

00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:24.484
if your subscription
has an introductory call.

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:28.155
If your subscription
has an introductory offer,

00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:30.557
determine whether users
redeeming your codes

00:21:30.624 --> 00:21:34.561
should be eligible to redeem both a code
and an introductory offer

00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:36.630
by choosing from the following options:

00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:38.565
If "Yes,"

00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:42.269
new users will redeem
your app's introductory offer first,

00:21:42.336 --> 00:21:45.839
then automatically renew
to the offer they redeemed with your code.

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:50.077
If "No," new users
will redeem the offer code first,

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:53.080
then automatically renew
to the standard subscription price

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:55.115
without using the introductory offer.

00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:59.386
If the customer cancels at any point
and then resubscribes,

00:21:59.453 --> 00:22:02.689
they'll still be eligible
to redeem an introductory offer.

00:22:04.124 --> 00:22:08.195
Choose the appropriate territories
for your offer, then click Next.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.967
Choose either pay as you go,
pay up front, or free,

00:22:14.034 --> 00:22:17.838
then choose the appropriate duration,
currency, and price.

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:21.942
Apple automatically calculates
the prices for all territories

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:23.844
based on your chosen price point.

00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:27.381
But you also have the option
to set a different price

00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:29.116
for specific territories.

00:22:29.183 --> 00:22:31.785
In this example,
we're creating a free offer.

00:22:33.187 --> 00:22:34.588
Select Duration.

00:22:36.123 --> 00:22:37.324
Click Create.

00:22:39.293 --> 00:22:40.928
Once you've configured your offers,

00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:43.830
you'll need to create codes
for your users to redeem.

00:22:44.798 --> 00:22:49.303
You can create up to 150,000 new codes
every quarter per app.

00:22:49.837 --> 00:22:52.105
In order for users to redeem codes,

00:22:52.172 --> 00:22:54.408
your app must be in
the "ready for sale" state.

00:22:54.908 --> 00:22:57.444
Next to your offer, click Create Codes.

00:22:59.847 --> 00:23:01.315
In the pop-up window,

00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:03.917
select the number of codes
you wish to create.

00:23:03.984 --> 00:23:09.056
You must select a minimum of 500
and a maximum of 25,000 at a time.

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:14.328
Choose an expiration date.

00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:17.831
The expiration date
determines how long the codes are valid.

00:23:17.898 --> 00:23:21.969
You must select a minimum of one day
and a maximum of six months.

00:23:25.672 --> 00:23:28.275
If you need more than 25,000 codes,

00:23:28.342 --> 00:23:31.678
you can create multiple batches of codes
on the same offer.

00:23:33.747 --> 00:23:35.349
Once your codes are created,

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:37.417
you'll need to download them
from App Store Connect

00:23:37.484 --> 00:23:39.786
so you can share them with your users.

00:23:39.853 --> 00:23:41.555
You can utilize your own channels,

00:23:41.622 --> 00:23:44.825
such as email
or offline marketing campaigns.

00:23:46.193 --> 00:23:49.196
On the right-hand side,
next to the batch you want to download,

00:23:49.263 --> 00:23:50.597
click Download.

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:52.666
The file downloads automatically.

00:23:53.133 --> 00:23:55.602
Open the file
with a spreadsheet application.

00:23:56.203 --> 00:23:58.205
You can give codes to users directly.

00:23:58.672 --> 00:24:01.842
Codes can be shared
through on- or offline channels.

00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:06.079
For example, print the codes on a card
and hand out the cards at an event.

00:24:07.147 --> 00:24:08.348
Users can redeem the codes

00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:11.718
by entering them in
the Redeem Gift Card or Code page

00:24:11.785 --> 00:24:13.820
in their App Store account settings,

00:24:13.887 --> 00:24:15.122
or within your app

00:24:15.189 --> 00:24:18.492
if you've implemented
the presentCodeRedemptionSheet API.

00:24:21.094 --> 00:24:23.997
Codes can be used to create
unique redemption URLs

00:24:24.064 --> 00:24:26.266
that you can share directly with users.

00:24:27.401 --> 00:24:29.469
When the user taps on the URL,

00:24:29.536 --> 00:24:32.439
they'll be taken to a page
where they can redeem your code.

00:24:33.507 --> 00:24:36.143
Customers who do not yet have
your app installed

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.713
will first be prompted to download the app
before redeeming the code.

00:24:40.113 --> 00:24:43.784
To create these URLs,
copy the link on your offer page

00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:46.653
and then add each code
to the end of the URL.

00:24:50.624 --> 00:24:53.961
You can deactivate codes at any time
in App Store Connect.

00:24:54.027 --> 00:24:56.463
Users will no longer
be able to redeem them

00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.200
and will be shown an error message
stating the offer is no longer available.

00:25:01.435 --> 00:25:05.539
Locate the codes you wish to deactivate
and click Deactivate Codes.

00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:07.975
The codes will expire immediately.

00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:11.578
Subscribers who have already redeemed
the codes won't be affected.

00:25:14.348 --> 00:25:17.784
The deactivated codes
appear in your expired codes list.

00:25:17.851 --> 00:25:21.154
You can have up to 10 active offers
per subscription SKU at a time

00:25:21.221 --> 00:25:22.756
in App Store Connect.

00:25:22.823 --> 00:25:26.026
If you need more than 10,
consider deactivating offers

00:25:26.093 --> 00:25:29.596
whose codes have expired
or that you no longer need.

00:25:30.964 --> 00:25:34.101
In the upper right-hand corner,
click Deactivate.

00:25:36.303 --> 00:25:39.673
Deactivated offers
will move to your inactive offers list.

00:25:40.073 --> 00:25:42.876
You can view your deactivated offers
at any time

00:25:42.943 --> 00:25:47.047
as well as download expired codes
associated with deactivated offers.

00:25:48.582 --> 00:25:50.517
You can have up to 10 active offers,

00:25:50.584 --> 00:25:53.120
each with their own customer eligibility,

00:25:53.187 --> 00:25:57.057
territories, prices,
and intro offer stacking behavior.

00:25:59.393 --> 00:26:02.129
Click to view pricing and duration
for each offer.

00:26:04.364 --> 00:26:06.500

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.339

00:26:13.607 --> 00:26:18.545

00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:35.562
You can create a maximum of 150,000 codes

00:26:37.331 --> 00:26:39.199
Offer configuration:

00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:41.535
You select customer eligibility rules,

00:26:41.602 --> 00:26:44.471
timing, territories, pricing,

00:26:44.538 --> 00:26:46.740
and expiration in App Store Connect.

00:26:47.774 --> 00:26:49.309
Compatibility:

00:26:49.376 --> 00:26:51.445
iOS 14 and later,

00:26:51.512 --> 00:26:53.180
macOS not supported.

00:26:54.214 --> 00:26:55.949
Measuring offer performance.

00:26:57.384 --> 00:27:00.187
To measure the success
of your offer code campaigns,

00:27:00.254 --> 00:27:03.490
you will be able to view reporting
in Sales and Trends,

00:27:03.557 --> 00:27:06.894
including updates to
the subscription dashboards and reports.

00:27:07.494 --> 00:27:09.129
This reporting will help you understand

00:27:09.196 --> 00:27:12.466
the number of paid subscribers
acquired by offer codes,

00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:14.902
the offer-code-to-standard-price
conversion rate,

00:27:14.968 --> 00:27:17.638
and what are the most redeemed
offer code campaigns.

00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:20.674
The subscription retention dashboard

00:27:20.741 --> 00:27:24.111
will be updated to include
your offer code conversion rate,

00:27:24.178 --> 00:27:28.315
which shows the conversion rate
of all your offers for the past 30 days.

00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:32.019
This is the number of subscriptions
with an offer code enabled

00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:34.421
that converted to the standard price

00:27:34.488 --> 00:27:38.425
divided by the total number of
subscriptions with an offer code enabled

00:27:38.492 --> 00:27:42.496
eligible to convert to standard price
in the past 30 days.

00:27:44.031 --> 00:27:47.367
Additionally, we will be adding
a top offer codes table

00:27:47.434 --> 00:27:50.437
to the bottom
of the Sales and Trends overview page.

00:27:50.504 --> 00:27:54.241
Easily identify which offers
have the most redeemed codes.

00:27:56.877 --> 00:27:59.046
We'll be adding
the offer code reference name

00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:03.116
to transactions associated with codes
in your summary sales report.

00:28:03.784 --> 00:28:06.753
This can help you track
the total number of codes redeemed

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.355
as well as gain insights

00:28:08.422 --> 00:28:11.925
such as redemptions by device type,
region, and more.

00:28:13.927 --> 00:28:16.396
We've also added
the offer code reference name

00:28:16.463 --> 00:28:18.131
to your subscription report,

00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:21.201
subscription events report,
and the subscriber report,

00:28:21.268 --> 00:28:24.238
which can help you calculate
your offer code conversion rates

00:28:24.304 --> 00:28:25.873
and cancellation rates.

00:28:25.939 --> 00:28:28.275
Now back to Bryan
to conclude today's session.

00:28:29.843 --> 00:28:31.178
[Bryan] Thanks, Kenny.

00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:33.080
In summary of today's session,

00:28:33.146 --> 00:28:35.883
consider implementing
a redemption flow within your app

00:28:35.949 --> 00:28:38.018
for the best customer experience.

00:28:38.418 --> 00:28:41.121
Only generate the number of codes
that you plan to use,

00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:43.624
as you can't recover unredeemed codes,

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.794
and remember that codes expire six months
after the date they were created.

00:28:48.862 --> 00:28:52.499
Clearly communicate offer details,
eligibility requirements,

00:28:52.566 --> 00:28:54.968
and how to redeem in your communications,

00:28:55.035 --> 00:28:59.406
including that customers
can only redeem in iOS 14 or later.

00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:02.409
Thanks for watching.

00:29:02.476 --> 00:29:06.280
We can't wait to see how you use
offer codes to grow your business.

00:29:06.346 --> 00:29:10.884
