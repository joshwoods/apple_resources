00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:01.668
Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.872
I am Zhehong from Game Center
Engineering team.

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:07.374
Today, I'm really excited
to walk you through

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:12.012
how SharePlay has been
integrated with Game Center.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:15.282
Game Center is Apple's
social gaming platform.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.886
Players can add friends,
compete on leaderboards,

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:21.889
earn achievements,
and see everything in one place

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:24.892
with Player Activity.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:26.360
Game Center also supports

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.962
great multiplayer experiences
for players,

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.531
including invitation,
matchmaking,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.569
real-time gameplay,
and voice chat.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.372
This year, we're excited
to bring SharePlay support

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:39.773
to Game Center.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.809
Players can already
invite friends, contacts,

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.345
and nearby players
to play together.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.081
SharePlay enables them
to share gaming experiences

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.117
right in the moment.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:53.086
Now, if your players
are on a FaceTime call

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.588
or a Messages group,

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:57.691
they can immediately
jump into a game together.

00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.360
Imagine your players
are in a Messages group

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.363
with some friends,
and they want to play a game.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:06.767
They can simply start an
audio call from the group chat.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:11.004
Their friends will receive the
invitation as a FaceTime call.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:14.074
Then it's time
to launch your game.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.615
Let's take NBA 2K23
Arcade Edition as an example.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.550
We can click Play Now
in the title screen

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.519
and select Multiplayer.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.155
Then tap
the Play With Friends button.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.024
After that,
clicking Online NBA button

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.927
will bring you the game
Settings page.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.362
Let's set it to four quarters

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.531
and two minutes
for each quarter.

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.533
Click on Next.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.569
This brings up
the Game Center multiplayer UI,

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.473
where players will see the
brand-new mode selection screen

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:49.076
that includes
the SharePlay option.

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.877
Tapping
the Start SharePlay button

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.413
will activate a group activity.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.248
Players can join
and play together

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:58.418
by simply tapping
the Open button on their end.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:01:59.853
If you already use Game Center

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.089
to support multiplayer
in your game,

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:03.991
you will get
full SharePlay integration

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.159
with just one small update.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.664
Now, I will show you how to
enable SharePlay for your game.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:15.068
Currently, if you present the
GKMatchmakerViewController,

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:19.072
players will see the mode
selection screen by default.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.942
If you want to adopt
SharePlay integration,

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:25.779
the first step is to add the
entitlement of Group Activities

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.381
to your game.

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.050
You can do that by going
to the project settings,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.320
and in the
Signing & Capabilities tab,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.724
just search for Group Activities
and select it.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.460
With GroupActivities
capability enabled,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.197
the mode selection screen
will show the SharePlay option.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.500
If you are using
Game Center Multiplayer UI

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.036
provided by
GKMatchmakerViewController,

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.838
that is the only step
you have to do.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.707
You are done!

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.776
On the other hand,
if you are building

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:59.546
your own multiplayer UI
using Game Center APIs,

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:03.750
you could choose to integrate
with SharePlay's APIs directly.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.453
But since you're using
Game Center APIs,

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:08.455
we've also got you covered.

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:10.457
It's still really easy.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:13.060
You already added
GroupActivities capability

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.094
in Xcode.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:17.864
Now you want to call
some GameKit APIs.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.601
You can call the API to start
a Group Activity on SharePlay.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.671
Then, add the players
to the recipient list.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.141
And finally,
call the API to start a match.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.610
Let's jump into the code.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.049
First, call GKMatchmaker
.shared.startGroupActivity

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.952
so that GameKit can notify
your game when a player

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:42.055
from the FaceTime call
wants to join a match.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.492
Then, add the player
to the recipient list.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:49.796
Finally, call
GKMatchmaker.shared.findMatch

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.498
to start a match.

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:53.033
With just these steps,

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.268
your game is now
supporting SharePlay.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:57.804
As simple as that.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:01.074
To wrap up, Game Center's
integration with SharePlay

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:05.045
makes it easier for players
to start games with friends.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.114
If you're using
Game Center UI to build

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:09.683
a multiplayer experience,
you just need to add

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:12.786
a GroupActivities
capability in Xcode.

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:15.555
If you are building
your own custom UI,

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:19.426
use the new APIs
provided in GKMatchmaker.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.428
If you're new to using
Game Center to build

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:25.499
multiplayer experiences,
I suggest you watch this video:

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.969
"Tap into Game Center:
Leaderboards, Achievements,

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.140
and Multiplayer" from WWDC 2020.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.108
Thank you for watching.
