WEBVTT

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.610
All right, good morning.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.400
My name is John Geleynse.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.340
I'm the Senior Director of
Technology Evangelism

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.310
from Apple in Cupertino,
and it is awesome to see

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.400
you here this morning.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.690
We had a fabulous day yesterday.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.920
We packed this room,
and you've done it again,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.700
and it's really great.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.360
We saw some awesome apps from your
colleagues on the app side of the house.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.420
You're doing apps, too,
but we're calling you games.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.910
But it was a fun day yesterday,
and we hope that today

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.520
is going to be a fun day,
too.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.260
So it's great to be in Berlin.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.200
We've been here before,
and it's always a great experience.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.130
I want to thank you for taking
time out of your busy schedule,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.820
first of all, to come and join us here.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.380
I know many of you probably
didn't get to WWDC,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.360
so this is a great opportunity
for you to be here.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.660
But nonetheless,
it's time out of your day.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.620
It's time out of your work schedule.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.660
And we hope... We hope to pay you
back in spades with information

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.570
and tips and tricks and answers to
your questions throughout the day.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.920
So we're excited that you're here.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.610
So we've got a great day
planned for you today.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.100
We are going to be going into a lot
of detail about iOS 7 technologies,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.770
game technology specifically,
things that apply to game developers.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.740
We're going to be talking about the
new hardware that Apple has come

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.320
out with over the last few months.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.420
And we'll be running a lab.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.690
In addition to the sessions in this room,
we'll be running a lab next

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.200
door throughout the day.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.490
But I'll talk more about that
towards the end of this presentation.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.040
But for starters,
I wanted to give a review of a few

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.520
important milestones that we've
had over the last few months.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.500
And because these milestones are
really important for you to see and

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.200
think about as a game developer.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.830
First of all,
we recently announced that Apple shipped

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.060
its 700 millionth iOS device.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.620
And this is an unbelievable number.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.770
I mean, I've been personally with
Apple for 14 years and been through

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.870
the whole OSÂ X release cycle,
all of iTunes and the music

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.990
store and iPods and everything.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.260
And then the iPhone came.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.360
And who would have thought at that
time that we would hit this number?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.600
So this is an extremely
amazing milestone.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.440
And it bodes well for you as a game
developer because it's an enormous

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.020
audience for you for your games.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.370
And it means there are a lot of
devices that can run your games.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.240
And there's a lot of opportunity
for you to grow your market and to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.790
develop titles for this huge audience.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.470
And as you know,
the growth of games on the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.660
App Store has been phenomenal.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.930
And so thanks for your work.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.340
You know, your work.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.150
And I think that's the bigger part in the
part you played in creating games for the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.140
App Store because it's probably half of
the inventory of apps on the App Store.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.570
And they're selling like crazy.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.190
So now, since it's so easy for people to
update iOS 7 and iOS on their devices,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.390
we also announced that, you know,
more than 200 million of those

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.790
700 million devices were upgraded
to iOS 7 in the first three days,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.320
the first weekend that
iOS 7 was released.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:48.620
And that's an incredible amount of money.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.750
And so I think that's the
biggest thing that we've done.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.750
And I think that's the
biggest thing that we've done.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And in fact,
that three days was the fastest update,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.000
you know,
iOS update sequence that we've ever

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.000
seen in the history of iOS since 2007.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And it shows that, you know,
iOS 7 is really popular.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.000
In fact, it's so popular that
as of a few days ago,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.000
we announced that we're seeing
nearly two-thirds of all

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.000
iOS devices running iOS 7.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.900
So this is a huge, huge move forward.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.930
And, you know, clearly,
this means that your efforts

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.770
in the coming months should
be focused on supporting iOS

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.000
7 and the latest iOS devices.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.790
We're selling a lot of iPhones
and iPads and iPad minis,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.920
and they are all running iOS 7,
and almost three-quarters

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.990
of our community has already
transitioned to iOS 7.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then after you've supported
iOS 7 in the new devices,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
if that's the case,
you're going to be able to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.000
get a lot of new devices.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.550
So if time allows and you still have
customers that are running games on

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.300
older OS releases and older systems,
then consider adding

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.000
legacy support for them.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.940
But all of your energy
now should be on iOS 7.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.650
Now, we've listened to your
feedback over the last year,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.080
and we've done a bunch of things that
we think many of you appreciated.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.760
We've heard back from developers
who've given us this feedback and said,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.100
hey, you finally did that,
and I wanted to go over a couple of

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.580
these areas and things that apply to game
developers and developers in general.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.380
Some of the highlights of these efforts.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.930
So the first was app transfer,
letting you move your app

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.280
from one team to another.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.560
And so, for example,
if you sell your game or

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.700
your studio gets acquired,
this is a really great capability

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.840
inside of iTunes Connect.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.060
And we'll show you how this works today
in the noon App Store marketing session.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.800
Another thing that we heard from
developers and that we were able

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.070
to implement is over-the-air
download limit changes.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.560
So the limit was raised from
50 megabytes to 100 megabytes,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.180
and this makes it easier for people to
get your games when they're on the go.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.190
Even if they're not on Wi-Fi.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.420
And this is huge for
you as game developers,

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.200
right?

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.120
Because many of you were doing a
lot of work to keep your binary

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.200
sizes down to about 50 megabytes.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.200
And you were trying to
keep under that ceiling.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.200
And so this change means that it's a lot
easier for you to build a universal app,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200
to include your retina assets,
to include a 64-bit slice,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.330
and all the other things that
you need to put into your binary.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.220
Now, the other thing we did was we heard
a lot of feedback from developers who

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.620
couldn't get to the developer conference,
of course.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.800
We always hear feedback
about ticket sales.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.110
And so we worked really hard this
year to give you same-day videos.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.200
And because the demand for
tickets was unprecedented,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.630
there were a lot of developers
who really wanted to know what was

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.060
going on and wanted to be there,
so to speak,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.180
and learn what everybody else was
learning that was at the conference.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.680
So we did same-day videos,
and this meant that people,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.360
developers around the world, many of you,
could actually experience the

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.310
developer conference from afar
and learn what everybody else

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.620
was learning in San Francisco.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.380
And one of the things that
we saw as a result of this,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.340
which was pretty cool,
was that there were many people

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.530
who had one person who got into
the show from their company,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.820
and what would happen is the
videos would become available,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.540
and many of you would
watch them back at home.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.620
Okay.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.660
And then people were sending questions
to their colleagues at the show,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.180
asking them to go to the
labs and gather information,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.320
gather answers, and then send it back.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.630
So there was this real-time
feedback loop that we were getting,

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.350
and it was tremendous.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.340
So we got a lot of
positive feedback on that,

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.730
and we're going to try to continue
this trend for future WWCs.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.800
Another request was
hosted in-app purchases.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.880
And in-app purchase, obviously,
is something that you can

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.390
use to monetize your games.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.530
Many of you know this.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.900
If you've got freemium,
you're using the freemium model.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.760
And if you have something that you
sell in your game that involves

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.830
downloading additional content,
Apple can provide for the

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.480
hosting of that content,
up to 2 gigabytes of content.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.380
We announced this at WDC this past year.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.140
There's no additional cost involved,
and we simply provide this

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.250
hosting service to you.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.470
And so it's super easy to use.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.340
This was a big request,
and it's now here for

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.080
you to take advantage of.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:25.580
And for those of you who have paid apps,
we expanded the volume purchase program.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.060
And what this really means for you
is this is a way for you to sell

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.460
your apps in large numbers at a
discount to businesses or schools.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.920
And if you've got an
entertainment-type game,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.460
this could be really interesting for
getting it to schools in high volume.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.580
And it gives you, really,
another way of expanding.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.230
your market.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.200
So, and then finally we added
enhanced sales and trends.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.390
So there's some great new
ways to view your sales and

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.400
trends data in iTunes Connect.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.450
And this makes it easier for you to know
what's going on with your sales overall

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.660
and to see how your app is selling.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.000
And we'll go into more detail about
these reports and how you can extract

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.990
even more information from them in
the noontime session as well today.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.930
And then finally,
another big highlight of stuff that

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.600
we've done based on your feedback
is we added a kids category.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.920
And if you make games for children,
this category makes it easy for

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.090
parents to find age-appropriate
games for their children.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.080
And this really increases the
chances of people finding your

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.570
game because you're not in such a
big pond of the entire app store.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.180
You're now just in this category.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.600
So kids category is a big deal.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.920
So we're listening,
and those are a few of the things

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.780
that we've done in the past
year based on your feedback.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:51.040
But we are always interested in
hearing from the developer community.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.570
We see your blogs.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.160
We get your email.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.630
But we want to encourage you
to continue to file bugs,

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.910
enhancement requests.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.920
To send us email.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.730
You're going to see email addresses at
the end of many of the presentations

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.960
here today from the evangelism team.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.080
And we're also interested in your
feedback throughout the day in the labs,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.560
in the reception afterwards,
or in any time that you've got a

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.780
moment to catch an Apple employee.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.980
There are a pile of us here.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.100
There's a lot of us here.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.190
You'll see them at the
end of this presentation.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.060
And we really do want your feedback.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.960
We want to make it great, even better,
to be an iOS developer.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.940
So okay,
that's the stuff that we've done.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.610
In the past,
let's shift our focus to the present.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.540
2013 was a really busy
year for us at Apple.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.200
I mean,
every year seems to be really busy.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.560
But it was also a really
important one for us.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:46.530
We saw a fundamental evolution in
the iOS operating system on the

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.280
platform with the release of iOS 7.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.090
And we introduced a whole
bunch of new devices.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.420
And the thing to realize is that these
changes provide... a completely new

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:05.760
basis for...or a new foundation for
a next generation of games and apps.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.390
And that's really what we
want to talk about today.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.540
So at WWDC, as you know,
we introduced iOS 7.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.970
And it's the next generation of iOS,
obviously.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.490
There have been six previous...six major
releases of iOS previously since 2008

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.920
when the SDK first came out with iOS 2.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.190
And every time there's a new release,
we're... you know,

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.280
there's always a new SDK with
tons of new technology for you to

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.060
take advantage of in your games.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.850
And iOS 7 is the most significant
update to iOS since 2007.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.440
Even though there have been
these six previous releases,

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.770
we made a ton of changes with iOS 7.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.540
And now, obviously,
with the numbers I shared earlier,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.110
you've got hundreds of millions
of customers... that are running

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.450
iOS 7 on their devices now.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.630
And iOS 7 has so many new technologies
and features for you to take

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.340
advantage of as a game developer.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.790
I mean, there's SpriteKit for 2D games.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.020
Developers have been asking for
something like SpriteKit for years,

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.060
and now it's here.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.510
There's a new framework for
supporting game controllers.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.430
We announced that at WWDC and
actually had game controllers

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.630
for people to play around with
in the labs at the conference.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.160
There are major enhancements
to existing frameworks,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.920
so OpenGL ES3 and Game Center have
dramatically enhanced capabilities,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.300
and we'll cover these in
sessions later on today.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.400
And then there's 64-bit,
which lets you tap into the

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.640
performance of the A7 processor.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.290
So iOS 7 is a huge change.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.820
Huge step forward as an OS release.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.300
It introduces a brand
new user experience,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.170
which you've all experienced,
but it also introduces a ton

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.330
of technologies for you to take
advantage of as a game developer.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.600
And so, really,
no matter what kind of game you develop,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.570
whether it's an arcade game,
a puzzle game, a racing game, or an RPG,

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.680
there is a lot of capabilities in
iOS 7 for you to take advantage of.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.540
And on the hardware side,
we introduced a new

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.790
generation of iOS devices.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.620
You know, this is the iPad
Mini with Retina display.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.420
The iPad Air came out,
and they were the most recent

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.400
introductions to the hardware line.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.680
And these are incredibly powerful
new devices that are built on the A7

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.400
chip with its 64-bit architecture.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:29.400
And alongside of that,
they've got the M7 motion coprocessor.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.750
So these are very significant devices.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:41.400
And with that, prior to that,
we announced the iPhone 5c and the 5s.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.400
And the 5s is incredibly powerful.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.400
I mean, undoubtedly, you've been playing
with it for a long time.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.180
And running your games, you know,
builds of your games on it.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.390
And the GPU on that device
is awesome for games.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.380
And the speed is amazing.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.170
And we think that, really,
the iPhone 5s is going to be the

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.400
new baseline for a lot of games.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.410
This is an incredible device.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.930
And it's the combination of these
new devices with the A7 processor

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.300
and the retina displays and all of
their hardware capabilities combined

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:20.300
with iOS 7 that form a foundation
for the next generation of iOS games.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.610
And helping you get the most
out of all of these technologies

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.990
and out of these devices is
really what the focus is today.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.480
So I'd like to spend some time
talking about the characteristics

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:40.770
that I think people will come to
expect in next-generation iOS games.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.520
I mean, there are great games
on the platform today,

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.530
but what we want to talk about this
morning is next-generation iOS games.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.810
So first and foremost,
a next-generation game

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.700
needs to be a great game.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And I mean by great that, you know,
people aren't going to do it for free.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.990
You can judge your game based on
the technologies that you adopt.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.500
It's not about the technologies.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.800
People don't buy games because
they use Game Center specifically.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.600
They don't buy games because
they're built on OpenGL ES 3 or 2.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.360
and they also, you know, great games.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.200
It's not about what API you
integrate specifically.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.890
It's not about the technology.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.800
Instead, what people want is
they want to have fun.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.510
They want to be entertained.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.310
They want to learn while they're
doing a logic puzzle or they want to,

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.570
you know, a casual game or so,
or they want to be entertained

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.880
in a group setting by doing
group gameplay over AirPlay.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.730
It's about being entertained.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.780
And so what's important to people who
are buying games is that the games are

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.360
inviting and that they're engaging,
that they're intuitive,

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.650
and that they're polished.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.870
And so let's talk about a
few of these for a minute.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.540
So the best games on iOS are inviting,
and this means that they leave

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.340
a great first impression.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.400
Now,
we saw some fabulous software yesterday,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.280
and I'll tell you,
of all of the cities we've been to

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.600
on the Tech Talks -- and I'm not
just saying this because I'm on

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.220
stage here in Berlin -- and frankly,
the apps, the quality of the apps we

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.570
saw yesterday was profound.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.860
It was very, very, very high.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.750
And I'm assuming that today we're
going to meet a bunch of you who

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.320
have some experience with iOS.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.320
Yeah.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.320
And I'm assuming that today we're
going to meet a bunch of you who

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.320
have some experience with iOS.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.320
And I'm assuming that today we're
going to meet a bunch of you who

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.420
have some experience with iOS.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:18.520
Yeah.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.080
And I'm assuming that today we're
going to meet a bunch of you

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.380
who have some incredible games.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.020
But frankly, not every game on the
App Store is incredible.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:33.060
There are a lot of games that are okay,
and they could be a lot better.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.870
And one of the things that a lot of
developers struggle with is creating

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.660
something that is inviting that
leaves a great first impression.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.790
And the first impression for a game,
for an app, for anything really

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.480
begins on the App Store.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.920
It's your icon.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:48.520
That's your calling.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.520
It's your calling card.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.160
It's the way you describe your game,
the App Store description.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.160
It's the screenshots that you select for
your game that people are going to view.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.420
Now, why is this important?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.180
Well, it's because people are
perusing the App Store.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.220
They're browsing the
App Store all the time,

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.250
looking for the next cool game to play.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.070
Right?

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.280
And they're going to pick your game out
based on what they see on the App Store.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.960
And so you need to have a great icon.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.320
You need to have appealing screenshots.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.250
And then your first impression,
once they see it,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:18.360
they're going to be like, "Oh,
that's cool.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:18.520
That's cool.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.450
I'm going to play this game."
And then once the game is downloaded,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:27.080
the first impression is reinforced
again and again as players

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.980
relaunch the game over and over,
and your game starts up.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.110
And the question you really see,
the question to ask yourself and the

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.870
thing to evaluate of your own game is,
every time it launches,

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.680
does it launch quickly?

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.680
Does it get people back
to where they were before?

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.580
Are you saving the state?

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.920
Are you building excitement
when the app is launched?

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.240
Or do people constantly have to
wait for stuff to happen before

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.760
they can get into the gameplay?

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.790
No one wants to wait.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.520
Perhaps there's something
that's interfering with launch.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:04.510
So a great first impression is
really driven by being inviting,

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.850
by launching quickly,
and constantly reinforcing

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.700
that impression over and over
as people play your game.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.960
Now, great games are also intuitive.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.680
And this means that they should
show the player how to get started.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.270
This means that they should
provide feedback within the game

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.140
that reinforces the gameplay.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.440
And games, just like apps,
should be intuitive and easy to use for

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.020
the people that they were created for.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.010
I mean, there are so many
different kinds of games,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:38.640
RPG, casual, first person shooters,
all these different kinds of games.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.840
And different players are drawn
to different kinds of games.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:47.100
What one person understands
and likes with a logic,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.800
a casual logic puzzle solving game is
completely different from somebody who's

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.600
playing a first person shooter like
Call of Duty or something like that.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.010
And so what is obvious in one
case might not be so obvious

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.500
to a player in the other case.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.220
And so you really have
to define your market,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.090
understand who you're going for,
and then create a game that's

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.030
intuitive and easy to use for them.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.580
And another attribute of great
games is that they're engaging.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.540
This means that they're addictive,
that they're sticky.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.860
Engaging games bring people
back again and again.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.940
You want people to download your
game and leave it on their device.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.630
In fact, what you're doing,
your number one competition

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.710
is not so much other games in
your category or in your genre,

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.050
but it's more for the
attention of customers,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.780
right?

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.500
Just because someone has downloaded
your game doesn't mean they're

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.980
going to play it again and again.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.240
And so your number one competition
is for their attention.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.290
And engaging games that leave
a great first impression,

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.700
reinforce that over and over and over,
and that are intuitive,

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.860
are games that don't get deleted.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.750
Your competition is really whether
or not customers are going to

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.590
delete you off their device or not.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.170
And then your competition after
that is whether or not you can

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.890
compete with other game developers.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.650
So engaging games are games that
players just can't put down.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.660
And they, you know,
they have to play just one more time,

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.380
right?

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.800
And I'm not a huge gamer myself,
but there are about 10 games that

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.920
I love to play again and again that
I continue to keep on my phone,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.880
and they're the kinds of games
that I can't put down when I'm on a

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.880
transcontinental flight or whatever.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.590
And I just, I can't.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.450
I keep wanting to play.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.490
I got to beat my high score.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.660
I got to beat my high score.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.300
And that's the kind of addictive,
kind of engaging,

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.520
bring people back replayability
that's accomplished actually

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.370
by having great gameplay,
frequent updates, fresh new content,

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.520
and new game levels, for example.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.260
All of those things,
giving customers those

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.720
things again and again,
over and over,

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.450
bringing them back in with new levels,
new content, that kind of thing is what

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.530
encourages replayability.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.640
And also, great games are social.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.040
And this means they create a real sense
of competition or reward or teamwork.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.610
And this is, you know,
they offer different challenges.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.360
And on iOS, this is largely accomplished
through Game Center.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.580
And we have a session later today that
will cover Game Center enhancements

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.260
and Game Center in and of
itself in a lot more detail.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.620
And lastly, games,
great games are polished.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.250
And this is all about
having an attractive design,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.750
which actually ties back to
leaving a great first impression.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.190
And polished games look gorgeous.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.430
And they feel just right on iOS.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.080
They're designed for iOS.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.220
The graphics are retina quality.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.790
And the graphics fit the full
resolution of the screen.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.730
They're not stretched or scaled
to kind of fit and therefore,

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.080
you know, they're distorted.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
And lastly, great games are polished.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
And this is all about
having an attractive design,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
which actually ties back to
leaving a great first impression.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
And polished games look gorgeous.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
And they feel just right on iOS.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
They're designed for iOS.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
The graphics are retina quality.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
And the graphics fit the full
resolution of the screen.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
They're not stretched or scaled
to kind of fit and therefore,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.080
you know, they're distorted.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.330
Polished games should feel native,
which means that buttons

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.860
should behave like buttons.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.770
There should be feedback.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.400
They don't have to look like
standard UIKit controls,

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.280
they can be completely custom UI,
but if it looks like a button,

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.440
it should behave like a button,
because people on iOS,

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.340
people on these devices expect
all apps to behave certain ways.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.270
And lists within your game
should scroll and be responsive

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.360
beneath someone's finger.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.340
They should bounce at the
top and at the bottom,

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.860
like standard lists do in other apps.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:27.200
So this is important for
polished games to feel native.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.810
And polished games also need to
pay attention to the details like

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.380
saving progress when they quit,
so that when they're restarted,

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:39.260
you've saved state and customers can
come back to where they left off.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.970
Particularly with multitasking in iOS 7,
where someone might double tap

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.320
the home button and leave the game
momentarily to go do something else.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.170
You want to pause and provide a really
great experience and save the state

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.920
and hold things where they're at,
and then give a good experience

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.170
for players coming back into
the game once they return to it.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.810
And polished games handle
device rotation correctly.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.450
And as I go through all of
these attributes of being great,

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.420
really,
there's a lot of things in here that

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.750
are check marks that you need to be
checking that you're doing in your game.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.300
All right.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.000
And lastly, great games are,
great iOS games are innovative.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.920
And, you know,
the way to define innovation

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.850
is that they are frequently,
you know, the first of their kind.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.870
They're category-defining.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.610
They are groundbreaking.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.560
They create a completely
new genre of gaming,

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.400
perhaps.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.320
That's what innovative games do.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.600
And they're like a breath of fresh air.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.570
And innovative games are often
built on technological advances,

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.860
frankly.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.320
And we'll look at some
examples here shortly.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.180
And here are a few examples
of some really great iPhone

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:57.060
and iPad games that have won
Apple Design Awards over the years.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.700
I mean, I've been involved with the
Apple Design Awards for pretty

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.560
much my entire career at Apple.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.080
And I remember awarding Real Racing,
the first version of it, an ADA.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.620
Doodle Jump, when it first came out,
just took off.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.960
They won an Apple Design Award.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.660
Cut the Rope, Topple.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.600
Osmos came out on iPad.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.380
Fabulous game.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.060
Tremendous flight control.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:23.540
Completely create a brand
new genre of gameplay when

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.940
it hit the App Store in 2008.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.120
And over the years,
it's won a couple of Apple Design Awards.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.280
And then to more recent years.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.510
Apps like Ridiculous Fishing,
Jetpack Joyride,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.180
Where's My Water from Disney.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.570
Fabulous games that are
incredibly engaging.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.440
They keep people coming
back again and again.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:43.380
They're attractive.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.240
They're polished.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.720
They do all of the things I just spoke
of that are important for great games.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.000
Badland.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.420
Unbelievable production
quality in this game.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.780
Letterpress.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.400
Talk about a social game.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.240
Talk about great gameplay and
interaction and familiarity.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.980
And it's feeling native without being,
you know, even though it has custom UI.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.450
And then Sky Gamblers.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480
Great performance.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.200
And an app that runs on iPad, iPhone,
and OSÂ X.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.760
So, you know,
these are truly great games,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.190
and if you haven't already,
spend time with these games,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.630
with all of them,
and pay attention to how well they embody

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.330
the characteristics that I just spoke of.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.590
I mean, look through these games,
play them, and think about, you know,

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.010
are these attractive?

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.190
Are they responsive?

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.380
Are they doing the things
that I talked about earlier?

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.810
Do they represent the
characteristics of quality games?

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.420
And, you know, when you play with them,
when you interact with these games,

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.090
and many of you probably have,
you'll quickly begin to understand

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:50.500
why these games are so special,
why they won an Apple Design Award.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.090
And maybe,
in the process of learning these

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.890
things and experiencing these
attributes inside these games,

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:01.190
you'll find ways and realize ways
that you can also improve your game.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.290
So there you have it,
the traits of great games,

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.650
but we were talking about
next-generation games.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.170
And to be clear,
having a great game is just the

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:16.490
first -- is just the starting
point for a next-generation game.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.110
So in addition to being great,
next-generation games also have

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.200
five notable new characteristics.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.380
The first is that they're optimized
for performance on the A7.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.860
And the A7, as you know,
has been re-architected for 64-bit,

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:38.080
making our newest devices the
world's first 64-bit mobile devices.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.270
I mean,
this is desktop-class architecture and

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.880
horsepower in the palm of your hand.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.160
And no one else has
done anything like this.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:52.990
And the A7 has got a brand-new CPU and a
GPU that provides tons of computational

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.160
power for the most demanding apps.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:00.090
And we're just beginning to see
stuff come out now that's taking

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.200
full advantage of this horsepower.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.160
Now, with 64-bit architecture,
with the 64-bit architecture

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.160
that the A7 has,
it means,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.260
what this really means is that we've
got twice as many integer and floating

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.690
point registers as earlier processors.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.030
So as the A6, for example,
on the iPhone 5.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.070
And what these extra registers
mean is that the LLVM compiler,

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:26.130
for example,
that you use to develop your apps with,

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.840
it can use these extra registers
to optimize assembly language

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.610
and the Objective-C runtime.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.750
And so just by virtue of having
extra registers on the processor,

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.830
we can optimize the
performance of iOS overall,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.840
and we can optimize your code simply
running it through the LLVM compiler.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.020
And because of all of that,
the A7 offers faster performance

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.030
for both 64-bit and 32-bit apps.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.210
Now, if you're worried about the
switch to 64-bit and that

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.240
it'll be difficult for you,
don't worry.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.310
You can easily maintain a
single code base and target

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.040
both 32-bit and 64-bit devices.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.880
And we'll cover some techniques and
we'll cover details about how to do

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.340
this in a session later on today.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.340
But what I want to make here is
that the 64-bit architecture of

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.210
the A7 is here to stay on iOS.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:23.760
This is the future.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.030
And so don't put off moving to 64-bit.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.040
Now's the time to do it.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.350
This is where we're moving.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.950
The A7 improves CPU performance by
up to 2x when compared to the A6,

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.620
but it also gives you double
the GPU performance as well.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.220
And you all know what the
benefits of a faster GPU are,

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.940
right?

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.460
There's more polygons, more sprites,
more particles, more complex shaders,

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.900
more special effects,
increased frame rates,

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.490
smoother animations,
more realistic lighting

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.540
and visual effects,
right?

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.980
These are all of the things
that a GPU provides to you.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:07.570
And ultimately it means that the
techniques that used to be too expensive

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:13.440
for you to code or to employ in your
games are now totally within reach.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.850
I mean,
many developers would hold back because

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.500
the hardware couldn't handle it.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.380
And now there's no reason to hold back.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.480
We believe that the new GPU,
the capabilities of a fast GPU like

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.220
in the A7 are going to open
up a whole new class of games.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.810
And, you know, let's look at a leading
example of all of this.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.220
This is Infinity Blade III.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.300
You've probably seen this.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.120
You've probably played it.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.380
Maybe some of the authors
of this game are here today.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:44.400
We demoed this game on stage
at the launch of the iPhone 5S.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.620
And Infinity Blade II,
which was the predecessor,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.440
was an incredible game in and of itself.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.110
In fact,
I remember Infinity Blade I being

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:58.540
an amazing game and setting a
standard for a really great game

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.220
mechanic and great performance.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.440
And each subsequent release
of this game has been amazing.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:11.260
But the guys behind this game, you know,
they took Infinity Blade II and they

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:17.120
just kept dialing up the polygon count,
the texture size, the shader complexity,

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.510
and turned... and turned... and turned
on all kinds of special effects.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.280
And they were blown away by the results.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.940
So if you take a look
at this for a minute,

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:34.550
this is captured off of... in real
time off of an iPhone 5S at the launch.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.590
And if you just watch this carefully,
you can see that there's

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.420
incredible depth of field.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.040
I mean, look at the lighting effects,
the lens flare,

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.460
the reflections off of the armor, right?

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.350
The guys from Epic and
Chair Entertainment were amazed

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:59.120
at how capable the A7 was and what
they could do with it while still

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.780
maintaining their target frame rate.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.780
I mean, this is fantastic stuff.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.300
You see this on a Retina iPhone 5s.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.200
It's amazing.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.400
And that's just one example of
what's possible with the new

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.320
64-bit A7 chip that's powering
the iPhone 5s and the new iPads.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:22.310
And frankly, if there's nothing else you
take away from today and no

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.860
further guidance that you,
you know, take from Apple,

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.980
it would be that taking advantage
of this horsepower is probably the

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.480
most important thing that you can do
to build a next-generation iOS game.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.750
If nothing else,
if you just build a great game and

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:43.600
take advantage of this horsepower,
you'll have done an awesome job.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.530
But there's more,
because the second trait of a

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.990
next-generation game is that
it's always ready to play,

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.140
to be played.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.730
And this is possible due to a
new feature in multitasking on

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.540
iOS 7 that lets you do background
downloads of your game content.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:04.190
In iOS 7, we added some new multitasking
modes that all apps can use.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.590
And we did this in a way
that preserves battery life.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.320
So let me be clear.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:13.660
Multitasking gives your app numerous
opportunities to stay up to date.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.640
iOS 7 does intelligent scheduling.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.110
So for example,
it notices when people play a game,

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.000
when the game is typically played.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.550
And it gives background cycles ahead
of time so that your game can be ready

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.400
to be played again at the same time.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.900
iOS 7 also takes advantage of the times
when a device is powered up to let

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.620
your game do opportunistic updates.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.540
Maybe you want to go get some things for
your game for the next time it's played.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.810
And because the device powers up,
we give you some time

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.560
to go get that content.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.040
And thirdly,
iOS 7 responds to push notifications

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.330
as a trigger to give your game
time to fetch the information it

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.860
needs so that when people tap on
the notification about your game,

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:57.520
they're taken directly to the game
and it's ready for them to play.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.310
And this stuff wasn't
possible previously.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:07.090
Now, this is doable using three new
API tied to multitasking in iOS 7.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.600
The first is background fetch,
where we will launch your game

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:15.560
periodically so that you can pull down
new data and update your UI accordingly.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.200
The second is remote notifications,
where we'll run your game in response

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:24.280
to a silent push notification so that
you can update your content on demand.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:28.210
And instead of having to
poll your servers for updates

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.260
when your game launches,
for example,

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.460
which slows down that initial
launch time of your game,

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.280
obviously.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:37.210
And it delays that instant
gratification for players.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.420
They launch the game.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.080
They want to play.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.720
They have to wait because you
have to go poll your server.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.860
That doesn't have to happen anymore.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.340
And the third part of this
is the background transfers.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:53.410
iOS can download content
updates in the background even

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.400
if your game isn't running.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:02.130
Now, since you have new opportunities
for your game to be running on

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:06.560
iOS 7 that didn't exist before,
it's even more important than ever

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.760
that you are being power smart as well
when you do these background updates.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.140
So let me just touch on this briefly.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:20.060
Using the network, of course, obviously,
uses power because we have to power up

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.980
the antennas regardless of whether you're
using cellular or Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.640
So when you connect to
an external resource,

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.350
it's going to take power because
we have to bring up the antennas

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.220
and the radios on the device.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.990
So do access these external resources
only when needed and avoid polling

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:41.370
for information from your game
servers or wherever you're reaching

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.480
out to for more information.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.400
Another thing here about
being power smart is that it's

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.130
important to try to transmit the
smallest amount of data possible.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:35:23.900
[ Transcript missing ]

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:29.680
So that's a brief touch on multitasking,
but on iOS 7, your game as a result can

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.480
be always ready to play,
which is a great thing.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.520
I mean, nowadays, who wants to wait,
right?

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:41.310
Next up is that
next-generation games are,

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.930
iOS games are secure.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.860
And these days,
a lot of games are backed by a server.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.220
So it's more important
than ever to be secure.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.670
Most of the developers
that we talk with nowadays,

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.000
certainly over the past year,
have some server infrastructure

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.270
that's supporting gameplay.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:38.600
[ Transcript missing ]

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.690
And this is an important
thing for you to understand,

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.770
particularly if you have
a server-backed game,

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.040
because it has an effect on your
game if you use the new multitasking

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.150
API to do stuff in the background
or when your game isn't running.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.430
So what happens is that data protection
will encrypt data on disk using

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.000
keys based on the user's passcode.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.740
And when an iOS device locks,
we throw away these keys and may no

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.230
longer be able to decrypt the data.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.330
So with the new
multitasking APIs in iOS 7,

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.050
your game may be allowed to
run not only in the background,

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.460
but also when the device is locked.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.290
These are new capabilities.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.260
But the problem is that potentially,
if you need to update your

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.820
game in the background,
you're going to need to access

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:29.450
credentials in order to obtain player
information from your game server.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.140
But if the device is locked,
you might not be able to

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.610
get these credentials.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.920
So while data protection is important
for securing data on the device,

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.830
it's equally important that you use
the latest best practices to securely

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.710
transmit data over the network as well.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.860
And to do this,
it's important to use secure protocols

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:55.000
and to verify certificates and,
whenever possible,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.300
to hash any sensitive data.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.140
And always respect your player's privacy.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.590
And we've got a session
that goes in detail.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:08.270
Around data protection and access,
credential access,

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:11.580
and all of the things that
I just spoke of later on today.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.350
And you don't want to miss it.

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:18.170
And just to drive home the point here,
making your app secure,

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:24.440
making your game secure is not something
that should be an afterthought.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.250
It's important to plan for
these things in advance and to

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.350
ensure a secure user experience.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.330
We have a session, as I said,
later today that will talk

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.400
about this in more detail.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.230
Now, another attribute of
next-generation games is that

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.000
they are designed for touch.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.200
And what this means is that when
you're creating an iOS game,

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:53.270
it's critical that the controls and
interactions are designed with direct

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.960
manipulation and touch in mind.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:01.340
Now, if your game was sort of, you know,
the genesis of your game was, you know,

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.760
recently around iOS, then,
and you thought about

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.860
multi-touch already,
that's sort of the only place

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.430
that your game has existed,
then this is sort of a non-issue.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.420
Of course, it's going to be, you know,
touch-enabled.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.780
But if your game is coming to
iOS from a console platform,

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:21.900
let's say, then the controller there
was designed for you already,

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:27.320
but it had many built-in assumptions
about gameplay and interaction that

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.550
may need to be reconsidered or changed.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.500
So it sort of depends on where you're
coming from with your game as to whether

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.620
or not you are designed for touch or not.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.990
The best games on iOS create
controls that are designed for touch,

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:42.780
as I just said.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.110
And this means taps, swipes, gestures.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:46.010
They work well.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.490
They respond immediately.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.610
They track beneath the user's finger.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.270
They give feedback, this kind of thing.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.800
And by touch, I mean, you know,
that touch defines the

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.200
realm of possible controls,
and the controls define the gameplay.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.130
So it's the gestures and taps that
define the mechanic of the game.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.920
and the key is to create controls
designed around direct interaction,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.040
right?

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:15.780
Direct manipulation reinforced
by instantaneous feedback.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.440
And think about that for a moment.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.860
Direct interaction reinforced
by immediate feedback.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.400
Does your game do that?

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:29.240
So let's go back a few years and
look at a classic example of this.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.920
And I said to you that there are about
10 games that I play over and over.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.200
This is one of them.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.500
This is one of that 10.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.100
I love flight control.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:42.000
And this is flight control for FireBint,
if you didn't know.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.780
They're now part of EA.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:49.290
And this game instantly defined a
completely new genre of gaming when

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.060
it arrived on the App Store in 2008,
by the way.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.360
This was a really innovative game.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:56.300
Talk about technological advances.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.740
These guys had dabbled with the
multi-touch capabilities of the

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:04.500
SDK and had come up with the
game mechanic for flight control.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:10.680
And this is a game that was
designed for touch from the get-go.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.240
So what I mean by that is that you see an
airplane flying in-- you've undoubtedly

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:20.380
played this game-- and you take your
finger and drag a path to the runway that

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:23.490
corresponds to the color of the airplane,
right?

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:25.580
And that's it.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.390
It's super easy.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:27.380
Right?

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.190
It's really great.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.790
There's no other rules.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:31.280
That's how you play the game.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.920
And that's why it's so compelling.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.580
Because people just pick
it up and they're like,

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.580
oh, is that all I need to do?

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.470
That's incredible.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:40.220
And when this first hit the store,
this blew people's minds.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.790
But it's such a super easy interaction.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:45.150
But why is this so great?

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:49.120
Well, it's because your eyes tell
you where the airplane is.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.380
You get audio and visual feedback
when you touch the plane.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.570
You feel friction as you draw
the flight path on the glass.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.120
And you see immediately
the path that you drew.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.750
And you see the effects of that action.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.240
Everything is in sync.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:14.930
And so, in other words, what you feel,
what you see, and what you hear all

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.000
reinforce each other.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.440
This is what being
designed for touch means.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:25.000
And there are not enough games yet on
the App Store that do this correctly.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.130
And we want to work with you today to
make sure that your games are doing this.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:32.960
So what works best for when
you're designing for touch?

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.580
Well,
what works best is game mechanics that

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.840
are built around direct manipulation.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.780
Things like drawing,
dragging path gestures like we just saw,

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.300
swipes, touches, and taps.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:49.140
And that's all versus game mechanics
built around indirect manipulation,

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.500
like virtual D-pads
and virtual joysticks.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:56.830
Those are far less efficient,
and they're not designed for touch.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.900
But there are games that are
based on indirect interaction.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:07.960
And those types of games are great
candidates for augmenting your touch

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.040
input with support for a game controller.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:16.700
And game controllers are super great
for providing the physical feedback

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:22.380
that you need for indirect interactions,
so tight sequence moves and so on.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:27.120
And we'll go into great detail this
afternoon in one of the sessions

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.760
around the MFI game controllers.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:32.940
And you can learn more about them.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.820
We may even have some samples in the lab.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.230
I can't remember.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.460
And so anyway,
that's a quick overview of what

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:42.880
it means to be designed for touch,
which is a vital trait of

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.970
a next-generation game.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.660
And finally,
let's talk about being state of the art.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:52.740
Because next-generation iOS games
consistently need to target the

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.140
latest and greatest to really
differentiate themselves on iOS.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:02.160
If you want to stand out from the crowd,
then take advantage of the latest and

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.970
greatest OS and hardware technologies.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.970
So state of the art games take
advantage of the capabilities

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.840
of the latest iOS devices.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:15.140
Every time we come out with a new device,
we have new capabilities.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.880
I mean, think about it.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.470
Go back to the iPhone 4.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.940
When it came out,
we introduced Retina Display.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.910
Before that,
we had devices that came out,

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:23.490
we introduced the Gyroscope.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:26.140
And prior to that, the very first iPhone
had the accelerometer.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.760
For example.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:31.210
And every time there's a new device,
we're introducing new hardware

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.680
capabilities that you can take
advantage of in your games.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.690
And right now,
new hardware capabilities to

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.110
take advantage of are 64-bit,
the A7 GPU, Open GLES 3.0,

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.200
and those kinds of things.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.620
state-of-the-art apps also
support the latest iOS releases.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:54.340
And we recommend supporting the
current release of iOS and 1 minus,

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.680
so current OS and current OS minus 1.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.630
And this makes a lot of sense when
you recall the speed with which

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.940
people have latched on to iOS 7.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.000
As I mentioned earlier,
as of a few weeks ago,

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:14.320
we saw that 74% of all iOS devices
today of the 700 million that

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:17.860
we announced are running iOS 7.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:22.180
And that's an OS that came
out just a few months ago.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.090
So think about where you are
putting your development resources.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:31.360
How much effort is going
into the iOS 7 slice here,

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.310
the slice that's growing,
versus how much effort are you

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.860
putting into the smaller slice?

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:40.560
I mean, and really,
the challenge is that you need

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.980
to make sure that your resource
allocation isn't out of balance.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.990
Target iOS 7.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.250
That's where the energy is.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.580
Christmas is coming.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:51.660
People are going to buy tons of devices,
and they're all going

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.140
to be running on iOS 7.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.580
So target current iOS
version and one minus that,

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.020
and when the new version
of iOS comes out,

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.910
and undoubtedly there'll be another one,
you know, move to that right away.

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:09.070
State-of-the-art apps also integrate
with built-in game technologies,

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:14.520
and the big ones on iOS 7 are
the improvements to Game Center,

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:20.400
OpenGL ES3, talked about much of this,
the SpriteKit framework, Game Controller,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.420
and AirPlay.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.000
AirPlay,
which has been around for a while,

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.140
but still, not enough games are
taking advantage of it.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.250
There's a huge opportunity here for you.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.300
And there are so many other technologies
in the SDK that have been around

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.430
for a while or that have just been
introduced that are enhancements

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:38.200
to existing frameworks that you can
use to do something really cool on iOS.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:44.410
So familiarize yourself with the built-in
technologies on iOS and integrate them

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:49.790
instead of rolling your own stuff,
instead of creating your own custom

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.650
libraries and trying to do things
that the SDK already does very,

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:59.510
very well and does in an optimal way
for the... for the CPU and the GPU.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.340
And state-of-the-art games also are built
using the current tools and techniques.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.610
Now, our current tool set
includes these three things,

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:09.370
right?

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:14.290
The current shipping version of Xcode,
which is 5.0.1,

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.070
it includes the iOS 7 SDK,
and this version of Xcode

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.940
is for OSÂ X Mavericks.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:25.910
So make sure that your development
machine is running MacÂ OSÂ X Mavericks.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:30.700
Now, sometimes we hear,
from people who say that they're using

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.670
an older SDK and an older version of
Xcode because they think that moving

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:41.240
to the newest stuff is going to mean
that they can't support anything older.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:55.800
[ Transcript missing ]

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.270
So stay current with our tools,
stay current with all of the

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:03.920
capabilities that they provide,
and take advantage of this to reach

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.240
back to earlier versions of the OS.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.140
And we'll cover some more
of this later today as well.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.180
So use the current tools and
techniques and continually

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.840
push ahead to stay modern.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.260
I mean, with every OS and SDK release,
we keep innovating and

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:21.470
adding new capabilities,
like I mentioned earlier.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.340
And players quickly move forward.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:27.980
Your customers are wanting
the latest hardware.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.620
They're buying it,
and they're upgrading to iOS.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.310
They want the newest
capabilities of Game Center.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.620
They want the newest
capabilities of this hardware.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:40.140
And they are going to quickly come to
expect that your game is ready to go.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.440
They're ready for the new hardware
and for the new capabilities.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.360
So it's important that you adopt
these things quickly and avoid the

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.040
temptation of sticking with an older SDK.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:56.910
So avoid standing still, keep investing,
keep learning, and keep current.

00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:59.040
And that's state of the art.

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:02.900
So these are the five characteristics
of next-generation iOS games.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:08.140
They are 64-bit optimized
and optimized for the A7.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.300
They're always up to date.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.600
They're secure.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:11.940
They're designed for touch.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.080
And they are state of the art.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:20.120
And of course, it goes without saying
that they have to be great.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.040
and these along with key
iOS 7 technologies like

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.460
we just mentioned earlier,
OpenGL ES3, etc.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.480
are what we will be
focusing on today in depth.

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:34.640
So iOS 7 and our latest devices make it
possible for you to build next-generation

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.300
iOS games that were impossible to
imagine just a couple of years ago.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.360
So we hope you have a great day.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.920
We're really looking forward
to talking to all of you.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.210
And we're going to take a real
short break right now and start

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:49.040
as soon as we can at 10 a.m.

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.500
on the advances in OpenGL ES 3.0.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.840
Thank you so much for
spending time with us today.
