00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.103
George Karas: Hello,
my name is George Karas,

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:06.673
and I am part of Apple's
Video Partner Operations team.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.309
In this video we'll be covering
two topics.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.712
First, a product overview
of the Apple TV app

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.413
and universal search features.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.550
And second, a deep dive
on how to integrate content

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.652
from your video service
with these services

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:20.520
via metadata feeds.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.356
So let's get started
with an understanding

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.893
of what these features are
in better detail.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:27.594
First, universal search,

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:31.798
which can be experienced by
customers in two primary ways:

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.433
with Siri via your voice

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.936
to search for content
you want to watch,

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.504
as well as text-based search

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.940
through Spotlight
on iOS and macOS.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.743
Safari on macOS
is also supported.

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:44.945
The supported content-types
within universal search

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.750
are movies, episodic TV series,
and live sporting events.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.319
Apple then displays content
in a universal fashion

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.322
on our canonical product pages.

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:57.624
Now, let's talk about
the Apple TV app

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:00.594
and understand how this
compliments universal search.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.696
The Apple TV app
is a standalone application

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.966
that is preinstalled
on both iOS and tvOS devices

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.068
in over 100 countries,

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.671
and is a place for everything
a customer wants to watch,

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.306
all in one place.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.308
The Apple TV app brings
everything together:

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:17.711
movies, TV shows,
sports, and news.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:20.280
It also tracks playback as
a person watches content

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.516
across their favorite
video services,

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.952
so that they can resume watching
right from the TV app,

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.887
across all of their devices.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:29.723
The Apple TV app also provides
notifications to customers

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:32.392
when a new episode is available
of a TV series,

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.361
their favorite sports team
is playing live,

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:35.629
or there's a close game

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.931
that Apple thinks
you wouldn't want to miss.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.333
In addition to these features,

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.902
Apple's Editorial team curates
content in a variety of ways

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:43.804
to promote new things to watch,

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:47.607
allowing customers to discover
new programs from your service.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.243
Next up is the Siri
Live Tune-In feature,

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.879
which is available
on both iOS and tvOS

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.182
and allows customers to tune
directly to live channels

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:56.783
with their voice via Siri.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.251
For TV providers
who are bringing

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.954
their full suite of channels
to Apple's platforms,

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.889
this is a great way
to allow your customers

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.693
to conveniently navigate
your entire EPG by their voice

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:10.764
simply by requesting the name
of the channel that is desired.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:12.566
Now that we've covered
what these features are,

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:13.667
it's time to understand

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.503
how to technically integrate
with them.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.038
In order for your service
to integrate

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:19.339
with these features,

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.075
metadata feeds are required
to be provided to Apple

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.744
so that your content can be
displayed

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:26.346
within the Apple TV app.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.447
These metadata feeds

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.150
are provided in Apple's
XML specification,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.418
and there are two kinds of feeds

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:33.186
you will need to understand
and develop

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.822
to participate
with this service.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.457
First, the catalog feed,

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.026
which contains
descriptive metadata

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.994
about your VOD movies
and TV shows

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.729
and live sporting events.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.164
If you are integrating
live sports

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.799
into the Apple TV app as well,

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.100
then Apple recommends
you provide

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.837
two separate catalog feeds:
one for your VOD content items

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.173
and another
for your live sports.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.575
The second type of feed
is availability,

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.244
which corresponds
to the catalog feeds

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.212
provided separately,
and informs Apple

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.548
when your content is playable
with start and end dates

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.017
along with deep-link URLs
that the Apple TV app will use

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.119
to direct customers
to your application,

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.955
so content can be opened
and played.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:11.391
Let's first start with an
overview of the catalog feed.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.561
Again, this is an Apple XML feed
of descriptive metadata,

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.530
such as titles and descriptions.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.265
TV series are
structured appropriately

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.233
across three different
content types:

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.303
TV shows, TV seasons associated
to the show,

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:26.006
and TV episodes
that make up the season.

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:29.443
Apple also supports season lists
and mini-series TV-show types

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.912
that can be provided without
the TV season level,

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:34.481
and instead
only the show and episodes.

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.017
In addition to these elements,
we request that you provide

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:40.454
a release date for movies,
premiere dates for TV shows,

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.689
and air dates for episodes.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.891
Ratings or age classifications

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.094
can also be included
in your catalog feed,

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.062
along with cast and crew
information

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.164
and the network that originally
aired the TV show

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:53.467
or studio that produced
the movie.

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.302
All of this information
from your catalog feed

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.971
is used for mapping purposes
on the Apple side,

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.606
so that we can
accurately understand

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:01.675
that your content matches
existing references

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.743
for the same movie or TV show
in our system

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:07.314
and can present it accordingly
on our canonical product pages.

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:09.783
The last key piece
to the catalog feed is artwork,

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:12.319
which can be provided
for your movies and TV shows.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.688
Apple has the ability
to leverage existing metadata

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:17.390
and imagery to build out
the canonical product pages.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.757
However, it is important

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.360
that your metadata meet
our quality standards,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.996
so that it can be
managed efficiently by Apple.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.364
Artwork is important to be sure

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:27.033
your content is displayed well
within the Apple TV app,

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.369
especially for content being
prominently placed or promoted

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.338
by Apple's Editorial team.

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:33.406
Now let's take a look
at some XML samples

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:36.543
to get a bit more familiar
with these feeds.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:38.645
Here we have a sample
for providing a movie

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:42.149
in the Apple XML catalog feed
specification.

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:44.551
The first things that call out
is the contentType element --

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.853
which in this example,
is equal to movie --

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:50.757
and a contentID that you'll use
to identify an item in the feed.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.626
It's important that the
contentID values you provide

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.162
across your items are unique
to meet the spec

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:57.931
and also remain static
for that item.

00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:59.566
Now let's take a look at how

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.169
some of the descriptive metadata
elements are provided.

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.173
Here we can see the following:
title, description, genre,

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:08.575
ratings, and credit information.

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.610
It's also important to notice
how certain elements,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.213
like titles and descriptions,
are provided with a locale

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:15.415
that indicates the language
of the metadata.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.350
Locales are very important
for processing your metadata

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.085
in Apple systems

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:22.455
and displaying it correctly
on our customers' devices.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.658
In addition to the metadata
you are able to provide

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.693
for your content
from your own systems,

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:29.429
you are also able to provide
an external identifier,

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.398
such as a TMS ID from Gracenote

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:34.234
that can help Apple with mapping
your content efficiently.

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.269
This is especially important
if you have challenges

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.005
around providing certain pieces
of information accurately

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.943
to the definitions
of Apple's specifications.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:45.512
Within the movie item,
cover artwork can be provided,

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:46.947
and it's important to note

00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:49.783
that in addition to the cover
artwork shown in this example,

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:52.118
there are a variety of supported
image types that can provided

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:53.820
for your content
through the feed,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.090
such as background images
and title-treatment logos.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.092
You'll need to study
the documentation available

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.528
for further detail on images.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.331
Lastly, within the movieInfo
block is where you will provide

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:07.434
other factual information,
such as the type of the movie,

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:10.437
the duration in seconds,
production studio,

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:12.339
and the original release date.

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:16.009
All of these are very important
for mapping on the Apple side.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.012
Now, for quick comparison,
let's look at a TV-show example,

00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:20.647
which is very similar to a movie

00:06:20.647 --> 00:06:23.083
but with some
important differences.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:24.618
The contentType element is used

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:27.087
to distinguish this item
correctly as a TV show,

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:29.489
and the same rules apply
for contentID values here,

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.758
as mentioned for movies.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:34.928
Similar to movies, we have a set
of descriptive information:

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:38.498
title, description, genre,
ratings and advisories,

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.233
and credit information.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.370
Locale values are equally
important here as well.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.305
Cover artwork and other
image types

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.207
can also be provided
for TV shows

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:49.609
by indicating the URL
the image is available at,

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:50.977
the type of image it is,

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:53.146
and the locale to represent
the language of the artwork

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:55.749
if it contains text.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.118
As mentioned, there are
different types of TV shows,

00:06:58.118 --> 00:07:00.320
which will impact the structure
of the TV episode

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.289
that relate to the show:

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:03.857
standard with seasons;

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.959
seasonless or miniseries
are without seasons;

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.527
and then along with the network

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:09.396
that originally aired
the TV show;

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:10.797
and the date
it originally premiered,

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:14.401
which can be worldwide or local
to a country.

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:16.136
Now, let's talk about
sharing information

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:18.305
about your sporting events
in the catalog feed.

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:19.439
Again, Apple encourages you

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.074
to provide a separate
catalog feed

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:22.409
for your sporting events,

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.110
different from your VOD
catalog feed

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.780
that contains your movies
and TV shows.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.348
For each item
in this sports feed,

00:07:28.348 --> 00:07:30.417
you must indicate
the type of sport it is --

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:33.720
such as basketball,
baseball, or cricket --

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.423
and the league or tournament
the event is a part of.

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.024
For both of these,
Apple provides a dictionary

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:39.959
of sport name
and league abbreviation

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.662
that are required to use
in the catalog feed.

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.798
For mapping purposes,
it is important to indicate

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.734
the season of the league
the event is a part of,

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:50.036
as well as the competitors
participating in that event,

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.838
which would be
the teams playing in the game

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:52.872
or individual athletes,

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:55.375
depending on the type of sport
you are providing.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.744
Additionally, including venue
information helps our system

00:07:57.744 --> 00:08:00.280
with processing and mapping
your sporting events.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.916
And when it comes to artwork
for sports in the Apple TV app,

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.418
it is not required to be shared
in the catalog feed.

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:07.220
Apple handles artwork
for sporting events

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.988
entirely from third parties
that we manage

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.990
and work with to ensure
images are appropriate

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.593
for use in the Apple TV app.

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:15.228
So let’s take a look
at how sports look

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:17.063
in the catalog feed.

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:19.366
Just like we saw before
for movies and TV shows,

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:20.700
you must indicate
the contentType

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.302
equal to "sporting_event"

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:25.405
and provide an appropriate
contentId value.

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:27.741
Titles and descriptions
are supported in the same way,

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:30.176
along with external identifiers
to help with mapping

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.812
if these are available to share.

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.179
Within the
sportingEventInfo block

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.414
is where you will indicate

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:38.485
the sport name
and league abbreviation.

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:39.818
Venue information
has its own block

00:08:39.818 --> 00:08:41.855
so that you can indicate
the name of the stadium

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.424
along with where it's located.

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:46.292
For competitor's data,
you will provide the name,

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.927
such as Lakers and Warriors;

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:50.897
team abbreviations from
your own system, if available;

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:54.701
and designation of each of these
as the home or away team.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.636
If you are unable
to provide competitors

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:57.971
for a particular event,

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:01.941
the venue information
will be required for that item.

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.244
Now that we have reviewed the
catalog feeds at a high level,

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.712
let’s talk about
the availability feeds

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.414
that you will also
need to provide

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:09.449
so that your content
can appear at the right time

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:10.984
in the Apple TV app.

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:12.685
There’s three types
of availability feeds

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.422
that are important
for you to understand.

00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:16.456
The first schema is VOD

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:19.526
for your on demand movie
and TV show content.

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:21.895
The second is a linear
availability schema

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:22.996
for your live sporting events

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:26.199
that take place
on a 24/7 linear channel.

00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:29.102
It’s required to provide one
linear availability per channel

00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:31.805
that carries
live sporting events.

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.506
The last schema
is similar to VOD,

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:36.109
but is an availability feed
for live sporting events

00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:39.212
that are played in event-based
fashion on a video service.

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:40.814
This is to support live games,

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:42.949
outside of
a 24/7 linear channel,

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:45.385
where the playable stream is
only available on your service

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:48.822
for duration the game
is being played live.

00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:50.457
First, let’s understand
some basics

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:53.560
before we dig into
these types further.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.961
Each availability feed
you provide

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.664
will require a serviceId value
that must be unique,

00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:00.800
and used to identify the feed
in Apple’s systems.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.535
Each item
in the availability feeds

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.771
will need to also reference
the catalogId value

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:08.308
so that Apple can match up
the information appropriately.

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:09.876
Playable properties
allow you to indicate

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:12.278
the audio language
and video streaming quality

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.881
of the content or channel
you are providing the feed for,

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.783
in addition to any
advanced media options

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:20.186
that may be available,
such as HDR.

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.155
The primary purpose
of the availability feeds

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:25.158
is to control the availability
and presentation of your content

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:27.327
within the Apple TV app
by offers --

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:28.728
window start
and end dates --

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:29.829
and restrictions --

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:32.031
information about where
and how your subscribers

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:34.667
are able to play back
the content.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:38.271
So let’s dig in, starting with
the VOD availability feed.

00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:41.207
For each playable item,
start and end dates are shared

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:43.243
to control when your video
service can be included

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:46.646
as a playable option
on the canonical product page.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.148
Deep-link URLs are also
provided for each item

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.383
so that the Apple TV app

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.385
can send customers
to your application

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:55.021
to open and play the content
appropriately.

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.623
And additional restrictions
are shared

00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:58.091
if your content
requires the customer

00:10:58.091 --> 00:11:01.661
to have a specific
subscription package.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.062
Here’s a sample
of a movie item

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:06.766
provided in
the VOD availability feed.

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.668
You can see here that
the contentType for that item

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.436
is also indicated in this feed,

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:13.373
in addition to the contentId
value and catalogId value

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.341
that carries the rest of
the descriptive information

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.143
for it separately.

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.778
Via the locators elements,

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:21.314
you are able to provide
the appropriate deep-link URLs

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:23.783
for your iOS
and tvOS applications

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.985
so that the content
can be opened for browsing,

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.487
or to initiate playback
automatically

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:29.188
if the customer has the
appropriate entitlements

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.924
to do so.

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:32.592
Playable property
information is shared

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:35.128
to indicate the language that
the content is available in,

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:36.529
the quality
of the video stream --

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.964
which for this example
is a movie

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:40.600
playable with HDR capability.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.136
Additional language components
that may also be available --

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:45.939
like English closed captions
or Spanish subtitles,

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:47.674
as presented in this example --

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:50.843
can be indicated within
the playable properties as well.

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:54.113
Within the offers element is
where an offer can be provided

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:56.149
to specifically identify
the windowStart

00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:58.084
and windowEnd dates within it.

00:11:58.084 --> 00:11:58.952
The offeringType indicates

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.354
what type of customer
can play the content.

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:03.756
In this example, we see
the Subscription type shown,

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:07.760
and the other two possible types
here are Free and Account.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.163
Subscription represents
paid subscribers,

00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:11.364
Account represents customers

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:13.499
with an association
to a video service

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:16.102
with something such as
an email address,

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:18.838
and Free indicates the content
is readily playable for anyone

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:21.908
without any sign-up
or payment required.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.444
The availability feed
supports the concept

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:26.613
of content changing
offering types,

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:29.148
and restrictions can also be
added to the offeringType

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:31.117
to represent
various subscription packages

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:33.586
that are a part
of your video service.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.689
For multiple offers,
simply repeat the offer elements

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:39.892
with their respective
offeringType and window dates,

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:42.929
and add restriction tier
elements to package your content

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.665
according to how it is
offered to your customers.

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:47.700
The tier names used
are for you to define

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.335
but must represent packages,

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:50.970
and it’s best to avoid
special characters

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.340
or exceedingly long values.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.542
Now let’s review
linear availability feeds,

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.511
which are used
to provide information about

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:01.214
when live sporting events are
playing on a specific channel

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:03.416
that is part
of your video service.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:04.851
Start and end dates
are provided,

00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:06.886
along with the stream properties
of the channel,

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.022
so that Apple can represent
the audio language

00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:11.257
and video quality appropriately.

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:14.594
Just like VOD, deep-link URLs
are shared within this feed.

00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:17.263
However, these are specific
to a playable linear channel

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:18.364
in your video service

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:21.467
instead of being specific
to a content item.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.069
Live and broadcast flags
are important

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:25.405
to represent the content
accordingly to Apple,

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:28.141
and present these games
as live events or re-airs

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.643
within the Apple TV app.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.912
Here’s a sample
linear availability feed

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:36.516
to help you get familiar
with the differences from VOD.

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:38.184
The basics apply here as well,

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:40.520
as these also have
their own serviceId

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.522
used to identify
that channel’s feed,

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:44.657
along with a serviceType
equal to "linear"

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.393
to differentiate the data
in Apple’s systems.

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:48.895
Because
a linear availability feed

00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:50.863
is required per live channel,

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:54.100
the serviceId must be unique
across these feeds.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.835
Locator deep-links
are also provided

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.603
at the service level
of the feed,

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.772
and here we can see
playableProperties information

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:00.707
being used to indicate

00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:04.277
this is an English-language
channel with closed captioning,

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:05.545
HD video quality,

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:09.148
and 5.1 surround sound
capability.

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.683
And serviceOffers are used

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.318
to represent that
this channel is available

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:14.153
to subscription-level customers,

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:15.688
but additionally
restricted to those

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:18.558
that also subscribe
to sportsPackage12,

00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:20.626
and are in a specific location
of the United States

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:25.465
as represented by the
Nielsen DMA value indicated.

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:26.866
To help you develop these feeds,

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.368
here are some things
you should know.

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:31.637
XSD files are available
with the specifications

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:34.207
to assist with
your validation exercises.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:37.376
Apple also provides access to
the Media Feed Validator tool

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.845
to generate validation
reports

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:40.680
and a visual representation
of them

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.715
to be sure you are
meeting Apple’s specifications

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.051
and quality standards.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.919
Once your feeds are passing
the Media Feed Validator

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:50.156
without errors, they are
ready for review by Apple.

00:14:50.156 --> 00:14:52.258
All feeds are reviewed by Apple
before being accepted

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:55.061
into our production system
for regular ingestion,

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.729
and upon approval
you can start testing

00:14:56.729 --> 00:15:00.133
your video service integration
with the Apple TV app.

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:01.200
Thanks for joining
this session

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.770
to better understand the product
features of the Apple TV app

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.840
and the metadata requirements
to participate with the service.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.041
Adhering to the specifications

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:10.743
and recommendations
in this video

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:13.146
will help make your onboarding
process a smooth journey

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:15.381
towards customers
enjoying your best video content

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.916
from the Apple TV app.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.918
Thank you!
