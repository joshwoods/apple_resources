WEBVTT

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.539
Starting with tvOS 11.2,

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.009
Apple TV 4K can automatically
switch video display modes

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.411
to match the native frame rate
and dynamic range

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.814
of video content.

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.183
The Video and Audio section
of the Settings app

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.919
allows the matching frame rate
and dynamic range behavior

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.489
to be set independently,
and enables viewing of content

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.692
it its original frame rate
and dynamic range.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.462
By default,
these options are disabled.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:29.563
When enabled,

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:32.466
and video content is played back
in a compatible app,

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.969
tvOS will automatically switch
the video display settings

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.839
to match that of the content.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.276
For instance, if the content
is in 24 frames per second

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.745
and standard dynamic range,

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.114
the device will switch
from its system mode

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:51.251
to 24 frame per second,
standard dynamic range mode.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.787
Once the media playback session
is over,

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:56.790
the device will then switch back
to its system mode.

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.761
The first step in supporting
frame rate matching

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:04.831
for your content is to ensure
that your HLS master playlists

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.267
are fully annotated
with the native frame rate

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.237
of the variants
using the FRAME-RATE attribute.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:13.106
If a playlist does not include
the FRAME-RATE attribute,

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.108
frame rate mode switching
will not be supported

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.743
for that asset.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.012
Furthermore, only playlists
that declare

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.848
either a single frame rate
for all variants

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.517
or only have frame rates

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:26.286
that are integer multiples
of the smallest frame rate

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.287
are supported.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.590
For example, 29.97 and 59.94.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.962
Dynamic range mode matching

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:38.098
does not typically require
any changes to your playlists,

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.033
as content is assumed
to be SDR

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.337
unless the VIDEO-RANGE attribute
specifies otherwise,

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:44.972
as all non-SDR content

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:47.975
must include the VIDEO-RANGE
attribute already.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.078
Apps that use
AVPlayerViewController

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:53.347
will automatically support
mode matching,

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:56.483
unless the appliesPreferred
DisplayCriteriaAutomatically

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.485
property is changed to false.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.888
When content is played back
in full screen

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:06.293
using AVPlayerViewController,
tvOS will automatically switch

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:09.529
to the appropriate display mode
for that content.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.665
Then, when
AVPlayerViewController

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:14.334
leaves full-screen mode
or is dismissed,

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.337
tvOS will switch back
to its system display mode.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.941
For apps that play back
full-screen content

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.810
using AVPlayerViewController
or TVMLKit,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.213
no additional work is required.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.582
However, for other scenarios
where your video

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:31.651
might not always be played back
in full screen,

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:35.155
if you are playing
multiple videos simultaneously,

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.425
switching between different
short videos frequently,

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.927
or you aren't using
AVPlayerViewController

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:44.564
for your video playback,
you may need to directly specify

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:47.868
the AVDisplayManager
preferredDisplayCriteria

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:50.704
to ensure that the mode switch
occurs at the right time

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:52.406
and reflects the characteristics

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.441
of the appropriate
media content.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.745
If you are using
AVPlayerViewController

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:01.715
and wish to opt out of
mode switching entirely

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.684
or need to manage
the display mode manually,

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:05.685
begin by setting

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:09.523
the appliesPreferredDisplay
CriteriaAutomatically property

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:12.692
of AVPlayerViewController
to false.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:17.564
This will disable the automatic
AVKit matching behavior.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.999
Then, to trigger tvOS
to switch modes

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.235
to match a specific piece
of content,

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.038
retrieve the AVDisplayCriteria
object vended by

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:29.076
the preferredDisplayCriteria
property of the AVAsset.

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:31.411
Assign that
AVDisplayCriteria object

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.680
to the preferredDisplayCriteria
property

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.251
of the AVDisplayManager vended
by the key UIWindow.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.088
The mode switch will occur
upon setting this property,

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:43.657
assuming that matching
was enabled in settings

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:48.161
and that the attached device
supports the preferred mode.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.063
You should perform this switch
before assigning

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.532
the AVPlayerItem
to the AVPlayer object

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.634
so that AVPlayer
configures itself

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.970
based on the targeted
display mode.

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.774
To switch back
to the system's default mode,

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:02.776
simply set
the preferredDisplayCriteria

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:04.277
property to nil.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.014
To know when the mode switch
begins and ends,

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.282
you can key-value observe

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.384
the displayModeSwitchInProgress
property

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:15.088
of the AVDisplayManager object.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.589
To help you determine
the best way

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.659
to make use of this new feature
in your media application,

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.729
here are some guidelines
to keep in mind:

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.665
Switch modes only as often
as necessary.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:29.069
All televisions respond to mode
switching a little differently,

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.104
but it will generally cause
the screen to flash

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.006
or temporarily black out,

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.041
and may take a few seconds
to complete.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.343
This can be disruptive

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:40.013
if it occurs more often
than necessary.

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.448
Typically, mode switching

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.584
is only appropriate
for full-screen playback.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.987
Matching frame rate
and dynamic range for content

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:49.723
that plays in the background,
as a thumbnail,

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:52.192
or as an interstitial
as part of a game,

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:56.663
can be quite disruptive
and is generally unnecessary.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.832
The primary user interface
of your app,

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:01.134
outside of the video viewing
experience,

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.136
should be run
in the system's frame rate

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:07.240
so that UI and animations
are smooth and fluid.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.210
When the television
is in a lower frame rate mode,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.678
those animations and movements

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.847
will also render
at that frame rate,

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:16.383
and may appear less smooth
as a result.

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.853
There are also
several circumstances

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:22.189
where leaving the device
in its system mode

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.625
will yield an improved
user experience.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.795
If your app plays shorter clips,

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:32.299
displays multiple video tiles
simultaneously,

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:34.501
or frequently switches
between content

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.870
with disparate characteristics,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.573
it would be preferred
to avoid mode switching entirely

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:43.343
to ensure the viewing experience
is not disrupted unnecessarily.

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:48.648
tvOS 11.2 enables
video content frame rate

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:53.220
and dynamic range matching
on Apple TV 4K.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.354
AVPlayerViewController

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.891
can manage this behavior
automatically,

00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:59.526
but some apps will want
more control

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:03.196
by utilizing AVDisplayManager
and AVDisplayCriteria.

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:08.501
