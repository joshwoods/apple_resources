00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:04.171
Hi, I'm Tim Horton from
the Safari and WebKit team,

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:06.139
and today I'm going to show you
how easy it is

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.343
to ensure that users get
beautiful, rich presentations

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.845
when sharing links
to your website in Messages

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.447
and elsewhere on the system.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.216
Imagine that a user of your site

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.885
is reading about
your latest new product,

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.654
and wants to share a link to it
with their friend.

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.756
They'll use the Share Sheet
in Safari

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.491
and send it via Messages.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:28.962
On the other side,

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.965
their friend will see a very
inviting link to tap on.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.769
I'm going to walk you through
the straightforward steps

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.703
you need to take

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.440
to get your link looking
just as good as these.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.510
First, we'll talk about
customizing the title.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.513
Then, about adding
helpful icons.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:50.250
And then large images,
to make our links really pop.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.986
Then we'll go a step beyond
the links we've seen so far

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.957
and add autoplaying
inline video.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:57.858
And finally,

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.360
we'll finish up with a few
other resources you can use

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.030
to help improve your site.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.031
So, let's jump right in

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:07.234
by customizing
the title of our link.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.803
You likely already have
an HTML <title> tag

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:14.207
in the <head> of your pages,
and that will work just fine.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.176
There is a little bit of
unnecessary duplication

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.412
between the title
and the domain, though.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.213
We could change
the page's title,

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.983
but in this case, we still want
the window title in Safari

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.352
to have the Apple suffix.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:29.089
So instead, we can add another
tag to our page's <head>.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:33.460
This is a <meta> tag,
with the name "og:title".

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.096
The "og" there
stands for "Open Graph,"

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.698
which is the standard
that specifies

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:39.766
the names of these tags.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.835
The web browser will still
use the <title> tag

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.270
for the window title,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.175
but the rich link will use
the "og:title" instead.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:52.212
Now we have a nice title
with no redundancy.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.448
It's best to keep titles
unique and informative

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.950
so that rich links contain
at least as much context

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.753
as the URL would have provided.

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:00.654
You should also avoid

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.322
duplicating the site name
in the title,

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.091
since the domain name
is also provided

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.293
on the second line of the link.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.694
It's important to keep in mind

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.830
that JavaScript does not run
when creating rich links,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.065
so the Open Graph tags

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.368
need to be in the source
of the page

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:17.571
and cannot be
generated dynamically.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.639
Next, we can spruce up
our link a bit

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.376
by adding an icon.

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:24.211
There are many ways
to specify icons,

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.780
from favicons
to Apple touch icons,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.250
and it's likely your site
already uses one of them.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.586
If it doesn't, the best way
to add an icon

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:35.422
is by adding a "link rel
equals icon" tag

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:38.225
to your site's <head>.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:40.327
And this is what our link
looks like now.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.596
For some pages,
this is all you need.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.264
If a large hero image
doesn't make sense,

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:47.000
you can stop here.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.902
But in our case,
we have a nice big image

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.771
that is specific to this page,

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:55.275
so let's continue on
and make our link even nicer.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.110
To provide an image
for a rich link,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.946
we can add another Open Graph
meta tag to our <head> --

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.649
this time, "og:image".

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:06.253
The content is just
the URL of the image.

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:10.023
Now our link looks just like
the real one on apple.com!

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.792
You may have noticed that
we don't show the icon

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.160
if we have an image.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.395
It's still a good idea
to specify both,

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.331
because there are times when
we'll fall back to the icon --

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.635
for example, in cases of
poor network connectivity.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.839
You should only use "og:image"
for interesting images

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.642
that are specific
to the particular page.

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:29.976
Generic fallback images --

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.779
like your company's logo
or a user's avatar --

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.115
should be icons instead.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.384
Images should not include text.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:41.221
Rich links are presented at
many sizes, across many devices.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.590
The same image will be shown
all the way from Apple Watch

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.891
to iPad Pro,

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.760
and text in an image
will not scale well

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.895
across all of those.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.531
And as I mentioned before,
you should still specify an icon

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:53.667
even if you also have an image.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.504
Now we'll take our link
a step beyond images

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:01.975
and introduce an autoplaying,
autolooping video.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.810
All that's needed for
inline video

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.079
is yet another Open Graph tag.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.682
This time, "og:video".

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:12.252
The URL should point to a small,
downloadable video file

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:16.055
of any format that iOS and macOS
can natively play.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.026
As you see,
the video plays inline.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.628
If the video contains audio,

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:26.500
it starts out muted but
with the option to unmute it.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.969
If you can't host
a video file yourself,

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.240
you can instead point your
og:video at a YouTube embed URL.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.408
YouTube videos won't autoplay,

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.944
but the user can tap
to play them.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.580
It's important to note that
this is specific to YouTube;

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.983
other embedded players
will not work.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.087
When adding video metadata
to your site,

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:49.556
it's important to
keep the size in mind.

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:52.025
The icon, image,
and video together

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.227
are limited to 10 megabytes,

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:56.997
and the smaller they are,
the faster the link will appear

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:00.167
and the happier your users
will be.

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.435
You should use
directly referenced video files

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.539
for the ideal
autoplaying behavior.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.908
And like I said earlier,
except for YouTube,

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:10.911
embedded video that
requires HTML or plug-ins

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:13.113
is not supported.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:14.548
I hope you'll take
this information

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:17.083
and go and add Open Graph
metadata to your website

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.219
to make sure that when
your users share links to it,

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.555
they get the best
possible experience.

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:23.857
For more information and
additional resources about

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:25.192
