00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.920
Hi, I'm John Geleynsse, Director of
Technology Evangelism at Apple.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.100
With more and more apps on
the App Store every day,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.420
it's important to take your app
to the next level to get noticed.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.560
In this video,
I'll show you some great apps

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.560
on the App Store today that
set new standards in usability,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.600
design, and innovation.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.870
These examples will help you to
understand the characteristics and key

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.600
ingredients that make apps really great.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.600
So let's get started.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.890
Here are the seven ingredients that
we've seen in some of the best apps on

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.770
the App Store and as we've worked with
countless developers creating apps for

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.600
iPhone and iPad over the past few years.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.010
As you design and create your iOS app,
be sure to incorporate as many

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.410
of these ingredients as possible.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.600
Let's look at these one by one.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.530
First of all, great iPhone and iPad
apps are delightful.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.280
They draw you in,
they keep you satisfied,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.600
and leave you with a great experience.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Making you come back again and again.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
Delightful apps do this in several ways.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600
First, they're inviting.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.300
They have an attractive design that
leaves a great first impression.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.590
So be sure that your app leaves a
great first impression with users.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.700
Delightful apps are also intuitive.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.220
This means that people know
exactly what to do when they first

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.000
launch them and never need to
consult a manual or any other help.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.060
Intuitive apps are designed with
users in mind and they're organized

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.280
in ways that meet user expectations.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.250
So the question is this:
is your app intuitive or is it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.640
difficult for people to use?

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.360
Delightful apps are also engaging.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.270
This means that they keep
people coming back for more.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.810
Your app should meet a need so
effectively and provide so much value

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.110
that users come back again and again.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.600
Delightful apps are also enabling.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.720
Meaning they allow people to do
things they couldn't do before.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.150
I mean, think about this for a moment.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.190
How will your app do this?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.800
How will your app do what it does in
a way that's never been done before?

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.060
And finally,
delightful apps are exciting.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.900
This means they generate
enthusiasm in people,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.040
they have flair,
and they show great attention to detail.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.150
And in my experience,
apps in any category of the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.040
App Store can be exciting.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.890
Here's a great example of
a very inviting casual game

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.360
called Dizzy B by Igloo Games.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.620
This app leaves you with a
very happy first impression.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.000
It's attractive,
has bright and friendly colors,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.760
very cute sounds, and is very responsive.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.300
And a whole lot of fun to play.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.340
And keep in mind,
these are really valuable

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.800
attributes to have,
even if your app isn't a game.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.340
Here's another really inviting
game called Carcassonne.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.980
It's just like the real board game,
which many families and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.540
friends like to play.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.840
If you've ever played the real
board game and then discovered

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.520
this app on the App Store,
you won't be disappointed.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.020
Carcassonne for iPad uses
high-quality textures and visual

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.700
elements from the real board
game that look fantastic on iPad.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.180
The production value of your
app's artwork should be as

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.220
high-quality as possible,
too.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.860
And, wherever possible,
your app should mimic the real world

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.860
or try to reflect elements of what
people are used to when they're

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.840
doing the things your app does.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.200
Here's Time Tuner by Dream Surface.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.540
It's a bedside clock radio
with location-awareness,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.980
and it's also a great way
to get your app to work.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.980
It's also a great way
to get your app to work.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.980
It's also a great way
to get your app to work.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.980
It's a great way to get your app to work.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.980
It's a great app that's super
intuitive and does one thing so well,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.980
it could become a replacement for
the real thing for some people.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.940
Your app should do one thing well
and not try to do too many things.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.960
Now,
here's an example of an engaging app.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.920
Remember,
engaging means that the app keeps

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.120
you coming back again and again.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.660
This is Tab Toolkit by Agile Partners.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.520
It won an Apple Design Award in 2010.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.380
It lets you download and sync tablature
files from the web to your iPad,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.120
and then use them to learn how to
play a piano or chord a guitar.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.110
It looks like sheet music,
and yet offers the ability

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.840
to change instruments,
change tempo,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.600
isolate left hand or right hand,
bass guitar or lead guitar,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.720
and much more.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.990
And it's these capabilities,
combined with lots of valuable content,

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.340
that keep users coming back for more.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.480
So what will your app do to be sticky
and bring people back time and again?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.700
And finally,
here's an example of an exciting app.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.320
It's the Jamie Oliver 20-Minute
Meals app for iPhone.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.580
It too won an Apple Design Award in 2010.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.530
It lets you pick great recipes,
manage their ingredients,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.490
organize grocery lists,
watch streaming videos,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.280
and follow detailed
step-by-step instructions.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.420
And the visual design of this
app is really attractive.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.790
Great production value.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.180
It's nicely organized and it uses
the latest technologies on iOS.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.600
That's what great apps do.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.520
But what sets this app apart
is its attention to detail.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.320
Because when you're following a recipe
step-by-step and then rotate the iPhone,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.830
you get a larger,
more legible presentation

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.020
of instructions.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.820
And then,
if you tap the screen on the left,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.120
you get a photo of how the food should
appear at that stage in the recipe.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.820
I mean, how cool is that?

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.700
That's not what you'd expect.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.000
And as a result,
it surprises and excites.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.580
Great apps sweat the details.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.200
So how will your app
exceed user expectations?

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.660
So that's Delightful,
the first of seven essential

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.930
ingredients for great apps.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.920
Great iPhone and iPad
apps are innovative.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.000
By innovation I mean groundbreaking,
jaw-dropping, category defining.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.920
I mean really inspirational apps and
apps that are a breath of fresh air.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.700
Take Flight Control by FireMint.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.550
It's a highly addictive air traffic
control app which is used multi-touch

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.190
to allow you to tap an incoming
airplane and drag a path to the

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.290
runway matching the airplane's color.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.630
If two planes are going to collide,
you can tap one of them

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.250
and drag a new flight path.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.500
It's simple to learn, easy to play,
and super addictive.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.010
Now, the innovative thing about
this app is that at the moment

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.990
it arrived on the App Store,
it defined a completely

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.500
new genre of gaming.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.620
Until then,
no one had ever done an app with

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.380
that type of interaction model.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.140
Your goal should be to create
a genre-defining app too.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.870
Here's another really great
example of an innovative app.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.310
This is Peaks by Augmented Outdoors,
an app that lets you identify mountains

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.580
by triangulating iPhone's GPS location,
compass bearing,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.580
and accelerometer to accurately determine
which direction you're looking and

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.400
how far away you are from a mountain.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.860
It then tells you the name, height,
and distance of the

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.980
mountain you're looking at.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.860
How cool is that?

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.390
Before iOS and the App Store,
we couldn't imagine these

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.340
types of innovative solutions.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.930
And now there are more and more augmented
reality apps every day transforming

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.350
how we use our iPhones and iPads and
changing the way we get things done.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.410
How will you take advantage of similar
hardware and software features of iPhone,

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.700
iPad and iOS to augment
what your app does?

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.000
Here's an augmented
reality app for golfers.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.700
This is Golfscape by
ShotZoom Software LLC.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.520
Hold this app up as you look down the
fairway and it will tell you how far

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.550
away the green is and what obstacles
and traps exist and where they are.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.180
Amazing!

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.700
Great apps exceed users' expectations.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.700
Yours should too.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.610
Here's Zipcar.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.340
This is car rental
without the countertops,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.420
the agents,
the parking lots or any of that stuff.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.650
It lets people find the nearest
available Zipcar and reserve it.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.780
And then as you walk towards
the vehicle and get nearby,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.700
the app displays a key fob so you can
unlock the doors and honk the horn.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.500
That's awesome!

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.700
It's great apps like
this that get noticed.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.700
And here's a fantastic new app that
recently appeared on the App Store.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.700
It's called Word Lens by Quest Visual.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.390
This is unbelievable innovation.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.660
It translates English to
Spanish and back on the fly.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.830
It maintains relative font size, color,
thickness and transparency

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.700
and background color.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.670
Watch this carefully.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.960
Isn't that amazing?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.080
Great apps like this are unforgettable.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.820
And then there's Doodle Jump,
an incredibly addictive app that has

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.040
several innovations worth noting.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:13.380
First, a simple swipe to change themes
instead of a more modal approach.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.180
Second, in-game leaderboards.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.540
And third,
they do regular updates with new

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:24.120
themes and creatures and gameplay,
keeping users coming back for more.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.680
Great apps make things
simple and constantly provide

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.120
users with great value.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.150
And the last example of innovation
is Scrabble by Electronic Arts.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.480
Check this out.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.460
So here we have two people playing a
game of Scrabble using their iPads.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.180
Lots of fun.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.880
But check this out.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.920
You can manage your letters in
private on your iPhone or iPod

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.930
Touch and then move them to the main
board with a simple flick gesture.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.010
What a riot!

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.220
With 160 million iOS devices out there,
people are looking for really great

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.940
software to take advantage of the
iPhones and iPads that they already have.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.060
And so these are a few examples
of really innovative apps.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.410
So the question is this:
What innovations will

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.060
you build into your app?

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.210
Now, let's talk about optimization.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.400
Great iPhone and iPad
apps are also optimized.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.450
Now optimization means several things.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.700
First, it means that great
apps are high quality.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.700
This means they function as designed.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.690
They're robust.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.870
They're stable.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.700
They're reliable.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.340
They're just what people
expect on iPhone and iPad.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.240
Optimization also means
that you make sure your app

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.730
delivers maximum performance.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.060
It launches quickly,
it's really responsive,

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.580
and it's super efficient.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.610
Optimization also means optimizing your
app's integration with iOS technologies.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.880
That means using as many of the powerful
built-in frameworks as you can to

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.720
deliver rich functionality rather than
writing your own duplicate frameworks.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.910
And here are some of the frameworks
available to your app on iOS,

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.350
but there are many,
many more within the SDK.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.540
These frameworks are what we use
to develop iOS itself and what we

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.640
use for built-in apps like Safari,
Mail, Photos, and more.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.840
These are mature, stable,
hardware accelerated.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.720
They're localized and accessible,
so using them means your app

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.580
will be these things too.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.720
Lastly, optimizing your app means
building something that's

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.520
made specifically for iOS.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.860
And targeted at the iPhone or iPad,
rather than developing something

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.790
that's cross-platform and
lowest common denominator.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.400
Now here's a great example of an
app designed specifically for iPad.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.400
It's Infinity Blade by
Chair Entertainment Group.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:00.400
It has incredible gameplay,
unbelievable performance,

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.480
and stunning high-res graphics.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.320
This is an app that's only possible
because it was developed for iPad.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.120
Here's another example of an app
designed specifically for iPad.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.020
This is Inkling,
an interactive textbook app that

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.000
offers students interactivity,
social collaboration,

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.760
tutorials and quizzes,
and simple ease of use,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.900
only possible on iPad.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.080
And then there's The Elements
by Theodore Gray,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.450
an interactive periodic table of the
Elements textbook offering content not

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.100
previously available in digital form.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.910
for iPad.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.410
So the challenge is this:
be sure to optimize your app in

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.620
all of the ways we just mentioned.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.780
Avoid just building something
and hoping it's good enough.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.640
Now, onto connected.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:11.110
Great iPhone and iPad apps are connected,
and there are three aspects to this.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.260
The first is to ensure that your
app works well with other apps.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.450
If your app displays a telephone number,
people should be able to tap

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.300
that number and initiate a
phone call if they're on iPhone.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.500
If your app displays a web address,
people should be able to view that

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.790
content within your app using a UI web
view or be automatically sent to

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.640
Safari to browse the content there.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.340
And the same concept applies to street
addresses and other location information.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.330
Either display this information
within your app using Map Kit or allow

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.000
people to switch out to the Maps app.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.600
The second aspect of
connectedness is to ensure that,

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.870
where appropriate,
your app is connected with

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.790
the personal information
available on the user's device.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.940
Contacts,
photos and more can be used by your app,

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.900
making it far more
integrated and personal.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.260
And the third aspect of being connected,
and the focal point for this

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.540
section of the presentation,
is that your app can reach out beyond

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.890
itself to add more value for people.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.300
For example,
there are millions of iPhones out

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.580
there that your app can connect to.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.100
Here's the Starbucks app.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.700
It looks great and
it's super easy to use.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.090
Among other things,
it lets you create your

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.260
favorite Starbucks drink,
so that when your colleague, friend,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.940
or family member is
making a Starbucks run,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.700
you can connect to their iPhone
and send them your drink order.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.440
This is a simple example of
how to connect with others

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.690
for a very practical reason.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.700
And it's a clever way of getting
people to notice and remember your app.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.750
Could your app benefit from being
able to do a digital handshake

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.690
and exchange information this way?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.700
Here's iPad to iPad.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.500
I mentioned this app before,
it's Scrabble from Electronic Arts.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.790
But it's a great example
not only of innovation,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.270
but of connectedness between
iPads via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.700
really enhance the gameplay.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.300
Connecting your app on iPhone with
a companion app on Mac OS X can

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.700
also add lots of value for people.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.700
Here's Billings Touch by Market Circle.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.440
This is a very capable time tracking
app for anyone who wants to manage

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.700
billing against projects or clients.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.700
On its own, it's really great.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.460
But combined with a companion app on
the Mac called Billings Mac OS X means

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.260
people can have data automatically
synced so that they can take advantage

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.890
of the power of the desktop to,
for example, design and print an invoice.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.310
And a similar example,
this time between iPhone,

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.990
iPad and the Mac,
is Things by Cultured Code,

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.890
a very flexible,
really well designed GTD getting

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.410
things done to do manager app which
automatically synchronizes tasks and

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.370
projects between these devices directly,
providing users with excellent

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.760
functionality and mobility.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.900
This is definitely an
example worth following.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.890
And this is SkyGrid,
a great app with consistently high app

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.290
store ratings that keeps people up to
date on the things that they care about.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.350
This app on iPhone and iPad is a great
example of how reaching out beyond the

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.270
device can add lots of value for users.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.800
And the last example is
Flight Board by Ben Cazaz,

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.750
an app that provides flight departure
and arrival information using a really

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.500
accurate reproduction of a flight board.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.980
It's a simple,
extremely well done example of

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.610
an app that reaches out beyond
the device to connect with more

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:30.690
information of value to users.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.200
That's connected.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.800
Now, number five.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.280
Great iPhone and iPad
apps are accessible.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.860
Building accessibility in your app means
that everyone will be able to use it,

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.180
which is important whether your app
is for in-house use by employees

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.320
or for anyone in the app store.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.650
Now here are some interesting
stats for the US that are likely

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.580
similar to the rest of the world.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.990
First of all,
10 million people are visually impaired.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.800
31 million people are hearing impaired.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.820
And some 12 million have
a learning disability.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.020
For example, they might have dyslexia and
so will misinterpret what they

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.450
see on the screen in your app.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:22.860
So, all told, that's one in five users.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.340
Or one in five employees.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.130
Or one in five of your customers.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.060
Basically, 50 million people who won't be
able to use your app at all or

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.440
who will have difficulty using
it unless you make it accessible.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.140
The good news is that accessibility
is built into iOS and integrated

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.180
into numerous frameworks,
including UIKit, for example.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.080
Your job is to simply follow the
documentation and add accessibility

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.530
wherever you can to your app.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.000
And in return,
the Accessibility Framework will enable

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:02.680
powerful new capabilities in your app,
including voiceover and much more.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:07.680
Great iPhone and iPad apps are
accessible so that everyone can use them.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.740
Great iPhone and iPad apps are localized.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.480
It's more important than ever for your
app to be usable by people everywhere,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.170
since the App Store is now
in more than 90 countries.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.540
We live in a global village with many,
many languages being

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.180
spoken in each country.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.140
Reaching all of these people in
their language of choice is a great

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.040
way to make sure that your app
has as broad a reach as possible.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.400
So localize your UI for as
many languages as possible.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.910
Here's things for
iPhone by Cultured Code,

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:44.270
available in English, German, and French.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.330
and even more languages.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.620
Localization can be restricted
to the basic UI of your app,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.840
but can extend to all
of your content too,

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.490
if that makes sense.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.000
Every little bit helps,
and iOS makes it easy to include all of

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.570
the translations within the same binary,
so that there's still only one

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.500
app that users need to download.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.340
And finally,
great iPhone and iPad apps are designed.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.300
This means focusing on delivering
the optimal interaction design,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.800
meaning how the app works and what
happens when things are tapped.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:22.320
And focusing on a strong visual design,
meaning how the app looks

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.460
and presents information.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.690
Let's begin with a great
quote by Adam Angst.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.420
He says,
"The iPad becomes the app you're using.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.300
Switch to another app and
the iPad becomes that app.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.290
If that's not magic,
I don't know what is." I love this

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:44.310
quote because it's been my own
experience and it provides a great

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.050
backdrop for a discussion on design.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.250
Here are a few examples
that illustrate this point.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.760
Here's maps on iPad.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.150
iPad becomes a digital map.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.980
Here's Notes on iPad.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.800
iPad becomes a classic paper notepad.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.440
Here's Calendar app.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.110
iPad becomes a day timer.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.380
Here's Contacts.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.580
iPad becomes an address book.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.060
Notice there's no menu bar,
no windowing system, no file system,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.700
or any of the encumbrances of a
traditional computing experience.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.770
The only thing that matters
is the app that's running.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.900
This is NPR, National Public Radio,
for iPad.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.700
It combines their radio broadcasts
with their excellent online content.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:39.700
iPad becomes the best
NPR experience ever.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.620
And here's a point of sale system
called Square for iPhone and

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:48.290
iPad that's really attractive,
easy to use, and allows anyone to take

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.500
credit card payments.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.500
Totally transformative
for small business.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.690
iPad becomes a point of sale system.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.910
Here's Marvel Comics,
a fantastic digital comic

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.410
reading experience on iPad.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.640
iPad becomes a comic book.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.200
And here's AmpliTube Fender
by Agile Partners.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:15.100
iPad becomes a Fender guitar
amp and effects modeler.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.580
How beautiful is that?

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.570
And so, as you can see,
each app takes over the iPad screen

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.930
and the device becomes your app.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.140
It becomes whatever you want it to be.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.990
This is why design matters so much.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.270
It's vital that your app works
exactly as users would expect it to,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.960
and that it has the attention
to detail and polish needed

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.290
to surprise and delight.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.260
These are the seven ingredients
of great iPhone and iPad apps.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.640
So there you go.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.420
There are definitely many more
app examples I could have talked

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.940
about since there are lots of
really great apps on the App Store.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.700
And there are probably other valuable
ingredients we could discuss too.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.000
But the ones I've covered here
are the ones you should begin

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.300
incorporating into your app today.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.730
I look forward to seeing the next
great version of your app and hearing

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:12.060
about any questions you have and about
your experience developing for iOS.
