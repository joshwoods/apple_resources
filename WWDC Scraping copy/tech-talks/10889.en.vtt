WEBVTT

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.402
Michael Caldarone: Hi, everyone.
I'm Michael Caldarone

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:06.073
from App Store Games
Business Management.

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:07.608
Today's developer session
is called

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.710
"Get started with
in-app events."

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.545
We're looking forward
to sharing more about

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:15.382
this exciting new feature
with all of you today.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.684
We'll begin with
a brief introduction

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.053
to the concept of events
and how they will look

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:23.190
when showcased
on the App Store.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.993
Then we will walk through
how to set up in-app events

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.228
in App Store Connect.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.796
Using the information
we walk through

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.499
in the first two sections,
we'll put it all together

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.434
in some examples.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.937
In-app events is a new
feature that transforms

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:39.373
discovery and rediscovery
on the App Store,

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.541
giving you new ways
to showcase your events

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.112
and expand their reach.

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:48.248
But what are we talking about
when we talk about events?

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.951
They are timely activities
within your apps and games,

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.552
such as a game
competition,

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.989
a fitness challenge,
a movie premiere, and more.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.458
In fact, many of you may
already be running events

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.327
inside your apps and games.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.728
For those of you who aren't,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.164
now is a great time
to consider doing so.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.433
That's because now
events are discoverable

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.303
right on the App Store.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:12.239
So how can events benefit
your business?

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.408
Events can help you
attract new users

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:17.411
and drive new downloads,
keep active users engaged

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.746
by providing new content
and functionality

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.481
within your app or game,

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.983
and reactivate
lapsed users

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:24.885
by giving them reasons
to come back,

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:27.387
even after a long absence.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.522
Later in this session,

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:31.692
we'll dig deeper
into these concepts.

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:35.028
On iOS 15 and iPadOS 15
or later,

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:38.065
events appear across the
App Store as event cards.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.300
Event cards include
images or video

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.538
as well as the event name
and short description.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.840
Event cards appear
on your product page,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.841
where events are listed

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.911
in order of their start date
and priority.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.313
People who have previously
downloaded your app or game,

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.482
including those
who have deleted it,

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.785
will see them above your
screenshots, as seen here,

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.154
while users who have not
downloaded your app

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:05.459
will see your event cards
below your screenshots.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.893
Users can tap
the event card

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.996
to open an event
details page,

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:10.897
as seen on the right here.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.266
If they do not already have
the app or game,

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.035
they can download it
from the event card

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.671
by tapping
the Get button.

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.040
If someone already has
your app installed,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.042
they can tap Open
to launch your app

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.777
straight to your event.

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:24.978
The event details page,

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.248
with its longer description
and larger media asset,

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:32.619
gives users additional
context around your event.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.688
To help you build
anticipation for your event,

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:36.523
you can publish them
on the App Store

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:40.160
up to 14 days
before the event starts.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.562
Customers can also opt in
to be notified

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.197
when your event starts.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.166
These notifications
come from the App Store

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.935
and will launch customers
directly into the event

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:51.238
inside your app or game.

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.207
If the user doesn't have
your app or game installed,

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:58.678
they'll be directed
to the event details page.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.614
To help you market
your events off-store

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.082
and provide
a seamless experience

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:03.550
for App Store customers,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.988
we generate an App Store URL
for each event.

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:11.525
This URL directs the user
to your event details page,

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.860
and will fall back to your
App Store product page

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.362
after your event has ended

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:19.032
and for customers
on older OS versions.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.367
The event card
is discoverable

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.035
across the App Store.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.703
In addition to
your product page,

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.973
they are also discoverable
in Search.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.275
On the Games and Apps tabs,

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.777
users will see personalized
event recommendations

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.512
that can help them
stay informed

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.614
about the apps and games
they already have,

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:35.715
find something new,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.818
or rediscover
an old favorite.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:40.153
And lastly, our editorial team
will be curating

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.255
the most exciting
and innovative events

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:45.192
on the Today, Games,
and Apps tabs.

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:47.360
When users search for
your app, game, or event,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.496
it can appear
in search results.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:52.032
This helps users, including
those who have lapsed,

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.433
more easily discover
the events

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.103
happening
in your app or game.

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:58.004
As you see here
on the left,

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.006
if a user that has not
downloaded your app

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.742
or game searches for it,
they will see screenshots

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.479
alongside your app icon.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.748
Moving to the center,
if a user who currently has

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.717
or has previously downloaded
your app or game

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.985
searches for it,

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:13.620
they will see
your in-app event card

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.623
alongside your app icon
and name.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:19.793
Users can also search
directly for an event.

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:21.795
On the right, you'll see
a user searched for

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.430
"june leaderboard climb",

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.098
and the Mountain Climber
app and the event card

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.535
displayed in results,
regardless of user state.

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.337
So now that we've shown you
what events look like

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.705
on the App Store,

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:35.575
let's talk about how
you can set up your own.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:37.477
We've created a robust
set of tools to help you

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.479
set up your in-app events
and showcase them

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.681
to the right audience.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.482
We've also updated

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.251
the App Review
submission experience

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:46.987
to give you more flexibility
around submitting new events

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:49.356
without a new app version.

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:51.825
We're gradually rolling out
this new experience,

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:53.793
so in order to create
in-app events,

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.463
you'll need to make sure
someone in your organization

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.165
with an Account Holder role

00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:00.267
has enabled the new
submission experience

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.068
in App Store Connect.

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.203
Later this year,

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:07.207
all users will be updated
to the new experience.

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:08.775
Keep in mind that
while marketing roles

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:11.545
can create events,
only App Manager, Admin,

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:15.715
or Account Holders
can submit events.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:18.018
Once the new submission
flow has been enabled,

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:20.120
you'll see the new
In-App Events section,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.856
where you can create
and manage your events.

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.393
In the In-App Events section,

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.628
you will provide your event
metadata and media

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:31.264
for your event card
and event details page.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:33.166
You can preview
what your provided media

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.901
will look like
in an event card

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.336
and event details page

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.738
to confirm that crucial
aspects of your image

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:42.242
or video will not
be obscured.

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:46.913
Your metadata must adhere
to App Review guideline 2.3.13,

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:49.149
which broadly covers
in-app events;

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:52.385
and 2.3.8, which requires
that all metadata,

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.120
including visuals,
is appropriate

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.522
for all audiences

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:59.659
and adheres
to a 4+ age rating.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.028
If your event is available
in multiple regions,

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.763
be sure to use language
that's appropriate

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:05.498
for customers
in all regions

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.133
in which your event
is available

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:10.770
and accounts for differing
cultural values.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.539
Ensure that any
intellectual property

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.276
or trademarked content is
authorized by relevant parties.

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:18.011
Avoid claims
that can't be verified,

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:21.147
such as "the best"
or "number one."

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:23.817
Don't include specific prices
in your metadata,

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:26.786
as pricing and currencies
can vary across regions

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:29.923
and can be changed
independent of your event.

00:06:29.923 --> 00:06:31.524
Avoid including
the type of event

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:34.027
in the title or descriptions.

00:06:34.027 --> 00:06:36.296
You can find detailed
metadata specifications,

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:40.734
requirements, and guidance
on our Developer site.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.369
The metadata
you provide is used

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.971
when displaying your in-app
event across the App Store,

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:48.608
so it's important it accurately
portrays your event.

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:50.810
Let's look at
these two examples.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.379
In the Do example,

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.214
the event name
is in title case

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.449
and is a distinctive,
unique name.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.251
As you can see,
the Don't example

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.588
is a general call to action
to watch the livestream,

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.823
which isn't very helpful
for users to learn about

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:06.092
what your event is about.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.962
It also uses all caps and
multiple punctuation marks,

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:10.897
which is not ideal.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.599
Next, let's look at
the DO example's

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.101
short description
below the event title.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.803
It provides
an accurate summary

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.438
of what the event
experience is like

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.774
and uses title case.

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.909
As with the event title,
the Don't example

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.911
is a call to action
to subscribe

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:27.814
and includes
specific pricing.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.617
This is not needed since
you'll select an event cost

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.752
in App Store Connect,
which displays

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:35.789
whether an in-app purchase
or subscription is required

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.957
in order to participate
in the event

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.460
on your event details page.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.262
When looking
at the visual assets,

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:44.364
you'll notice they look
very different.

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.600
We recommend that you avoid
including text or logos

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.402
in your assets
when possible,

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:54.941
especially if they include
your event or app name.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:58.745
Scrolling down, you'll also be
able to select the event badge,

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:02.582
which tells the user what type
of in-app event you are running.

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:05.418
But which event badge
should you choose?

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:08.088
There are many activity types
that make great candidates

00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:09.222
for in-app events,

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:13.026
such as a challenge,
live event, or premiere.

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:15.562
To help users understand
your type of event,

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.564
you'll select one
of these seven badges,

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:20.600
depending on
what best fits your event.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.769
This badge will display
on your event card

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:25.171
and event details page.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.906
To help you best
select a badge,

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:30.043
let's go through each one.

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:32.312
A challenge is an activity
that encourages a user

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:36.049
to achieve a goal within
a certain amount of time.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.050
For example,

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.586
beating a certain number
of levels in a game,

00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:42.589
or meditating a certain number
of minutes over the weekend

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:44.524
for a health app.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.961
A challenge is a compelling way
to maximize the user's enjoyment

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:51.197
of existing features
in the app or game.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.799
A competition is an activity

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.101
in which users compete
against one another

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:57.737
to achieve a ranking
or win awards.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:00.407
This could be a movement
competition in a fitness app

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:03.176
or a player versus player battle
in a game.

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:05.712
Similar to challenges,
competitions are a great way

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:09.783
to put a new spin on existing
content or features.

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:11.551
The results of challenges
and competitions

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.754
are often represented
in leaderboards.

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.323
Live events are activities
that occur in real time

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:20.393
that all users experience
simultaneously;

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:24.464
for example, a sporting event
or live-streamed concert.

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:29.269
Live events must introduce
new features, content, or goods.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:32.005
A major update introduces
significant new features,

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.706
content, or experiences;

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:37.210
for example, the launch of
new game modes or levels.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.212
These events go beyond
minor enhancements

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:42.315
like UI adjustments
or bug fixes.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.884
New season is used
to introduce new content,

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:47.153
storylines, or media libraries;

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:50.256
for example, a new season
of a television show

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.226
or a new season pass
in a game.

00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:55.328
A premiere indicates
the first-time availability

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.230
of content or media;

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.900
for example, newly released
movies or audio.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.470
Special event is used
for limited-time events

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.072
that are not captured
by another event badge,

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:09.576
possibly spanning multiple
activities or experiences;

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:13.213
for example, an event
featuring a collaboration.

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:15.982
These events should provide
customers with new content,

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.784
features, or goods.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.786
As a reminder,
only select this badge

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:20.820
if none of the others

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.590
appropriately
describe your event.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.492
Please keep these
considerations in mind

00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:27.227
when selecting
the best-fitting badge

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:29.195
for your event.

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.431
If none of these badges
seem appropriate,

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:33.500
the content should not
be considered an event

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.635
and should not be submitted.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.204
Next, you'll also be able
to set up the country

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.707
or region availability
and scheduling,

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:42.542
including the event
start time,

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:46.212
event end time,
and publish start time.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.948
If an event is published
before its start time,

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:53.086
the event card will display
the date and time it will begin.

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:55.722
Publishing the event before
the start time can be useful

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:58.892
to build anticipation
for the event.

00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:00.927
An event can last
up to 31 days

00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:05.431
and be promoted up to 14 days
before its start date.

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.101
If you'd like, you can make
your event available

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:09.669
only in specific regions

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:14.073
and customize the dates
and times for each location.

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:16.376
Next, you'll select
an event purpose,

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:18.344
which is one of the factors
the App Store uses

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:21.714
to offer personalized
recommendations.

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:24.284
Most events are appropriate
for all users,

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.085
but if your event is
specifically intended

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:29.222
to attract new users,
keep active users informed,

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:30.924
or bring back lapsed users,

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:34.427
you can select a specific
purpose accordingly.

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:35.728
To help your event
reach the people

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.130
for which it's intended,

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.533
the App Store incorporates
app usage information.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.036
That data is processed
on device

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:47.006
to minimize data collection
and enhance user privacy.

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:49.142
Regardless of the event
purpose you choose,

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:52.145
your published events will be
discoverable on the App Store

00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:54.414
by all users.

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.683
But which purpose
should you select?

00:11:56.683 --> 00:12:00.119
We'll take a look at
each one in more detail.

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:02.455
New users are people
who have never downloaded

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:03.957
your app or game.

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:06.726
The best application of
in-app events for a new user

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.228
is to teach them about
some key feature or content

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.698
your app or game offers.

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:13.366
The principles are similar
to your strategy

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.234
for early retention.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.303
The initial experience
the new user has

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:19.906
is likely to determine
whether or not they come back

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.709
for day two and beyond.

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:25.345
While your active users
are already engaged,

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.046
you'll want to make sure
they stay informed

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.015
about the latest happenings
just in case

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:30.583
they missed
other communications

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.418
within the app or game.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.988
As previously mentioned,
the event content you produce

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:37.757
can effectively become
its own content type,

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:42.295
and you want to make sure
active users are aware of it.

00:12:42.295 --> 00:12:45.031
Another exciting aspect
of the in-app events feature

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:46.699
is the opportunity
to communicate

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:48.568
with lapsed users.

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:50.536
Lapsed users may have been
your app or game's

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:53.606
most engaged, valuable users
at one point in time,

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.908
but at some point,
they moved on.

00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:57.944
By publishing your events
on the App Store,

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:00.246
you can let lapsed users
know about new features

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.749
and content that have been
introduced since they left,

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:04.317
and that they are
no longer discovering

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:07.954
within your app or game.

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.455
The Open button
on in-app events

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.591
will take the user directly
to the right place

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:13.159
in your app or game.

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.761
To accomplish this,
you'll need to provide

00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:17.864
a deep link
for every in-app event.

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:20.633
A deep link is a universal link
or custom URL

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:23.569
that opens an app
to a particular place.

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.705
While you can use
either of these,

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:28.608
we do recommend using
the universal link.

00:13:28.608 --> 00:13:30.443
There is detailed
documentation about

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:33.780
how to set up universal links
on the Developer site.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.282
This URL will be passed
directly to your app

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:39.819
when the user taps Open,
so avoid using URL shorteners

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.754
and other services
that add redirects

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:44.123
that your app
can't handle directly.

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.359
Be thoughtful about
the most relevant destination

00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:47.894
to direct users.

00:13:47.894 --> 00:13:49.128
If your event is live,

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:52.165
you can link directly
to the event.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.666
If your event hasn't started,

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.668
you might direct users
to a landing page

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:59.205
that builds anticipation and
reminds them when to return.

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.007
If a user is new
to your app,

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:04.043
consider taking them through
any necessary onboarding

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.012
before directing them
to the event.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.147
Always provide a way
for users to return

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:10.750
to your main app experience.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.787
Lastly, we recommend testing
your deep links on iOS 15.

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:17.056
One simple way to do this
is to paste the link

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:18.291
into the Notes app,

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:20.460
and then tapping
to launch it.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.263
This will replicate how it will
behave on the App Store.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.235
Next you'll indicate priority.

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:31.137
Priority affects
how an event is sorted

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:32.739
on your product page.

00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:36.642
High-priority events will appear
ahead of normal priority events.

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:38.444
This in turn affects
which event appears

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:41.147
in search results
for your app or game.

00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:43.149
Priority will not affect
search ranking

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:45.785
relative to other apps.

00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:48.054
You'll also indicate
whether an in-app purchase

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.422
or subscription is required

00:14:49.422 --> 00:14:53.025
in order for a user to
participate in the event.

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:57.864
This will appear as a label
on the event details page.

00:14:57.864 --> 00:15:00.266
Once you've configured
your event metadata,

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.568
you'll submit it for review.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.437
You can have
up to 10 approved events

00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:07.106
in App Store Connect
per app at a given time,

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:10.243
and a maximum of five events
published on the App Store

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:13.112
across all storefronts
at a time.

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.781
This means if you are
planning to publish

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:16.783
any region-specific events,

00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:18.484
they will reduce
the number of events

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:21.187
you can show in other regions.

00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:23.022
For example,
if you publish one event

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:25.224
that is only available
in Japan,

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:27.093
the maximum number
of events you can show

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.529
across other regions is four.

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:31.197
Please be aware
that once an event

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:32.999
has been submitted for review,

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:36.435
you cannot also submit another
event or binary for review

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:40.373
until after the first event
is approved.

00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:43.376
Now that we've discussed
how to set up in-app events,

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:44.744
how does this feature
fit together

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:48.014
with your larger
content management practices?

00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:50.550
Here we'll look at some standard
event program concepts

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.285
and a few examples
that illustrate

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:56.422
how it all can fit together.

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:58.157
These are six main steps
to consider

00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.593
when managing
an in-app events program.

00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:03.095
You can keep them in mind
when creating each event,

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:06.432
as well as when planning
your overall strategy.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:08.267
First, set the goal.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.570
Determine your desired
impact and KPIs,

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.105
such as driving additional
feature engagement.

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:15.374
Next, determine your concept.

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:16.576
Set your event strategy --

00:16:16.576 --> 00:16:18.611
such as target audience
and timing --

00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:22.348
as well as identify feasibility,
blockers, and solutions.

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:24.183
Your concept for
in-app event submissions

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:27.019
should be the highest quality,
most captivating events

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.389
and not just minor updates
or content drops.

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:31.557
Then make a plan.

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:32.959
Decide when the event will occur

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.661
and who in your organization
will take care of each step

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:38.397
necessary to make
your event happen.

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:39.899
Next comes the fun part:

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:42.335
executing and activating
your event.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.836
Once it's live,
you can move on

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:47.240
to monitoring the event
and corresponding KPIs.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.309
Look at user engagement
over the duration of the event.

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.078
For example,
for an in-game event,

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:54.680
you'll want to keep a close
eye on economic indicators

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.716
and game balance
to identify any problems

00:16:56.716 --> 00:16:59.085
before they get out of hand.

00:16:59.085 --> 00:17:01.587
In an entertainment app,
extremely low engagement

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:04.557
could be the sign
of a technical issue.

00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:07.426
Lastly, analyze your event
once it's ended.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.829
Perform a deep dive to
understand the event KPIs

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.664
and business impact.

00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:13.332
Consider looking at things
like the behavior

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:17.403
of a particular user segment
before and after the event.

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:20.506
You can use this analysis
to determine next steps,

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:23.743
such as whether to run a similar
event again in the future,

00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:26.012
make it an automated
recurring event,

00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:30.116
or try a different
concept entirely.

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:32.652
So what does this process
look like in practice?

00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:36.722
At the top, you can see
the six steps we just described.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:37.957
Below that, you can see

00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:39.859
where the in-app events
feature milestones

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:41.761
map to the process.

00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:43.596
Whether or not you have
previously employed

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:46.032
an events strategy
like the one at the top,

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:48.801
the in-app events feature
can be leveraged to enhance

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.836
and supplement
your current approach

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:54.507
or be your primary
event distribution method.

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:56.742
Next, we'll walk through
three sample KPIs

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.744
and related events.

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:03.249
In this example,
we are shown an event card

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.951
describing a premiere
of a program

00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:06.652
called Climb Champions.

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:08.321
Our goal is
to maximize downloads

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:10.056
and day-one retention,

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:12.024
so an appropriate
event purpose would be

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:15.294
to attract new users
to our Mountain Climber app.

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:17.029
We want to share
our Climb Champions show

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:20.800
with new users in hopes of
encouraging them to try our app.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.369
In our short description,
we elevate unique aspects

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:26.272
of the show in order
to get people excited,

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:29.809
such as how it features stories
from the world's best climbers.

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.978
New users can feel like
they're joining a community

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:34.480
and taking part
in something unique.

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:38.217
This next example
shows a challenge

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:40.319
called
the June Leaderboard Climb.

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:42.355
Here we want to drive
daily active devices

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:44.557
as well as
longer-term retention.

00:18:44.557 --> 00:18:46.525
The most relevant
event purpose in this case

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:48.861
would be to keep
active users informed,

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:49.795
since you are most likely

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.898
speaking to more established
users.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.133
For active users,

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:56.635
an event that leverages a
familiar feature within the app

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:59.005
would be a good approach.

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:00.339
In our Mountain Climber app,

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:02.541
tracking distance
is a core feature.

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.443
The challenge rewards
increased engagement

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:07.346
with this core feature.

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:11.784
Lastly, we have a major update
titled Guided Climbs.

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:14.353
if we want to drive
redownloads and reengagement

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:16.856
of those users who have
stopped engaging with the app,

00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:19.325
then we want to bring back
lapsed users.

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.861
While there are many reasons
why a user stops engaging

00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:23.062
with an app or game,

00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:26.165
these users enjoyed it
at one point in time.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.000
A compelling major update
could be the reason

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.969
they decide to come back.

00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:33.773
With in-app events, now you're
able to tell them about it.

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:36.675
Here we are introducing
a significant new feature --

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.578
the Guided Climb --
which focuses on local terrain

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:41.313
and provides a more
engaging experience

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:43.249
through community narratives.

00:19:43.249 --> 00:19:45.017
This new feature might be
addressing the reasons

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.186
many users lapsed
in the first place,

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.021
bringing them back in.

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.056
As we discussed,

00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:52.691
the last step of a successful
in-app events program

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.960
is analyzing
event performance.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.128
So later this year,

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:58.664
we'll be adding a new dashboard
in App Analytics

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:02.601
to help you evaluate
the performance of your events.

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:04.503
You'll be able to see
a list of your events

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.505
and the key metrics
listed for each,

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.441
so you can see how
the App Store is helping

00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:10.376
generate visibility
for your events

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.244
and their performance.

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:13.746
You'll also be able
to filter events

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:15.614
by territory and source type

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:20.553
to be able to see where
your users are coming from.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:21.854
That's all for today.

00:20:21.854 --> 00:20:23.856
Thanks for joining.
