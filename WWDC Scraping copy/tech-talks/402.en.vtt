00:00:01.168 --> 00:00:03.337
Here are some features
in Web Inspector

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:06.340
that will help you
to debug tvOS apps.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.141
Let's get started.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.545
To demonstrate these features,
we'll open up an example app

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:14.815
for video playback
from our Sample Code Library.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:18.719
Currently this app is running
in the Xcode Simulator.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.989
To access Web Inspector
for an Apple TV device

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.157
or for an Apple TV Simulator,

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.661
click on the option
in the Develop menu.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.732
Once inside, you can use
seven of Web Inspector's tabs.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:34.902
Elements, Network, Resources,

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:39.773
Timelines, Console, Storage,
and Debugger.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:43.443
The Elements tab shows you
the TVML DOM structure.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.812
Here you can edit and copy TVML,

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:49.116
move and delete Nodes,
and add Attributes.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.818
To see more Node properties
and Event Listeners,

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:55.022
see the Node section
in the right sidebar.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:59.226
Option-click to copy the path
of a selected Node.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.695
You can also view
computed styles

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.497
and modify style rules

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:06.300
in the Styles section
of the sidebar.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.068
Rules that have media queries

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.171
are shown with
media query information.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.240
Default TVMLKit styles

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.842
are shown as
the User Agent Stylesheet

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.244
and are locked.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.480
These styles cannot be modified.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.581
In the Network tab,

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:25.018
you can see all the resources
loaded by the current app.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.321
In addition to
the default tab features,

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.857
there is a button
to clear network items.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.927
You can also inspect
timing information,

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.463
examine Request & Response
headers,

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.232
and see the response result.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.535
Next is the Resources tab.

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:43.403
If you include
structured comments

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.472
in your app's JavaScript files,

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.708
those files
will show up in Resources

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.978
for further examination.

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.079
The Timelines tab

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.581
helps you check
the performance of your app.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.652
Here we have a prerecorded
example in the Timelines tab.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.154
Select your instruments
and record events

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:05.492
like a reload operation
with the record timeline button.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.693
For more details,

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.196
click on one of the instruments
you recorded,

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:13.100
JavaScript & Events
or JavaScript Allocations.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.137
To clear your timeline,
click the clear timeline button.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.906
Next is the Console.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.342
Besides showing messages
logged by the app,

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:26.179
this tab has features to filter
the console log,

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:30.851
clear the console log,
and trigger garbage collection.

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:33.286
The Storage tab
shows a persistent state

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:36.156
that is available to web content
being inspected,

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.225
which can be refreshed.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:40.260
By default it shows Cookies,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.929
Local Storage,
and Session Storage.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.164
But as available,

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.634
this tab also shows
additional storage APIs,

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:52.506
like WebSQL, IndexedDB,
and Application Cache.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:55.675
You can add and modify
any of the key value pairs

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.478
displayed in this tab.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:02.249
Last is the Debugger,
which, like the Network tab,

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:07.187
also shows a list of resources,
and has default tab features.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.390
It also has a Breakpoint section
in the left sidebar,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.493
and a Scope Chain
in the right sidebar.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:17.531
The Debugger controls to pause,
play, and step through your code

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.834
are in the top left corner
of the tab.

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:24.838
In summary, you can access
Web Inspector for tvOS apps

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.541
through the Develop menu
in Safari.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:31.778
Use Web Inspector
to examine your content in tvOS.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.181
To try the latest version
of Web Inspector,

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.450
download the Safari
Technology Preview

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.819
from the Apple Developer site.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.757
If you find bugs, report them
at bugreport.apple.com.

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:44.758
For more information

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:48.895
and additional resources
about Web Inspector and tvOS,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.997
use the links
in the Resources section

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.900
associated with this video.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.268
And that's
your quick walkthrough

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.705
of debugging tvOS apps
with Web Inspector.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.907
Thanks for watching.
