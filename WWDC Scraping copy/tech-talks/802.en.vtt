00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:03.403
Apple Watch Series 4

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.439
includes significant
enhancements

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.875
for designers and developers.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.545
Series 4 watches have new
displays with larger dimensions,

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:14.982
along with new APIs
and improvements in performance,

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:18.218
enhancing your ability
to deliver rich information

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:21.788
and actions to the people
who use your app.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.424
You'll want to take these
new dimensions into account

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.027
as your create
or update your app.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.163
Series 4 watches are larger
than watches in previous series.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:33.800
They come in two sizes, measured
on the exterior of the case:

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.005
40mm and 44mm.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.609
Previous series of Apple Watch
are 38mm and 42mm.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.145
And the display dimensions
of these watches

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:50.984
measure 272 by 340 pixels
on 38mm watches,

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:56.056
and 312 by 390 pixels
on 42mm watches.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:59.526
The displays of Series 4 watches
have grown significantly,

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:04.730
measuring 324 by 394 pixels
for 40mm,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.203
and 368 by 448 pixels for 44mm.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.039
Not only is display larger,

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.107
but the border around it
is thinner,

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.877
bringing more attention
to interactive elements,

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:21.248
and making the information
feel richer and more immersive.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.217
You'll want to account
for all display dimensions.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.753
Your app should deliver
the same information

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.390
and actions to the user,
regardless of screen size.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.892
As you consider your layouts,

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:35.696
notice that the display
of the 40mm Series 4 watch

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.898
is actually very similar
in dimension

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:43.103
to the display of the 42mm
watches of previous series.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.872
The new 40mm watch
has a display size

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:50.444
that is 12 pixels wider
and 4 pixels taller.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.145
Looking across the case sizes,

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:56.249
40 and 42mm watches
sit in the middle of a spectrum.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.286
If you target your screens
layouts here,

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:02.022
you should then ensure
your layouts scale down

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:07.761
to 38mm dimensions,
and up for 44mm dimensions.

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.830
The Design Resources
on developer.apple.com

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.567
contain assets and templates
to get you started

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.902
in designing for all 4 sizes.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.605
Be aware that some watchOS
interface elements

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.707
scale with the watch size.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.510
The templates contain
extensive collections

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.246
of these elements,
organized by watch size,

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:32.019
to ensure that your mock-ups are
as pixel-precise as possible.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.354
So now let's talk about
how these new displays

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:37.190
impact the layout
of your screens.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.428
The most notable difference
of the new display is its shape.

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:42.796
Like iPhone X,

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:45.165
Apple Watch Series 4
has rounded corners,

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.566
creating a symmetrical look

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.536
within the curved corners
of the case.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:51.038
WatchKit will assist you

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:53.473
in the presentation
of text and controls,

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.643
so that your UI appears
in an optimal location

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.078
in the viewport.

00:02:58.078 --> 00:03:00.781
WatchKit elements will adapt
to the new displays.

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:03.917
At the top,
your app's status bar

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.253
will account for
the rounded corners.

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:08.622
As in previous versions
of watchOS,

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.358
the clock will appear
on every screen,

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.727
and your app can use
the title area

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:16.096
to provide a helpful heading
or title

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.398
describing the purpose
of the screen.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:21.134
Both of these elements
will be indented,

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:24.571
and this indentation should
create left and right margins

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.107
that extend vertically through
the display of content

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:28.108
in your app.

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:31.111
These are
System Minimum Layout Margins.

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:33.480
Graphic elements
and button backgrounds

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.515
should extend
beyond these margins

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:39.152
and run nearly edge to edge,
up to the one pixel margin

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.888
that runs by default
on either side.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.257
Text should align
to the left margin,

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:48.328
extending from the left edge
of the text in the status bar.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.664
To account for the corners
in scroll views,

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:53.467
there are clear areas
at the top and bottom

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.135
of the content area.

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:57.537
These are known as
scroll clear areas,

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.473
and they ensure that text
and buttons

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.875
are nudged fully into view

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.678
when the user completes
a scrolling action.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:08.081
For example, a button at
the bottom of a scroll view

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.918
will settle in the safe area
above the clear area.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.222
If you're using a full-screen
SpriteKit or SceneKit scene,

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:18.190
you'll want to use
the margins and insets

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.228
to nudge your content
into view.

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:24.397
The best watch experiences
are simple and glanceable,

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.399
so you may have views
within your app

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.535
that are intentionally
single-screen

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.103
and should not scroll.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.405
For example,
if you want to make sure

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.875
that a button rests
in the clear area,

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.410
rather than getting nudged up
by the system,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.681
you can do so by setting
an attribute in Xcode.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.984
In the attribute inspector
for the view,

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:46.987
you can select
Fixed to screen edges,

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:49.890
and this will ensure that
the content within that view

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.925
will not scroll.

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:54.060
Now let's talk about
updating your app

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.730
for Apple Watch Series 4.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.232
Your app will run
on Series 4 watches

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:02.869
even before you recompile it
for watchOS 5.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:08.108
It will be displayed at 38mm
dimensions on 40mm watches,

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:13.213
and at 42mm dimensions
on 44mm watches.

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:16.516
It will be centered
in Series 4 displays.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.018
And from a user point of view,

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:21.354
your app will appear
and behave predictably.

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.690
Recompiling your app
for watchOS 5

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.427
will allow your app to occupy
the full width and height

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:29.429
of the new display.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.998
As long as you've implemented
your WatchKit elements

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:35.902
relative to their containers
rather than at fixed widths,

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:39.005
your app will expand to fill
the additional screen space

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.042
on Series 4 watches,
and this will feel much more

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:44.878
immersive and engaging
to your users.

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:47.347
If your app contains
a full-screen SpriteKit

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.916
or SceneKit scene,
you'll want to make sure

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.018
that text and controls
in your scene

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.955
are rendered correctly
on Series 4 watches.

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.824
You should access the
System Minimum Layout Margins

00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:00.760
to ensure that your content
is inset properly

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.029
from the left and right edges
of the screen,

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.799
and the Content Safe Area Inset
information

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:08.702
to ensure that text and actions
settle appropriately

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:13.940
in the content area of the watch
when the user scrolls.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.576
Series 4 introduces new haptics

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:19.446
that correspond with the
rotation of the Digital Crown,

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:23.350
creating a more tactile
experience across Apple Watch.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.152
By default,
haptic detents, or taps,

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:28.955
are produced when the
Digital Crown is rotated.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:32.859
So common user interactions,
like scrolling

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.061
or selecting an item
in a picker,

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.731
will deliver tactile
feedback to the user.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.666
You should evaluate your
app's experience

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:43.570
with this new haptic feedback
on Series 4 watches.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.707
Users will become accustomed to
a consistent tactile experience,

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.076
so if your app coordinates
events in the UI

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.878
with Digital Crown rotation,

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:54.314
you'll want to make sure
that those UI events

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:56.950
line up with these
new haptic effects.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.988
Next, let's discuss the new text
styles introduced in watchOS 5,

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:04.357
and the implementation
of Dynamic Type

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.493
on Series 4 watches.

00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:09.229
In watchOS 5,
the Dynamic Type Library

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.033
was expanded to include
four new larger sizes.

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:16.236
Large Title,
and Titles 1, 2, and 3

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:19.539
provide more ways to ensure
that content and actions

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.242
are glanceable
on the watch screen.

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:24.611
As you're implementing
and testing these styles,

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.446
remember that there
are different

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.282
default content categories
that correspond

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.384
to the watch case size.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:35.288
Small is the default
category for 38mm,

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:42.195
Large for 40mm and 42mm,
and XLarge for 44mm.

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:45.031
While watches may start
with different default settings,

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.367
each offers the same spectrum

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:51.037
to accommodate a wide range
of user settings.

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:53.907
Adhering to these styles
will ensure that your app

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:56.943
is delivered predictably
to all users.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.978
Finally, let's discuss
enhancements

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:02.515
related to the visual assets
in your watch project.

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.918
You can now streamline
the production of graphics

00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:08.455
by using PDFs, allowing for
high-resolution scaling

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.190
across device sizes.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.226
If you prepare your graphics
with a scale factor of 2

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.128
and save them as PDFs,

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:16.996
you can create a single file

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:20.900
for usage across all
four watch sizes.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.169
When you bring this PDF asset
into Xcode,

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.906
place it in the Asset Catalog
of your Watch project,

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:30.110
drop the asset in
the Universal 2x box.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.345
And then, in the
attribute inspector,

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.715
adjust the Auto Scaling
property to Automatic.

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:40.854
This scales your graphics down
by 9 percent for 38mm displays,

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:45.492
and up 10 percent
for 44mm displays.

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:49.796
One last note: To account
for the UI of the 44mm watch,

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:53.500
there are two new
app icon sizes.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.403
These new icons will be used
for the short look notification

00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:59.038
and the Home screen icon.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.940
Guides and dimensions
for these icons

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.810
can be found in the templates
in the Design Resources,

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.647
which have been newly updated
for Apple Watch Series 4.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.315
There's also a thorough
introduction

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:12.018
to watchOS 5 features
in the video,

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:15.622
"What's New in watchOS"
from WWDC.

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:17.557
This video,
the Design Resources,

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.226
and the Human Interface
Guidelines can be found

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.229
at developer.apple.com.
