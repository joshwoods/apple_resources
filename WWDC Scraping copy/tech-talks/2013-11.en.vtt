00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.240
My name is John Geleynsse.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.340
I'm the Senior Director of
Technology Evangelism.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.960
We're the guys putting on the tech talks.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.230
We've done this for years.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.670
We've been to Berlin before,
and it's always been a really

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.610
great experience to be here,
so we're pretty excited to be back.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.370
I want to welcome you this morning.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.220
We've got a great day planned,
a lot of really technical content,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.260
so take out your laptops
and get ready to take notes.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.880
We've got a real busy schedule as well,
so we'll get into the details

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.800
of what the schedule looks
like throughout this morning,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.240
but we're really happy to be here.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.210
So we've got, as I said,
a great day planned,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.500
a lot of deep technical content
about programming for iOS 7.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:14.180
We've got a great day planned,
a lot of deep technical content

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.990
about programming for iOS 7.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.510
So before I get into sort of the
main content of this kickoff,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.440
I wanted to start with a couple of
significant milestones of things that

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.490
we've done over the last year that
address and respond to the feedback

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520
that we've heard from so many of you.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.320
So we recently announced that we've
shipped over 700 million iOS devices,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.290
which is a lot of devices for your apps,
and it's an enormous audience

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.220
for you as a developer.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.590
And that includes the 9 million
new iPhones that shipped in the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.230
record-breaking 9 million devices
that were shipped in the first

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.950
three days when these went on sale.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.030
So some pretty incredible
sales numbers there.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.340
And obviously all these
devices shipped with iOS 7,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.040
but since iOS 7 updating is so easy,
more than 200 million of these

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.390
700 million devices were updated
to iOS 7 in the first weekend

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.660
in which iOS 7 was available.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.430
So that was a huge start,
a real fast start for us.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.480
We were really excited with it,
and it's the fastest software

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.410
upgrade in the history of iOS,
and it shows that iOS 7 is the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.340
most popular iOS update so far.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.300
And it's so popular, in fact,
that as of just the other day,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.350
we've got stats that show that
we have 74% of the installed

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.310
base is running iOS 7.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.080
That's pretty much two-thirds
of all iOS devices.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.110
We're running iOS 7.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.660
And so clearly, this is a huge ramp-up to
the new operating system,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.180
and clearly customers
love having the latest,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.670
greatest software running on the latest,
greatest hardware.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.330
And so you definitely want to be
there with your apps on iOS 7.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.940
Now, if you need to run on iOS 6 as well,
then you can, you know,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.580
obviously consider supporting adding
legacy support for those customers.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.930
But today... Is all about iOS 7,
and we want to teach you how to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.170
take advantage of everything that
is on this release because that's

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.020
where so many of our customers are.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.680
Now, we've listened to your
feedback over the last year,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.800
and we've done a bunch of things for you.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.300
And I wanted to talk
about a few of these.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.500
First is we announced App Transfer.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.680
And this lets you move your
app from one team to another.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.690
For example, if you sell your app or
your company gets acquired,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.100
this is a big request from
the developer community.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.660
And this is now available for you.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.420
And recently,
over-the-air download limits were raised

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.880
from 50 megabytes to 100 megabytes.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.010
And this makes it even easier
for people to get your apps,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.720
even if they're not connected to Wi-Fi.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.600
So as you move to universal binary,
as you add support for Retina Display,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.360
as you add all kinds of new
capabilities to your apps,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.860
they've gotten bigger
and bigger over time.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.170
And so this is a pretty big deal.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:06:09.400
[ Transcript missing ]

00:06:10.000 --> 00:08:23.100
[ Transcript missing ]

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.470
So that's what we've done in the past,
but now I'd like to shift

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.280
our attention to the present.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.920
You know, 2013 was a busy year for us,
and we got a lot of stuff done,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.180
and it was a really important
year for several reasons.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:46.520
We saw primarily a fundamental
evolution in the iOS platform in 2013,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.800
and it started with the
introduction of iOS 7 at WWDC.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.190
iOS 7, as you know,
is the next generation of iOS,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.240
and it's the most significant
update to iOS since 2007.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.450
You know, we're 2013 right now,
and it's hard to believe that iOS 7 is,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.850
you know, six or seven years old,
eight years old.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.320
I mean,
it seems like time has just flown.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.400
I mean, I've been at Apple for 14 years,
and I remember the day that iOS,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.680
you know, came out,
that the iPhone was introduced.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.040
And since then, we've had, you know,
six major releases of iOS.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.410
Now we've got the seventh,
and it is the most

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.430
significant release we've had.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.480
And as I mentioned before,
we've got hundreds of millions

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.360
of customers on board with iOS 7
running on their devices already.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.100
And as you know,
iOS 7 has got this great new

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.980
user experience that focuses
on people's content and brings

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.410
a new level of physical realism
to the overall user experience.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.740
And we're going to get into this in a
lot more detail in a session following

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.110
this one for user interface design.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.810
But iOS 7 brings, you know,
motion effects that

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.580
give a sense of depth.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.400
It brings text that's far
more legible and dynamic.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.790
And there's a lot more-- there's
new gestures and new capabilities.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.000
So the overall user experience of
iOS 7 has changed pretty dramatically

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.940
from what was there before.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.120
And we're seeing a lot of apps
already that have been redesigned

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.360
to take advantage of the new
user interface of iOS 7 and to

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.380
fit into this new environment.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.340
And I want to show you
a couple of examples.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.880
Here's an exciting version
of--here's a new app called

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.100
Sky Guide from 5th Star Labs.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.300
And this is a stargazing app,
and they introduced-- you know,

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.410
they worked on the UI for iOS
7 and introduced translucency,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.600
parallax, and dynamic type.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.100
So these are some initial
things that they've done,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.200
but the effect already on the
app has been pretty profound.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.600
Zite, one of my favorite apps.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.520
It's an intelligent magazine helping
you to discover interesting things,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.080
articles that are out on the
net based on your interests.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.660
And they completely revamped the
UI and looked to clean up their design,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.120
improve the legibility of their content.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.910
They enlarged photos
and went edge to edge.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.400
They added some subtle motion effects
as you're scrolling through the content.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.980
And they added support
for iOS 7 gestures.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.000
So again, some preliminary steps
for this developer,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.270
but the result is a pretty
dramatic change to the app as

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.520
compared to the iOS 6 version.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.140
Here's another app called Just.me.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.590
It's a sharing app that
offers the best of texting,

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.330
email, and networking all in one app.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.770
And they worked hard to remove all
of the extra adornments that they

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:44.170
had on screen and to give space to
the content that really mattered,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.110
which was the content that
users are producing in the app.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.930
They focused on bigger text,
edge-to-edge photos,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.820
and minimal distractions.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.590
And the result is
something that's pretty,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.040
pretty gorgeous.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.870
Here's Evernote.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.340
It won an Apple Design Award this
past year at WWDC.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:09.200
And on the left is the iOS 6 version
that won an Apple Design Award,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.310
along with their Mac app and
their Safari extension and all

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.540
the stuff they were doing on
the various Apple platforms.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.860
And on the right side,
you've got the current

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.260
shipping iOS 7 version.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.980
And Evernote chose to
reinvent the app around iOS 7.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.860
So they stopped, they looked at iOS 7,
and they decided to just redo

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.760
the entire experience as if
it was their first version.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.320
And that meant that they could
throw out some old ideas,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.790
some old ways of thinking about things,
and restructure the content,

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.620
lay it out differently,
and really optimize it.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.340
And they did that, and they did that,
and they did that, and they did that,

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.980
and they did that, and they did that,
and they did that, and they did that,

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.840
and they did that, and they did that,
and they did that.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.230
And so as part of the redesign,
they added translucency

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.660
and depth with UIKit.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.400
They added multitasking background sync.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.710
They did AirDrop for sharing of notes.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.310
And they did TextKit support for
better text management and layout.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.610
And pretty dramatic change
from where they were before.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.500
Here's American Airlines with a
completely redesigned app for iOS 7.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.920
On the left is their
previous iOS 6 version,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.640
and on the right is
their new iOS 7 version.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.070
And the goal that they had was to
improve legibility and introduce

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.910
a much stronger design aesthetic.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:32.500
And the design that they did for iOS
7 brings in translucency and depth.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.860
It's a much cleaner design.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.220
It focuses on the content
that you really care about,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.540
and so there's greater legibility for
the things that matter most to you.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.600
And the result is pretty dramatic.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.830
And so these are five examples
of apps that have been

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:57.110
completely redesigned for iOS 7,
but there are so many more.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.200
These are a bunch of apps that have
done a ton of work to revamp for iOS 7.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.130
You've got Reader 2, Fantastical 2,
Tweetbot 3, favorites of many of you,

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.770
I'm sure, Perfect Weather, PCalc.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.060
GoBank.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.960
It was a great app on iOS 6,
and they just tuned it, cleaned it up,

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.540
widened things out, increased legibility.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.370
Again, many of these developers did
many of the similar things

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.000
that their peers have done,
and the results are dramatic.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.920
Argus, a new app for fitness.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.420
DJ2, new to iOS 7,
a new app that's taking

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.950
advantage of things on iOS 7.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.740
HomeSnap Real Estate, great app,
completely redesigned for iOS 7.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.810
Vimeo.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:47.360
Albumatic, NBC, Snap Guide, Open Table,
and then the Ted app.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.080
These are all fantastic
apps in and of themselves,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.620
and every one of these developers
took the time to do-- to make

00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.520
a huge effort and to clean up,
to change, to improve legibility,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.250
and to optimize their
UI for-- to fit in with iOS 7.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.860
So a real terrific job from
all of these developers.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.260
And so these are just, you know,
a small set of the hundreds of

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.510
thousands of apps that are being updated
for iOS 7 every day and that have

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.000
transitioned to the new UI for iOS 7.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.750
And as I said,
we'll have a session following

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.510
this one where we're going to go
into great detail about how you

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.870
can transition your UI to iOS 7.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.000
We're going to talk about icon design,
line thickness, going edge-to-edge,

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.310
improving legibility of text,
all kinds of things that

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.010
you need to know about.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.000
That you may have read about but didn't
necessarily know how to approach.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.900
And so we'll go into that detail.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.230
Now,
in addition to the new UI with iOS 7,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:53.580
there's a whole lot of new technology
for you to use in the iOS 7 SDK.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.920
With every one of the releases
of iOS over the years,

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:01.310
we've come out with an SDK that
has new technology for you to use.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.290
And this technology comes in the
form of new frameworks or major

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.230
enhancements to existing frameworks.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.770
And none of this is new news to you.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.360
So many of you are
experienced developers.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.000
Pretty much everybody in the room
has got an app on the App Store,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.890
and so you know this.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.650
But I just want to stay high level for a
moment in this kickoff session and just

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.940
remind you that it's in the SDK that
you have the building blocks that

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.710
you're going to use to build your app,
obviously.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.550
But it's with these building
blocks that you can choose.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.860
It's how you choose to assemble
these building blocks that makes

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.510
the difference between an average
app and an app that really shines.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.120
And on top of the new UI and
the new technology in the SDK,

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.250
there's a whole new generation
of hardware that's just come out.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.630
And most recently, we introduced the iPad
Air and the iPad Mini,

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.880
both of them with Retina display.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.240
And so now every single
one of our iOS devices,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.080
I believe, is Retina-enabled.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:12.790
And these new devices
are incredibly powerful.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:12.790
And they're built around the new
A7 chip with 64-bit architecture.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:12.790
And they've got the
M7 motion coprocessor.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.910
And on top of that,
we introduced the iPhone 5s,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.590
which preceded the iPad
Air and the iPad mini Retina.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.790
But it's another powerful iOS device,
and it's built on the same A7 chip,

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.940
obviously, and it features the
Touch ID fingerprint sensor,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.960
which adds a whole new level
of convenience while also being

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.200
more secure at the same time.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:41.460
And all of these things combine,
all of these powerful new devices

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.170
and the release of iOS 7 combine
to create and form a new foundation

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.620
for next-generation apps.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.710
And helping you get the most
out of this new foundation

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.000
is what today is all about.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.180
We want to help you understand
what a next-generation app

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.010
is and how to build one.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.260
So let's talk about what
a next-generation app is.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.340
First and foremost, next-generation apps,
of course, have to be great.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.690
And I talk about great apps all the time.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.780
If you've ever been to a
Tech Talk where I've kicked off the

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:23.460
session before or kicked off before,
I've talked about great apps.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.350
And yet, over and over,
as I meet with developers,

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.850
people still don't have a good handle
on what the definition of great is.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.780
So what makes a great app?

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.420
Well, it's not just the
technology that you adopt.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.840
It's not just the
APIs that you integrate.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:53.000
[ Transcript missing ]

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:58.000
What people care about is
what your app lets them do.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.470
People care about the solution,
not so much the collection of

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.660
technologies or the features per se.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.000
And so great apps offer
a fantastic solution.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.450
In other words,
developing a great app is really all

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:17.070
about making something that's intuitive,
engaging, beautiful, and very,

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.800
very useful.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.670
Now, there are a lot of characteristics
and traits that make an app great.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.380
And I've talked about these before.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.700
There's a video on the developer
website that's somewhat dated now,

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.680
but where I go into depth
on many of these terms.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.420
And we've worked with
developers for years now on iOS,

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.640
talking about these traits.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.920
And they never get old.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.900
In fact, these traits are evergreen.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.540
They apply equally to iOS
as they do to apps on OS X.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.800
And it's important to know that
building apps with these traits

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.770
is essential if you want to
build something that's the best.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.750
And I thought it would be good to
talk for a moment and highlight a few

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.770
of these so that you understand them
a little bit more in more detail.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.640
So first is that great apps are inviting.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.370
This means that they leave
a great first impression.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.260
They have an attractive
design that draws people in.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.610
And making a great first
impression begins on the App Store.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.280
It's a function of your icon,
which is kind of your business card.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.300
It's your calling card.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.300
Leaving a great first impression is a
function of the App Store description

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.290
and how you talk about your app.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.770
It's a function of which
screenshots you've chosen

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.300
to feature in the App Store.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.730
And then the first impression
of your app is carried on and

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:48.300
reinforced or broken down across
every subsequent launch of the app.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.300
So if your app gets people into the
app and gets them up and running,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.810
doing something interesting quickly,
looking at interesting content

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.140
and doing what they really want,
you're going to constantly reinforce

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.060
that great first impression that they had
from the moment they started using it.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.100
But if the app doesn't do those things
and is slow to start and doesn't get

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.300
people into what they want to get into,
puts barriers in their way,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.300
you're going to erode that
great first impression.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.300
So one way or another,
people are going to make an impression.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.700
And you will have a lasting impression
with people that's either positive or

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.300
negative based on how your app behaves.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.300
But great apps are inviting.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.300
They draw you in and leave
a great first impression.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.850
Great apps are also state-of-the-art,
and this means that they take advantage

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.260
of the latest hardware and software.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:41.020
They make efficient use of the CPU and
the GPU to get every last ounce

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.450
of performance out of the system.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.900
And they take advantage of the
latest hardware enhancements.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.280
I mean,
we're always featuring our new devices.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.360
We're always putting the spotlight on
the newest iPhone or the newest iPad

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.050
and what it can do in its performance.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.250
Or, you know, over the years,
we introduced things like the

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.400
gyroscope or accelerometer,
or now we've done the M7.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.800
We've got these new things
we put into the hardware,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.010
and apps that take advantage of those
hardware capabilities are apps that

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.730
get the spotlight on them as well.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.760
and by integrating with the latest APIs,
state-of-the-art apps can also add

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.470
really cool new capabilities and features
based on what those technologies can do.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.630
And great apps are well-designed.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.210
And well-designed apps have
high-quality visual design and

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.920
show a lot of attention to detail.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:37.140
Well-designed apps are easy to
use and familiar by the people

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.560
that they were intended for.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:45.480
So if you're designing for, say,
a radiologist versus a commercial

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.800
airline pilot versus a football coach,
you're going to have apps that

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:55.320
are designed for very different
audiences and for very different uses.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.930
And well-designed apps are easy to use
for the audience they were intended for.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.990
They're familiar to the audience
that they were intended for.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.870
They're well-organized.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.120
They're uncluttered.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.020
They're simple.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.160
They're efficient.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.260
They're intuitive.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.440
They're stable.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.460
I mean, these are high bars, right?

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.880
But great apps can do these things.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.720
And great apps are well-designed.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.890
And frankly,
well-designed apps just feel right.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.640
They're perfectly balanced.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:30.260
They're just like, you know,
that one tool that's made

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.510
specifically for a certain use case.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.960
And lastly, great apps stand out.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.280
They get noticed for all
of the right reasons.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.780
You know,
there's really nothing like them.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:25:19.800
[ Transcript missing ]

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:26.270
and it uses device motion and core
location and is built around OpenGL ES.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.240
And the result is an
app that is designed,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.070
valuable, standout, memorable,
and state-of-the-art.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.100
And here's Procreate,
another Apple Design Award-winning app.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:45.410
This is an amazingly deep and powerful
drawing tool that can be used by artists

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.250
and illustrators to do real work.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.740
I mean,
this is a powerhouse of iOS technologies.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.190
It uses modern,
concurrent programming technologies

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.570
that leverage the hardware.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.490
is the founder of OpenGL ES.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.700
It's optimized for
graphics around OpenGL ES,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.410
and it delivers
state-of-the-art performance

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.590
and unbelievable responsiveness.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.700
It renders canvas sizes up to 4K by 4K,
and it uses core Bluetooth to

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.700
connect to accessories like
pressure-sensitive styluses.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.700
And on top of that,
it's got advanced layer

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.700
management and compositing.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.280
And the list goes on.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.000
And there are so many great apps.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.620
These are just 14 of the most
recent Apple Design Award winners

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.910
over the last two years.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:42.060
I mean, you've got DM1, Paper by 53,
Where's My Water, National Parks,

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.340
Ridiculous Fishing, right?

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:51.920
WWF Federation, Evernote, Badland, Yahoo,
Letterpress, Procreate, Sky Gamblers,

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920
right?

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.920
All of these apps are state-of-the-art.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.180
They're inviting.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.640
They're well-designed.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.820
They're connected.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.880
They're all of the attributes
that I spoke of around great apps.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.300
And so these are some of the basic traits
that you need to incorporate into your

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.650
app in order to make it really great.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.620
And this is really just the starting
point for a next-generation app,

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.180
which is what we're
really talking about now.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.550
So in addition to being great,
there are five notable additional

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.800
attributes or characteristics
of next-generation apps.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.890
The first is that they're optimized
for performance on the A7.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.370
The A7 has been
re-architected for 64-bit,

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:38.150
making our newest products the
world's first 64-bit mobile devices,

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:42.990
delivering desktop-class
performance in your hand.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.440
I mean, think about this for a moment.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.640
What does desktop class
performance really mean?

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:52.670
Go back a few years to some
of the incredible apps that,

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:57.450
say, won an Apple Design Award on
Mac OS X or these amazing apps in

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.260
science and technology that have
come out over the years on OS X.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.220
That's desktop class performance
running on a Mac Pro.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.510
And so think of some of the
apps that are on these kinds of,

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.440
you know,
some of these kinds of apps running on

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.160
really powerful hardware like a Mac Pro,
and you've got the standard

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.540
for desktop class computing.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:23.640
Now imagine that functionality
and those kinds of apps redesigned

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:31.000
for the multi-touch experience
of iOS and deployed onto an iPad

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.800
Air with Retina Display running A7.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.880
I mean,
nobody has done anything like this

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.320
on a 64-bit computing platform,
mobile computing platform.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.520
And the A7 is a brand-new,
brand-new CPU and GPU which

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.870
provide tons of computational
power for demanding apps and games.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.900
And we'll go into depth
about this more today,

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.150
but I want to take a moment
just to explain what 64-bit

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.090
architecture in the A7 really means.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.490
First of all,
it means that we've got twice as

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.200
many integer and floating-point
registers as earlier processors.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:07.270
And this lets the LLVM compiler
use these extra registers to

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.080
optimize low-level assembly and
Objective-C runtime performance.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.200
So the LLVM compiler is able to optimize
the LLVM compiler to a certain extent

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.050
and optimize the LLVM compiler to
a certain extent and optimize the

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:19.800
LLVM compiler to a certain extent

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.530
And 64 bit also means that we
offer faster performance for

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.930
both 64 bit and 32 bit apps,
because the entire

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:32.950
operating system itself,
iOS, is optimized for 64 bit.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.940
It actually runs 32 bit apps faster.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.570
And if you're worried that
this will be a big change,

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:45.880
i.e., moving to 64 bit,
for you and for your app, don't worry.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.250
You can easily maintain a
single code base and target

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.250
both 32 bit and 64 bit devices.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.860
And we've got a session all
about this later on today.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.330
I believe it's right after lunch.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.740
And so the key point here is that
the 64-bit architecture of the A7

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.460
is the future of the iOS platform.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:11.040
And so it's not okay to just
delay the move to 64-bit.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.800
Now is the time to move.

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:13.780
This is the future.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.520
It's here now, and you've got to move
your apps to 64-bit.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.860
Now,
the new A7 chip improves CPU performance

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:26.320
by up to 2x when compared to the A6,
which was the processor

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.760
that was in the iPhone 5,
for example.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.650
And a great example of an app
that benefits from this new

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.150
architecture is DJ2 by Algorithm,
based here in Germany.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.340
It's a great company.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.180
They've done some fantastic
apps that have won

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.690
Apple Design Awards over the years.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:45.900
And DJ2 on A7 is now able to do
things it couldn't do before.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.550
And an example of this is their new
harmonic match feature that can analyze

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:55.530
the musical key of a song in real time
and then transpose the key to ensure

00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:01.610
the two songs match up musically as
they transition from one to the next.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:06.030
And on previous iPhone hardware,
say running on an A6,

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:10.540
on an earlier version of iOS,
this wasn't possible because there

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:16.000
was limited horsepower and it could
take anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.260
Thank you.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.600
And now on A7, with 64-bit,
DJ can get these effects to

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.640
occur in real time and still have
processing cycles for a smoother user

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.600
experience and better visual effects.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.420
And if there are folks
from Algorithm here today,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.880
make sure you introduce yourself
to people so that others can

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.240
learn from you and your expertise.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.140
Now, another example of an app
that benefits from the A7 is

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.510
Sketchbook Mobile from Autodesk.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.210
This is an app that is
incredibly CPU-bound.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.760
And the A7 allowed Autodesk to
increase the maximum size of

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.410
brushes and other parts of the app
to twice their previous size while

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.930
maintaining their target frame rate,
even on the much larger canvas sizes.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:07.250
And the A7 also allowed them to
create completely new canvas sizes,

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:11.890
increasing canvas sizes up
to 33% larger than before.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.930
And now they can support drawing on
a full-resolution 8-megapixel image.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.180
without any performance degradation.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.780
So with very little effort,
simply moving to A7 and going to 64-bit,

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.740
the Autodesk has been able to make some
pretty significant strides forward.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.460
And in addition to
CPU performance improvements,

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.840
the A7 gives you two times faster
GPU performance than the A6 chip.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.800
Now, as many of you know,
having a super-fast

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.760
GPU provides a lot of benefits.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:48.300
Benefits such as increased
graphics fidelity within your app,

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.590
decreased wait times,
and increased drawing performance,

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:57.260
smoother animations, crisper lighting,
more realistic visual effects,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.760
and basically an entirely
new class of apps,

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760
frankly.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:09.750
The GPU on the A7 is so capable that we
are already seeing a completely new class

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.900
of apps and unbelievable performance.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.140
In other words,
you have a lot of horsepower to

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.630
take advantage of with the A7.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:17.710
Right?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.560
Right.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.520
And pretty much you're unlimited
now in terms of what you can do,

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.080
and you don't need to
limit yourself anymore.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.800
You don't need to constrain your
code and hold things back because

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.910
the hardware can't handle it.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.570
It can handle it.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.500
You can do, show,
and compute more than ever before.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:41.940
Now, a great app that shows off both
of these CPU and GPU improvements

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.100
is Infinity Blade 3.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:48.100
We recently demoed this app at
the launch of the iPhone 5s.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:53.100
And the app implements super high
fidelity graphics with four times

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:58.100
the texture detail and four times
the polygon count of any console

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.100
work that these guys have ever done.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.960
I mean,
they kept turning up the dial on detail.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:11.850
and the CPU and the GPUs to keep up
with it without dropping frame rates.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:39:27.700
[ Transcript missing ]

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.550
Now, fitness apps are obviously
a great example of where M7

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.890
can make a big difference.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:37.440
But I think what's even more exciting
is the endless possibilities for

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:42.240
other apps that aren't currently
measuring motion data but could.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.540
I mean, think about it.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.950
How much better of an experience could
you offer if your app changed its

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:53.200
behavior based on where people are,
what direction they're facing,

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.480
and how active they are?

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.320
I mean, there's some very interesting
possibilities here.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.750
And I think we're going to start
to see a lot of these things

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.400
benefit more apps over time.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.520
So we'll talk more
about M7 later on today.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:11.470
And so being motion aware lets your
app use the M7 to know how a device

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:15.460
is moving around and how you can
customize the experience in your app.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.020
And that's the second attribute
of being a next gen app.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.220
Now, the third attribute of
a next generation app,

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:25.560
in addition to being
optimized for 64-bit,

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.240
being great, to be location aware.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.920
And in particular, with iBeacon,
which we announced at

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.080
WWC a few months ago.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:38.120
I mean, think of iBeacon as a tiny radio
that you can put almost anywhere.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.600
It's a signal that can be
picked up by an iPhone.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.030
That iPhone can then determine
where the iBeacon is with

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.360
a high degree of accuracy.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.890
Now, what's interesting and what
many developers forget is

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:56.490
that there are millions of iOS
devices today that are iBeacons.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.640
I mean, there are hundreds of millions of
devices that have already moved to iOS 7,

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.990
and those devices can enable the
iBeacon functionality within iOS

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.240
7 and become iBeacons themselves.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:12.280
And what this means is that you can
start to build iBeacon-based solutions,

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.850
and you can, if nothing else,
you can use iOS devices to begin

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:21.360
experimenting with iBeacon and
figuring out what support you

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.700
want to have in your app today.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.450
Since you can turn on this functionality
and test your ideas with existing

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.130
iOS devices that you already have.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:42:48.300
[ Transcript missing ]

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:51.790
And another example might be in
a museum with its own app that

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.430
first simply notifies people
that they're nearby and then,

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.910
you know, lets them check in.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:02.500
So this app would be aware of the
fact that it's near the museum.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:07.160
And once they're checked in,
the app can become an indoor location app

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.430
that knows which gallery people are in
based on proximity of this iOS device to

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:16.270
other iOS devices throughout the museum,
let's say.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.630
For example,
you could have iPads at various

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.000
points throughout the museum.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.880
And each of those iPads is
running the app for the museum.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.630
It's pushing out an iBeacon, a unique ID,
and it could provide information as

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.830
a result to the museum app that is
running on someone's iPhone as they

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:35.990
walk through the museum or as they
walk through the store or as they walk

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.110
through whatever situation you've got.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.380
Or even better,
what if the museum's docent

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.780
was carrying an iPhone,
running an app that was

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.220
causing that iPhone to run?

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:50.820
You could find assistance
from those people,

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.060
right?

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.950
iBeacons can run on iOS devices today.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.490
The opportunities are endless.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:00.290
And so that's location,
brief touching on location and iBeacons.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.220
And we think iBeacons are going
to fundamentally change the

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:08.200
way location works for apps,
especially when indoors.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.560
Now, iOS already provides great
API and map kit and core location,

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.900
and when combined with
iBeacon and the M7,

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.230
you can now add a whole new level
of location awareness in your app.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.240
Not only can you know where
your app is in the world,

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:27.440
but you can know how close it is
to another iOS device or iBeacon.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:56.900
[ Transcript missing ]

00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:00.960
Now let's talk about another
attribute of next-generation apps,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.740
which is multitasking and the fact that
every app should support multitasking.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.640
In iOS 7,
we added multitasking for all apps

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.230
in a way that maintains battery life.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:17.560
And using these multitasking
API means that your app is always

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.770
ready for when people want to use it.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:22.490
And this is key.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:24.630
Right?

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:28.150
We're all familiar with this,
where iOS 7 is a great app switcher,

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:32.080
and people can see a snapshot of your
app even when it's not the frontmost app,

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:32.820
right?

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.430
We double tap the home button,
we get in there, we can move around.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.770
And what's important here is that
you want to make sure that the

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:44.770
snapshot of your app is up to date,
so that when someone taps on your app,

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:50.130
the snapshot matches what will happen
when the app comes to life again.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.800
And most importantly,
you want to be up to date.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.030
When they get into your app,
you don't want to have and many of

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.620
you saw this probably the very first
time you ran your app on iOS 7,

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.750
you don't want to have just your snapshot
to be a white screen with nothing on it.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:06.460
Customers don't know then
what's going on in the app,

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.030
and it's not a great experience.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:11.170
So being ready using the
multitasking API correctly is

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:16.220
really important for being up to
date for customers within your app.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.420
And iOS 7 does a lot of things
around multitasking that are

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.420
beneficial to you as a developer,
right?

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.980
We do intelligent scheduling.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.850
And notice when your
app is typically used,

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.480
and we will give it background
cycles based on that usage pattern.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.880
We take advantage of times when
the device is powered up and let

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.680
your app do opportunistic updates.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.300
And iOS 7 responds to push notifications.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.580
So as a trigger to give your app time
to go and fetch data that's needed

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.600
based on that push notification.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.040
And so there's no more
waiting for screens to reload,

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.660
or at least there shouldn't be any
more waiting for screens to reload.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.120
If you're taking advantage
of multitasking on iOS.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.980
correctly.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:02.420
The way to do this is to take
advantage of the three API that exist.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.550
There's background fetch,
where we will run your app periodically

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:10.080
so that you can pull new data down
and update your UI accordingly.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.340
There's remote notifications,
where we'll run your app in response

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:16.960
to a push notification so that you
can update your content on demand

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.100
versus having to poll for information,
which is very inefficient.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.220
And lastly,
there are background transfers,

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:28.040
where iOS will upload or download data
in the background on behalf of your app,

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.230
even if it isn't running.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:33.920
So those three API are very important
for giving a great experience.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:38.550
And we will talk more about these
API in greater depth today in one

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.880
of our sessions this afternoon.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.080
And since you've got new opportunities,
though,

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:48.230
on iOS 7 for your app to be running,
it's even more important than

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:52.660
ever that you are power smart when
you do your background updates.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.090
So let's just talk about
power smart for a moment.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.610
So first, using the network requires
powering the antennas,

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:04.260
regardless of whether you're using Wi-Fi,
cellular, or Bluetooth, right?

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.870
If we turn on a radio,
it takes power from the battery.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.060
So be sure to optimize your networking.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:15.550
not only be transmitting the
least amount of data as necessary,

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:31.500
[ Transcript missing ]

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.750
Secondly,
when you want to know the type of

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:38.470
activity that the user is engaged in,
use the M7 processor and the

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:43.150
core motion APIs rather than
doing things manually on the CPU,

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.260
as we talked about before.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.240
If you are showing
information in real time,

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.690
you can get a constant feed
but only capture the data

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.590
from the M7 when you need it.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.720
And lastly,
you can always query the M7 later

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.980
by date range so that you don't
have to constantly be updating

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.980
information using the CPU.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:09.270
So there's just new ways of doing things
with M7 and new ways of querying the

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:14.430
system that really prevent having to
wake up the system radios and wake up

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:17.970
the hardware in ways that you used to.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.580
And thirdly,
as far as being power smart is concerned,

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.110
you need to be power smart
when using location services.

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:29.910
The core location framework relies on
radios to determine the user's location.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:31.250
Obviously, right?

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:34.680
We're turning on the radios
to determine Wi-Fi location,

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.900
to find cell towers,
all of these kinds of things.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.570
So only use these services when needed.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:44.660
This will allow us to turn off the
radios in order to save power when

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.580
you're not tracking the user's location.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:51.750
And be sure to use the right service
for the experience that you need.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.460
For example, if you only need to know
what city a person is in,

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:59.300
you can do that without requiring
the finest level of accuracy,

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.260
which would use more power.

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:05.810
So if you just need to know the city,
then don't track down to the meter,

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:10.340
which is just far more burdensome on
the system and requires the radios to

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:13.010
be far more active using more power.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:17.460
So that's multitasking in iOS 7,
which allows your app to always

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.320
be ready for when people need it,
and some tips on being power smart

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.210
relative to running in the background
and doing some of the things that

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:25.780
are capable and possible there.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:31.720
And last, but certainly not least,
a next generation app needs to be secure.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.460
More and more users are setting
a passcode on their devices,

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.420
and on iPhone 5s,
Touch ID does away with the need for the

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:43.380
passcode most of the time for many users.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:47.870
And since all of our current
devices support hardware encryption,

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:51.780
when the passcode is set,
data protection is enabled.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.200
And if you're not aware of
how data protection works or

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.180
what it means to your app,
today is the day to learn

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.540
about how this all works.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.630
I mean,
data protection will encrypt data on disk

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.900
using keys based on the user's passcode.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:15.190
And when an iOS device locks,
we throw away these keys and may no

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:18.000
longer be able to decrypt the data.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:22.520
By default, that would include keychain
items and files in some cases.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.140
And with the new
multitasking APIs in iOS 7,

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.480
your app may be allowed to run
not only in the background,

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.320
but also when the device is locked.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:37.600
And this can be a problem for you,
for example, if you want to update your

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.090
app in the background.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:44.800
You may need to access credentials
in order to log into your server,

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.280
but if the device is locked,
you might not be able to

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.940
get to those credentials.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:55.680
So it's really important to understand
how you should approach this situation.

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.260
And while data protection is important
for securing data on the device,

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:03.180
it's equally important that you
use the latest best practices when

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.820
you transmit data over the network.

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:10.900
Be sure that you're using secure
protocols and verifying certificates.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.690
Whenever possible,
hash sensitive data and always

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:17.050
respect your user's privacy.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.710
There are lots of apps which
are not doing these things.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.460
And for many of these apps
that aren't doing these things,

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.910
security is really--

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:49.300
[ Transcript missing ]

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:54.080
So these are the five characteristics
of next-generation iOS apps.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:58.030
They're optimized for
64-bit on the A7 chip.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:02.410
They are motion aware with the M7 chip.

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.500
They're location aware.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:22.500
[ Transcript missing ]

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.450
And so iOS 7 and our latest
devices make it possible for

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:29.300
you to build apps impossible to
imagine just a few years ago.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.560
I mean, really,
think about it for a moment.

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.490
How long have we had apps around?

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:36.210
How long has the apps
ecosystem in iOS been here?

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.300
Seven years, right, roughly?

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.740
And we are seeing apps
today that were completely,

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.370
you know,
that weren't even imagined three, four,

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:47.760
five years ago.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.710
And we as an evangelism team,
we at Apple are working with some

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:56.110
of you already on your next apps and
the next revisions that are coming

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.820
for this new hardware and for iOS 7.

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.410
And some of this stuff
is just unbelievable.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.480
And so it's just an
exciting time to be here.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.820
And we're seeing apps that just
weren't possible years ago.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:14.140
And, you know, this hardware and this new
operating system open up

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.700
completely new opportunities.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.700
And today is the day to start
learning how to develop for this

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.480
new OS and for this new hardware.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:26.020
And we've got a full day of content
focused specifically on helping

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.410
you move to iOS 7 with your app.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.940
We have eight very technical sessions
that are loaded with information,

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.150
so get ready to take lots of notes.

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:38.580
We are going to make
videos of these sessions,

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.470
but you're going to want
to take notes anyway.

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.400
Now, after this session,
we begin with the user

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.940
interface design session,
which is up next.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.900
After that,
we've got architecting modern apps.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.820
And in that session,
we will talk about some of

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:59.130
the newest UI kit enhancements
available to your apps in iOS 7.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.660
Following that,
we will have a break for lunch.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.600
And then at 12:30,
so half an hour after lunch,

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.540
begins being served,
the App Store marketing team

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:11.930
will talk about distributing and
marketing your apps on the App Store.

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.690
So you can either quickly grab some
food and eat outside and then come

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:17.120
into the room for that session.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.750
Or if the lines are too long,
feel free to grab food and

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:21.810
bring it into this room.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:24.500
That's why we've got tables,
to make it easy to take notes,

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.260
make it easy to eat food and drink.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.440
And either way, come back into the room.

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.200
You do not want to miss this session.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.800
It's the only non-technical
session of the day.

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.370
And then after lunch,
we'll start back up with details on

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:42.470
moving to 64-bit and how to maintain both
iOS 6 and iOS 7 versions of your app.

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:44.600
And following that,
we'll go into detail on the new

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:49.880
multitasking capabilities of iOS 7 that
I referred to briefly a few moments ago.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:53.680
And then we'll dive into how you
can make your app more secure.

00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:55.710
And finally,
we'll wrap up our sessions with

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.380
some really valuable and interesting
tips and tricks to get the most--

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.240
out of your iOS 7 development.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:06.690
And this is a very cool session filled
with stuff that many of you-- you've

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.110
probably seen some of the buttons.

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:10.060
You've probably heard
about some of these things,

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.260
but never dove into.

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:15.060
And you're going to really love
some of these tips and tricks.

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:18.120
And once our sessions are complete,
you're invited to stay and

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.100
have some food and drink out
in the lobby out these doors.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:25.190
And this reception time at the
end of the day is a really fun

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:29.320
time and a valuable time to meet
other developers from-- you know,

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:33.310
that are here in the room today,
and to meet us from Apple and

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:36.440
connect with us even more than
you have throughout the day.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.550
So please make a point of staying for
the reception and meeting your peers and

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.860
meeting the rest of the folks from Apple.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.720
In addition to all these sessions,
we have an all-day lab

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.100
running in the next room.

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.920
And there's going to be
a lot going on in there,

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:53.740
so I want to take a moment just to
explain how this is going to work.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:57.500
So first of all, I want to ask all of the
Apple employees to come forward.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:03.620
We have brought-- flown-- a lot of folks
in from Cupertino to meet with you today.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.820
We have Apple engineers from
the iOS engineering team.

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:09.580
We've got UI designers-- six of them,
actually,

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:14.720
available for UI reviews today-- and
lots of other experts from various

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:18.900
teams throughout Apple that you
work with directly-- for example,

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.220
AppReview and iTunes
Connect and the App Store team.

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:25.720
So we've got a ton of
resources for you here,

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:28.390
and it would be a crying shame
if you did not leverage the

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:31.950
knowledge and experience that is
standing in front of you right now.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.440
Now, the first thing about the lab
I want to make clear is that

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:38.560
you should feel absolutely free
to go in and out of this room,

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.300
back and forth to the
lab throughout the day.

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:45.800
If you just sit here all day and
do not take advantage of the lab,

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.470
you're going to miss out on
an enormous resource for you.

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.860
Unfortunately,
there's only one of you in some cases,

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:55.900
and you've got to be in-- it's hard
to be in multiple places at one time.

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:59.470
But please, please, please,
if you've got to be in one of the labs,

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:02.480
if you've got a question about something,
go out to the lab.

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.180
If you think it's not busy,
go out to the lab.

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:05.470
Come back in.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.200
Next, we have many topics that
are covered in the labs.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:13.700
So the first is that we have
design labs where you can schedule

00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:18.160
a 30-minute time slot to sit down
with an Apple interface designer.

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.270
We've got six of them, as I said,
or an evangelist,

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.420
and get feedback and advice
on your app's design,

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.340
the visual design,
the interaction design.

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:30.670
And these UI design audits are
intended to review your app's UI,

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:34.280
so you have to be sure to
have an app for us to look at.

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.250
Don't sign up for one if you don't
have an app for us to look at.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.520
Now,
there are a limited number of time slots.

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.400
Even though we've got six designers,
there are more people here,

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.230
there are more of you than we
can meet with in half-hour slots.

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:49.970
So you're going to want to boot it out
of this room if you're interested in

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:54.700
this right after this session and sign
up for these right at the main table.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:58.510
And just go around the corner to
the lab concierge table and sign up,

00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.460
and we'll give you a time slot.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.530
Now, in addition to UI design sessions,
we've got a lot of these

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:11.920
folks here are iOS engineers,
and they're going to be available to

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.860
cover programming and development topics.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:17.000
And they can answer questions
about most of our frameworks,

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.420
about app services, developer tools,
graphics technologies,

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:24.290
and pretty much any technology that
you're using inside of your apps.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.470
Don't be shy.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.380
We can look at code.

00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:31.220
We can help you understand the
best way to use a framework.

00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:34.220
We can help you architect
your code differently.

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:39.340
And we can help you improve the
performance or integration of your app.

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:44.330
And if you have any technical question,
any question at all, come and see us.

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.300
Let us know.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:47.280
We will do our best to get an answer.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.750
If we have to, we'll call back home to
California to talk to some of our

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.480
colleagues and get the answer.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.850
We've got people on standby.

00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:59.580
And if you don't have a question,
come by the lab anyway

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.570
and show us your app.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.820
And just say, hey, take a look at my app.

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:04.500
What do you think?

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.740
And we'll tell you.

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:08.840
And we'll look at things like the
performance and all these things.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.640
And we will point you to somebody
else in the room that you should

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.130
meet with to get things done.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.300
So come by the lab, please.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.570
And lastly,
we have members from the app review team,

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:22.220
the iTunes connect team,
and the app store marketing team who

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.350
can talk with you about getting your
app through the review process and

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:28.680
getting published on the app store.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.640
Again, don't be shy.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.150
If you have an idea for a future app,
come and talk to them about it.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.100
If you have a revision of your
current app stuck in review,

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.750
go talk to somebody about it.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.270
If you want to know how to
work the app store a little bit

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.490
better and do better marketing,
come talk to those guys about it.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.600
Don't be shy.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.780
Come by the lab.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.900
We're there and we're in here presenting.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.500
So we hope that you have a great day.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.960
We're really looking forward
to talking to you all,

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.260
to meeting with you all.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.360
We know many of you.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.560
Actually, I do personally.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.620
And we'll take a very
short break right now.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.170
And get back going as soon as
possible right at about 10.05 with a

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.820
session on designing for iOS 7 apps.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.630
So thanks for spending the day with us.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.180
And have a great day.
