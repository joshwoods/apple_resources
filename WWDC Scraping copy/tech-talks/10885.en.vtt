00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:02.336
Greg Bradley: Hello,
App Store developers!

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.905
I’m Greg from
the App Store Review team.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:10.077
Our goal is to help developers
find success on the App Store.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:13.080
We're an international team with
reviewers on three continents,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.983
fluent in over 80 languages,
working around the clock

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.685
to give you feedback
on your apps.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.454
Today I’m going to share tips
from our team

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.623
to help you prepare
your apps for review

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:26.493
and get ahead of some of
the common issues we see.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:29.129
The three tips we have for you
today will help you avoid issues

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.699
that we find on 30 percent
of rejected submissions.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.736
These issues are as common
as they are preventable.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:38.105
Implementing these tips
before you submit your app

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.073
will make your submission ready
for your customers

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.275
on the App Store,

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:44.811
and also ready for us
to conduct our review.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.146
To help visualize that,

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.682
we’ll describe the journey
of two apps:

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:52.119
one that implements all of these
tips, and one that doesn't.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.689
We'll call it,
"A Tale of Two Apps."

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.991
And we’ll touch on
some additional resources

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.661
you can check out
to help you before, during,

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.197
and after you submit your app.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:06.967
Our three submission tips are:

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:11.238
test thoroughly so that your app
is ready for your customers,

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:15.876
tell us more about the unique
experience your app provides,

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:19.880
and provide access, setting us
up to do a complete review.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.916
Let's start with testing.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.718
Your app may have
a great concept,

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.988
but bugs and crashes
can ruin the experience.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.723
So when we find a major bug,

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:32.025
or your app crashes
during our review,

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:35.762
we’ll let you know and do our
best to help you fix the issue.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.764
We'll share the steps
to reproduce these issues,

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.234
and for crashes,
provide crash logs.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.704
We review all apps
on physical devices,

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:48.575
not on a simulator, to mirror
actual, real-world conditions.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.878
The issues we see will also
impact everyone using your app,

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.915
and we want to help you
prevent that.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.351
The best time to fix a bug
or crash, though,

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.319
is before you submit.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.389
At App Review, we review apps
the way a user would use them,

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.523
not necessarily in the way

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:06.526
that a proper QA team
would QA them.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.829
A great tool to help you
do quality assurance

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:13.967
and beta testing on real,
physical devices is TestFlight.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.803
TestFlight makes it easier
to resolve issues in beta

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.839
before you hit production.

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.441
You can upload beta builds
right in App Store Connect

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.010
and distribute
to internal testers

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.579
on your Apple Developer Program
account.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.781
You can also share your
beta app to users

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:33.653
with iOS, iPadOS,
macOS, and tvOS devices

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:38.191
by inviting them via email
or by sharing a public link.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:41.094
TestFlight builds are also
reviewed by App Store Review.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.964
We may reject a TestFlight
submission if it has issues

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.399
that would prevent beta testing

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.769
or has content that would
never be on the App Store.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.070
Our TestFlight reviews exist

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.372
to help you resolve App
Store Review guideline issues

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.342
before the app is submitted
to the App Store.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.978
And it’s also accessed
with your developer account,

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:01.214
you could start testing today!

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:02.983
If your app is live
on the store,

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:05.552
and you’re submitting a critical
update to fix some issues,

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.686
we're happy to work with you

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.156
to get that update
to your customers.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:11.925
This includes what we call
"bug fix submissions."

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.360
If we find an issue
with your app

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.829
during our review of an update,
we'll let you know

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.697
and ask if you'd like
to resolve the issue

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.533
on the next submission.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.868
If so,
we'll approve the update.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.104
It's a simple process and we'll
let you know if you're eligible

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:26.973
in our message to you
in App Store Connect.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:30.143
Keep in mind though, apps with
legal, trust, or safety concerns

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:33.480
are not eligible
for this process.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.648
All right.

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:36.616
Now let’s imagine
these types of preparations

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.619
in the context
of two apps being submitted.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.557
We’ll call them
Turtlr and R-bit.

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.492
For one of these apps,
the developer took the time

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:48.161
to go through
an industry-standard QA process,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.429
while the other cut some corners

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.933
and sped past the testing phase
right into submission.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.168
If you’re familiar
with heavy-handed idioms,

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:58.672
you can probably guess
which one is which!

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:02.109
Turtlr had a full round
of QA using TestFlight,

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.244
after which the developer
was fairly certain

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.846
that it was bug free,

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:09.149
and it runs really nicely
on all of the tested devices.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:11.318
R-bit didn't use TestFlight

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:14.554
and did a quick,
but noncomprehensive QA.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.723
There were a couple
of lingering bugs,

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:20.227
and sometimes it crashes
when we try to sign in.

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:23.330
Let’s move on
to our second tip.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.499
Tell us more about your app
when you submit!

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.101
You’ve worked tirelessly
to make an excellent app,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.670
and we’d be happy to read about
your app’s concepts and features

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.372
in your own words.

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.274
We encourage you
to provide any information

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.243
in the App Review Information
section

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:40.147
on the app version page
in App Store Connect.

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:43.250
Are you submitting
a new app for the first time?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.318
Tell us about
your app's concept,

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.953
how to enable key features,

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.522
and even describe
the target audience

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:51.324
you designed your app for.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:53.360
Are you submitting
a big update?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.095
Tell us about what’s changed

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:57.831
and where to locate
significant new content.

00:04:57.831 --> 00:04:59.666
Also keep in mind
that as apps change,

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.735
we may ask you questions
you answered

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.470
on previous submissions.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.372
This is to make sure
our understanding of your app

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:07.407
keeps pace with all
the improvements

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:10.844
and new features
added over time.

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:12.979
Another thing to keep in mind
is that some apps

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.081
may require additional
documentation,

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.617
such as from
a regulatory agency,

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:21.254
or to demonstrate authorization
to use protected content.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:22.689
For example,
if you’ve worked hard

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.824
to secure regulatory approval
for an app

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.760
that syncs
with medical hardware,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.864
you can attach the documentation
when you first submit your app.

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.299
If you’re wondering
whether or not you should

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:34.134
submit documentation,
it never hurts

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:36.903
to provide us with more
information about your app --

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:40.941
especially if you’re operating
in a highly regulated industry.

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:41.875
To learn more about apps

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.743
that may require
additional documents,

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:51.084
see guidelines 1.3,
1.4, 4.1, 5, and 5.2.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.486
Remember, it’s up to you
to comply with local laws

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:56.356
wherever your app is available.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.691
If we need additional
information

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.327
about any of the features
or functionality,

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:03.897
we'll let you know via
an Information Needed message.

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:05.999
But if you can anticipate
the type of questions

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.335
that a person using
your app might have,

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:12.305
this information could help
streamline your app’s review.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:16.009
Let’s check in on our slightly
cliche metaphor real quick.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.246
Turtlr put the time
into fully describing the app,

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.182
as well as helping us understand
who the app is for,

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:26.019
not only in the app description,
but in the notes for App Review.

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.587
Also, they were not sure
if we needed

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:29.789
documentation for
regulatory clearance,

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.660
but they’ve gone ahead
and submitted that anyway.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.296
R-bit’s plan for marketing
their app is to be mysterious

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:39.833
to create some buzz,
but perhaps too mysterious

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.601
because when they submitted
the app for review,

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.272
there’s not a lot of information
about what the app is or does.

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.841
We’ll have to spend some time
figuring that out.

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.509
Even when one
launches the app,

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.811
it’s got a bit
of a learning curve.

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.580
Well, let’s move on
to our third tip

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.017
and see how that can help
streamline a submission!

00:06:57.017 --> 00:06:58.551
We review the entire app,

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.620
so if there are
account-based features,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.155
we need to review
the app experience

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.425
both with and without
an account.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.261
Two ways to accomplish this
are either with a demo account,

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.664
or by creating a demo mode.

00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:13.667
Let’s talk about
demo accounts first.

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.769
Provide us with up-to-date
login credentials

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.637
to a demo account
in App Store Connect

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:22.242
so that we can easily access
any account-based experience.

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:24.744
Ensuring the account is
up to date is an important step

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.347
because while we may
create a new account

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:29.249
to review the sign up flow,
you know best

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:33.053
the experience that you want
users with accounts to have.

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:35.155
If your app doesn't have
an account-creation feature,

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:36.356
it’s even more important

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:39.559
to provide this up-to-date
login information.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.495
Also, if it makes sense to do so
based on your app’s concept,

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:45.832
fully featured demo accounts
populated with relevant content

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:50.303
can help show us your app
in its best light.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.406
For example, if you’re creating
a social media platform,

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:54.908
you can populate
the demo account

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:57.010
with content that really shows
off the services

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.779
and experiences
your app provides.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.981
For apps that handle
sensitive user information,

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.617
or operate in highly regulated
industries

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:06.986
with restrictions
on creating new accounts,

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.856
consider building in
a demonstration mode,

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.725
like one your QA
or marketing teams

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.827
may already be using.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.795
Demonstration modes
exhibit your app’s full features

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:19.699
and functionality to us,
while using stand-in data.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.434
We understand that
you may be working with data

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.938
that simply cannot be shared
externally, even with Apple.

00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:26.940
With a demonstration mode,
you can help us understand

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.642
the entire user experience
from beginning to end

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:33.947
without compromising
any sensitive user information.

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:36.015
Let’s compare this demo
account preparation

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:40.353
using our thinly veiled
rabbit-versus-turtle analogy.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.822
Turtlr’s account was
up to date and working.

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.724
This might seem like
an obvious first step

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.926
but invalid or expired
account credentials

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:49.863
are something we observe
rather frequently!

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.766
The account provided was
populated and looked lived in,

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.901
as if we were taking a look
at the existing account

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:57.737
of someone
who uses the app daily.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:00.540
This created a natural
user experience for us.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.809
It’s as if we’d been
using the app forever

00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:05.779
even though this is
the first time we launched it!

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:09.282
R-bit’s demo account,
however, was expired.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:11.651
Well that’s that; we’ll try
creating our own if we can,

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:15.388
otherwise, we'll have to ask
for some updated credentials.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.756
Getting close
to the finish line here.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:21.494
Will Turtlr or R-bit
cross it first?

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:22.629
Let’s put all of that together

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:26.299
and see the conclusion
of our Tale of Two Apps.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.834
Turtlr followed
all of these tips

00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:30.770
and did a couple
of relatively simple things.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.572
They QA’d their app,

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.008
they provided
some detailed info,

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:37.210
and they made sure
the demo account existed

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.345
and was functional.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.815
R-bit did a little bit
of testing,

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:44.250
but not enough to catch
all of the issues.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.653
They didn't give us
or their prospective audience

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:48.922
much guidance
on how to use the app,

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:53.560
and the demo account had expired
some time before submitting.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.296
With Turtlr, the time spent
preparing the app for submission

00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:58.565
ended up saving them
time in the end.

00:09:58.565 --> 00:09:59.799
They submitted the app,

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.534
and after doing
a thorough review,

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:02.735
we approved their submission

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:05.171
since there were
no other issues.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:08.041
R-bit, however,
ran into a couple of obstacles.

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.442
Without a working demo account,

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.411
and having a handful
of usability issues

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:15.114
including some bugs
and concept clarity concerns,

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.516
it will take more time
for the app

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:19.152
to be ready for the App Store.

00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:21.120
Both apps did get approved,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.656
but by more thoroughly preparing
the app for submission,

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.892
our turtle friend here --
much like the turtle

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:28.194
you may have heard about
in a story or two --

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:31.331
ends up taking the win
at the end.

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:35.001
What does that time look like
in the real world?

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:37.136
We complete our review
in less than 24 hours

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:38.805
for 90 percent of apps.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.341
Reject or approve, you’ll
typically get an answer from us

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.643
in about a day.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.246
This means that if there are
no issues with submission,

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:48.982
it's likely your app will be
reviewed and approved

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:51.718
in under 24 hours.

00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:53.186
If there are some things to fix,

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:56.289
you'll also likely know
in under 24 hours.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:59.592
But, if it takes multiple
submissions to solve the issue,

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:02.996
it may take a few days for your
app to be ready for approval.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.965
We understand the difference
between one day and a few days

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.167
can be significant
in the world of apps,

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.769
so we are happy
to provide these tips

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.538
to help your app
be ready for approval

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:15.975
without needing multiple
submissions and reviews.

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:18.678
We’ll close out by pointing you
to some additional resources

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:23.483
to keep in mind as you submit
apps to the App Store.

00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:26.419
The first resource is
the person reviewing your app!

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.787
If you’ve heard
from App Store Review

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.055
about an issue with your app

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:31.024
but you don’t understand
our requirements,

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.326
you can reply to our message
right in App Store Connect

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:34.861
and let us know.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.296
We’re happy to explain the issue

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:39.265
and help you understand
our guidelines.

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:41.568
If you’re facing extenuating
circumstances,

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:43.970
such as submitting an update
with a critical bug fix

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.172
or a time-sensitive event,

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:50.243
you may request
an expedited review.

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:52.211
Be sure to let us know
your circumstances

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.048
and we’ll do our best
to support you.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.883
If you think we’ve misunderstood
your app

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.252
and disagree
with the outcome of our review,

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:03.122
you can file an appeal
with the App Review Board.

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:04.724
Be sure to provide
specific reasons

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.793
why you believe your app
follows our guidelines

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:10.430
to help the App Review Board
consider your case.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.166
You can find links to the forms
for requesting an expedite

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.435
or filing an appeal
on the App Review page

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:18.071
on the Apple Developer website.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.639
There you can also find
more tips

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.040
for preparing your app
for review

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.777
and other common issues
to look out for.

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:26.145
Thanks for watching our video.

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:28.247
We're always excited to see
the next big thing

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.682
from App Store developers,

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:33.019
and we look forward to helping
you find success on the store!
