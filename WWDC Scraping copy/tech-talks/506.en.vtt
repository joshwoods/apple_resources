The set top box APIs

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.438
are used in
server-to-server communication

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:07.174
which enable the
Apple Zero Sign On experience.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:11.378
These APIs create and control
profiles for Apple TV devices,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:15.082
which make the Apple TV setup
easier for your customers.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.817
With the set top box APIs,

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:19.586
the setup flow highlights
the customer's TV provider

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.055
when they first set up
their Apple TV.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.790
The app is
automatically installed

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.525
and the customer
is authenticated

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.295
with their TV provider
at the system level.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.831
No iTunes or iCloud account
required.

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.801
Apple TVs are matched by their
serial numbers to the customers.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.570
This process involves
your server

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.672
calling the set top box APIs

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:41.975
to create and assign profiles
to devices.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.144
Upon activation,
the appropriate profile

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.280
is downloaded to device.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.583
This profile is the key
to the set top box behavior.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:52.119
It allows tvOS to know
the TV provider

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.687
and contains the user token,

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:56.890
that you create to identify
your customer.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.126
This profile is installed
on device

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.795
when a customer activates
their Apple TV.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.397
It will only be used
with the customer's consent

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.501
and only removed
with the customer's consent.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.403
If a customer sells
their Apple TV,

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:13.573
the profile can be removed when
they inform the TV provider.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.042
The set top box APIs

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:18.345
can only successfully
assign profiles to Apple TVs

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.948
if those devices maintain
a chain of custody

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.382
from Apple to you.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.184
If they are called
on any other device,

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:27.187
the APIs will respond
with an error.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.289
If a customer needs
to replace a device,

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.559
they can do so through you
or any Apple retail store.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:35.429
If through you, you can enable
their new Apple TV

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.764
with the Zero Sign On
user experience.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.433
If through
an Apple retail store,

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.402
the TV provider doesn't know
about the hardware exchange,

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.072
and there's no profile
assigned to the new device.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:46.606
So the customer's Apple TV

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:50.344
will have a standard retail
experience with single sign-on.

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.546
Also, the devices
returned to Apple

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:54.781
will be removed
from your pool of devices,

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.118
and their new Apple TV
is added to your pool.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.587
To get started using
the set top box APIs,

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.457
first we need some information
called onboarding data.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.025
You send this data to Apple.

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:06.693
This includes the DUNS number

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.662
identifying your
business entity,

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:10.330
the name of your company,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.100
and your phone number
as they appear in DUNS.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.103
Also your company's website,
the public key

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:18.739
from a public/private
key pair you generate,

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.374
and an Apple customer number

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:23.377
that was used for purchasing
your Apple TVs.

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:24.344
With this information,

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.813
we can get
your business entity onboard

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:30.584
using the set top box APIs
and into our program.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.986
Once you have access
to the set top box APIs,

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.654
you can start using them.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.758
To begin, you start
an authenticated session.

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.192
Once this session has started,

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.529
you can create, check,
and assign profiles

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.731
to specific Apple TVs.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.367
You can remove a profile
so that it won't redownload

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.536
when the customer
resets their Apple TV.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.773
You can also get the list
of Apple TVs available to you

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:56.309
with fetch devices
and fetch device details.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.046
In summary, the set top box APIs

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:03.350
are a set of APIs to associate
Apple TVs to customers.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.352
Thank you.
