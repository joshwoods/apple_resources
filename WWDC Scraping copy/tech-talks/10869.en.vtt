00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.040
Thank you all for
joining today’s session.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.480
We’re excited to introduce you to
Family Sharing for in-app purchases.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.940
First, let’s introduce ourselves.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.840
I’m Bryan Eisenstadt, and I’m on the
App Store Monetization team.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.170
And I’m David Wendland,
a Global Technical Advocate with

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.770
the App Store Commerce team.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.700
Today, I’ll be giving you an overview of
Family Sharing for in-app purchases,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.020
then David will discuss engineering
and implementation of the feature.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.440
So let’s get started with
the feature overview.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.190
So what exactly is
Family Sharing for in-app purchases?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.640
As a reminder,
Family Sharing is a powerful tool

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.150
that makes it easy for customers
to share their digital purchases

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.900
with their family members across
all of their Apple devices.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.100
Since its launch in 2014,
Family Sharing has become an

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.330
important part of the Apple ecosystem,
bringing content and services

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.810
to more customers and more
devices than ever before.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.460
As part of Apple’s ongoing
investment in Family Sharing,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.440
we’re excited to roll out an update that
expands these capabilities to StoreKit.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.980
And that’s what today’s
session is all about:

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.540
getting started with
Family Sharing for in-app purchases.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.270
We’re excited to share that you
can now enable Family Sharing for

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.580
auto-renewable subscriptions and
non-consumable in-app purchases.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.780
In addition to being available for
both subscriptions and non-consumables,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.270
Family Sharing enables purchase
sharing with up to five family members

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.360
included in a customer's family group.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.600
As a developer,
you can choose to implement

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.860
Family Sharing on existing SKUs or create
new ones specifically for Family Sharing.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.840
Family Sharing is easy to
implement within App Store Connect,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.130
as David will discuss in-depth
later on in this presentation.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.860
Family Sharing provides a streamlined,
convenient user experience and

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.020
can help you attract subscribers,
encourage paid subscriptions,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.740
increase user engagement,
and improve retention.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.180
So let's talk about that a bit
more with why Family Sharing.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.140
Family Sharing for in-app
purchases can help with four

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.300
key areas of your business:
subscriber growth, increased engagement,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.440
and reduction in churn,
which all add up to a higher

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.540
customer lifetime value.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.380
To help illustrate how
these metrics work together,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.680
let’s look at an example.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.110
Family Sharing can be a
compelling feature in Acquisition

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.450
Driver to grow your subscriber
base and acquire customers,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.100
like Michael shown here, to your product.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.600
Once you’ve acquired
Michael as a subscriber,

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.300
he can seamlessly extend his
subscription to the four other members

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.640
of his family with Family Sharing,
multiplying the number of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.380
customer touchpoints to your
service and app by five times.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.860
And with five members of the family
now engaging with your product,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.730
a compelling content offering combined
with effective engagement marketing

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.340
can keep them coming back to your app.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.380
And with more users getting value
from your product and service,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.520
the overall effect can
be to help reduce churn.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.240
and customers love Family Sharing too.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.800
Previously, customers had the ability to
share in-app purchases on the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.590
App Store with family members,
but never services

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.320
through in-app purchases.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.720
So we’re excited to
introduce that to you today.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.110
Second, Family Sharing has been
engineered alongside iOS 14 to

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.820
offer customers a seamless and
easy-to-use out-of-box experience.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.470
The user experience is consistent
across devices and apps.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.680
Next, Family Sharing is built with
privacy in mind and eliminates

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.780
the need for password sharing.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.930
Each family member receives their
own entitlement to a purchase.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.510
And finally,
Family Sharing adds value to your in-app

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.880
purchases by offering purchasers up
to six entitlements instead of one.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.020
This gives families the opportunity
to take better advantage of purchases,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.680
extending the number of
people with access to them,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.010
and giving each family member the ability
to personalize their app experience.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.680
Now that we’ve explained what
Family Sharing is and the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.690
benefits to implementing it,
let’s talk about how customers and

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.340
developers make the most of the feature.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.490
In order to begin using
Family Sharing for in-app purchases,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.880
customers must create a family group.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.990
One adult in a household can do so by
inviting up to five of their family

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.520
members to join using their Apple IDs.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.230
Each family member uses their
own account so their experience

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.450
stays personalized and private.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.600
Once a family group is created,
each family member gets instant

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.000
access to the group subscriptions and
content that is eligible for sharing.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.050
Let’s take a look at how customers
manage their subscription sharing

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.300
preferences within the Settings app.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.260
This is the Manage Subscriptions page,
where customers can view all of the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.970
products they’re currently subscribed to.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.490
The Share New Subscriptions toggle
at the top of the page allows them

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.790
to choose whether or not they’re
automatically sharing family

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.980
sharing-enabled SKUs moving forward.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.320
This toggle is turned
on by default in iOS 14,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.970
but customers can choose
to opt out at any time.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.720
Selecting any of the listed apps will
allow you to edit purchases and choose

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.040
whether Family Sharing is turned on
or off for a specific subscription.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.340
The initial setting is based
on the Share New Subscriptions

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.510
preference in the image on the left.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.300
This is also where customers will
need to come in order to opt into

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.240
Family Sharing in the event it becomes
available for an existing subscription.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.460
Now let’s review the steps family
groups would need to take to share

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.600
their Family Shared Subscriptions.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.910
For any new purchases of
Family Shared Subscriptions,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.670
Family Sharing is enabled automatically.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.230
For any existing subscriptions
a customer has that become

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.730
available for Family Sharing,
the original purchaser has to

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.040
opt into sharing within settings.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.730
This is to ensure the customer
fully acknowledges the updates

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.870
to their subscription's terms.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.980
Managing sharing preferences is
slightly different for non-consumables.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.540
Here you see the
Family Sharing purchase sharing screen,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.030
which includes the Share Purchases
with Family toggle,

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.100
which must be turned on in order to share
non-consumables with family members.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.830
Family Sharing of non-consumables is
automatically enabled for both new

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.090
and existing purchases as long as
purchase sharing is enabled in iCloud,

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.590
the family is sharing purchases,
and the app is not hidden

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.280
from purchase history.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.420
Family members will automatically have
access to the content of new purchases,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.260
but when Family Sharing becomes
available on existing purchases,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.570
family members will have to select
the Restore Purchase button in

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.070
order to unlock the content that
has newly become available to them.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.190
While we highly encourage you
to message the availability

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.200
of Family Sharing through
your own marketing channels,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.920
there are two use cases
where the App Store will

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.840
message customers directly.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.660
Purchasers will receive
a push notification when

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.600
Family Sharing becomes available
on an existing subscription SKU.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.870
Push notifications will also be
deployed to customers that purchase

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.100
a new Family Sharing-enabled
SKU but have turned off the

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.560
Share New Subscriptions master toggle
within the Manage Subscriptions page.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.420
In both cases, the push notifications
will link customers to the

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.170
Edit Subscription page for that app,
where they can choose to share it

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.450
with the rest of their family group.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.520
Now let’s talk about some of the ways to
make your family sharing functionality

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.000
as discoverable and engaging as possible.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.560
App Store Connect makes it
easy to turn on family sharing

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.220
for all of your customers.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.470
Consider including the functionality
in your onboarding flow to clearly

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.830
communicate the ability to share
your subscription with your

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.880
family members as part of the
overall service value proposition.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.670
It’s also possible to
offer Family Sharing as a

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.620
separate subscription tier.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.220
As you can see here,
the purchase flow clearly differentiates

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.110
between the available tiers and includes
a link out to the Family Sharing overview

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.170
page at the bottom of the screen.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.140
If you do choose to
offer Family Sharing as

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.140
a higher tier of service,
remember to group the higher

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.240
tier with the individual tier
or tiers in App Store Connect.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.390
This will allow you to offer
upgrade messaging such as the

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.750
in-app messaging shown here,
which highlights the value

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.990
of upgrading an individual
subscriber's plan to the family tier.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.190
After a new family subscriber
completes their purchase,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.650
consider marketing the functionality to
remind them to encourage their family

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.680
members to take advantage of the service,
as shown here on the left.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.750
On the right, you can see a message
for the family members,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.420
communicating that they now
have access to the subscription.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.100
In a little bit,
David will walk you through how to

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.490
recognize a family member and unlock
access seamlessly so they can start

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.860
enjoying your service right away.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.740
Here’s a live example from Night Sky.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.440
They’re offering Family Sharing to all
their customers on an existing SKU.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.890
On the left,
you can see how they’ve clearly

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.640
highlighted Family Sharing within
their signup flow and promote that

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.800
it��s available at no extra cost.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.150
And on the right,
you can see they’ve given the

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.630
feature a dedicated page within their
post-purchase subscriber onboarding

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.300
carousel that encourages new plan
owners to take advantage of the benefit.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.270
So let's quickly recap a few items
to keep in mind when reviewing

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.040
implementation plans with your team.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.370
First, consider the incremental value
family sharing could provide to

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.980
your in-app purchases and how you
could use the feature to bring

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.030
new subscribers to your service.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.900
Next, decide whether you'll enable family
sharing on a new or existing SKU.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.160
And finally,
work with your product growth and or

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:58.080
marketing teams to create merchandising
that helps you encourage new subscribers

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.380
and increase engagement with your
service through family sharing.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.020
I'll now hand it over to David to
discuss engineering and implementation.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.000
Thank you, Bryan.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:09.630
Hi, everyone.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.060
I’m Dave Wenlend on the
App Store Commerce team,

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.640
based in Cupertino.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.860
As a global technical advocate,
I have the opportunity today to

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.970
share with you some engineering
and implementation details

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.780
to consider when adopting
Family Sharing for in-app purchases.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.730
We have three sections to cover.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.280
We’ll start with enabling
Family Sharing per product

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.390
in App Store Connect.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.440
Then I’ll discuss how your
app will be able to entitle

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.140
service for our purchasers,
family members,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.920
and I’ll finish up with updates to
StoreKit and Server Notifications

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.240
for Family Sharing.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.580
So let’s begin with
enabling Family Sharing.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.920
So visit App Store Connect and navigate
to the subscription or non-consumable

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.940
product that you wish to enable.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.460
You’ll see a new section
labeled Family Sharing,

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.390
and to start, tap Turn On.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.040
A confirmation dialog will be shown.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.290
Once you tap confirm,
your product will be family shareable

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:08.350
for all your customers' new and
existing purchases within a few hours.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.910
Now we do want to emphasize that
once enabled for a given product,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.800
it cannot be reverted.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.420
Reason being is that customers
may have based their purchasing

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.730
decision on this functionality.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.740
Once enabled in App Store Connect,
StoreKit will now return the

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.640
property "Is Family Shareable" for
any products that you have enabled.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.470
As shown earlier by Bryan,
this allows you to dynamically

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:39.980
control family sharing specific
UI within your app on iOS 14 or later.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.850
Here’s sample code of how your
app could use the new property

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.400
in the SK Product Object.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.680
The Is Family Shareable property is a
simple Boolean allowing you to identify

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.350
and merchandise family shareable
products with custom UI or copy,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.400
just like the example Bryan showed
earlier with Night Sky.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.180
Now let’s dive deeper into
how Family Sharing works

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.000
for the family members.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.380
The great news is,
Family Sharing works the same way

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.400
your server and app are familiar with.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.470
Your app should already handle
these family transactions

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.180
without making any changes,
server-side or client-side.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.660
Because automatically,
family shareable purchases are

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.780
available to all members of the family.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.160
So when your application is launched,
you will see a transaction

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.520
in the payment queue,
just like a normal purchase.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.050
Thus allowing you to validate each
family member's app receipt for

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.180
access using their own Apple ID.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.590
With our assumption that
your app will work for family

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.360
members without any changes,
let’s review some key best practices

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.520
that ensures your application delivers
an optimal experience in all scenarios.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.280
To start,
it’s critical to initialize your

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.840
SK Payment Transaction Observer
at launch and keep it alive

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.560
while your application is active.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.510
This will ensure your application
never misses a transaction.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.190
This is also important for other
scenarios such as Ask to Buy,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.070
PSD2, or subscription offer codes
where a transaction may be

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.350
finalized outside of your app.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.950
Next, before merchandising any
product to your customers,

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.690
it is a best practice to ensure
you know the customer status first.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.090
By retrieving the app receipt
and validating it with our

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.770
verify receipt endpoint,
you can determine if they have past

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.850
purchases that you need to entitle or
if they are a new customer so you can

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.320
merchandise to them appropriately.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.060
With these two best practices,
you can reduce customer escalations,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.170
minimize refunds, and negative reviews,
ultimately improving the

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.370
overall customer experience.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.280
Now let’s illustrate what a new
purchase looks like for family

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.840
members and their devices.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.830
The purchaser initiates a
purchase on their device,

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.040
just like normal.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.160
As this product is family shareable,
transactions will be created

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.040
for each family member.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.520
If you are following our best practices,
your application will see these

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.400
new transactions upon launch or
in real time in the payment queue,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.310
in which you can validate and entitle
service like any other transaction.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.900
One thing to note,
we have implemented a delay for

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.380
the family transactions to allow
the purchaser time to disable

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.690
sharing if they so choose to.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.320
Let’s take the same illustration,
but for an existing

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.700
subscription purchase.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.480
As mentioned earlier,
for existing purchases,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.900
Family Sharing is not enabled by default.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.990
The purchaser would need to
enable Family Sharing from the

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.220
Manage Subscriptions page for
each existing subscription.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:47.680
Once enabled,
the transactions for each family member

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:47.680
would be created shortly thereafter.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.140
The App Receipt has received a new field:
In-App Ownership Type.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.640
This will allow you to distinguish
between the purchaser and family members.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.340
As Bryan shared earlier,
if your application wanted

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.570
to have a custom onboarding
experience for family members,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.820
this is something you could use.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.440
Or this could be helpful if you wanted
to identify a customer who has the

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.580
ability to manage the subscription.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.690
Then you’d use the type Purchased.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.430
The value can be found within
the transaction objects of

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.400
the Latest Receipt Info array.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.210
Next up, handling subscriber events.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.140
There are unique
scenarios to be aware of,

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.810
as there are times you may need to
revoke access from a family member,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.220
such as when the purchaser has
disabled Family Sharing completely,

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:36.290
or perhaps the purchaser has received
a refund for the subscription

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.250
or non-consumable product.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.750
Finally,
it may be the case that either the

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:45.260
family member or the purchaser is
no longer part of the family unit.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.760
To account for these scenarios,
we have some updates in iOS 14 and

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.060
to App Store Server Notifications.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.890
We’ve updated our StoreKit framework
with a new method called Did Revoke

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.680
Entitlements for Product Identifiers.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.920
This callback is a signal that
some entitlements may have

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.730
changed for this customer and
you should verify their status.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.180
In addition,
we’ve introduced a new server

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.100
notification type called Revoke.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.990
This real-time server-to-server
notification is exclusive

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.540
for family members.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.840
So when you receive
either of these callbacks,

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.290
it’s important to reestablish
the correct entitlements,

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.420
meaning it’s important to iterate
through the entire receipt,

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.360
as these customers may have
had multiple entitlements.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.480
So if one has been revoked,
there may be another transaction

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.000
entitling the customer.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:37.450
So by doing so, in those cases,
you would ensure no service interruption.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.890
Let’s briefly review the server
notification types we have

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.740
today and note which apply.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.940
Also, if you have not already added your
server endpoint in App Store Connect,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.840
you can do so at any time.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.420
Some do apply to all
in-app purchase types,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.400
and once enabled,
you will receive them for sandbox

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.520
and production transactions.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:02.260
Thus,
once your engineering schedule allows,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:02.710
you can take advantage of
them one type at a time.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.340
The first four notifications
do not apply to family members.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.770
As noted earlier,
the revoke notification is only sent for

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:15.020
family members for the scenarios covered,
but this does apply to

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.500
both non-consumaples and
auto-renewable subscriptions.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.690
Now,
the Did Fail to Renew and Did Recover

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.340
notifications are relevant for both.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.010
In these cases,
they are sent for each family member

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.420
and you will want to ensure you are
updating their status appropriately,

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.620
as the whole family enters and
exits the billing retry state.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.600
Additionally,
if you have Billing Grace Period enabled

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.240
in App Store Connect,
then these notifications would include

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.620
the Grace Period Expires Date field.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.550
The last four notifications will
be coming out later this year,

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.840
so be sure to follow
Apple Developer News for updates

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.060
at developer.apple.com/news.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.570
Until then,
you can use the in-app ownership

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.640
type to identify them and
leverage our Verify Receipt

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.300
endpoint to get the latest status,
to account for subscriber downgrades,

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:09.890
upgrades, renewals,
or customers disabling auto-renew.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.260
And here’s an update in Sales and Trends.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.280
With the subscription report,
you may have questions such as how many

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.040
paid subscriptions do I have by product,
or how many customers have access,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.280
including family members.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:28.100
You’ll see we’ve added a new subscribers
column to the subscription report.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.840
This additional column will provide
you the count of customers who

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.740
have access to the subscription,
including the primary subscriber

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.880
and the entitled family members.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.960
Note that this field is only
populated if the record represents

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.730
more than three active subscriptions.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:49.070
To close out, consider enabling
Family Sharing functionality with

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.000
either your new or existing products.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.010
Do clearly communicate family sharing
availability and the value proposition.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.450
And remember,
family sharing provides customer

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.500
privacy and reduces credential sharing.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.140
And lastly,
please follow our best practices by

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.730
initializing Transaction Observer on
App Launch and verify customer status

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.630
before merchandising your products.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.670
Thank you for watching and we can't wait
to see how you use Family Sharing for

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.920
in-app purchases to grow your business.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.070
For more information
about Family Sharing,

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.000
