WEBVTT

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.336
Jesse Wesson: Hi,
my name is Jesse,

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.805
and I'm an engineer
on the Xcode Cloud team.

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:06.573
Today, we're going to talk about
how to connect

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.542
your Xcode project
and source code

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:10.510
to Xcode Cloud using cloud

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.380
and self-hosted source code
management tools.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.416
We're going to start
by doing a brief intro

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.684
to source control management

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.520
and how it can help you
be more productive.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.222
Then we'll cover how Xcode Cloud

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.958
accesses and uses
your source code.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.828
We'll then focus on how to use
Xcode Cloud with a self-hosted

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:31.331
source code management tool
like GitHub Enterprise.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.566
We'll finish up by going over

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.836
some common
project maintenance steps.

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.338
Let's get started with a brief
intro to source control

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.108
and why you
may want to adopt it.

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.777
Continuous integration tools
like Xcode Cloud

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:47.014
and source control levels up
your development practices,

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:48.649
helping you
to take on the complexity

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.184
of feature development
and accelerate your delivery

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.520
of high-quality apps
to the App Store.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.855
Let's go over
a couple of ways

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:58.158
source control can help
your development work.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.328
One of the benefits is that it
tracks your changes over time,

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:04.731
so you can try something out,
but always go back

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.168
and restart
from a previous change.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.471
Source control can also help you
when you need to context switch.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:14.641
In this example, we're working
on our next major release,

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.009
but we just received
a bug report

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.011
that we want to address.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.380
Source control allows you
to easily go back

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.816
to your released version
and create a new branch

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.752
where you can make
the needed bug fix.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.655
Git is one of the most commonly
used source control systems

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.526
and is fully integrated
into Xcode and Xcode Cloud.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:34.361
Source control
management providers,

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.763
also known
as SCM providers,

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.933
have created great platforms
to host your Git repositories

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.169
and help you collaborate
with others.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:45.272
Xcode Cloud works with
the three main SCM providers:

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:48.275
BitBucket, GitHub, and GitLab.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.178
You can integrate Xcode Cloud
with these SCM providers

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:53.814
to create workflows
that respond to events,

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:55.749
like when you push changes
to a branch

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.218
or you create and update
a pull request.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.519
To learn more about this,

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:05.125
check out "Meet Xcode Cloud"
from WWDC21.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.728
Let's check out how Xcode Cloud
accesses and uses

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.963
your source code.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.733
Xcode Cloud was designed
with privacy and security

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.401
at its core.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.804
Your data is encrypted
in transit and at rest,

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.974
using industry-standard
strong encryption protocols.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.911
This includes the encryption
of all your build artifacts.

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:27.681
The foundation of Xcode Cloud's
privacy and security

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:29.850
is our ephemeral
build environments,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.754
which are protected by strong
and secure isolation boundaries.

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:36.156
For source access,
Xcode Cloud is using

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.192
secure HTTPS connections
to communicate

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:43.230
with your SCM providers,
which we'll go through next.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.967
Let's dig into how the Xcode
Cloud source code flow works.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.870
Every time a workflow runs
and your build is started,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.774
Xcode Cloud creates one of these
temporary environments.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.475
Before anything
can be started, though,

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.712
your source code is pulled down
to this temporary environment.

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:01.948
Xcode Cloud does this by
performing a git clone operation

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:06.787
using your remote repository
on the configured SCM host.

00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:08.855
Once this completes,
then the build action

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.658
can be started and any custom
CI scripts you've included

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:14.227
in your repository will be run.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:17.230
For more information on custom
CI scripts, check out

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.036
"Create Practical Workflows
in Xcode Cloud" from WWDC23.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.438
Now let's go through
how we connect

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:27.741
Xcode Cloud
to GitHub Enterprise.

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:29.643
Whether your project
is hosted in the cloud

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.912
or is self-hosted,
Xcode Cloud

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:33.647
will guide you
through the onboarding steps

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:36.149
to connect
to your source repository.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.684
This includes granting
Xcode Cloud

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:40.387
access to your SCM provider,

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.723
which takes just a couple of
clicks through these web pages.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.226
Self-hosted projects
need a bit more information,

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.962
which we'll detail next.

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.164
For this,
we're using GitHub Enterprise

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:54.067
to host the Backyard Birds app.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.902
You can get started
with onboarding

00:03:55.902 --> 00:04:00.574
by clicking on "Get Started"
in the Cloud tab.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.509
This will start
the onboarding dialog,

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.611
where you'll first be asked
to choose the app or framework

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.880
you want to connect.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.182
After we select
the Backyard Birds app,

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.152
we'll be given a chance
to customize our first workflow.

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:16.123
We're going to stick with the
default one for this example.

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.758
After choosing the workflow,
we'll need to grant access

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.228
to our project
on the SCM provider.

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:24.464
By clicking on Grant Access,
Xcode will open up

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:27.534
App Store Connect
in our web browser.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:28.935
In App Store Connect,

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.471
you'll be asked
which SCM provider you're using.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.607
Since we're using
GitHub Enterprise,

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.109
let's choose that one.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.611
It'll then take you
through the steps

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:41.882
to grant access
to your SCM provider.

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:43.650
In order for Xcode Cloud
to communicate

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.954
with self-hosted SCM providers,
some configuration is needed.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:51.358
The steps will vary
with each SCM provider.

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.260
As we're using GitHub
Enterprise,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.829
we need to install
the Xcode Cloud GitHub app

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:57.464
on our server.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.033
Oh, it looks like we hit
a connection issue.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.269
This can happen when your SCM
instance --

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.504
in this case
our GitHub Enterprise server --

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:08.041
is not accessible
to Xcode Cloud.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.010
In order for Xcode Cloud
to interact

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.345
with your SCM provider,
it needs to connect

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:17.050
using Secure HTTPS
over port 443.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.287
This means we need to update our
server and network configuration

00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:23.089
to allow connections
from the Apple-owned and managed

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.091
IP address range.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.028
Inbound HTTPS traffic
will be configurable

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:29.529
in the cloud provider settings

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.033
you're using to host
your SCM instance.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:35.468
The IP address ranges
are listed in our

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:40.407
"Requirements for using
Xcode Cloud documentation."

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:42.342
Once we've updated
those settings,

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.810
we can pick up where we left off

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.814
and authorize
the Xcode Cloud GitHub app.

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.549
We then need to pick
which repositories

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.751
Xcode Cloud
will have access to.

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.188
In this example,
we're choosing all repositories,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.657
and now we click Install.

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:58.925
Success!

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.927
Xcode Cloud is connected
to our self-hosted

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:03.263
GitHub Enterprise instance.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:06.166
And this is now reflected
in Xcode as well.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.368
We can now create
any number of workflows

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:12.539
to build, test,
and deploy our app.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.741
As long as your SCM provider
doesn't change,

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:16.843
you won't have to go through
these steps again.

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:19.746
However, as your project
grows and evolves,

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:22.382
you may need to change
where your source is hosted.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.583
There's a couple of steps needed

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:27.087
to help keep
Xcode Cloud connected.

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:28.989
In the case where
your whole project has moved

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:31.658
to a new SCM provider,
you can update

00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:35.161
the primary repository
for your product.

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:38.765
From the Settings page
for your Xcode Cloud product,

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.834
you can click on
the More Options button

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:44.137
and then click
Change URL.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.972
When changed from here,
this will update

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.974
all of your Xcode Cloud
workflows,

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:51.011
so we'll ask you
to confirm this.

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:54.814
You can then enter the new URL
for your source repository

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.050
and click Next.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.052
Your primary repository
is now set

00:06:59.052 --> 00:07:02.422
to this new source repository.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.125
Sometimes you may want to change
the source repository

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.927
for just one workflow.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.430
You can do this
from the Workflow Editor,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.365
which can be found
under the More button

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:14.501
on the Manage Workflows page.

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:18.505
From the Workflow Editor,
under Primary Repository,

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:22.175
you have the option to change it
for this specific workflow.

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:25.979
Here, you can enter the URL
of your new repository.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.914
And that's it!

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:30.583
With these couple of steps,
you can keep Xcode Cloud

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:34.354
connected to your project.

00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:37.257
Xcode Cloud and source control
are great partners

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:40.960
that help to accelerate your
delivery of high-quality apps.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.730
We went over how it connects
to GitHub Enterprise,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.899
but it also works great
with cloud-based

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:47.967
and self-hosted
source repositories

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.104
on BitBucket, GitHub,
and GitLab.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.206
When these tools are combined,
they can take work

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.675
off of your plate and allow you
to focus on the things

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:59.245
that are most important
to you and your customers.

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.481
Thanks and happy coding!
