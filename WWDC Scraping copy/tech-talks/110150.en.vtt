00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.537
Bryan Eisenstadt: Thank you
for joining today's session.

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:05.539
We're excited to provide you
with an update

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:07.407
to subscription offer codes

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:11.678
which brings custom code
functionality to the feature.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.082
I'm Bryan and I'm part of the
App Store Monetization team.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.017
Raul Basurto Rosenzweig: And
I'm Raul, a developer advocate

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.253
for the App Store Commerce team.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.555
Bryan: And together,
we're excited to share more

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:25.158
about custom offer codes.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.161
Let's jump into the first part
of the presentation.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:31.732
I'll start with a brief recap
of our offer codes feature,

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:36.703
then I'll walk through the new
capabilities of custom codes.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.940
I'll discuss some
suggested use cases,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.608
and I'll finish
with a walkthrough

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:45.812
of creating a custom code
campaign in App Store Connect.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.849
So let's get started.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:52.552
Today we're excited to discuss
a new custom code functionality

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:56.490
that has joined the existing
capability of offer codes.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.926
Before we dive into
this new function,

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:01.295
let's briefly discuss
what's been previously shared

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.065
about offer codes.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.335
As a refresher,
offer codes are a dynamic tool

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.704
that can help you
acquire, retain,

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:13.006
and win back subscribers.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.474
You can choose
to distribute them

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:17.678
across both your online
and offline channels.

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:22.783
And they can be served to new,
existing, and lapsed customers.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:26.153
Once distributed, there are
a few options you can choose

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:29.189
to ensure your customers can
seamlessly redeem their offers

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.525
and begin their subscriptions.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.593
At the end of the offer period,

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.663
the subscription autorenews
at the standard price,

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:42.769
unless the subscriber cancels
or turns off autorenewal.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:46.506
Offer codes are complementary
to our two other offer types --

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.875
intro and promotional offers --

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.278
but give you the choice
of added flexibility,

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.380
since offer codes
are the only offer type

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.784
that can be distributed
outside of your app.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.987
We launched offer codes in 2020

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:02.756
with the ability to create
unique, one-time-use,

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:05.592
alphanumeric codes that
are distributed to customers

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:09.196
on a one-to-one basis and
are redeemed in the App Store

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:13.066
or directly in your app
when using the StoreKit method.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.801
These codes are ideal
for instances

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.703
where access needs
to be restricted,

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:20.007
such as when bundling codes with
the purchase of a physical good

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:24.444
or when using codes to rectify
customer support issues.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.214
Now, let's discuss
the capabilities we've added

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:31.852
with the introduction
of custom codes.

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:34.788
Custom codes now enable you
to create and distribute

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.824
memorable custom codes
such as "NEWYEAR"

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.961
that can be redeemed
by multiple customers.

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:42.863
You're able to set
redemption limits

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:46.566
and choose whether or not
to set an expiration date.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:50.003
Custom codes offer a simple
distribution and redemption flow

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:54.808
that's ideal for campaigns
that require mass distribution.

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:58.211
As with one-time-use codes,
you can use custom codes

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:02.749
to create free, pay as you go,
and pay up front offers.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.420
You can create up to ten active
offers per subscription SKU

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.189
at any given time
and have the ability

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.760
to create batches
of between 500 to 25,000 codes,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.566
up to a maximum of 150,000
per app, per quarter.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.569
You're able to choose
each batch's expiration date,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.672
but expiration dates
are not required.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.375
Finally, redemption
is supported on iOS

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:33.613
and iPadOS 14.2 and later.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:36.650
The Apple UI handles
the full redemption experience

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.519
and automatically prompts users
to install your app

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.089
if they don't currently
have it downloaded.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.224
Customers can seamlessly
redeem a code

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.959
from within your app
when you use

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.996
thepresentCodeRedemptionSheet()
StoreKit method.

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.632
When choosing this flow,
we recommend adding

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.469
a Redeem Code button
to your app's paywall

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.406
to reduce customer friction,
like in this example here.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.275
After a customer taps
the custom Redeem button,

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.177
the system
automatically provides

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.947
a series of code
redemption screens,

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:10.250
the first being
the code input page.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.018
Once a customer types
in the code

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:15.922
and that code is valid,
the offer details pages shown.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.859
If for any reason
the code isn't valid,

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.361
the customer will see
a clear error message

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:26.366
explaining why the offer
is unavailable to them.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.803
If you would prefer to let Apple
handle the entire redemption,

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:31.771
custom codes
can also be redeemed

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.509
via a URL or QR code,
which deep links users

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.512
directly to the App Store
redemption flow.

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:40.514
Unlike one-time-use codes,

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.649
custom codes are not
manually redeemable

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.785
through the App Store
gift card redemption flow.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.054
Raul will discuss how
to recognize transactions

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:53.827
made outside of your app
later on in this presentation.

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:56.363
Here, I'd like to help you
visualize the differences

00:04:56.363 --> 00:05:00.267
and similarities of our
different types of offer codes.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.737
Custom codes enable you
to create uniquely named codes

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.673
that can be widely distributed,
and you have the option

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:11.144
to choose whether or not
to set an expiration date.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.514
Whereas one-time-use codes
are randomly generated,

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:18.118
alphanumeric codes
that can only be redeemed once.

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:20.420
One-time-use codes
automatically expire

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.756
six months from the date
they're created,

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:25.358
but you can choose to make
the expiration window smaller

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:28.728
if you prefer.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:31.198
And regardless of which
offer code you choose,

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:32.766
you're able to distribute
your codes

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.136
across your online
and offline channels.

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.738
You can create campaigns
targeted towards new,

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.308
existing, and lapsed customers,

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:45.645
and the Apple UI will handle a
seamless redemption experience.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:48.815
Finally, a code's discount
will automatically renew

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.686
at the standard
subscription price.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.755
Now, let's discuss some ways
that you can use custom codes

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:59.092
to support your campaigns.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.460
There are a number
of different ways

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.164
both custom and one-time-use
offer codes can be used,

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:06.366
and you have the flexibility
to distribute them

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.035
however you'd like.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.004
Codes can be distributed
as an add-on

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:13.573
where a subscription service
compliments a physical good

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:15.609
or service.

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:18.778
In your marketing channels --
both digital like email

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.747
or physical like billboards --

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:24.517
to acquire
or win back subscribers.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:29.889
In physical retail or at events,
including industry conferences.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.992
Distributed via
third-party partners

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.793
as part of comarketing campaigns

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:36.663
and partner
marketing initiatives.

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:39.866
Or by customer support teams
who might give a customer

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:43.403
a free or discounted period
in lieu of sending the customer

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:47.407
to AppleCare for a refund.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:50.577
But I'd like to dial into these
three categories, specifically,

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.213
to show how the added
functionality of custom codes

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:56.783
can help support
these use cases.

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.986
Custom codes add new flexibility
to distribute offer codes

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.856
in your digital
marketing channels.

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:05.125
For example,
you could consider running

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.427
a spring break
social media campaign

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:11.965
that includes the custom code in
the campaign copy "SPRING2022"

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:16.569
for 50 percent off
of your first month.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.339
Here's an example of how
that could look in execution,

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.574
using a hypothetical
music streaming app

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.843
that's promoting
a 50 percent discount

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:26.446
using the custom code
"100MUSIC"

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:31.484
on their annual plan
via a social media post.

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:34.621
Additionally, custom codes
make it easier than ever

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.991
to distribute codes on flyers
that are passed out at events

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:40.760
like industry conferences
or concerts.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.863
With this approach, you can
consider giving event attendees

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:46.933
a three-month, extended
free trial to your subscription

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.803
by printing the custom code
"THREEMONTHSFREE"

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:54.607
onto flyers that are handed out
at the event venue.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:57.677
In this example, the music
streaming app is offering

00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:00.747
an extended free trial
to music festival attendees

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:04.017
by printing the custom code
"MUSICFAN" onto flyers

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:07.220
that are handed out
at a concert venue.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.556
Alternatively,
this is how it might look

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:12.359
if 100 Music decided
to use a QR code

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:16.129
to direct users directly to the
redemption flow of the offer.

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:19.065
If the user doesn't already
have the app installed,

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:22.168
they'll first be prompted
to download it.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.171
And finally, custom codes
can be used to help amplify

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.507
your third-party
partnerships.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.643
For example, you can now have
social media influencers

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:34.781
or podcasters share custom codes
through their preferred medium

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.583
as a means
to increase awareness

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:39.386
of the discounted campaign
you're running.

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:41.354
And here's an example
of 100 Music

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.857
partnering with an influencer
to promote their product's

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.526
playlisting capabilities.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.396
The influencer promotes
the subscription and offers up

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:52.432
a 20 percent discount
on three months of service

00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:57.670
using the custom code
"JOHNNYSPLAYLIST."

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.040
Now that we know what custom
codes are and how they're used,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.309
I'll now walk through
how you can create them

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:06.146
in App Store Connect.

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:08.415
In order to set up
offer code campaigns,

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:11.184
you need to be assigned
as either the account holder,

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:14.454
admin, app manager, developer,

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:17.857
or marketing role
in App Store Connect.

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:22.529
Begin by clicking the plus mark
next to Custom Codes.

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:24.731
You'll then be prompted
to create and enter

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.600
your custom code.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.303
Custom codes may be
up to 64 characters

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:32.939
and may not include
special characters.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.508
Keep in mind that you won't
be able to edit the code

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:38.077
once you've created it.

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:40.947
Custom codes can't be used
for other offer campaigns

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.016
or subscriptions for your app.

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:46.119
To create a new campaign using
the custom code that's already

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:48.421
being used by a different offer,

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:52.492
you must first
deactivate the code.

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:54.794
You'll then select
a redemption limit,

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.696
which is the total
number of customers

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:59.799
that can redeem
this custom code.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:03.803
You can choose a limit of up
to 25,000 redemptions at a time,

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:06.739
but if you need more,
you can use the same custom code

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:09.409
multiple times
on the same offer.

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:15.248
Up to 150,000 redemptions
per app, per quarter.

00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:18.251
Next, you'll have the option
to choose an expiration date

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:22.489
to determine how long
the codes are valid.

00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:25.225
To create codes
with no expiration date,

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:27.760
you'll select
the No Expiration Date option

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.496
from the date picker.

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:32.031
If you choose to select
an expiration date,

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:35.034
note that codes will expire
at 12:00 a.m. Pacific time

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.836
on the chosen date.

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.571
Expiration dates
may not be edited

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:42.242
after the campaign is live.

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:47.280
Finally, click on Create
to activate your offer.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.316
You can have up to 10 offers
active at a time.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.785
Offers can't be edited
once they're live,

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:55.221
so you'll need to create
a new offer in the event

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:58.658
that changes to customer
eligibility are needed.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.661
As previously discussed,
codes can be used to create

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:06.065
redemption URLs that you can
share directly with users.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.401
When the user taps on the URL,

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:12.138
they're taken directly
to the offer redemption page.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.773
To create this URL,

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:17.277
simply copy the example link
from your offer details page,

00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:21.714
then add the custom code
to the end of the URL.

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:24.017
And that completes
our feature overview.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.485
I'll now hand it over to Raul

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:27.220
to discuss some
of the finer details

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.690
around engineering
your custom code campaigns.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.058
Raul: Thank you, Bryan.

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:34.127
Now I'm going to discuss
things for you to consider

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:36.763
when planning and implementing
offer codes into your products,

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:39.299
application,
and back-end systems.

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:41.501
I'm going to cover
this in three sections.

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:44.938
First, we'll review redemptions,

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:47.640
then dive into
offer configuration,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.477
and lastly, share some
StoreKit considerations.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:54.514
Let's start with redemptions.

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:58.751
Before diving into redemptions,
some restrictions to be aware of

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.853
is that subscribers are limited
to one redemption

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:02.855
per configured offer code.

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:05.892
These offers are uniquely
identifiable by the name added

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.394
when you set them up
in App Store Connect.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:11.764
Also, be aware that subscribers
cannot redeem an offer code

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:14.133
that will result
in a lower level

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:16.302
from their current
level of service.

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.638
It must be for
a higher-tiered SKU

00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:21.808
or the same SKU
they're already subscribed to.

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:23.676
Ideally, this is taken
into account

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:25.378
with your eligibility logic

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:28.314
when targeting subscribers
with an offer.

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.683
A great way for your subscribers
to redeem your codes

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:34.454
is through the in-app redemption
sheet that you saw earlier.

00:12:34.454 --> 00:12:36.756
This is the ideal experience
where subscribers will have

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.859
the ability to redeem an offer
directly in your app using

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.528
PresentCodeRedemptionSheet().

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:45.298
This will be the only scenario
where the redemption occurs

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:48.001
with your app actively
running in the foreground,

00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:51.004
as the sheet will open
right on top of your app.

00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:52.205
As a side note,

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.007
if you're displaying
codes within your app,

00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:56.376
it may be beneficial
to make it easy for subscribers

00:12:56.376 --> 00:12:59.112
to copy and paste the code.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.948
A second redemption
option is the redeem URL,

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:05.051
where you will prepopulate it
with a custom offer code.

00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:07.387
It is comprised of two values
to be aware of:

00:13:07.387 --> 00:13:10.189
the idea of your app
and the offer code.

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:12.558
This is a good option
if you also want to advertise

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:15.395
your offer code
through a QR code.

00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:19.332
As noted earlier, redemption
can occur outside of your app,

00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:23.403
so it's important you listen for
Transaction.Updates at launch.

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.172
This is a best practice and
important for other scenarios

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:30.009
like Ask to Buy,
PSD2, and offer codes.

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:31.511
So with proper initialization,

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.747
it ensures no transactions
are missed.

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:36.949
On the other side,
called the finish method,

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.952
as it removes transactions
from the queue and it tells us

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:42.889
the customer has received
their items or service.

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:45.224
Between these two,
when implemented correctly,

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:48.494
you will provide an optimal
customer experience.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:50.630
Now let's talk
about configuration.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.800
When configuring offer codes,
there is a choice to also allow

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.769
the redemption
of the introductory offer.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:59.038
I want to visualize
the subscriber experience

00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:01.674
for either setting
that you may choose.

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.509
Let's take a simple scenario.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:06.145
We have a standard
monthly subscription,

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:07.180
and we've configured it

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.184
with a one-week-free
introductory offer.

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.419
For a marketing campaign,
we have created a code

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:16.422
that offers free access
to our servers for one week.

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:18.991
Let's see what happens if we
do not allow the redemption

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:22.795
of both the intro offer
alongside the offer code.

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:24.964
When the subscriber
redeems their offer code,

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.667
the offer code goes
into effect immediately,

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:30.970
in this case, our one week free.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.206
After the offer period,
the subscription renews

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.775
at the regular price.

00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:37.643
Now, at some point
in the future,

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:40.446
the subscriber
may lapse or churn.

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:42.215
If they resubscribe,

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.318
since they are still eligible
for the introductory offer,

00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:49.055
they would then receive
their one-week free trial.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.357
So this configuration
just determines at what point

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:54.393
they will receive their
introductory offer.

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.596
This experience is just
something to keep in mind

00:14:56.596 --> 00:15:00.967
when creating offers for a given
group that you're targeting.

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:03.536
Now what happens
if you choose to allow both?

00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:06.239
Let's use that same
example scenario.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:09.442
This time, when the subscriber
redeems their offer code,

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:12.945
the intro offer
goes into effect first,

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:16.015
followed by
the offer code period,

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:19.852
and then subscription renews
at the regular price.

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:22.755
I hope this helps illustrate
and provides more clarity

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.858
on what the configuration means
from a subscriber's experience

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:28.995
and helps you determine when
you want to allow or not allow

00:15:28.995 --> 00:15:31.197
this redemption behavior.

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:33.933
Finally,
some StoreKit considerations.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.003
With the original StoreKit API
and StoreKit 2,

00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:39.672
you can see any redeemed offers
using the type

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:44.343
and identifier found with
the transaction or renewal info.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:47.180
Offer Codes are type three
and the identifier will contain

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.382
the unique string you added
in App Store Connect

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:52.485
for each of your
configured offers.

00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:54.854
If you have
a server-to-server setup,

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:57.323
you can get this information
using VerifyReceipt,

00:15:57.323 --> 00:16:01.460
App Store Server API, and
Server Notifications Version 2.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.863
Make sure you're parsing
the type OFFER_REDEEMED

00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:07.533
notifications with their
corresponding subtype.

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:10.670
In summary of today's session,
custom codes are now available

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.140
and can be used for campaigns
that require wide distribution.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.710
Test interrupted purchases and
your redemption code experience

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.879
by leveraging Sandbox.

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:21.614
Consider implementing
a redemption flow

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:25.117
within your app for the best
customer experience.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:27.253
Clearly communicate
offer details,

00:16:27.253 --> 00:16:29.956
eligibility requirements,
and how to redeem

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.992
in your communications,
including that customers

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.929
can only redeem
on iOS 14.2 or later.

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.431
If you're looking
for more information

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:40.933
or would like to reference
what we discussed today,

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:43.970
do visit our Developer website,
which is an excellent resource

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.873
that you can reference
at any time.

00:16:46.873 --> 00:16:49.642
With that, I'd like to conclude
today's presentation.

00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:51.644
We're very excited to launch
these new features

00:16:51.644 --> 00:16:53.946
and can't wait to see
what you do with them.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:56.949
Thank you.
