WEBVTT

00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:03.036
Hello, everyone,
and thanks for joining us today.

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:07.541
My name is Pranav, and I work on
the media quality team here at Apple.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:12.179
I'm very excited today
to talk about the Apple Pro Display XDR.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.016
In this talk, we are going to guide
app developers

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.951
as well as professional users

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.153
on how to work with this amazing display

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.155
and use it in the most recommended way.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.493
The Pro Display XDR is
a high-grade reference monitor.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:31.131
It's a 32-inch LCD display,
has over 20 million pixels,

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.333
and with a 6K resolution,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.703
this is the largest retina display
Apple has ever made.

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:41.141
It has a P3 wide color gamut
and supports true 10-bit color.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.745
The display can get as bright
as 1600 nits,

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:49.650
and it can even maintain 1000 nits
of full-screen luminance indefinitely.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.320
This makes it an ideal display
for all your HDR workflows.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.657
We have also built reference modes
into the display,

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:00.127
and all of these modes are calibrated
at the factory.

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:04.898
For you, this means you can now work on
a display which has a high color accuracy

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.936
and comes packed with features
for all your postproduction needs.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:13.674
We have built every element
on this display for pros.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.677
It is designed to support
professional workflows

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.247
such as video editing,
photography, color grading,

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:24.218
visual effects, 3D animation
and game development.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.855
Now, a few of the pro apps out there

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.858
have already been customized
to work with this display.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.993
And here you can see a few of them.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.398
As an example, Blackmagic Design
has enabled the support of EDR in Resolve.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.268
This has enabled Resolve to display

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:45.606
both extended range
and SDR content simultaneously.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:49.510
They have also added the ability to assign
unique color spaces

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:53.480
to the input footage, the timeline
working space and the output.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:57.017
And while Adobe Premiere Pro
and Foundry Nuke

00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:00.320
have already implemented
preliminary support for EDR,

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:03.590
full EDR support for these apps
will be coming soon.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.629
In this session, we want to help
other pro app developers

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.931
create and customize their own app,

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:13.934
making full use
of this display's capabilities.

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.805
At the same time,
we want to provide our pro users

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.575
with the best practices
on using this display

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:24.645
to ensure their workflows
are set up correctly.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:27.915
With that aim in mind,

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.750
here's what we'll cover today.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:34.254
We're going to start by understanding
what reference modes are

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.590
and learn about
the different characteristics

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:39.359
of reference modes
available on this display.

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:43.964
We'll then talk about
some of the key concepts

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:46.867
related to color management and EDR

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:50.270
which are crucial when developing
pro apps for this display.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.707
Next, for our pro users,

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:56.777
we will discuss some of
the recent features we have shipped

00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:59.646
and how these features
can make their workflows

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:01.849
both more capable and accurate.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.019
And finally, we'll show you
how you should measure

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:08.488
the front-of-screen response
of this display

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:12.159
and ensure that your content
is being rendered correctly

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:14.728
as you work in any of the reference modes.

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:17.331
So let's get started.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.767
Well, what are reference modes?

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:23.370
For each of the reference modes,

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:29.142
we have configured the luminance, color
and gamma response of the display itself,

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.045
so when you switch from
one reference mode to another,

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:36.316
the display changes its own behavior
to adapt to the particular workflow.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:40.387
And since each of these modes
are calibrated,

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:44.258
you can expect high color accuracy
for all your reference modes.

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.661
Now given this, a reference mode

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:51.932
is much more than simply plugging in
an ICC display profile.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.269
In fact, as you switch
between reference modes,

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.572
ICC profiles get automatically populated,

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.475
which helps the display
work in conjunction

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:04.178
with color management provided by macOS.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.180
And like with any color managed system,

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:10.083
your media surfaces need to be tagged
with color descriptors.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.152
And we'll discuss this in detail soon.

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:18.525
The display comes with several
built-in reference modes out of the box.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:21.094
And there are two categories
of reference modes.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.932
The first is Apple-designed modes,

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:29.136
which reflect the characteristics
of our internal Mac displays.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.472
So when you are in one of
the Apple-designed modes,

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.008
you will notice
dynamic adaptation features,

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:37.544
such as True Tone or auto brightness,

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.680
can be enabled or disabled.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:43.116
These adaptive technologies are great

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:48.021
because they facilitate viewing even in
a non-reference viewing environment.

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:50.958
However, professional users

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:54.428
who are authoring content
in a reference environment

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.563
would want to work in reference modes

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.733
where these dynamic features
are strictly disabled.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.438
For that, we have standards-based modes.

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:08.842
These have been designed to support
specific postproduction workflows

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.112
which are in alignment with
common industry specifications

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:16.583
and assume that you are working
in the reference viewing environment.

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.488
Viewing condition is extremely important
when using these modes.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:26.393
Typically most workflows require you
to work in a dim viewing environment.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:31.532
Let's look at a few of the most popular
reference modes in detail.

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:34.434
This is the HDTV video reference mode

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:39.640
built using the ITU BT.709
and BT.1886 recommendations.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.943
Now, while our display
can do up to 1600 nits

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.078
and a P3 wide color gamut,

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:49.516
you do not need all of it when
working in an SDR workflow.

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:51.652
So when you switch to this mode,

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:56.323
we intentionally restrict the peak
luminance of the display to 100 nits

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.027
and the color volume
to a Rec.709 color gamut.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.697
Also all dynamic controls are disabled,

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:07.768
and you should use this reference mode
in a dim viewing environment.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:12.072
Next let's check out
the HDR video reference mode.

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:15.175
Here we see a P3 wide color gamut

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:18.345
and a peak HDR luminance of 1000 nits.

00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:22.716
And you can have 1000 nits
of full-screen luminance indefinitely.

00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:26.653
For you, this means you can
now work on your HDR workflows

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.488
for as long as you want

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:33.227
and not worry about the patch size
or a huge drop in luminance over time.

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:37.497
In the pro display XDR reference mode,

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.267
we make full use of
the display's capabilities.

00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:44.438
Here we have an HDR
peak luminance of 1600 nits

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:47.107
for up to 39% of screen area.

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:51.411
And your SDR peak luminance
can be set up to 500 nits

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.247
using the brightness slider.

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:57.618
Also, all dynamic adaptation features
can be enabled,

00:06:57.684 --> 00:07:00.521
and HDR video content is tone mapped.

00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:05.726
Now, very often you would want
both your SDR and HDR assets

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.962
to be displayed simultaneously
on the same screen.

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:12.199
For example,
you might want to check your e-mail,

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.934
which is in SDR,

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.838
and also play a video
which might be in HDR.

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:21.208
To enable this, we have
come up with a unique way

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:25.479
of merging both SDR and HDR elements
into one.

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:28.215
And we'll discuss soon how we do that.

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:35.222
We will now talk about
a few important concepts to be aware of

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.891
when developing apps for this display.

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:41.328
To understand reference modes more,

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:44.798
we need to understand
the different pixel processing stages

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.733
in our media pipeline.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.635
Let me show you what happens

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:51.505
when we are in one of
the SDR reference modes.

00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:56.109
Our SDR video content is
decoded by core media

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.946
and tagged with the color descriptors
in the file.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:02.883
Next, both UI and SDR video

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.054
get mapped into a common
color representation for composition.

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.724
The composed interface is then mapped

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:14.161
to the display's transfer function
and color space

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:16.897
before sending it out to the pro display.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.602
When we are working in
an HDR reference mode,

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:25.439
such as the HDR video
or the pro display XDR mode,

00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:29.109
the Mac and the display
communicate over a PQ link.

00:08:29.176 --> 00:08:34.281
Again, SDR content and UI
is decoded to linear light

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.850
using the tagged color space and gamma.

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:41.188
HDR content is decoded to linear light

00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:45.158
using the PQ or HLG transfer function.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:48.962
All compositing is done in an EDR space.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.899
Let's discuss briefly what EDR is.

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:56.570
EDR stands for extended dynamic range,

00:08:56.637 --> 00:09:02.409
and it's our approach to simultaneously
represent SDR and HDR scenes

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:04.611
using extended range.

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:08.048
EDR is an SDR referred working space,

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:14.021
such that SDR content remains unchanged
in its logical 0-to-1 range

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:17.958
while EDR allows brighter values
above 1.0.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:23.130
The range above EDR 1.0,
typically referred to as headroom,

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:26.633
is generally reserved
to represent specular highlights

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.002
and emissive surfaces in the scene.

00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:33.907
Finally, the composited frame

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:37.911
is mapped to the display's color space
and PQ transfer function

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:39.313
and sent to the display.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:45.285
Now we have seen the different
reference modes behave differently

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:49.489
and make use of the color management
provided by macOS.

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:50.991
As a result of this,

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:54.661
it is extremely important
to tag your media content,

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:57.431
both images and videos, correctly.

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:01.101
This will ensure that the media data

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:03.704
gets interpreted correctly by macOS,

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.372
which is a color managed system.

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:09.610
For images, you would assign
a color profile to it,

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:13.514
and for videos, you would tag it
with standard color descriptors.

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:18.218
Let's look at the color descriptors
in a video file.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:21.989
You can use QuickTime Player's
Movie Inspector

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:25.526
to read the color tags
associated with the video file.

00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:29.897
The color primaries tag
specifies the mapping

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.766
from linear RGB to XYZ space.

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:35.836
The transfer function tag

00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.805
specifies the electrooptical
transfer function

00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:43.477
to convert nonlinear R'G'B' code words
to linear RGB space.

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:47.047
And finally, the Y'CbCr matrix

00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:52.119
specifies the mapping
between Y'CbCr and R'G'B' space.

00:10:52.553 --> 00:10:55.989
If you are using AVFoundation
to tag your content,

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:59.326
I recommend watching
this year's WWDC session

00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:01.261
on exporting HDR media.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.899
For reference modes on pro display XDR,

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:08.969
here's a table of
recommended color descriptors

00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:12.773
you should be using
when tagging your video files.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.144
These tags ensure that your content
gets interpreted correctly

00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.580
in the reference mode you are working in.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:24.218
Now, if your app
is using AVFoundation framework,

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.887
it will correctly identify
the reference mode

00:11:26.954 --> 00:11:29.456
and provide the necessary color management

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:31.692
required for each of the modes.

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:37.064
First, Y'CbCr code word in the source
gets decoded by core media

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.702
and converted to nonlinear R'G'B'
code word in source color space.

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:45.906
This is then mapped
to the preset's transfer function

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:47.241
and color space.

00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:52.012
The display can then use
the preset's characteristics

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.847
to linearize the input signal.

00:11:56.884 --> 00:12:00.721
If your app hardware uses
a custom video pipeline,

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:03.156
here are a few things that you need to do.

00:12:04.024 --> 00:12:09.196
First, you need to convert
code words in Y'CbCr space to R'G'B'

00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:13.600
using the NCLC tag
specified for the Y'CbCr matrix.

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.270
The R'G'B' code words

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:18.972
should then be linearized to niche value

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:20.641
and mapped into EDR.

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:23.944
This mapping into EDR should be done

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:29.349
such that EDR 1.0 is mapped
to reference white in the source.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.152
Pixels which are brighter
than reference white

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:35.889
can then be mapped
to EDR values greater than 1.0.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:40.727
The display pipeline then
takes care of mapping EDR

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:42.596
to preset's color space

00:12:42.663 --> 00:12:44.598
and feeding that to the display.

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.802
Now, based on the reference mode
the user is working in,

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:52.773
you will want to manage
the mapping to EDR differently.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.275
This will help you tailor
your app's behavior

00:12:55.342 --> 00:12:57.411
to take advantage of it.

00:12:57.477 --> 00:13:01.615
To correctly identify which reference mode
the user is working in,

00:13:01.682 --> 00:13:04.318
you can make use of the EDR parameters.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:08.055
Let's understand each of the three
headroom parameters.

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:12.559
Potential headroom tells you
the maximum headroom possible

00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:14.995
in the current display configuration.

00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:17.998
And it might vary from
one reference mode to another.

00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:22.402
For example, the HDR video reference mode

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:25.472
has a peak HDR luminance of 1000 nits

00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:28.775
and a peak SDR luminance of 100 nits.

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:32.980
This implies it has
a potential headroom of 10.0.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.449
The HDTV video mode,

00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:39.653
which has a peak SDR and HDR luminance
of 100 nits,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.689
has a potential headroom of 1.0.

00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:49.062
The headroom parameter can raise the
amount of headroom currently available,

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:53.233
and this can be less than or equal to
the potential headroom.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.703
Note that as brightness is increased
in a reference mode,

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.139
headroom can decrease.

00:13:59.206 --> 00:14:02.643
As an example, the Pro Display XDR preset

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:06.713
has a peak HDR luminance of 1600 nits.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.585
If the brightness slider is
set to an SDR peak of 200 nits,

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:13.720
the headroom is 8.0,

00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:16.490
while the potential headroom is still 16.

00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:21.628
Finally, reference headroom
is the amount of headroom

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:25.432
in which you can expect accurate
reproduction of requested luminance.

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:30.637
Reference headroom can be
less than or equal to the headroom value.

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:37.211
For example, in the HDR video
and the HDTV video reference modes,

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:39.112
we guarantee accurate reproduction

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:43.283
for up to 1000 nits and 100 nits,
respectively.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:48.455
Hence the reference headroom
is the same as headroom for these modes.

00:14:48.522 --> 00:14:52.092
For Apple-designed modes,
the reference headroom is zero.

00:14:53.927 --> 00:14:56.129
And here's how you can do it in code.

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:58.832
First, we create an NSScreen object

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.401
which points to
the Pro Display XDR screen.

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:03.637
Then, we can query

00:15:03.704 --> 00:15:07.841
the potentialHeadroom, headroom
and referenceHeadroom parameters.

00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:12.880
Now that your video pipeline is set up,

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:17.818
you would want to evaluate your app's
color performance for correctness.

00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:19.119
One way to do that

00:15:19.186 --> 00:15:22.956
is to measure the front-of-screen response
of the display

00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:26.760
using a measurement instrument
such as a spectroradiometer.

00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:30.864
Here's a flowchart
summarizing the different stages involved.

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.635
As we discussed previously,

00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:37.171
color management is performed in macOS

00:15:37.237 --> 00:15:41.008
to map the input signal to
the preset's color space.

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:45.112
The Pro Display XDR then
takes in the R'G'B' code words as input

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:47.147
and generates the light spectrum.

00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:52.886
A spectroradiometer can then be used
to measure the light output

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.689
to derive luminance
and chromaticity values.

00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:58.525
To help with this process,

00:15:58.592 --> 00:16:00.894
we have provided video test patterns

00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:04.865
which are available on
the AVFoundation developer web page.

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:08.769
These test patterns
are QuickTime movie files

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:12.439
tagged with the correct NCLC
and static metadata

00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:13.974
for HDR 10 files.

00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:18.612
And this includes a 21-step
luminance ramp,

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:22.616
100% amplitude color primaries
and color secondaries.

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:25.719
We have also included with it

00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:30.257
the reference luminance and
chromaticity values that you should expect

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:34.928
when these test patterns are displayed in
the reference mode they're designed for.

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:41.034
We will now talk about
deploying Pro Display XDR

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.170
and show how our pro users

00:16:43.237 --> 00:16:46.707
can make use of some of
the new features we have released

00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:51.278
to make their workflows
both more capable and more accurate.

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:57.417
So Pro Display XDR
is calibrated at the factory

00:16:57.484 --> 00:17:00.621
and is ready to be used out of the box.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:03.423
We also have a list of
built-in reference modes

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.727
which have been designed for
the most popular workflows.

00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:09.463
Together with these,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.033
we now also support
an array of customization options.

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:18.839
Let's start by talking about
customized reference modes.

00:17:20.974 --> 00:17:25.679
Now, although the display comes with
a list of reference modes built into it,

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:27.681
but what if your unique workflow,

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:31.118
it needs a different combination
of transfer function,

00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:33.187
white point and color gamut?

00:17:34.021 --> 00:17:37.991
Or if you want to use a different
maximum luminance target?

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:40.928
For that, we have
customized reference modes

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:45.432
available in macOS 10.15.4 and later.

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:47.267
With custom reference modes,

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:51.605
you can now customize these parameters
to create a unique reference mode.

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:56.276
Let me show you how we can create
a custom reference mode.

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:00.080
Let's imagine you need
to create a workflow

00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:03.250
with 600 nits of maximum HDR luminance.

00:18:03.317 --> 00:18:07.554
Also let's say you would like your UI
to be brighter than 100 nits.

00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:09.289
Maybe 200 nits.

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:12.826
You should first select Displays
from System Preferences.

00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:15.362
On the window title Pro Display XDR,

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:18.966
select Customize Presets
from the presets list.

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:22.970
Now choose a base preset

00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:25.939
from which you want to create
your custom preset.

00:18:27.674 --> 00:18:29.710
Next, click on the plus icon.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:35.782
Here you can name your preset
and edit the description.

00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:41.255
From the available options,
you can choose the color gamut,

00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:45.559
the white point
and the SDR transfer function.

00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:51.064
You can also explicitly apply
a system gamma boost.

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:58.071
Finally, we change
the maximum HDR luminance to 600 nits

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:01.742
and the maximum SDR luminance to 200 nits

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.610
and save the preset.

00:19:03.677 --> 00:19:07.147
We have now created
our unique custom reference mode.

00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:09.716
Let's look at the next feature.

00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:14.922
Now, very often measurement instruments
have slight differences

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.523
from one unit to another.

00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:20.127
And if all your workflows have been set up

00:19:20.194 --> 00:19:22.529
to work with your in-house instrument,

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:25.465
you may want to fine-tune
your Pro Display XDR

00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:27.835
to match with other displays.

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:33.240
For those of you who have access
to high-end calibrated spectroradiometers,

00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:37.344
you can now do this using
the fine-tune calibration feature.

00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:43.817
Fine-tune calibration is available
in macOS 10.15.6 and later.

00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:48.589
This feature allows you to adjust
your display's luminance and white point

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:52.559
so that it better aligns
with your in-house spectroradiometer

00:19:52.626 --> 00:19:55.128
and matches other monitors.

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:58.398
Let's see how we can use this
on Pro Display XDR.

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:05.072
First, we go to System Preferences
and choose Displays.

00:20:05.138 --> 00:20:07.441
In the preset list pop-up menu,

00:20:07.508 --> 00:20:10.677
we can see the Fine-Tune Calibration
option available.

00:20:12.412 --> 00:20:13.814
Here, we need to enter

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:17.985
our measured and target
luminance and white point values.

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.319
In the next section,

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.623
we will discuss in detail
how we can obtain these.

00:20:27.628 --> 00:20:30.330
Now we know that as content creators,

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:35.235
you want to make sure that your display
is behaving the way you expect it to.

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:36.670
So in this section,

00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:39.840
we will discuss how
you can objectively evaluate

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:42.309
that your content is being rendered
correctly.

00:20:43.877 --> 00:20:47.347
Here is a flowchart describing
our recommended process

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:51.285
for front-of-screen evaluation
when using the Pro Display XDR.

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:55.489
First, we need to create our test patterns

00:20:56.056 --> 00:20:59.059
and calculate
the reference values we expect

00:20:59.126 --> 00:21:02.663
when the test patterns are displayed
on a reference monitor

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:05.933
and measured
using a calibrated spectroradiometer.

00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:11.572
Then, we set up our measuring instrument
and the environment.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:14.708
For accurate results,

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:18.612
we recommend you use
high-end calibrated spectroradiometers

00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:20.380
while making measurements.

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:24.852
Here is a list of a few spectroradiometers
that we recommend using.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.891
Also, make sure your instrument
is configured correctly.

00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:36.663
For example, if you're using
a Photo Research PR-740 spectroradiometer,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:41.068
you might want to set your instrument's
bandwidth to four nanometers

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:44.838
and set the average number of readings
for each measurement

00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:46.640
to be three or higher.

00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:51.712
Your low luminance measurements
might get affected

00:21:51.778 --> 00:21:54.815
if stray light interferes
with your measurement.

00:21:55.616 --> 00:21:56.850
For best results,

00:21:56.917 --> 00:21:59.720
make sure your environment
is completely dark.

00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:03.190
And to avoid any thermal radiation,

00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:06.727
we recommend working in a room
with controlled temperature,

00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:09.396
typically less than 25 degrees Celsius.

00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:14.334
The next step is to display
the test patterns on screen

00:22:14.401 --> 00:22:15.936
and make measurements.

00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:21.175
Once you have the measurements
and reference values,

00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:24.011
you should perform an error analysis.

00:22:24.077 --> 00:22:28.081
Very high errors might indicate
an error in the process.

00:22:28.148 --> 00:22:31.919
This can be either your test patterns
aren't tagged correctly,

00:22:31.985 --> 00:22:34.388
your reference mode selection is incorrect

00:22:34.454 --> 00:22:37.824
or your instrument and environment
isn't set up properly.

00:22:38.926 --> 00:22:40.327
For error analysis,

00:22:40.394 --> 00:22:43.497
you should compute
perceptual color difference metrics

00:22:43.564 --> 00:22:46.366
to know how visible the differences are

00:22:46.433 --> 00:22:49.102
between the measured and reference values.

00:22:51.672 --> 00:22:56.410
In this example, I'm using a color
difference calculator we have built

00:22:56.476 --> 00:23:00.614
which computes several
perceptual color difference metrics.

00:23:00.681 --> 00:23:04.084
We will be providing you
with the sample code for this.

00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:08.722
The calculator takes in
reference and measured values

00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:14.461
and computes delta-E ITP, delta-E 2000
and delta PQ metrics.

00:23:16.663 --> 00:23:18.632
You can define your input signals

00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:22.369
from a list of color spaces,
color gamuts...

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.607
transfer functions and representations.

00:23:29.076 --> 00:23:33.080
Since our input signals are
spectroradiometer measurements,

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:35.749
we will select the Yxy color space.

00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:41.788
Next, we enter the reference luminance
and chromaticity values.

00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:47.628
And for this example,
we have chosen 94 nits, D65 as our target.

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:53.534
We then enter the measured luminance
and chromaticity values,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.336
which are slightly off the target,
as you can see.

00:23:57.304 --> 00:24:00.174
Finally, we compute the error metrics.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.778
We can repeat this process
for the entire 21-step luminance ramp

00:24:04.845 --> 00:24:07.948
to compute error metrics
for each measurement point.

00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:16.156
This is an example of a chart showing
delta-E ITP values for the entire ramp.

00:24:16.223 --> 00:24:20.194
And you can see that
the maximum error in this case

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.764
occurs for a target luminance
of around 94 nits.

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:29.169
Next, if the errors are
perceptually insignificant,

00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:31.071
we have validated our workflow.

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:36.443
But if the errors in luminance and
white point are perceptually significant,

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:40.080
we can improve those
using the fine-tune calibration feature.

00:24:44.218 --> 00:24:47.955
We will now use the maximum error case
to fine-tune our display.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.894
First we enter the measured white point
and luminance values.

00:24:55.629 --> 00:24:59.466
Then we enter the target white point
and luminance values.

00:25:00.968 --> 00:25:04.671
Finally, we can add a description
and hit "okay"

00:25:04.738 --> 00:25:07.040
to fine-tune the calibration
of our display.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.547
We have fine-tuned
the calibration of our display now.

00:25:13.614 --> 00:25:15.415
For a final validation,

00:25:15.482 --> 00:25:19.086
we'll make measurements
and perform an error analysis again.

00:25:22.623 --> 00:25:27.094
This is an example to show you
the improvement in delta-E ITP

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.330
that you might see
after fine-tune calibration.

00:25:30.397 --> 00:25:32.132
The entire luminance ramp

00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:36.270
will match your in-house spectroradiometer
much more closely now.

00:25:38.772 --> 00:25:40.607
We will soon be adding support

00:25:40.674 --> 00:25:43.810
for performing an in-field recalibration
of your display.

00:25:45.546 --> 00:25:49.349
With this feature, you will be able
to recalibrate your display

00:25:49.416 --> 00:25:52.119
for better alignment with your instrument.

00:25:52.753 --> 00:25:54.721
The calibration process will adjust

00:25:54.788 --> 00:25:58.959
your display's
color primaries, luminance and gamma

00:25:59.026 --> 00:26:03.864
and will require a high-end
spectroradiometer and a dark environment.

00:26:06.834 --> 00:26:08.802
And here's the process flowchart

00:26:08.869 --> 00:26:12.906
updated with in-field recalibration
added to the flow.

00:26:15.809 --> 00:26:17.611
Here are a few important things

00:26:17.678 --> 00:26:20.314
that we want you to take away
from this talk.

00:26:21.815 --> 00:26:24.084
Reference modes on Pro Display XDR

00:26:24.151 --> 00:26:27.521
are much more than using
an ICC display profile

00:26:27.588 --> 00:26:30.224
and provides a way
to configure the luminance,

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.294
color and gamma response
of the display itself.

00:26:34.361 --> 00:26:36.363
Using color management on Mac,

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.967
each reference mode supports
multiple media formats.

00:26:41.034 --> 00:26:44.071
You can either use
the AVFoundation framework

00:26:44.137 --> 00:26:47.241
or color manage your own video pipeline.

00:26:47.307 --> 00:26:49.476
With customized reference modes,

00:26:49.543 --> 00:26:54.548
now you can create your own reference mode
and work on your unique workflows.

00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:56.350
You can evaluate your workflow

00:26:56.416 --> 00:27:00.420
using Apple-provided
test patterns and reference values.

00:27:00.487 --> 00:27:05.659
And finally, you can use the in-field
recalibration and fine-tuning features

00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:10.330
to adjust your display's color primaries,
luminance and white point

00:27:10.397 --> 00:27:14.668
for better alignment
with your in-house measurement instrument.

00:27:14.735 --> 00:27:15.736
Thank you.
