WEBVTT

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.090
Hi everyone, I'm Seema

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.740
and I work on the App Store business management team.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.390
Today I'd like to talk about how to make the most

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.423
of your product page optimization efforts on the App Store.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.670
We've designed this presentation

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.010
for people familiar with the feature

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.900
who are hoping to continue to improve

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.053
their app or their game's performance across the App Store.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.290
This is a follow up to the previous session

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.203
titled Get Started with Product Page Optimization.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.950
If you've not used product page optimization,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.580
and are interested in learning more, we recommend watching

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.640
the Get Started with Product Page Optimization video

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.163
which is available on the Apple Developer website.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.850
Today we'll begin with the brief recap

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.403
of product page optimization on the App Store.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.390
Then we'll share some success stories

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.183
showcasing developers who have used the feature.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.950
Lastly, we'll share some key takeaways to keep in mind

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.023
as you continue to use this feature.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.200
Starting with a brief summary.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.580
Product page optimization is an App Store feature

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.900
that gives you the ability

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.630
to test up to three alternative treatments

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.243
against your original product page assets.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.313
So you can find out what resonates most with your audience.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.610
It gives you a data-driven way

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.720
to optimize your product page assets across the App Store

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.000
so you can learn what's most effective

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.650
at getting visitors to download

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.053
or re-download your app or your game.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.400
Treatments are shown to a percentage of people

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.120
across all traffic sources who are selected at random

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.713
in a privacy friendly way.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.370
People will see a particular treatment when they

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.360
browse the today, games, and apps tabs,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.243
or on the search tab in relevant search results.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.660
Additionally, people coming to the App Store

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.050
from external referral links such as social media posts

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.753
or paid advertising can see the treatments.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.120
So here's an overview of the feature.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.270
You can test your app icon, different screenshots,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.653
and app previews.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.660
You can create up to three treatments.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.190
You can choose the percentage of traffic

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.710
that'll see the treatments, and you can select

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.833
specific localizations in which to run your test.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.670
Now, as a part of a submission flow

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.820
specifically designed for this feature,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.370
you'll be able to submit your product page test assets

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.913
for review independent from the app binary.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.250
Now, as with any optimization feature, you need analytics

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.983
to help you understand the performance of each test.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.720
You can view your test progress in App Analytics,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.900
under the Product Page Optimization section.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.120
The Product Page Optimization dashboard

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.150
includes indicators to help guide your analysis

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.400
as your test progresses.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.040
These indicators tell you when a treatment is likely

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.000
performing better or worse than your original product page,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.253
with at least 90% confidence.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.610
Now, what do we mean by 90% confidence in a test result?

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.540
It means that if we ran the experiment 10 times

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.250
then at least 9 of those 10 would have a similar result.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.790
Meaning the difference between the baseline and the variant

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.953
is not due to random chance.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.370
We've developed a unique methodology that lets you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.190
continuously monitor your test while it's running

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.900
so you can identify exactly

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.843
when you've collected enough data to make a decision.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.143
You can also stop the test at any time.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.600
In summary, the Product Page Optimization dashboard

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.880
provides you with the information you need

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.190
to help you make data-driven decisions,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.463
and identify which treatment converts users the best.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.420
Now, it's important to note

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.430
that product page optimization testing

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.813
is not a one and done.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.323
It is an iterative ongoing process.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.173
So what do we mean by iterative?

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.680
It is improving your app's conversion rate

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.563
in the form of an ongoing optimization loop.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.700
Here are a few suggested steps to include

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.653
as a part of the optimization loop.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.793
Most testing efforts start with conducting research.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.000
For example, this could mean looking into

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.113
internal usage data, customer surveys, or market research.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.253
Next is creating a hypothesis.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.890
After conducting your research,

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.460
creating a hypothesis can help determine which test to run

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.933
and what to expect from it.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.670
Your research and hypothesis will inform

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.013
what assets you will create for the test.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.310
And once your assets are ready

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.290
you'll want to implement the test.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.570
At this point, you will upload your assets

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.273
into App Store Connect and submit for review.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.563
Next, it's time to analyze the results.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.220
As the test is running, and once complete,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.533
you can see the results in App Analytics.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.950
Based on the results you may decide to apply

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.960
one of the treatments to your product page

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.093
or keep the control as is.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.170
Use the results to inform next steps

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.733
and iterate from there on.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.810
Now, I'd like to note that these are recommended steps

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.360
and they might not apply to every testing scenario.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.530
For example, based on the results from one test

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.080
you might not need to research for the next one.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.060
You might choose to start with the hypothesis

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.113
and go from there.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.500
Keep this optimization loop in mind

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.490
and once you test, continue iterating on that test,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.133
in addition to creating new areas to test.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.080
Now let's take a look at some testing themes and examples

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.023
where developers have successfully leveraged this feature.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.320
We've seen developers test a variety of themes

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.050
when optimizing their product page assets.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.763
Here are the most common ones.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.270
Developers have tested various creative designs

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.790
or inclusion and exclusion of their brand

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.713
across their product page assets.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.460
As expected, testing seasonal content

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.903
is a common testing theme,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.900
where developers wanna see if seasonal assets

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.283
convert when relevant.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.440
Developers are also testing reordering their screenshots

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.623
to see which one converts better as their first screenshot.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.650
Another common testing type

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.550
is testing orientation of screenshots and app previews

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.870
to see if landscape or portrait converts users better.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.960
Developers are also learning from testing various callouts

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.900
on their screenshots, to see which callout or text

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.883
works better to convert users.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.130
Testing by asset type is also a common testing theme,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.460
where developers are testing to see if having an app preview

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.313
converts users higher than not having one.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.270
There are many more themes that developers are exploring.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.613
These are the most common ones we came across.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.620
From these themes, we will focus on the most popular ones

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.220
and share developer success stories for each today.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.670
The first success story is where a developer tested branding

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.520
through the design of their app icon.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.610
The second one is where a developer tested seasonal content

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.053
using their screenshots.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.040
And the third success story is a developer that tested

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.653
asset types like app previews.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.360
Starting with the success story from Peak Brain Training,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.513
a brain training app created by the developer PopReach.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.670
Peak Brain Training is a freemium educational app

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.070
that offers games designed to help you

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.893
expand your mental skills and challenge yourself.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.910
The developer PopReach decided to start with testing

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.393
their app icon to find out what creative converts best.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.990
Their hypothesis was that a robot character

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.093
would convert better than the control.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.620
In this case, they ran the test for 44 days with an average

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.123
of 154,000 impressions per treatment during the test.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.870
Now, the reason we included sharing the duration,

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.360
and the volume of impressions per treatment,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.720
is that when it comes to gaining insights from your test,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.640
the accuracy of those insights

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.003
is directly dependent on time and impressions.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.040
As much as there are many variables that impact a test

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.080
reaching statistical significance,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.923
volume of impressions and time play a major role.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.400
So here's what they tested.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.790
Starting with the control as you see here on the left.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.830
Next, you see the icon treatment

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.320
where the developer changed the background.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.280
Here you see the icon treatment with the design of a brain.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.700
And here is the icon treatment with the robots.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.250
If you remember this is the one the developer thought

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.640
would convert best as per their hypothesis.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.200
And here are the results.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.710
The icon with the brain performed better than the control,

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.243
with an 8% higher conversion rate and over 98% confidence.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.060
So the takeaways are across four variants testing confirmed

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.250
that the icon with the image of the brain

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.113
converted users the best.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.160
Results were different from the hypothesis,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.760
the robot icon performed worse than the control,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.740
which means that the developer was able to make

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.710
a data-driven decision informed by the results

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.293
from their product page optimization testing.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.960
After concluding the test,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.840
the developer applied the better performing icon

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.000
to their next app version.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.120
Although they did this once they ensured

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.843
the downstream performance of those users met their goals.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.710
The developer has plans to continue to iterate

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.450
and test additional assets

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.483
to inform their ongoing optimization efforts.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.580
Next up we have a success story from Angry Birds 2 by Rovio.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.870
Angry Birds 2 is a freemium game

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.970
in the puzzle action category,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.780
with an addictive slingshot mechanic, stunning graphics,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.443
challenging multi-stage levels, and scheming boss pigs.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.010
For their product page optimization test,

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.160
Rovio wanted to determine whether their seasonal creative

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.893
performed better than their evergreen creative.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.240
After doing some research, they came up with the hypothesis

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.030
that a screenshot featuring seasonal gameplay

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.263
would convert better.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.270
They ran the test for 20 days, during the month of December,

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.780
and saw an average of 2 million impressions per treatment

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.760
during the test.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.750
Here's what they tested, the first image is the control

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.020
where their evergreen art is their first screenshot.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.030
On the right is their treatment,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.980
where the first screenshot is different

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.203
and features holiday themed gameplay.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.790
As a reminder, this is the one

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.243
they thought would convert higher and here are the results.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.790
To their surprise,

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.880
the original product page with the Evergreen art

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.250
performed better than the seasonal creative

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.783
with a 1.5% higher conversion rate, and 100% confidence.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.300
While in this scenario,

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.810
this particular seasonal art did not perform better,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.120
we recommend that you test seasonal creative

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.330
for your app or game and let the data help decide

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.103
what works best for you.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.960
So the takeaways from this test are, across two variants

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.080
testing confirmed that the control, meaning the one

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.530
with the evergreen creative converted better.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.170
Results were different from the hypothesis.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.780
Now their hypothesis was informed by the fact

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.930
that seasonal assets have converted better for them

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.390
in other scenarios, but in this case,

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.580
the results were otherwise.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.880
Again, I would like to remind everyone that these results

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.120
are specific to this developer and this creative,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.340
and not to apply this as a general rule

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.500
for your app or your game.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.810
Important to note that in some cases

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.540
the control may perform better than the treatment,

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.370
which is a success.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.650
In this case the results from the test

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.550
inform the developer to keep their first screenshot as is,

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.080
which might not have been the case

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.510
considering their hypothesis.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.410
The Angry Birds 2 team has conducted many tests.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.560
As the marketing team works closely with the product team

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.410
to plan around their version release schedule.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.020
They make sure that they have assets prepared

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.330
and ready to go prior to release,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.363
so they can start testing immediately post-release.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.010
Our last success story is from Simply Piano

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.750
by the developer Simply.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.290
Simply Piano is a subscription app used by millions

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.510
that helps you learn how to play the piano

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.650
in a fast, fun way, with any piano, or any keyboard.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.840
For their product page optimization test

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.780
they wanted to determine if having an app preview

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.390
would convert users at a higher rate.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.150
They hypothesized the original product page

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.000
with an app preview would convert better.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.760
They ran the test for 12 days with an average

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.760
of 430,000 impressions per treatment during the test.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.960
Here you can see what they tested.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.880
The first image is the control,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.540
with the app preview which you can see playing here.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.700
This is the one that they thought would perform better

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.610
than the treatment as per their hypothesis.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.460
The image on the right shows their test treatment,

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.373
which includes a screenshot instead of an app preview.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.700
And here are the results.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.300
The treatment with the screenshot, meaning no app preview,

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.170
performed better, 3.3% higher conversion rate,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.570
and 100% confidence.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.150
In many cases, having an app preview

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.900
can have a very positive impact on your conversion.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.170
But in this case, the particular video that they tested

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.793
did not perform better.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.390
As mentioned before, what's great about

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.510
product page optimization is that it helps you determine

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.160
whether a particular asset

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.880
will improve your conversion rate with data.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.570
Now, when it comes to app previews, keep in mind,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.690
you can test up to three videos in the same test

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.930
to see which video might perform best.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.170
So the takeaways from this Simply Piano test are,

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.920
across two variants testing confirmed that the treatment,

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.880
meaning the one without the app preview, converted higher.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.130
Results were different from the hypothesis,

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.670
similar to what we saw with the Angry Birds 2 example.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.960
Their next steps is to continue to iterate and test again

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.450
as the findings were different than the hypothesis,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.773
which surprised them.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.440
So we're hoping that these examples

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.080
help inform your thinking as you implement

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.273
your product page optimization testing.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.630
Next, I'd like to share some key takeaways

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.920
for you to keep in mind

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.043
as you think through your ongoing optimization efforts.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.850
When planning and implementing your test

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.130
take an iterative approach.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.610
Revisit your assets over time to account for changes

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.730
in your audience, seasonality, et cetera.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.190
This will ensure you get the biggest impact

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.020
with your testing efforts.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.290
As you saw in our success story, sometimes the data proves

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.750
that the hypothesis can be incorrect.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.303
More the reason to iterate and test again.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.960
Limit the number of variables in the test

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.750
by testing a single asset at a time.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.970
This will ensure you can easily identify

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.510
what has brought the biggest impact to your conversion rate.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.120
We recommend running your test for at least one week

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.310
and in seven day increments.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.440
For instance, if your top users

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.410
are more active on the weekend and you start your test

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.140
on a Monday and run it for three days,

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.210
you're missing a key period of traffic

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.670
and your results won't be scalable.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.940
While testing, also aim for your treatment assets

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.970
to have notable and significant differences

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.920
in order to make an impact.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.990
If differences are minor or subtle

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.480
that could influence the amount of time it takes

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.180
for your test to reach confidence.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.700
You can see the results as the test progresses

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.840
to help you anticipate how long each test is likely to take.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.960
Now, if your team is okay with a lower confidence level

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.120
then you have the choice to stop the test

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.060
at the confidence level of your choosing.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.480
Here's some takeaways related to the submission process.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.610
When running optimization tests,

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.560
plan and coordinate closely

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.170
with the people responsible for the release schedules

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.560
to ensure tests have the most time and the best chance

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.110
to achieve necessary confidence.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.000
Product page optimization assets

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.480
can be submitted independent of the app release.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.360
With that, we recommend having your product page assets

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.170
ready to go for the next open window between app releases.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.510
This will ensure you can maximize the time

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.750
between app releases for testing.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.610
If you plan to test your app icon,

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.280
remember to submit any app icon assets

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.623
with the version of the binary being tested.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.680
To ensure a smooth submission process,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.810
be sure to follow the App Review Guidelines

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.973
before submitting your product page assets.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.440
And here are some additional considerations to keep in mind.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.450
Keep testing on the App Store

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.823
independent from any other platform.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.330
Avoid replicating alternative platform results

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.860
on the App Store.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.350
Apple and other platforms are diverse

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.780
with marked differences in user behavior,

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.150
and most importantly, user interface.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.010
Meaning that identical creatives

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.993
would not be seen the same way.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.860
Look out for external factors, like traffic mix,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.460
addition of a new campaign, weekly and seasonal changes,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.220
and keep these in mind as you assess and measure

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.813
the impact of your tests.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.320
So that's all I had for today.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.270
In closing, I'd like to share

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.150
that as a part of your optimization strategy,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.670
we highly encourage you to continue testing

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.650
to see what works and does not work

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.470
for your app or your game's audience.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.920
Have it be a simple test like reordering your screenshots

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.940
or something more complex like testing app previews.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.520
Keep at it to ensure you're maximizing

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.803
your app's presence on the App Store.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.460
If you're looking for more information or resources

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.350
about what we discussed today

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.290
you can visit the Apple Developer website.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.123
Thank you.
