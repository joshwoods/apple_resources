00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:03.703
Apple TV 4K takes
the living room experience

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:05.405
to a whole new level,

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:12.913
with support for 4K resolution,
P3 color, HDR video playback,

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:16.183
the incredible
A10X Fusion processor,

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.986
and the updated and improved
Siri Remote.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.855
Updating your app to
support these new features

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.191
is very straightforward.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:27.427
The first step is to
add a 2x launch image.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.264
Until you do so, tvOS
is going to run your app

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.198
in compatibility mode.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.869
While you're at it, you'll also
want to add 2x app icons

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.738
and top shelf images.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.542
When attached to
a 4K television,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.579
UIKit will now automatically
select retina assets

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.648
from your asset catalogue.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.786
You can inspect what screen
scale the device is running in

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.823
by inspecting the scale property
of the main UIScreen.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.092
You can also determine
the pixel resolution

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:03.030
of the attached display by using
the nativeBounds property.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.969
Just like the latest iOS
and macOS devices,

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.371
we're really excited
that Apple TV 4K

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.774
now supports P3 color.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.342
When providing retina assets,

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:17.277
you may also want to
update your assets

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:20.147
to take advantage of
this wider color space,

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:22.182
allowing your graphics
and images to contain

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:25.686
even richer and more saturated
colors than before.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.621
This isn't just for flat images

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:30.324
but is supported for
layered images as well.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.495
Media apps will also want to
look at updating their streams

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.764
to include 4K and HDR variants

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.435
for any content that was
produced in these formats.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:45.138
Apple TV 4K supports
both Dolby Vision and HDR10

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.407
for HDR content,

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.643
and the addition of support
for HEVC

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:52.779
enables these higher fidelity
and resolution streams

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.082
while consuming up to
40 percent less bandwidth

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:58.452
than comparable streams
encoded using H.264.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.989
The updated and improved
Siri Remote

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.158
now provides motion data
for attitude and rotation rate,

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.728
in addition to the values
for acceleration and gravity

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:10.030
that the prior version offered.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.967
To determine if
the paired remote

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.637
supports these new features,
you can inspect the new GCMotion

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.507
"hasAttitudeAndRotationRate"
property.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:22.709
The values for attitude
and rotation rate

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.279
are then provided by the
respective GCMotion properties.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:29.950
And with those few changes,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.818
you're going to be able to
take advantage

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:36.490
of all of the new capabilities
and performance of Apple TV 4K.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:42.796
