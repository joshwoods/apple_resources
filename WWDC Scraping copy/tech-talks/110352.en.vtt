00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.236
Hello, App Store developers.

00:00:02.236 --> 00:00:04.404
I'm Greg from
the App Store Review team.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.106
Today we're going to share
some best practices

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:09.042
for creating great apps
that do more for users

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.946
while collecting
less of their data.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.381
At Apple,
we believe that privacy

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.983
is a fundamental human right

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.151
and Apple products
are designed to protect privacy

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.623
and give users control
over their information.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.258
In addition to designing
our products

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:25.893
with privacy protections,

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.529
privacy is central in the
App Store Review Guidelines.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.799
Guideline 5.1.1 in particular
details some requirements

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.535
that are essential for
protecting users' information

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.872
in the Apple ecosystem.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.042
Improving your app's privacy
practices won't only help you

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.044
prevent issues in review,
though.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.914
Users prefer apps
that respect their privacy.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:49.316
So today we're going to share
three tips that will help you

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:54.454
build great apps that put users
in control of their data.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.690
Our first tip:
where possible,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.427
delay sign-in flows
or remove them altogether.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.696
Next, limit the data
your app requests

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.365
to only what is necessary.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.668
And last, be ready
with an alternative

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:10.604
when users decline
to share their data.

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.773
Along the way,
we'll share concrete examples

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:15.008
that'll help you get started.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.477
So let's start with signing in.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:21.848
Wherever possible, let users
enjoy your app without it.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:25.285
People prefer to go without
accounts where possible.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.521
They want to get
to the action quickly,

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:28.922
and forcing people to sign in

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:33.961
before they can do anything
useful can be discouraging.

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:37.364
To keep users engaged,
let them explore your app.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.033
Don't include a login if there's
no need for an account

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.370
or delay the login until
the app's account-based features

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.173
come into play.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:48.742
For example, a sporting goods
app might allow the public

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:50.544
to freely browse their products

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.180
until a user wants
to purchase an item.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.682
This allows users to enjoy
the app without sharing

00:01:55.682 --> 00:02:00.654
personal data until there's
a specific need for it.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:03.090
Our second tip is limit
the data you request

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.560
to just what your app needs.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.629
Data minimization is a pillar
of Apple's approach to privacy,

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.533
and we encourage app developers
like you to adopt it as well.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.701
Ask yourself,

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.771
what features do I want
to deliver to my app's users?

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:21.308
And then, what's the minimum
amount of data I need

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:24.845
to make this feature great?

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.680
By asking yourself
these questions

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.715
early in your
development process,

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:32.552
you won't end up asking
users for data you don't need.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.287
Let's see what this can
look like for users

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.590
in registration flows
when apps try to access

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.659
a protected resource.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.495
In registration flows,
we talked about

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:45.098
when it makes sense to ask
new users to register.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:50.203
Next, consider what data you ask
for in the registration flow.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:52.372
Information you request
should be essential

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.942
for your app to function,
or else, required by law.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:59.980
So let's look at an app that's
asking for more than they need.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.916
Here we have a registration page
for a shopping app.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.052
Looks like all fields
are required.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.454
Requiring the address makes
sense since they'll need it

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:08.955
to send me my orders,

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:11.525
but why would they need
to know my birthday

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.661
or whether I'm married or not?

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.363
Well, it turns out
this app has a feature

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.099
that sends coupons
to users on their birthday.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.068
While the coupons
might be a nice perk,

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:23.437
people can still enjoy
the main shopping functionality

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:27.140
without the app knowing
when they were born.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.776
But there are no features
tied to marital status,

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.412
so that should be
removed altogether.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.114
And since knowing
a user's date of birth

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.149
isn't essential
for the app to function,

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:40.187
it shouldn't require
all new users to provide it.

00:03:40.187 --> 00:03:45.092
Instead, this should be a
clearly labeled optional field.

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.494
Including a brief,
transparent description

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:49.162
of how the birth date
will be used

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:53.533
will also help people
make an informed choice.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.669
Similarly, be careful
when requesting

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.939
sensitive personal data like
health and financial information

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.475
or national ID numbers.

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.809
Only relevant app types

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.445
with a critical or legal need
for this information,

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:08.615
like medical or banking apps,
should ask for it

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.718
with a clear explanation
of how the data will be used

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:13.887
and stored.

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.655
After reviewing
your app's needs,

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.991
you might find that your app
actually doesn't need

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:21.328
much data from users
to authenticate their account.

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:25.031
In that case, instead of
a long registration process,

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.733
consider offering
Sign in with Apple

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.503
as a privacy-focused
alternative.

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:32.305
With Sign in with Apple,
users spend less time

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.608
filling out forms
or registering emails

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:39.045
and can quickly start enjoying
what your app has to offer.

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.549
In addition to registration,
many apps use device resources

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:46.086
which are protected by default
on Apple operating systems.

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:49.623
This means if you want to do
things like use the microphone,

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.691
communicate
with Bluetooth devices,

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.493
or use location services,

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:56.596
you'll need to ask
for the user's permission first.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:59.099
Our recommendation here
is the same:

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.401
only ask for what you need.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.703
This advice applies
to all protected resources

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.472
on Apple devices.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:08.441
Here are some more examples.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.810
Many apps offer an option
to select a photo

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.679
for a profile page.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.282
But if this is your app's
only use for Photos,

00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:16.483
you don't need to request access

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:19.786
to every photo
the user has ever taken.

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:23.723
Instead, a better fit for your
app's needs is photo picker,

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:25.825
so users can quickly select
the perfect photo

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.228
for their profile without
providing more access

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.530
than is required.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.165
Photo picker can
also be configured

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:37.237
for selecting multiple photos
or capturing photos and video.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.273
You may have
a chat messaging app

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.943
and are thinking about
requesting access to Contacts

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:47.480
to help people
connect with their friends.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.583
We have another idea for you.

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:51.585
Similar to photo picker,
you can configure

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.354
a view controller
for selecting contacts,

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.289
letting users select
the one or more contacts

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.593
they'd like to connect with.

00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:03.663
For some apps, only a few
features rely on location data.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.799
Rather than prompting
the location permission request

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.469
at launch, consider adding
a Share Current Location button

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.305
right in your app's experience.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:15.141
When people tap the button,
your app will receive access

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.645
to their location for that
session, just like Allow Once,

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:21.615
and will last until
they leave the app.

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.850
This gives people
a low-commitment option

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.287
when they use your app.

00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:30.423
Like other protected resources,
data in the Health app

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:34.394
can be accessed with the user's
permission through HealthKit.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.764
The Health app contains
sensitive, personal information

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:39.733
and your app should
have an appropriate reason

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.069
for trying to access this data.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.939
If your app doesn't have any
health or fitness features

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.774
that would require this data,

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:50.310
make sure your app doesn't
include the HealthKit framework

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.746
or any references to it.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:56.216
Otherwise, your app
may not pass review.

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:58.785
And don't forget
most permission requests

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.720
include a purpose string.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.423
Purpose strings are
short messages provided by you

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:04.991
in your app's info p-list

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:09.029
describing how your app
will use the requested data.

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.131
Writing clear purpose strings
helps users

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:13.700
make informed decisions.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.502
For more tips
on writing purpose strings,

00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:18.471
check out the links
associated with this video.

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.443
The main takeaway here is
to think critically

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.845
about what data
your app really needs

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:30.884
and, wherever you can,
build apps that require less.

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:33.853
This leads us to our third tip:

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:36.423
get creative with alternatives
that still provide

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:42.162
great experiences when users
decline to share their data.

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:44.097
People expect apps
to still function

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:48.168
when they decide
not to share their data.

00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:51.338
Apps that don't
create a poor user experience

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:55.375
and may not pass review.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:58.011
Anticipate that
some users will decline

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.780
to have their data collected.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.184
Others may be using devices
with parental controls activated

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:06.052
or other restricted
privacy settings

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:09.122
limiting access
to certain resources;

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:13.026
be ready with an alternative.

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:17.163
If someone prefers not to share
their location data,

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:23.169
let them manually input an
address or postal code instead.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:27.040
When people would rather not
take a photo of themselves,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.509
some apps let users
customize an avatar,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.511
giving their profiles
a personalized touch

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:35.882
without sharing more data
than they need to.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.284
Also, keep in mind,
if the user decides

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:41.421
to not grant permission
to access a protected resource,

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:44.357
it's important
to respect their decision.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.992
Don't include messages
in your app

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:49.829
asking them
to change their mind.

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:52.198
If they try to use a feature
that requires access

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:55.602
to a protected resource, though,
it can be appropriate

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:57.203
to include a message
letting them know

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.005
they can change
their permission choices

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:02.842
in the Settings app.

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.945
Those are our tips
for doing more with less data.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.147
Incorporating these practices

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:09.716
early in your development
process will not only help you

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.619
avoid delays in review,
your users will appreciate

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:16.189
the steps you've taken
to respect their privacy.

00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:18.024
We think these privacy
best practices

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.692
will help your app collect less

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:23.396
while delivering a satisfying,
