00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.630
Hi everyone, welcome to today's session on using

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.080
Game Center to boost discovery and engagement.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm Mischa and I'm the product manager for Game Center,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.590
I'm excited to share more about all the value that

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.440
Game Center can bring to your games.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
I'll start with an overview of what Game Center is

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.240
then share how easy it is to add Game Center to your game,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.120
I'll then share some of the key features of Game Center

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.420
and how they can help engage and attract players

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.970
followed by sharing a few additional features

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.400
and technologies that you can consider using

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.370
to take your game to the next level,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.463
let's start with an overview of what Game Center is.

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.810
Game Center is Apple's social gaming network

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.960
designed to help players experience the joy of games

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.700
with their friends.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.310
With Game Center players can see what games

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.010
their friends are playing and easily play with them

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.650
across their Apple devices.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.130
With Game Center, every player has a profile that they can

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.250
customize with a nickname and avatar.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.040
From a profile, people can see which achievements

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.331
that player has unlocked as well as their friends

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:15.660
and games they've recently played and since friends

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.660
are such an important part of enjoying games,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.860
we've made it easy for players to connect and play together.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.220
Players may also see friend suggestions and add friends

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.150
to be able to quickly invite them to games compare scores,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.290
and see what games they're playing and with Activity

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.230
Game Center brings together all the fun things

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.500
a player and their friends are doing, like when a friend

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.890
starts playing a new game unlocks achievements

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.440
or ranks up on a leaderboard.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.020
One of the best places for players to see all

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.430
their Game Center activity is the Game Center dashboard,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.610
here players can see their own activity as well

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.100
as their friends activity so they can keep up

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.250
with the latest and discover new games their friends

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.093
are playing.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.200
They can tap on any of these activities to easily jump

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.890
into the games their friends are playing, players can access

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.130
the dashboard in several different ways such as from

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.130
access points within your game, but the dashboard

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.313
isn't the only place where players can see their

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:21.360
friends activity.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.510
Another way players can view activity is with Game Center

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.380
widgets, players can add Game Center widgets to their device

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.690
home screen to see what their friends are playing

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.610
at a glance.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.340
This gives players an easy way to stay in the loop

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.070
on their friend's activity without having to open

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.307
any additional apps or games and like the dashboard,

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:45.600
they can tap on any activity to download or start

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.400
playing that game.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.370
Game Center will also send players notifications

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.700
about friend activity like when a friend has challenged them

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.360
in a game or passed their score on a leaderboard,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.880
even if it's a game they haven't played in a while

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.000
players will be notified so they won't miss an opportunity

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.703
to jump back in and get a higher score.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.020
And finally, all of this activity appears across

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.650
the app store, including Game Center and Friends Are Playing

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.280
sections as well as on your product page.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.040
This allows players to see what their friends are playing

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.650
right at the moment when they're looking for a new game

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.180
to download.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.330
When you add Game Center to your game your game can appear

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.690
in all of these places giving players more ways

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.453
to discover and download your game,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.850
so how can you add Game Center to your game?

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.540
You can get started in just a few simple steps.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.970
First, you'll need to enable Game Center in

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.260
App Store Connect with just a few clicks, then add the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.004
Game Center capability in Xcode and lastly,

00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:56.370
add a few lines of code in your game to import game kit

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.390
and start using the Game Kit APIs, let's walk through

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.440
what this looks like.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.150
To enable Game Center in App Store Connect, you'll go to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.150
the My Apps section, then select your game, then make sure

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.640
the app version you want to add Game Center too

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.150
is selected in the sidebar, once you've done that,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.700
you'll scroll down the page to select the

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.533
Game Center checkbox.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.740
Next, you'll add the Game Center capability to your

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.240
Xcode project, you can do this by going to Xcode

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.850
and double clicking the Game Center capability

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.743
or dragging it into your project.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.270
Then all that's left to do is just add a couple lines

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.780
of code to sign the player into Game Center allowing them

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.083
to use Game Center features when they start up your game.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.540
When you enable Game Center players are automatically signed

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.420
into Game Center upon launching your game,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.540
they'll also see a welcome banner which lets them know

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.540
they can start enjoying the Game Center features available

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.443
in your game.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.780
And also, as we've shown by just enabling Game Center

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.140
your game will automatically appear across all the places

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.860
we mentioned, helping to boost discovery of your game

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.820
and bring players and their friends in on the fun.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.520
Now that we've reviewed what Game Center is how

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.220
to get started and the value it brings to you

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.010
and your players, let's look at some key features

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.950
Game Center offers and how you can use them to drive

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.103
additional discovery and engagement for your game.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.650
In this section, we'll share how you can use Game Center

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.490
key features of identity, achievements, leaderboards

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.270
and multi-player functionality to deepen player engagement

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.190
and further boost discovery, let's take a quick look

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.610
at how Game Center identity works and what you can

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.443
do with it.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.980
As we've shared Game Center lets players build

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.820
a consistent identity across games they're playing.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.210
This identity starts with their profile and allows them

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.179
to share their gaming activity with their friends.

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:16.080
By simply adding Game Center to your game you'll unlock

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.110
all of this functionality for players and allow

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.870
for greater discovery of your game.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.090
You'll also have the option to build more

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.270
personalized experiences on top of this Game Center

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.493
identity in a few different ways.

00:06:31.686 --> 00:06:34.620
For example, you can add an access point to your game

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.860
which displays a player's Game Center avatar,

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.130
players can tap the access point to easily access

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.980
any other game center features your game supports,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.593
like viewing their leaderboards or achievements.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.930
When the access point initially appears you have the option

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.840
of showing highlights such as the number of achievements

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.900
the player has unlocked or their leaderboard ranking,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.000
which provides players with quick insight

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.160
into their progress.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.710
After showing any highlights the access point

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.710
collapses to display their avatar and by implementing

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.440
Game Center, you'll have access to players nicknames

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.040
and avatars so you can integrate these directly into

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.360
your game.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.390
For example, you could display a player's avatar

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.870
within your game during multiplayer matches,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.290
you could also consider using a player's nickname and avatar

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.253
as defaults to speed up their onboarding experience.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.990
Game Center identity also allows you to save a player's

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.230
game state, so their progress will be synced to all

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.100
their devices, new or old, letting them pick right back up

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.303
where they left off.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.320
Next, let's talk about achievements, achievements are

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.050
special milestones that let players know when

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.250
they've successfully reached a particular goal in your game,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.200
players can track their progress toward

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.020
different achievements as well as share their progress

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.370
with friends.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.210
Achievements are great for motivating players to keep going

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.320
and more deeply engaged with your game and they're great

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.103
for Completists who want to collect and complete them all.

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:22.770
You can create three types of achievements in your game

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.040
each of which displays differently to players,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.070
standard achievements require players to meet the

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.940
outlined criteria such as completing a particular level,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.470
these appear as locked until a player meets that criteria.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.190
Progressive achievements show players their gradual progress

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.040
and how close they are to completing and unlocking

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.830
an achievement, this type of achievement can be

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.640
especially helpful at motivating players to keep going

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.940
since they can easily see their progress.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.030
An example of a progressive achievement could be defeating

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.630
a certain number of enemies or collecting a certain amount

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.983
of precious minerals.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.630
And finally, hidden achievements conceal the details

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.630
until the moment the player has reached and unlocked

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.800
that goal.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.050
Hidden achievements can be helpful at preventing

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.350
any spoilers in your storyline or gameplay,

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.295
such as a surprise or moment of delight that you want

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:22.170
to preserve for the player until they discover

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.223
it in your game.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.180
Players can see their number of completed achievements

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.660
on their profile to get a sense of what they've accomplished

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.230
in their games and they can tap to view more detail

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.690
on their achievements to see which achievements

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.290
they've completed those in progress and those that are

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.373
still locked.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.660
This helps players track their progress and encourages

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.220
them to jump back into your game and if you've created

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.940
any progressive achievements players can see their progress

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.210
towards unlocking them and will let them know when they're

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.930
close to completing an achievement to give them an extra bit

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.103
of motivation.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.940
When players earn an achievement you can give them

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.210
a celebratory moment by displaying a notification

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.750
within your game, you can do this by having your game call

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.383
game kit to display the achievement completion banner.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.540
Players can see achievement activity appear across

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.560
their device, including on their dashboard, Game Center

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.790
widgets and on the app store, so anytime a player unlocks

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.820
a new achievement in your game their friends will see

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.240
this activity and get inspired to play your game as well

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.403
and unlock their own achievements.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.890
To add achievements to your game, go to App Store Connect

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.540
and select your game and version, then select the services

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.040
tab, scroll down to the achievement section and click

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.953
the plus icon to add your achievements.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.870
Here you can set up your achievements and input the required

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.400
information including the achievement name and description,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.360
point value, whether or not they're hidden and whether the

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.093
achievement can be completed more than once.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.790
And that's achievements a great way for players to track

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.490
their progress and share their accomplishments

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.663
with their friends.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:28.310
Next, let's look at leaderboards, with Leaderboards players

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.250
can participate in competitions within your game

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.430
and challenge other players to beat their score.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.540
Encouraging deeper engagement with your game, you can set

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.500
up leaderboards in your game for various levels or modes.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.830
For example, in our game the Coast we've created

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.733
six leaderboards, one for each map level in the game.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.410
Leaderboards show how many points a player has earned

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.740
throughout their gameplay and how they rank among

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.220
their friends, players can see when a friend passes them

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.160
on a leaderboard, as well as how many points they need

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.880
to beat their friends score motivating them to jump back

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.250
into your game and pass them.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.670
As we've shown, players also receive notifications

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.940
about leaderboard activity adding more motivation

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.900
to return and reclaim their rank and by tapping the global

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.050
view on the leaderboard players can see how they rank

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.530
among other players from around the world.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.680
To enable these experiences, all you have to do is

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.790
use Game Kit to send score data from your game.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.970
When you do this Game Center stores and displays those

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.890
scores in the Game Center interface or you can use Game Kit

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.790
to send and store data and display leaderboards within

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.983
your own custom interface.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.810
When you send score data players will see their leaderboard

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.200
activity appear across their device, such as

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.290
on their dashboard on any Game Center widgets they've added

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.410
to their device and on the App Store.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.590
This can help players feel challenged and encourage them

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.560
to engage more deeply in your game, whether it's to

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.860
beat their own best score or climb the leaderboard

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.374
and beat a friend score and with notifications,

00:13:17.374 --> 00:13:21.870
leaderboards are a great way to keep active players engaged

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.080
as well as bring back people who may not have recently

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.223
played motivating them to return and reclaim their rank.

You'll choose which type of leaderboard you'd like

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.640
to create, classic or recurring and then add the necessary

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.640
