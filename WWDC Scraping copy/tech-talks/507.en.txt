The VideoSubscriberAccount framework is a native app framework that facilitates passing the authentication token between the authentication context and your app. The VideoSubscriberAccount framework is a client-side framework that is built into your app. Because it is built into a native app, it requires native iOS and tvOS development. To get access to this framework, add this specific entitlement to your entitlements file. You will need to update your provisioning profile to include this extended entitlement. This updated profile should replace the original one in your app's project.

Once your app has access to the framework and integrates with it, it's important to remember that because there is authentication at two different points on the device -- system level and app level -- that those two authentication states need to be synced visually. As a result, there are user experience implications when integrating with the framework. To fully be integrated with it technically and visually, your app needs to handle all these syncing cases on both a cold and warm start successfully. First, check if the customer has granted access to use the framework. If the customer has not granted access, request it.

Once the customer has granted access to the VideoSubscriberAccount framework, check the system level authentication status using a VSAccountMetadataRequest. If the customer is not authenticated at the system level, request this authentication. Next you need to present a view controller containing the authentication UI to the customer. This view controller is created by the framework and is passed to the VSAccountManager presentViewController delegate method.

Finally, request app-level authentication with a verification token in the metadata request. After fully integrating with the framework, the application will go through an additional QA review before formal app review. In summary, the VideoSubscriberAccount framework exists so your app can talk to the authentication context and a video subscriber can be authenticated. Thank you.
