00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:04.071
Savannah Wu: Hello.
Thank you all for joining

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:07.841
today's session
on custom product pages.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.544
First, let's introduce
ourselves.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:14.781
I'm Savannah from the App Store
Games Business Management team

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.516
Michelle Van Regenmorter:
And I'm Michelle

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.852
with the App Store Connect
Operations team.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.754
Together with my colleague
Savannah,

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:26.059
we're excited to share more
about custom product pages.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.561
Savannah: Today,
I'll be giving you

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.464
a brief overview
of this feature.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.666
Michelle will take you through
the feature setup

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.535
within App Store Connect.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.572
And I'll introduce the
considerations and strategies

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.376
to help you make the most
out of this feature.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:46.246
Let's get started
with the feature overview.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:49.016
Your product page
is the home for your app.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.285
It's where people learn
all about your app

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.153
before they decide
to download it,

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:55.822
and the destination for people
finding your app

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:59.159
via browse, search,
or referral.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.029
Referral audience can be people
who land on your page

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:05.365
from any external links
such as social posts

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.001
or paid advertising.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.537
We're excited to share
the custom product pages

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:14.007
as the first feature to
customize your store content

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:18.245
specific to your referral
audience.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.615
Since this feature is designed
for referral traffic,

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:26.353
let's first take a look
at the current user journey.

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:29.156
People can come from
lots of referral sources,

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.224
including paid marketing
channels,

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:35.362
organic social posts,
email campaigns, and more.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.765
These sources might have
different optimization levers

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.600
or intended audiences

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.072
based on things like interests
or customer status.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.307
It's common practice
to show your audience

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.242
different acquisition assets

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:52.312
highlighting various
selling points of your app.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:55.615
For example, you can see an ad
for the Mountain Climber app

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.652
on the social platforms.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.887
Once the users click on the ads,

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:06.226
previously they all landed on
the same default product page.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.562
Now with the custom
product pages,

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:12.966
you can create up to 35
variations of the product page

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.235
to highlight your app's
rich content

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:19.439
and engaging features
for different audiences.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.241
For an app
like Mountain Climber,

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.843
you could create one page

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:25.245
to highlight
the live-streaming feature

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:30.050
for users interested in
following climbers in real time

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.219
and create another
custom product page

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.022
to highlight
the GPS tracking feature,

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:36.690
which might appeal
to people

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.861
interested in planning
a group climb with friends.

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:44.364
You have the flexibility
to customize the screenshots,

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:47.267
app preview videos,
and promotional text

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:50.537
in each of the custom page.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:52.706
With the customized
product page,

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:55.842
you may have a more
streamlined user journey.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.812
Taking the GPS tracking
as an example,

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.714
you can have the same audience,

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:03.483
or preferably
a tailored audience

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:07.154
that is interested in climbing
with a group of friends.

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:10.123
Your audience would see
the GPS tracking feature

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.392
in your ads.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.561
And when they land on the store,
they will see

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:18.498
the relevant GPS tracking
content on their product page,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.736
making it a smoother
user experience.

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:26.006
To make it more valuable
for your own marketing efforts,

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:30.077
each page gets its own unique
URL that can be used

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:33.713
in your corresponding
marketing materials.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.683
And you have the flexibility
to customize your page

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:40.253
for specific localizations.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.923
To recap the benefits
of this feature,

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:45.559
you're able to customize
your product page

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:50.497
with content that is more
relevant to specific audiences.

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:53.033
This can lead
to increased store conversion

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:57.704
and improved efficiency
in your marketing campaigns.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.172
With the unique URL,

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:03.009
you will be able to access
analytics for each custom page

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.244
to help you understand

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:09.349
how effective each page is
at driving conversions.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.385
There's a new submission flow
designed for this feature,

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:15.689
which allows you to submit
the custom product page metadata

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.160
independent of the app binary
in the App Store Connect.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.362
Now I'll pass it over
to Michelle

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:26.700
to walk you through the feature
setup in App Store Connect.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.336
Michelle: Thanks, Savannah.
Let's walk through how to set up

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:33.673
custom product pages
in App Store Connect.

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.575
We'll start by navigating
to our app record

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:37.944
in App Store Connect.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.148
Click on Custom Product Pages
on the left navigation,

00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:43.783
under the Features subsection.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.988
And then click on the Create
Custom Product Page button.

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:52.092
Here, you'll start by providing
a reference name for your page.

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:53.393
This is how
you'll identify the page

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:57.063
in App Store Connect
going forward.

00:04:57.063 --> 00:05:00.400
We'll call this page
"Livestream."

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.202
Then you'll want
to click on the field below

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:06.306
to choose a product page
to start with.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.275
You can choose to start
your custom product page off

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:11.645
as a completely blank page,
or you can choose to copy

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:14.080
from your existing
app version product pages

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.050
or any other
custom product pages.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.654
In this example, we'll start
with the version 3.1 page,

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:25.091
which is currently live
in the App Store.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.562
Then click Create.

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:31.464
This will create your draft
of the custom product page,

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.000
which will start off with
the same screenshots,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.536
preview videos,
and promotional text

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:39.439
as the version you chose
to start off with.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.575
In this case,
the assets and metadata

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:45.178
are from version 3.1.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.314
Please note that you can also
see the unique URL

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:50.050
assigned to this page.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.485
In this example,
we'll add a new preview video

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:55.121
to show the live streaming
feature for this app.

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:58.458
And then we'll click
Add for Review.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.228
Here, you'll see a submission
confirmation screen,

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:04.197
showing the app version
that will be used for review

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.633
and the items
that will be reviewed.

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.803
You could choose to add
other items to this submission,

00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:10.770
but for this example,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.176
we'll click to submit
just this custom product page.

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:20.680
And with that, your test
will be submitted to App Review.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.983
Going back to the
Custom Product Pages screen,

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:24.985
you'd see your new
custom product page

00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:28.822
in the In Review state.

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:30.423
Once approved by App Review,

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.892
the page will automatically move
to the Approved state,

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:36.563
at which point
the page will be viewable.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:41.534
You can click on View Analytics
to view metrics.

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.003
You will be taken
to App Analytics,

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:45.505
which will let you view metrics
about your product page

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:49.509
including product page views,
total downloads,

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.245
and conversion rate;
as well as proceeds metrics

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.681
like average proceeds
per paying user;

00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.817
as well as average retention,
sessions,

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:03.056
and total downloads by territory
and source type.

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:06.693
If you want to look at your
metrics across product pages,

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:08.928
you can look at the Metrics tab
to view your data

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:13.166
across all of your product pages
on the App Store.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.503
This information can be further
filtered by territory,

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:21.841
device, source type,
and more.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:24.844
And you'll also be able to
export data from the dashboard

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:29.049
so you can analyze it
in your own systems.

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.918
Finally, the App Store Connect
API will be valuable

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:34.020
if you want to integrate
custom product pages

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.489
with your own systems.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.525
The API will allow you
to automate the submission

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:40.694
and management
of custom product pages

00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:43.830
outside of the App Store Connect
website.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.665
Now I'll hand back over
to Savannah

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:49.002
to walk through
the feature strategies.

00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:50.437
Savannah: Thanks, Michelle.

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.405
Now that we've learned
what this feature is

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:55.475
and how to set it up,
let's talk about

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.612
how you can make the most
out of this feature.

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:02.782
As a reminder,
here's the current user journey

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:05.285
for the referral audience.

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.755
Now with the ability
to customize your product page,

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:12.225
you can create a seamless
customer experience

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.127
by aligning your store assets

00:08:14.127 --> 00:08:18.998
with the acquisition marketing
assets for a given audience.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:23.036
Next we'll walk you through
some use cases with examples

00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:26.339
to show how to leverage
this feature.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.409
You may have several
marketing channels you use

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:31.745
to acquire referral audience,

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:34.547
and you can design
custom pages by channel

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:37.450
to reflect the audience
characteristics

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.853
tailored to that channel.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:43.523
Often cases, the most
effective acquisition assets

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.493
may look very different
from each other.

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:48.628
You may want to design,
for example,

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:51.331
two sets
of custom product pages:

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:55.702
one set to align with what works
best on your social channels,

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.637
while the other more tailored

00:08:57.637 --> 00:09:02.776
to the creative featured
in your email campaigns.

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:05.278
If you only have
one major channel

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:08.047
or the top assets
remain consistent

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:10.350
across your different channels,

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.852
you can design
the custom product pages

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:15.288
to reflect different
asset themes

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:19.292
or highlight seasonal assets
to make them more relevant

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:22.295
to your marketing materials.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.764
You can also use
custom product pages

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.133
to create versions
of your product page

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:30.570
that highlight different content
or features.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.840
If you still remember
the Mountain Climber app example

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.942
from the feature overview,

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:38.978
both live streaming
and GPS tracking

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:43.583
would be good use cases to
leverage custom product pages.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.585
Based on the performance
of each,

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.787
you can better understand
which feature

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:52.358
might appeal more
to your intended audience.

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:54.661
If you already have
a good understanding

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:56.262
of your user base,

00:09:56.262 --> 00:10:00.166
you may look at user interests
or user status

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:04.037
and pair this with each relevant
custom product page.

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:08.141
Let's see the details
with some concrete examples.

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:11.511
If you are designing your custom
product pages by asset --

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:16.416
for example, for your puzzle
game with characters --

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:18.284
you may have acquisition assets

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:21.354
that highlight
special in-game characters,

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:26.593
and the assets that highlight
the core puzzle gameplay.

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:28.895
You might design
two custom pages --

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:31.831
one highlighting
specific characters

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:34.734
and another highlighting
a puzzle gameplay --

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:38.638
and you can align the respective
marketing creative and messaging

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.241
for each focus area.

00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:43.510
This provides
a smoother experience

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.212
for users who see both.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:50.617
By aligning the assets from
acquisition to the product page,

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:53.820
you can potentially mitigate
one drop-off point

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:00.226
in the user journey and improve
conversion on-store.

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:03.229
If you are designing
custom product pages by audience

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:07.166
for your fitness app,
as another example,

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:10.837
assume your fitness app
has two main audiences:

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:14.007
cyclists and runners.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:17.243
You'd want to show them
relevant acquisition assets

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:22.181
in your marketing campaigns
and create two custom pages

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:25.184
to appeal to each
of these two groups.

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:26.819
One highlighting cycling

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:29.989
in your app videos and
screenshots, for example,

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:33.927
and another showcasing running
in your custom page.

00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:36.462
In this case, you can
align your audience

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:37.997
and acquisition creatives

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:40.800
with your custom product page
metadata,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.773
which can improve the efficiency
of your marketing campaigns.

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:49.776
Please also note that there are
different ways to go about

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:51.878
planning your
custom product pages,

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.981
and these strategies
can be used on their own

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:58.651
or combined with one another.

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.954
After deciding
on your use case,

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:03.256
here are some considerations
to help you

00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:06.125
further flesh out your strategy.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:09.762
You can choose on-store
which metadata to customize,

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:13.266
and for which specific
localizations.

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:15.835
Among screenshots,
preview videos,

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:18.738
and promotional text,
you can customize

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.641
only one
out of the three metadata,

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:25.578
or all three elements
at the same time.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.147
For preview videos
and promotional text,

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:31.985
you can also choose
to not use them as an option.

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:34.120
In this case,
assume you'd customize

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.124
both your preview video
and screenshots.

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:41.427
You also have the flexibility
to customize the metadata

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.664
for specific localizations.

00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:48.901
Assume you'd start with
the English-speaking audience.

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.504
Apart from
the product page strategy,

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:55.575
referral strategy off-store
also needs to be considered

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:57.777
to have a cohesive
user experience

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.880
and may help drive
better results.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.716
You can choose
which channels to include,

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:06.586
which audience to pair
with your custom pages,

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:10.256
and which assets
to show them.

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.392
For the fitness app,
for example,

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:15.962
assume Channel A
is the best channel for you

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.897
and runners and cyclists

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:21.000
are the two main groups
of your referral audiences,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.673
paired with corresponding
ads for each group.

00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:29.776
Putting the considerations
into a sample plan,

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:35.148
you will have two custom pages
plus the default page.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.751
Custom page one has preview
video and screenshots

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:43.389
tailored to the runner audience,
paired with the running ads.

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:46.192
Custom page two
has a different set of video

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:51.330
and screenshots for cyclists,
paired with the cycling ads.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.568
Every other element
remains the same.

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:58.204
Both of the custom pages
would be compared

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:02.542
to the default product page.

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:05.978
Once you have the custom pages
set up and approved,

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:09.215
the unique URL
specific to each page

00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:11.684
is a great way
to market your pages

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:14.887
to the appropriate audiences.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:17.824
The URL adds
an additional parameter --

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:23.129
product page ID --
at the end of the default link.

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:27.033
Only when the product page
is approved in App Store Connect

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.870
can users see
the customized page.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.740
If you decide to disable
your custom pages later

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.811
or for users who are
on the older OS version than 15,

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.513
the users
who are served this link

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:44.884
will fall back
to the default page.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:48.755
Advertising networks can also
use custom product pages

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:52.091
in StoreKit-rendered
advertisements.

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:54.927
They will replace
the default page identifier

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:58.598
with the product page ID
in their setup.

00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:01.000
More technical information
can be found

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.704
on developer.apple.com
website.

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:07.740
After the custom product pages
goes live,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.777
you can export the data
from App Analytics

00:15:10.777 --> 00:15:14.514
and customize the reporting
to your needs.

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:16.783
In this case,
the runner custom page

00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:20.753
saw a higher conversion rate
than the default page,

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.755
meaning the custom video
and screenshots

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:27.160
are performing better at
converting your runner audience.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.664
It's also a good idea to
validate that the D1 retention

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:34.534
continues to be
similarly strong,

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:41.007
showcasing the runner audience
remains engaged in your app.

00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:43.509
Cyclists custom page,
on the other hand,

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:44.844
is not effective,

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:48.414
as the conversion rate
is lower than the default page.

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:51.584
You may want to revisit
the audience/asset combination

00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:54.754
to try a different set.

00:15:54.754 --> 00:15:56.556
Hope you've had
a good understanding

00:15:56.556 --> 00:15:58.558
of this feature by now.

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:03.462
Before you start, here are
some things to watch out for.

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:08.634
First, with the ability
to customize up to 35 pages,

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:12.038
you'll want to prioritize
your most distinctive content

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:13.940
and assets first.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.144
This should help you make the
most of your internal resources

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:21.414
and drive the scale needed
for the page.

00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:25.384
Please be mindful when
comparing custom product pages.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:28.187
Remember that the audience
that sees each page

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:30.623
could differ across pages,

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:34.093
which may lead to differences
in performance.

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:37.330
If you want to do
an apples-to-apples comparison

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.365
of two product pages,

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:43.569
consider using the product page
optimization feature.

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:45.304
Even though
the metadata submission

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:49.242
is independent of the binary,
any new metadata

00:16:49.242 --> 00:16:53.713
still needs to be reviewed
and approved by App Review,

00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:57.750
so the same guideline
around metadata applies here.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.653
Please check
App Review Guideline section 2.3

00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:03.656
for more details.

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:08.527
Lastly, when analyzing results,
focus on conversion rate

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:12.531
but also monitor post-install
metrics like retention

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.734
to ensure
you're continuing to acquire

00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:18.371
a relevant and engaged audience.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.506
Earlier this year,
we announced

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:25.378
both custom product pages
and product page optimization.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.179
While there are similarities,

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:30.116
let's look at the key
differences side by side

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:34.654
in order to help you understand
when you might use each.

00:17:34.654 --> 00:17:37.556
As discussed,
custom product pages

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:42.762
are intended to highlight
specific content and features.

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:45.831
Product page optimization
is aimed at improving

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.200
your overall
product page conversion

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.337
in a controlled environment.

00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:54.807
The intended audience
for custom product pages

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:59.145
is referral traffic that
you send to each custom page;

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:01.714
while with product page
optimization,

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:04.817
anyone who sees your page
on the App Store

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:08.821
across Search, Browse, and more
are eligible to see

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:13.092
a treatment version
of your default product page.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:16.462
In cases where you have
both features live,

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:18.998
referral audiences
who are directed

00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:22.268
to a custom product page
will land on that page,

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:26.806
and not part of the
product page optimization test.

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:31.077
Custom product pages
don't have a limited timeframe,

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:34.814
which makes them great
for ongoing campaigns,

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:37.483
whereas product page
optimization tests

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:41.454
last for up to 90 days.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.189
In terms of the metadata,

00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:46.192
the assets involved
are slightly different.

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:50.363
Custom product pages allow you
to customize screenshots,

00:18:50.363 --> 00:18:54.100
preview videos,
and promotional text.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.635
Product page optimization
allows you to test

00:18:56.635 --> 00:19:02.141
different app icons,
screenshots, and preview videos.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:06.145
Lastly, the metrics available
for custom product pages

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:09.148
include conversion rate,
retention,

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:12.118
and proceeds for each page;

00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:16.355
while product page optimization
focuses on conversion rate

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:20.659
with improvement
and confidence level.

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:24.830
Finally, our Developer website
has helpful information

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.034
about this feature
including examples,

00:19:28.034 --> 00:19:32.805
technical implementation,
FAQs, and more.

00:19:32.805 --> 00:19:34.407
Thank you for watching.

00:19:34.407 --> 00:19:37.209
We can't wait to see
how you use this feature

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.613
to continually bring
the most relevant experiences

00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:42.748
to your audience.
