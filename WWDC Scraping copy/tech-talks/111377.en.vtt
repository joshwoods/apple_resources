00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.383
Hi, and welcome.

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.366
My name is Hubert and I'm a software engineer on the App Store Connect team.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.966
Game Center is a great way to keep players engaged with your game.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.399
You may already be familiar with
how to setup and manage Game Center in App Store Connect.

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:24.883
Today, I’m excited to show you how to manage
Game Center with the App Store Connect API.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.716
Game Center is a new addition to the App Store Connect API.

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:30.600
As a developer,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.633
you can automate and synchronize your
Game Center configurations across multiple platforms.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:41.283
I’ll start by showing you the
Game Center resources available in App Store Connect API.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.683
Then, I’ll work through an example
using the API to automate the creation of a new achievement.

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:53.683
I’ll also work through an example where I create
a game group with leaderboards that can be shared between apps.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:59.883
And then, I’ll configure multiplayer compatibility to enable matchmaking for a game.

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:06.883
Let’s explore Game Center in App Store Connect’s API by
taking a look at the core components of Game Center.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.033
Game Center focuses on Achievements and Leaderboards to
help drive player engagement in games on the app store.

00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:20.066
Achievements provide goals for players that
encourage them to explore more content in the game.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.950
You can see that I need to encounter 4 more mermaids to
obtain the Light of Prometheus achievement.

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:32.166
Leaderboards enable players to competitively track their progress between friends.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.950
In San Francisco Bay, I’m ranked 2 out of my 8 friends,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.733
and in order to pass my friend I’ll need to
come back into the game to try and beat their score.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.483
App Store Connect API relates all game center configurations for
an App through a new resource named game center detail.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.233
I’ll show you how to use the API to configure new achievements and leaderboards
for a game named “The Coast”.

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:58.666
Let’s start by setting up a new achievement for “The Coast”.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.233
“The Coast” is a game where players can sail in scenic areas.

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:08.599
I’ll show you how to create an achievement that is
earned the first time a player sails in the game.

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:14.199
Before I can create an achievement I need to create a new
Game Center Detail resource.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:18.216
This resource is the bridge between an app and an achievement.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.400
In this example, I’m using a POST request to create a Game Center Detail.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.616
“The Coast” has an app id of 123
which I’m required to set on the game center detail as a relationship.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.483
After the resource is created
a new ID for the Game Center Detail will be returned in the response.

00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:41.816
I’ll use this ID in the next step when I create the achievement.

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:47.349
Now, I can create an achievement that is awarded the first time a player sails.

00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:52.800
I’ll set the game center details relationship with the id from the previous step.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.400
Creating an achievement also returns with the newly created achievement id.

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:04.633
I’ll note this ID down because I need it in the next step
when I create localizations for the achievement.

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:12.383
Localizations are required so that players can read and understand
the details of an achievement based on their personal settings.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:17.400
This description helps guide players to obtain the achievement in their language.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.916
An achievement can have a localization for each supported language.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.650
I’ll create 2 languages for this achievement,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.683
one for Canadian English,

00:03:27.683 --> 00:03:29.599
and one for Canadian French.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.983
First, I’ll create the Canadian English localization.

00:03:34.183 --> 00:03:39.866
Note that I am creating this resource with
a relationship to the achievement id from the previous step.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.949
Then, I’ll create the Canadian French localization.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:50.166
And again, I’ll use the same achievement id from
the previous step to relate it to the achievement.

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.300
Once the localizations are created,

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:57.766
I’ll note down the localization id for the Canadian English localization.

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.333
And the Canadian French localization.

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:09.550
An image in Game Center is the icon for the achievement
awarded to the player once the achievement is completed.

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:15.766
After creating the localizations, the next step is to add an image for each localization.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.866
In this example, Canadian English and Canadian French both have their own image.

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:27.433
I’ll need to make an asset reservation to upload my localization image.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:33.649
This is done by creating an image resource
that is related to the Canadian English localization.

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.949
The “upload operations” attribute in the response contains the
request operations I can use to upload the asset.

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:50.233
I’ll use curl to upload the image file
to the URL provided in the upload operations attribute.

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:53.783
After the upload is complete,

00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:59.883
I can commit the asset reservation by
updating the image resource and setting the uploaded attribute to true.

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:06.516
Now that the achievement is setup it’s a good idea to test it in game with test flight.

00:05:06.983 --> 00:05:14.433
You can learn more about how to use test flight and game center
by visiting developer.apple.com/testflight.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:21.166
I’ve configured my achievement, tested it, and now I’m ready to submit it for review.

00:05:22.316 --> 00:05:27.783
I’ll need to create a release resource
which attaches my achievement to the game center detail.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.300
I’ll also need to enable game center for the next app store version
by creating a related game center app version.

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:41.266
Creating a release requires the Game Center Detail relationship,

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:44.066
and the Game Center Achievement relationship.

00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:54.766
Next, I can create a new game center app version
with the enabled attribute set to true and the app store version relationship.

00:05:57.533 --> 00:06:00.466
Now, it’s time for me to submit the achievement for review.

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:03.716
In App Store Connect on the App Version page,

00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:08.333
my achievement “First Sail!” is attached
to the Prepare for Submission version for my game.

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:11.583
This was done when I created the release.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.699
I can submit this app store version for review
and when it’s approved the achievement will go live!

00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:24.883
Let’s recap how to setup a new achievement
with the App Store Connect API’s Game Center resources.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.783
I created a new Game Center Detail
as the bridge between my App and an Achievement.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:35.800
And then, I created the achievement along with localizations and images.

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:45.183
I verified the new achievement with test flight
before creating a release and enabling game center on the app store version.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.850
Now, let’s talk about how to share leaderboards between apps.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.816
“The Coast” is also a multiplayer game
with various leaderboards that track player scores.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.800
Friends can compete with each other by beating their scores on a leaderboard,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.416
and when players overtake friends on leaderboards

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:09.016
a notification is triggered which helps drive players back into the game.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.683
In this example,
“The Coast” has a new spin-off game named “The Coast - Blood Moon”.

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:21.399
I want to create and share a new leaderboard
that tracks the total number of times a player has sailed

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:25.116
so that players can increase their score while playing in either game.

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:32.183
Previously, I created an achievement with a direct relationship to a Game Center Detail.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.716
Leaderboards can also be created with a direct relationship to a Game Center Detail.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.216
To share a leaderboard between apps,

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:45.016
I can create a game center group
as the bridge between a leaderboard and the game center detail.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:48.199
In this example,

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:53.816
I’ll add “The Coast” and “The Coast - Blood Moon”
to the same group so they can share a leaderboard.

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:58.300
I’ll start by creating a new game center group.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:05.183
Then, I’ll note down the group ID
so I can use it to relate the game center detail and leaderboard.

00:08:07.383 --> 00:08:11.600
Next, I’m going to patch the game center detail I created earlier for “The Coast”.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.133
I’ll add a relationship to the game center group that I just created.

00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:20.083
This step is repeated for “The Coast - Blood Moon”.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.416
Now I can create a simple leaderboard

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:29.116
that tracks the total number of times a player has sailed in “The Coast”.

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:35.416
I’ll relate the leaderboard
to the game center group so that both games can use the leaderboard.

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:40.716
Localizations, images, and releases should also be created for the leaderboard.

00:08:42.416 --> 00:08:46.383
Since I have created a new group leaderboard that is used by both games,

00:08:46.383 --> 00:08:51.883
I no longer need the original leaderboard
that tracks the total number of times a player has sailed in the game.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:58.216
I can use the archive feature
to remove the leaderboard from being visible to players in “The Coast”.

00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:03.100
You can archive an achievement, leaderboard, or leaderboard set.

00:09:05.083 --> 00:09:10.216
Using App Store Connect API, I can submit a PATCH request to update the leaderboard.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:14.750
In the request I’ll set the archived attribute to true,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:20.016
and once the request is complete
the leaderboard will no longer be visible to players in the game.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:29.716
Let’s recap how groups enabled me to share my leaderboard
between “The Coast” and its spin-off game “The Coast - Blood Moon”.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.350
I created a game center group and related both apps to the group.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:40.483
And then I created the leaderboard in the group along with some localizations and images.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:47.916
Just like achievements, it’s a good idea to use test flight
to verify the leaderboard before creating a release for the leaderboard.

00:09:48.366 --> 00:09:53.166
Because the old leaderboard is no longer needed
we can archive it to remove it from the game.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:01.216
Next, I’ll show you
how to enable multiplayer compatibility so that players can race in “The Coast”.

00:10:03.216 --> 00:10:08.299
Multiplayer compatibility enables matchmaking
and game sessions between players in games.

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:13.883
Connecting players with their friends
in “The Coast” can help bring new players into the game.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.600
Enabling it is done by specifying game center app versions
that are compatible with each other.

00:10:20.983 --> 00:10:27.833
In this example, I’ll create a multiplayer compatibility relationship
from the game center app version 2.0

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:34.850
so that it is compatible to matchmake with versions 1.1 and 1.2 but not 1.0.

00:10:37.416 --> 00:10:43.383
I’ve created a POST request to the
compatibility versions relationship on the game center app version.

00:10:43.983 --> 00:10:47.500
The request contains the list of versions that it is compatible with,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:54.933
and players on version 2.0 will now be able to join
multiplayer sessions with players on versions 1.1 and 1.2.

00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:58.583
App Store Connect API’s new Game Center resources

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:03.216
are great way to setup and manage configurations for your games on the App Store.

00:11:05.183 --> 00:11:06.583
To wrap up,

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:12.633
the App Store Connect API’s Game Center resources provide the ability
for developers to automate their game center configurations

00:11:12.633 --> 00:11:15.649
outside of App Store Connect’s web application.

00:11:16.183 --> 00:11:21.399
These configurations can be written once and synchronized across multiple platforms.

00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:27.016
Achievements and Leaderboards are
the core components of game center that help drive player engagement

00:11:27.016 --> 00:11:31.049
and both can be shared between multiple apps by utilizing game center groups.

00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:35.566
Unused components can be archived so that they are removed from the game.

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:42.000
And finally, Multiplayer compatibility
can be configured to open game sessions with friends.

00:11:43.716 --> 00:11:47.716
As always, we welcome any feedback that you may provide on Feedback Assistant.

00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:49.250
Thanks for watching,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.966
and I hope you can make the best use
out of App Store Connect API's new Game Center Resources.
