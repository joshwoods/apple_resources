WEBVTT

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.723
Hello and welcome to Get Started with in-app Events.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.200
I'm Michael and I work on the app store team.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.620
We'll begin this session with a brief introduction

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.270
to the concept of in-app events

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.770
and how they look when showcased on the app store.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.360
Then we'll walk through how to set up in-app events

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.563
in App Store Connect.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.530
And using the information we walk

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.180
through in the first two sections,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.210
we'll put it all together in some examples.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.650
Let's jump in.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.200
In-app events is a feature that transforms discovery

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.240
and rediscovery on the app store,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.730
giving you additional ways to showcase your events

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.143
and expand their reach.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.180
But what are we talking about when we talk about events?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.330
They are timely activities within your apps and games,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.180
such as a game competition, a fitness challenge,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.670
a movie premier, and more.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.760
In fact, many of you may already be running events

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.100
inside your apps and games.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.660
For those of you who aren't,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.720
now is a great time to consider doing so.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.330
That's because in-app events are discoverable right

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.323
on the app store.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.000
So how can events benefit your business?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.430
Events can help you attract new users

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.620
and drive new downloads.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.530
Keep active users engaged by providing new content

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.440
and functionality within your app or game.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.050
And bring back lapsed users by giving them reasons

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.753
to come back even after a long absence.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.870
We'll dig deeper into these concepts later

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.983
in this presentation.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.440
On iOS 15, an iPadOS 15 or later,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.323
events appear across the app store as event cards.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.770
Event cards include images or video,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.563
as well as the event name, and short description.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.670
Event cards appear on your product page where

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.853
events are listed in order of their start date and priority.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.500
People who have previously downloaded your app or game,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.780
including those who have deleted it,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.050
will see them above your screenshots, as seen here.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.690
While users who have not downloaded your app

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.333
will see your event cards below your screenshots.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.240
Users can tap the event card to open an event details page

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.743
as seen on the right here.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.250
If they do not already have the app or game

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.960
they can download it from the event card

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.583
by tapping the get button.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.630
The event details page with its longer description

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.280
and larger media asset,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.300
gives users additional context around your event.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.970
To help you build anticipation for your event

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.210
you can publish them on the app store up to 14 days

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.773
before the event starts.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.980
Provided that you have set your published date prior

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.730
to the event start date and time, customers can also opt-in

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.880
to be notified when your event starts.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.130
These notifications will come from the app store

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.190
and will launch customers directly into the event

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.530
inside your app or game.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.830
If the user doesn't have your app or game installed,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.743
they will be directed to the event details page.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.100
To help you market your events off store

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.430
and provide a seamless experience for App Store customers,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.480
we generate an app store URL for each event.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.380
This URL directs the user to your event details page

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.870
and will fall back to your app store product page

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.610
after your event has ended

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.313
and for customers on older OS versions.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.620
The event card is discoverable across the app store.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.150
In addition to your product page,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.433
they are also discoverable in search.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.190
On the games and apps tabs

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.070
users see personalized event recommendations

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.620
that can help them stay informed about the apps and games

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.380
they already have, find something new,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.453
or rediscover an old favorite.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.040
And lastly, our editorial team curates the most exciting

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.003
and innovative events on the today games and apps tabs.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.120
When users search for your app, game,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.180
or event it can appear in search results.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.970
This helps users including those who have lapsed,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.010
more easily discover the events happening

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.270
in your app or game,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.730
and potentially encourages users to engage

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.843
with your app or game.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.290
View this added visibility as part

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.693
of your organic discovery strategy.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.720
As you see here on the left,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.910
if a user that has not downloaded your app

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.580
or game searches for it, they will see screenshots

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.473
alongside your app icon.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.620
Moving to the center,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.010
if a user who currently has or has previously downloaded

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.200
your app or game searches for it,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.850
they will see your in-app event card

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.433
alongside your app icon and name.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.140
Users can also search directly for an event.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.240
On the right, you'll see a user search

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.147
for June Leaderboard Climb and the Mountain Climber app

00:04:48.147 --> 00:04:50.610
and the event card displayed in results,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.113
regardless of user state.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.350
So now that we've shown you what events look

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.730
like on the app store,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.283
let's talk about how you can set up your own.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.700
We've created a robust set of tools

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.410
to help you set up your in-app events

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.663
and showcase them to the right audience.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.740
We've also updated the app review submission experience

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.680
to give you more flexibility around submitting new events

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.723
without a new app version.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.070
Keep in mind that only marketing, app manager, admin,

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.980
or account holder roles can submit events.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.990
Marketing roles can only submit events

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.933
as long as there is no app version in the submission.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.310
On the left you'll see the in-app events section

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.773
where you can create and manage your events.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.680
In the in-app event section

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.200
you'll provide your event metadata and media

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.500
for your event card and event details page.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.110
You can preview what your provided media will look like

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.170
in an event card and event details page to confirm

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.000
that crucial aspects of your image

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.013
or video will not be obscured.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.920
Your metadata must adhere to app review guideline 2.3.13,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.680
which broadly covers in-app events metadata

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.340
and 2.3.8 which requires that all metadata

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.520
including visuals is appropriate for all audiences

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.163
and adheres to a 4+ age rating.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.420
If your event is available in multiple regions,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.210
be sure to use language that's appropriate for customers

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.180
in all regions in which your event is available

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.703
and accounts for differing cultural values.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.580
Ensure that any intellectual property

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.750
or trademark content is authorized by relevant parties.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.610
Avoid claims that can't be verified,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.340
such as the best or number one.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.130
Don't include specific prices in your metadata

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.190
as pricing and currencies can vary across regions

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.490
and can be changed independent of your event.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.470
Avoid including the type of event

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.290
in the title or descriptions.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.500
You can find detailed metadata specifications, requirements,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.140
and guidance on our developer site.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.780
The metadata you provide is used when displaying

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.210
your in-app event across the app store,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.943
so it's important it accurately portrays your event.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.170
Let's look at these two examples.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.290
In the do example, the event name is in title case

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.050
and is a distinctive, unique name.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.050
As you can see, the don't example is a general call

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.380
to action to watch the live stream, which isn't very helpful

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.230
for users to learn what your event is about.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.830
It also uses all caps and multiple punctuation marks,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.780
which is not ideal.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.600
Next, let's look at the do examples short description

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.620
below the event title, it provides an accurate summary

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.223
of what the event experience is like and uses title case.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.690
As with the event title, the don't example is a call

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.963
to action to subscribe and include specific pricing.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.010
This is not needed since you'll select an event cost

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.510
in App Store Connect,

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.790
which displays whether an in-app purchase

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.060
or subscription is required in order to participate

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.883
in the event on your event details page.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.520
When looking at the visual assets

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.190
you'll notice that they look very different.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.440
We recommend that you avoid including text

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.110
or logos in your assets when possible.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.473
especially if they include your event or app name.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.130
Scrolling down, you'll select the event badge

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.540
which tells the user what type

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.850
of in-app event you are running.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.073
But which event badge should you choose?

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.580
There are many activity types that make great candidates

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.890
for in-app events such as the challenge,

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.230
live event, or premier.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.810
To help users understand your type of event,

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.300
you'll select one of these seven badges depending

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.103
on what best fits your event.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.400
This badge will display on your event card

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.933
and event details page.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.193
To help you best select a badge let's go through each one.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.330
A challenge is an activity that encourages a user

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.360
to achieve a goal within a certain amount of time.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.930
For example, beating a certain number of levels in a game

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.695
or meditating a certain number of minutes

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:01.713
over the weekend for a health app.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.254
A challenge is a compelling way

00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:06.900
to maximize the user's enjoyment

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.213
of existing features in the app or game.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.980
A competition is an activity in which users compete

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.970
against one another to achieve a ranking or win awards.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.760
This could be a movement competition in a fitness app

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.700
or a player versus player battle in a game.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.610
Similar to challenges, competitions are a great way

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.570
to put a new spin on existing content or features.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.700
The results of challenges and competitions are

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.893
often represented in leaderboards.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.240
Live events are activities that occur in real time

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.180
that all users experience simultaneously.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.750
For example, a sporting event or livestream concert.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.190
Live events must introduce new features, content, or goods.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.370
A major update introduces significant new features,

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.530
content, or experiences.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.070
For example, the launch of new game modes or levels.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.470
These events go beyond minor enhancements

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.083
like UI adjustments or bug fixes.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.120
New season is used to introduce new content, storylines,

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.810
or media libraries to build on established content.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.170
For example, a significant sporting event, a battle pass,

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.270
or a themed content in a game,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.810
or a special episode of a television show.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.120
These events should focus on unique content

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.590
rather than promoting awareness

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.423
about the entirety of the season.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.200
A premier introduces new content

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.060
or media for the first time.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.363
For example, a movie debut or newly released audio.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.660
These events should focus on the introduction

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.830
of this unique content,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.230
rather than promoting general awareness

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.453
about your app's content or service.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.020
Special event is used for limited time events

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.870
that are not captured by another event badge,

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.890
possibly spanning multiple activities or experiences.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.683
For example, an event featuring a collaboration.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.530
These events should provide customers

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.440
with new content, features, or goods.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.740
As a reminder, only select this badge if none

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.740
of the others appropriately describe your event.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.600
Please keep these considerations in mind

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.380
when selecting the best fitting badge for your in-app event.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.930
If none of these badges seem appropriate,

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.240
the content should not be considered an event

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.803
and should not be submitted.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.240
Next, you'll set up country or region availability

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.306
and scheduling, including event start time,

00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:33.603
event end time, and publish start time.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.380
If an event is published before its start time,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.130
the event card will display the date and time it will begin.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.620
Publishing the event before the start time

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.920
can be used to build anticipation for the event.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.650
An in-app event can last up to 31 days

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.373
and be promoted up to 14 days before its start date.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.210
If you'd like, you can make your event available only

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.450
in specific regions and customize the dates and times

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.713
for each location.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.850
Next, you'll select an event purpose,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.980
which is one of the factors the app store uses

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.070
to offer personalized recommendations.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.340
Carefully consider the desired audience for your event.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.610
While some events might be appropriate for all users,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.490
selecting one of the more specific event purposes,

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.580
attract new users, keep active users informed,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.190
or bring back lapse users has been shown

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.383
to yield more efficient results.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.010
For example, more downloads for new users,

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.957
more opens for active users,

00:12:33.957 --> 00:12:37.440
and more redownloads for lapsed users.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.800
To help your event reach the people for which it's intended,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.953
the app store incorporates app usage information.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.270
That data is processed on the device

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.453
to minimize data collection and enhance user privacy.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.020
Regardless of the event purpose you choose

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.090
your published events will be discoverable

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.373
on the app store by all users.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.213
But which purpose should you select?

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.963
We'll take a look at each one in more detail.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.280
New users are people who have never downloaded

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.840
your app or game.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.720
The best application of in-app events for a new user is

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.700
to teach them about some key feature

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.880
or content your app or game offers.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.830
The principles are similar to your strategy

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.510
for early retention.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.330
The initial experience the new user has is likely

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.340
to determine whether or not they come back

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.083
for day two and beyond.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.850
While your active users are already engaged,

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.770
you'll want to make sure they stay informed

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.240
about the latest happenings

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.850
just in case they missed other communications

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.263
within the app or game.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.660
As previously mentioned, the event content you produce

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.630
can effectively become its own content layer

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.363
and you wanna make sure active users are aware of it.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.280
Another exciting aspect of in-app events

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.312
is the opportunity to communicate with lapsed users.

00:14:03.312 --> 00:14:06.660
Lapsed users may have been your app or games most engaged,

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.330
valuable users at one point in time,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.073
but at some point they moved on.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.240
By publishing your events on the app store

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.300
you can let lapsed users know about new features and content

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.260
that have been introduced

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.483
within your app or game since they left.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.370
The open button on in-app events will take the user directly

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.130
to the right place in your app or game.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.740
To accomplish this you'll need to provide a deep link

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.290
for every in-app event.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.800
A deep link is a universal link or custom URL

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.263
that opens an app to a particular place.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.960
While you can use either of these,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.603
we do recommend using a universal link.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.630
There is detailed documentation

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.700
about how to set up universal links

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.000
on the the developer site.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.650
This URL will be passed directly

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.230
to your app when the user taps open,

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.480
so avoid using URL shorteners

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.494
and other services that add redirects

00:15:02.494 --> 00:15:04.863
that your app can't handle directly.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.000
Be thoughtful about the most relevant destination

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.233
to direct users.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.270
If your event is live, you can link directly to the event.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.600
If your event hasn't started, you might direct users

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.270
to a landing page that builds anticipation

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.013
and reminds them when to return.

00:15:23.974 --> 00:15:26.730
If a user is new to your app

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.760
consider taking them through any necessary onboarding

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.510
before directing them to the event.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.680
Always provide a way for users to return

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.453
to your main app experience.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.490
Remember that the link must be directed to your app or game

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.533
not somewhere else like the web.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.733
Lastly, we recommend testing your deep links.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.240
One simple way to do this is to paste the link

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.660
into the notes app and then tap to launch it.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.700
This will replicate how it will behave

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.503
for customers on the app store.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.730
Next, you'll indicate priority.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.830
Priority affects how an event is sorted

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.063
on your product page.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.270
High priority events will appear ahead

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.580
of normal priority events.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.060
This in turn affects which event appears in search results

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.323
for your app or game.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.310
Priority will not affect search ranking relative

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.393
to other apps.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.130
You'll also indicate whether an in-app event purchase

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.080
or subscription is required in order

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.333
for a user to participate in the event.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.523
This will appear as a label on the event details page.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.680
Once you've configured your event metadata

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.183
you'll submit it for review.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.480
You can have up to 10 approved in-app events

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.360
in App Store Connect per app at a given time.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.970
And a maximum of five in-app events published

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.063
on the app store across all storefronts at a time.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.960
Note that even events that are only made available

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.983
in one storefront count towards the five total events.

00:17:03.198 --> 00:17:06.660
Keep in mind that you can include multiple in-app events

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.013
in one submission.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.510
We recommend doing this as all submissions,

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.460
regardless of number of items,

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.313
typically complete review within 24 hours.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.840
Lastly, the App Store Connect API supports all

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.750
of these actions so you can automate the creation,

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.543
management, and submission of in-app events.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.890
Now that we've discussed how to set up in-app events,

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.510
how does this feature fit together

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.630
with your larger content management practices?

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.267
Here we'll look at some standard event program concepts

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.520
and a few examples that illustrate how

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.083
it can all fit together.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.950
These are six main concepts to keep in mind

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.233
when managing an in-app events program.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.840
You can keep these concepts in mind

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.430
when creating each event,

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.953
as well as when planning your overall strategy.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.830
First, set the goal.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.170
Determine your desired impact in KPIs,

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.470
such as driving additional feature engagement.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.900
Next, determine your concept.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.530
Set your event strategy such as target audience and timing,

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.133
as well as identify feasibility blockers and solutions.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.640
Your concept for in-app event submissions should be

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.980
the highest quality most captivating events

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.623
and not just minor updates or content drops.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.750
Then make a plan, decide when the event will occur

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.610
and who in your organization will take care

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.133
of each step necessary to make your event happen.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.460
Next comes the fun part.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.103
Executing and activating your event.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.600
Once it's live, you can move on to monitoring the event

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.910
and corresponding KPIs.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.090
Look at user engagement over the duration of the event.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.490
For example, for an in-game event

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.340
you'll want to keep a close eye on economic indicators

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.770
and game balance to identify any problems

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.243
before they get out of hand.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.640
In an entertainment app,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.830
extremely low engagement could be the sign

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.943
of a technical issue.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.770
Lastly, analyze your event once it's ended.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.440
Perform a deep dive to understand the event KPIs

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.673
and business impact.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.360
Consider looking at things like the behavior

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.963
of a particular user segment before and after the event.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.040
You can use this analysis to determine next steps,

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.430
such as whether to run a similar event again in the future,

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.950
make it an automated recurring event,

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.443
or try a different concept entirely.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.123
So what does this process look like in practice?

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.313
At the top, you can see the six concepts we just described.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.060
Below that, you can see where the in-app events

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.790
feature milestones map to the process,

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.800
whether or not you have previously employed

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.500
an event strategy like the one at the top,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.200
in-app events can be leveraged to enhance and supplement

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.520
your current approach,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.463
or be your primary event distribution method.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.930
Next, we'll walk through three sample KPIs

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.283
and related events.

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.960
In this example, we are shown an event card describing

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.320
a premier of a program called Climb Champions.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.160
Our goal is to maximize downloads in day one retention.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.290
So an appropriate event purpose would be

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.220
to attract new users to our mountain climber app.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.370
We want to share our Climb Champion show with new users

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.803
in hopes of encouraging them to try our app.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.910
In our short description, we elevate unique aspects

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.910
of the show in order to get people excited,

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.380
such as how it features stories

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.393
from the world's best climbers.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.110
New users can feel like they're joining a community

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.183
and taking part in something unique.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.600
This next example shows a challenge called

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.343
the June Leaderboard Climb.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.850
Here we want to drive daily active devices as well

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.323
as longer term retention.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.100
The most relevant event purpose in this case would be

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.530
to keep active users informed since you

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.353
are most likely speaking to more established users.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.700
For active users, an event that leverages a familiar feature

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.953
within the app could be a good approach.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.410
In our mountain climber app,

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.930
tracking distance is a core feature.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.940
The challenge rewards increase engagement

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.173
with this core feature.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.813
Lastly, we have a major update titled Guided Climbs.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.590
If we want to drive redownloads and re-engagement

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.010
of those customers who have stopped engaging with the app,

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.533
then we want to bring back lapsed users.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.880
While there are many reasons why a user stops engaging

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.670
with an app or game these users enjoyed it

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.023
at one point in time.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.230
A compelling major update could be the reason

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.088
they decide to come back.

00:21:48.088 --> 00:21:51.093
With in-app events, you're able to tell them about it.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.840
Here we are introducing a significant new feature,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.020
the Guided Climb, which focuses on local terrain

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.330
and provides a more engaging experience

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.953
through community narratives.

00:22:02.874 --> 00:22:05.490
This new feature might address the reason why

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.070
many users may have lapsed in the first place

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.970
and can bring them back into your app.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.620
As we discuss the last step

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.630
of a successful in-app events program

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.240
is analyzing your event performance

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.480
and that's why we've added a new dashboard in-app analytics

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.390
to help you evaluate how users are engaging

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.493
with your event listing on the store.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.660
In the dashboard, you can see the key metrics related

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.120
to your events performance, including impressions,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.470
downloads, notification metrics, app opens, and more.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.310
You can also slice that data by territory and source type.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.830
This allows you to see where users are coming from

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.783
and how they land on your event page.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.330
Please note that an event

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.850
must have five downloads associated with it

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.013
before it shows up in-app analytics.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.720

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.463
