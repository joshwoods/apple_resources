00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:17.146
[ Background Conversations ]

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:18.116
>> Welcome.

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:20.796
This year, we are delighted to

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:22.896
introduce a new framework in iOS

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:25.756
11 called Core NFC, that would

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:27.946
allow your apps to integrate NFC

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:30.466
on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:34.126
Using Core NFC, apps can

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:35.486
interact with their physical

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:37.076
environment and the real-world

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:38.046
objects within it.

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:41.056
You may already know that Apple

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.736
Pay uses NFC for complex

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:44.376
payment.

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:46.966
Now, with the introduction of

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.656
Core NFC, you will be able to

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:52.716
use NFC in your applications to

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:54.576
create new and innovative user

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:58.676
experiences with the iPhone.

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:00.686
In this session, we will give

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.436
you a brief overview of new

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.476
field communications, what is

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:06.576
supported in the Core NFC

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:08.916
framework, the requirements and

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:11.236
details for using it, and some

00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:12.096
example code.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:16.056
To start off, let's talk a

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.616
little bit about Near Field

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:18.346
Communication.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:22.736
Near Field Communication, known

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:25.686
simply as NFC, is a wireless

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.126
technology that allows the

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:28.926
exchange of information between

00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:30.576
devices that are within close

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:31.276
proximity.

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:33.986
Limited to a range of just a few

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:34.796
centimeters.

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:38.366
NFC is actually a collection of

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:39.936
a number of different standards

00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:40.846
and protocols.

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:43.696
All of these standards coexist

00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:45.066
and are used in different

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:45.896
applications.

00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:48.316
You may have seen or had

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.156
experience with NFC text.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:51.926
The small little stickers or

00:01:51.926 --> 00:01:53.706
cards which can be read

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:56.066
wirelessly by an NFC reader.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.396
NFC text comes in a wide variety

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.326
of shapes, sizes, and

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:02.056
capacities.

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:04.496
They are classified into five

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:06.286
categories, known as Type 1

00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:07.306
through Type 5.

00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:09.636
Each one corresponding to a

00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:10.466
different standard.

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:13.896
For example, Type 3 texts are

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:14.956
based on FEDECA [assumed

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.256
spelling] and Type 4 is based on

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:21.486
ISO-14443.

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:23.856
The NFC Forum has defined the

00:02:23.856 --> 00:02:26.576
NFC Data Exchange Format, or

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.726
NDEF for short, as a common

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:30.526
messaging format for exchanging

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:32.646
data in a standardized way among

00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:34.356
the different text types.

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:38.036
Now that we have covered some

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:40.586
NFC basics, let's take a look at

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:43.086
what you can do with Core NFC.

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:47.016
For the initial launch of Core

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:49.626
NFC, we have focused on NFC Tag

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:51.146
Reading, which can be used to

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:52.886
enhance the user experience in a

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:54.516
wide variety of ways.

00:02:55.686 --> 00:02:57.516
Potential applications include

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:01.606
connecting user to location or

00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:03.586
context-specific content,

00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:06.026
connecting physical hardware

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:09.086
with your application, and even

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:10.666
for in-store product information

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:11.886
or inventory tracking.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.306
In addition, NFC Tags can be

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:17.206
used in place of QR codes.

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:21.876
Core NFC will allow your

00:03:21.876 --> 00:03:23.686
application to read any NDEF

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:24.626
formatted tag.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.066
This greatly simplifies the

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:28.586
process of reading tags within

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.056
your application or for having

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:31.196
to deal with the different

00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:31.936
standards.

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:34.366
Tag reading is supported on

00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:36.416
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:39.806
At this time, Core NFC does not

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:41.576
support writing or formatting

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:42.406
operations.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:46.886
There are two requirements for

00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:48.386
using Core NFC in your

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:49.616
application.

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:53.816
First, Core NFC is an

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:54.966
entitlement-protective

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:55.486
framework.

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:58.216
You will need to turn on the

00:03:58.216 --> 00:04:00.116
Near Field Communication Tag

00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:02.406
Reading Capability from Xcode to

00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:03.476
get this entitlement.

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:05.856
However, this capability would

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:07.426
not be in Xcode for the first

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:09.216
[inaudible] released at WWDC.

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.966
In the meantime, you can

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.326
manually request this

00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:14.756
entitlement by visiting the

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:17.016
Certificates, Identifiers and

00:04:17.016 --> 00:04:19.185
Profiles page on the Apple

00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:20.196
Developer website.

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:25.796
The second requirement for Core

00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:28.056
NFC is a Scan Usage Description.

00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:30.976
This string is required in your

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:33.016
application's info P-list file,

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:34.786
and it will be displayed to the

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.126
user when your application

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:38.426
starts NFC scanning.

00:04:39.386 --> 00:04:40.716
For more information, you can

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:43.986
watch the WWDC session, Privacy

00:04:44.076 --> 00:04:44.956
and Your Apps.

00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:49.656
Now that you have configured

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.666
your project correctly, let's

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.066
review some additional details

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.846
about tag reading with the Core

00:04:54.846 --> 00:04:55.706
NFC framework.

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.856
First, tag reading is an

00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:02.916
on-demand process, meaning that

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:04.656
your application has to initiate

00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:06.496
a tag reading activity using a

00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:06.986
session.

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:11.086
Second, your application has to

00:05:11.086 --> 00:05:12.906
be visible and foregrounded in

00:05:12.906 --> 00:05:14.436
order to start a tag reading

00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:14.996
activity.

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:17.096
A tag reading session will be

00:05:17.096 --> 00:05:18.596
ended if your application is

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:20.146
backgrounded or ceases to be

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:20.566
visible.

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:24.596
Next, each tag reading activity

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:26.326
is limited to 60 seconds at a

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:26.746
time.

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.956
If a session has timed out or

00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:30.586
invalidated, your application

00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:31.936
must create a new session to

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:33.646
initiate another tag reading

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:34.206
activity.

00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:38.246
You can configure a session to

00:05:38.246 --> 00:05:40.096
read either a single tag or

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:41.126
multiple tags.

00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:43.596
In a single tag reading mode,

00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:45.516
the session will be ended

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:47.316
automatically after a tag is

00:05:47.316 --> 00:05:47.676
read.

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:50.296
On the other hand, a multi-tag

00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:51.636
reading session will remain

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:53.096
active until canceled by the

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:54.966
user, or the 60-second timeout

00:05:54.966 --> 00:05:55.606
is reached.

00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:00.156
Finally, as mentioned

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:02.996
previously, the NFC Usage String

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:06.136
defined in your info P-list will

00:06:06.136 --> 00:06:07.706
be displayed to the user while

00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:09.166
the tag reading activity is in

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:09.746
progress.

00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:13.926
We have provided a sample

00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:15.126
application along with this

00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:16.436
presentation to demonstrate the

00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:19.126
use of Core NFC.

00:06:19.126 --> 00:06:20.396
Consider the case where you want

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:21.566
to take a physical kind of

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:22.266
inventory.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.666
Here, we are showing you the key

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:26.446
user interaction sequence of the

00:06:26.446 --> 00:06:27.466
sample application.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:29.936
The sample application consists

00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:31.806
of a main table view, and a Scan

00:06:31.806 --> 00:06:32.266
button.

00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:34.686
Every time an inventory item is

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.486
scanned, it is displayed as a

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:38.086
role entry in this main table

00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:38.416
view.

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:40.906
Just click on the Scan button to

00:06:40.906 --> 00:06:44.876
start a tag scanning.

00:06:45.036 --> 00:06:46.816
This UI will be presented to the

00:06:46.816 --> 00:06:48.836
user hopefully on top of your

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:50.836
application once tag scanning

00:06:50.836 --> 00:06:51.476
has begun.

00:06:52.636 --> 00:06:54.406
During tag scanning, the user's

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:56.076
description string is displayed

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:56.986
within the UI.

00:06:57.986 --> 00:06:59.496
At any time, the user can hit

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:01.106
the Cancel button to stop a tag

00:07:01.106 --> 00:07:03.146
scanning, which will invalidate

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:03.886
the reader session.

00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:09.106
The UI will get updated once an

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:11.116
NFC tag has been successfully

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:11.476
read.

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:14.196
Here, we have configured our

00:07:14.196 --> 00:07:15.916
reader session to be single tag

00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:16.516
read mode.

00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:22.026
Finally, the overlaid UI will be

00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:23.526
dismissed, and the application

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.136
will be foregrounded once the

00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:26.886
tag reading session has ended.

00:07:27.356 --> 00:07:30.966
All right.

00:07:31.106 --> 00:07:32.136
Let's walk through the code

00:07:32.136 --> 00:07:33.146
together from the sample

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.536
application we have just shown.

00:07:35.136 --> 00:07:38.336
At a high level, you would need

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:39.766
to perform these three easy

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:41.916
steps to enable tag reading in

00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:42.676
your application.

00:07:43.636 --> 00:07:47.326
First, adopt the NFC NDEF Reader

00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:48.836
Session Delegate Protocol.

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:52.596
Next, create an instance of the

00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:54.626
NFC NDEF Reader Session Class,

00:07:54.966 --> 00:07:56.546
and provide it with your

00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:57.066
delegate.

00:07:58.826 --> 00:08:01.086
Finally, start a reader session

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:02.506
using the Begin method, and

00:08:02.506 --> 00:08:04.116
handle the delegate callbacks.

00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:09.156
Here is a cool snippet from the

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:10.676
sample application, illustrating

00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:11.836
the three-step approach.

00:08:13.046 --> 00:08:14.846
To start off, we import the Core

00:08:14.846 --> 00:08:16.986
NFC framework into the code.

00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:22.386
Here we adopt the delegate

00:08:22.386 --> 00:08:23.706
protocol in Table View

00:08:23.706 --> 00:08:25.016
Controller, which will handle

00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:26.716
the two required callbacks.

00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:30.996
They invalidate with error and

00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:33.236
detect NDEF.

00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:38.385
The invalidate with error

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:39.986
callback will notify your

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.486
application when a tag reading

00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:42.616
activity has stopped.

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:45.746
This can happen for a variety of

00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:46.326
reasons.

00:08:46.886 --> 00:08:48.556
For example, a tag has been

00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:50.246
successfully read in a single

00:08:50.246 --> 00:08:51.116
tag read session.

00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:53.536
The user has chosen to stop the

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:54.696
tag scanning activity.

00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:57.716
The 3-second timeout has expired

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:00.056
or the application is no longer

00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:00.756
in the foreground.

00:09:01.526 --> 00:09:03.766
The specific session object

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:05.186
provided in the first parameter

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:06.896
will be invalidated after the

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:07.926
function exits.

00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:10.276
A new reader session instance is

00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:12.146
required for additional tag

00:09:12.146 --> 00:09:12.446
reading.

00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:17.166
The detect NDEFs will be invoked

00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:19.136
every time an NDEF has been read

00:09:19.136 --> 00:09:20.226
from an NFC tag.

00:09:21.426 --> 00:09:22.816
Your application can then grab

00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:23.946
the payload from the NDEF

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:26.706
message, decode it, and handle

00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:27.996
the message as appropriate.

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:33.846
Finally, we have an extra method

00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:35.236
that links to the Scan button

00:09:35.236 --> 00:09:36.736
for starting a single tag read

00:09:36.736 --> 00:09:37.226
session.

00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:40.196
All you need to do is create an

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.136
instance of NFC NDEF Reader

00:09:42.136 --> 00:09:43.786
Session with your data gate,

00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:45.636
then invoke to begin method to

00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:46.776
start tag scanning.

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.926
If you wish to create a

00:09:48.926 --> 00:09:51.326
multi-tag reading session, set

00:09:51.326 --> 00:09:53.126
the invalidate at the first read

00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:54.316
parameter to False.

00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:56.606
If you need to stop an ongoing

00:09:56.606 --> 00:09:58.296
session programmatically, you

00:09:58.296 --> 00:09:59.886
can call the invalidate method.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:02.116
This will trigger your

00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:04.096
invalidate with error callback,

00:10:04.576 --> 00:10:05.476
letting you know that the

00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:06.396
session has ended.

00:10:11.566 --> 00:10:13.386
In summary, it is very simple to

00:10:13.386 --> 00:10:15.276
enable NFC tag reading with Core

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.766
NFC by following these steps.

00:10:20.276 --> 00:10:22.116
Enable the NFC tag reading

00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:22.846
capability.

00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:26.676
Make sure your Scan Usage

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:28.336
Description String is set in

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:30.426
your info P-list.

00:10:32.116 --> 00:10:33.906
Integrate the Core NFC framework

00:10:33.906 --> 00:10:34.566
in your code.

00:10:35.146 --> 00:10:37.776
And start reading tags.

00:10:41.576 --> 00:10:43.046
