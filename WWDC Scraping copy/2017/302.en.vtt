00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:32.506
>> Hi everyone.

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:34.986
My -- welcome to our session on

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:36.316
"What's New in iTunes Connect?"

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:37.796
My name is Daniel Meoh.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:39.356
I'm an engineering manager on

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:39.926
iTunes Connect.

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:43.536
So we're going to talk about a

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:44.876
number of new features today.

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:46.906
Some of these we launched

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:48.386
earlier this year and the rest

00:00:48.386 --> 00:00:49.466
will be rolling out over the

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.876
course of the rest of this year.

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:52.486
We're going to talk about

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.946
everything from responding to

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:57.366
customer reviews to new ways to

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.296
control how your app versions

00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:01.526
arrive in your customers' hands.

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:04.426
So let's jump right in and start

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:05.726
by talking about ratings,

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:07.116
reviews, and responses.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.406
Now since we did launch this a

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.006
few months ago, how many of you

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:14.976
have already used this feature?

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.508
[ Scattered Applause ]

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:20.266
Great. Well, whether you've used

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.416
this or not, I'm sure we can all

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.706
agree that directly engaging our

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.156
customers benefits everybody.

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:30.896
So before we talk about how to

00:01:30.896 --> 00:01:33.596
respond let's take a minute to

00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:36.056
think about why customers write

00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:39.246
reviews in the first place.

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:41.826
So sometimes our customers just

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:44.876
love our apps and they want to

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:45.686
let the world know.

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:49.106
Other times customers may be a

00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:51.416
little confused as to why maybe

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:53.436
you've included or not included

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:56.436
certain features or maybe around

00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:57.506
design decisions you may have

00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:58.000
made.

00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:02.156
And finally, we're all familiar

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:04.196
with this, customers often take

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.446
to reviews to let us know about

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:09.166
bugs or crashes in our apps.

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:13.736
Now no matter what the reason

00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:15.586
is, why customers write these

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:17.526
reviews, we have a great way for

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:18.246
you to respond.

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:20.986
Now here we see iTunes Connect.

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:23.126
This is where you've always come

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:24.136
to read reviews from your

00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:26.406
customers and now this is where

00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:27.706
you come to respond.

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:29.666
We're going to take a look at

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.166
our app, Forest Xplorer, which

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.946
is a fictitious app for a hiking

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.356
and trail navigation.

00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:38.146
So let's look for a review to

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:38.856
respond to.

00:02:39.716 --> 00:02:41.226
We're going to start by looking

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:45.086
for two-star reviews that don't

00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:46.886
yet have any developer

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:47.626
responses.

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:51.896
And here we have one that we can

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:52.676
take a look at.

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:54.416
It looks like we have a customer

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:55.526
that's been using our app for a

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:57.616
long time and just recently she

00:02:57.616 --> 00:03:01.126
went hiking and found that one

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:02.306
of the app -- one of the trails

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:03.856
that she was on was outdated.

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:06.206
Well, it turns out we released a

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:07.696
new version of our app just this

00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:09.666
morning and it refreshes the

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:10.936
trails in her area.

00:03:11.796 --> 00:03:13.946
So let's go ahead and let her

00:03:13.946 --> 00:03:14.866
know that.

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:16.346
We'll start the process by

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.066
clicking the "reply" button next

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.896
to her review, which brings up

00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:23.706
this modal where we can type in

00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:24.446
our response.

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:27.286
Here we'll let her know that we

00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:28.916
really appreciate her using our

00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:31.276
app for so long and that she

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:32.266
should check out the new version

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:33.526
we released this morning because

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:34.966
it should address her concerns.

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:38.316
Once we hit "submit" this

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:40.146
response shows up right under

00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:40.636
the review.

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:42.796
Now you may notice that the word

00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:44.406
"pending" appears next to the

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:45.416
response title.

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:48.106
All this means is that this

00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:49.666
response has not yet made it to

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:51.466
the system to show up on the App

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:51.806
Store.

00:03:52.406 --> 00:03:54.466
Once it does this word "pending"

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:55.286
will disappear.

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:56.886
For those of you who are

00:03:56.886 --> 00:03:57.986
wondering, this has nothing to

00:03:57.986 --> 00:03:59.106
do with app review.

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:02.586
Now one other thing to note here

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:06.306
is that every review only has

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:07.446
one response.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:10.146
So your customer can update the

00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:12.016
review as much as they like and

00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:13.666
you can update your response as

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:15.776
often as you'd like, but this is

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:17.276
not a threaded conversation.

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:20.426
So it will only be one pairing

00:04:20.486 --> 00:04:21.076
per customer.

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:25.216
Now once this response does make

00:04:25.216 --> 00:04:27.846
it all the way to the store your

00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:29.006
customer will receive a

00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:29.826
notification.

00:04:30.746 --> 00:04:32.316
This comes in the form of both a

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.136
push and an email notification.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:36.476
This notification is triggered

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:38.556
when you, as a developer, submit

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:40.876
your initial response or update

00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:43.046
an existing one after a customer

00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:44.166
has updated their review.

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:47.726
Any other times you update your

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:51.186
response will not trigger a

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:51.896
notification.

00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:55.996
On your end you can also opt

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:57.946
into an email notification.

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:00.186
This will be triggered when a

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:01.706
customer updates the review

00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:02.886
after you've responded.

00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:05.546
You can enable this by going

00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:07.226
into the "use/enroll" section of

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:08.166
iTunes Connect.

00:05:08.636 --> 00:05:11.696
All right, going back to our

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:14.266
scenario; here our customer has

00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:16.236
tapped the "update review" link

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:17.676
in the email notification that

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:18.376
she received.

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:20.756
This gives her the chance to

00:05:21.036 --> 00:05:22.616
obviously update her review.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:24.976
It takes her directly into the

00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:26.406
App Store to her review.

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:29.196
So it turns out our customer has

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:31.716
updated her app and it worked

00:05:31.716 --> 00:05:32.616
out really well for her.

00:05:33.076 --> 00:05:34.456
So she's decided to update her

00:05:34.456 --> 00:05:35.936
review to five stars.

00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:38.446
Once she hits the "send" button

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:40.576
we have another satisfied

00:05:40.576 --> 00:05:40.976
customer.

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:46.666
Now looking at some early stats

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:48.826
around this feature, we notice

00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:50.546
that all of the reviews that

00:05:50.546 --> 00:05:52.426
were updated after developer

00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:54.616
response, it was an average of

00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:55.916
about a one and a half star

00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:58.206
increase to these reviews.

00:05:58.996 --> 00:06:00.376
So that sounds like a great

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:01.946
reason to go out there and start

00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:04.816
engaging your customers.

00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:06.856
We also have a number of best

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:08.246
practices around this feature.

00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:12.076
First, customers of course like

00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:13.616
to know that they're being

00:06:14.276 --> 00:06:15.586
listened to.

00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:17.596
So stay on top of what they're

00:06:17.596 --> 00:06:19.476
saying and respond in a timely

00:06:19.476 --> 00:06:19.836
manner.

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:22.476
One way you can do this is to

00:06:22.476 --> 00:06:23.886
opt into those notifications

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:24.806
that we were talking about

00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:25.186
earlier.

00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:28.066
That way when customers update

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:29.396
their reviews after your

00:06:29.396 --> 00:06:31.006
response you can get a good

00:06:31.006 --> 00:06:34.706
feeling of how they 're reacting

00:06:34.706 --> 00:06:35.656
to your responses.

00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:40.516
Next, really listen to your

00:06:40.516 --> 00:06:42.846
customers before you respond,

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:46.306
and when you do respond, respond

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:47.636
specifically to the thing

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:48.686
they're talking to you about.

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:52.126
Try to stay positive and please

00:06:52.126 --> 00:06:54.346
don't use this to advertise or

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:56.156
to incentivize higher ratings.

00:06:58.476 --> 00:07:00.936
If you are responding or

00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:02.916
releasing a new version that

00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:04.036
addresses concerns that

00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:05.086
customers have been talking

00:07:05.086 --> 00:07:07.356
about, like features or bug

00:07:07.356 --> 00:07:09.526
reports, be sure to include this

00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:11.146
in your "what's new" text with

00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:11.926
your version update.

00:07:12.406 --> 00:07:13.716
This way as many customers as

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:15.656
possible will know that you've

00:07:15.856 --> 00:07:16.996
addressed their concerns.

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:18.926
You can also take this

00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:21.376
opportunity to respond to those

00:07:21.376 --> 00:07:22.386
customers so they can be

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:23.856
notified that a new version is

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:25.976
available to take a look at.

00:07:29.586 --> 00:07:31.296
And finally, if you do have

00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:33.146
sensitive customer information

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:35.846
please be mindful of the fact

00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:38.596
that this is a public forum so

00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:41.456
treat it that way.

00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:43.006
We have a new store kit API

00:07:43.146 --> 00:07:44.346
around this feature that allows

00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:46.516
you to collect both reviews and

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:48.156
ratings from directly inside of

00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:49.616
your apps without sending your

00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:51.026
customers to the App Store.

00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:52.726
So be sure to come to our

00:07:52.726 --> 00:07:53.736
"What's New in Store Kit"

00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:55.796
session tomorrow at 11 to find

00:07:55.796 --> 00:07:57.226
out more about that.

00:07:59.736 --> 00:08:01.186
All right, now let's talk about

00:08:01.186 --> 00:08:01.636
test flight.

00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:03.966
So test flight is our beta

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:04.916
testing platform.

00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:06.356
It allows you to distribute your

00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:09.296
prerelease app builds to testers

00:08:09.646 --> 00:08:12.166
to vet your builds before you

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:13.826
distribute them to the App Store

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:14.456
at large.

00:08:15.176 --> 00:08:15.926
Now we made a number of

00:08:15.926 --> 00:08:17.286
enhancements to this platform

00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:19.406
recently, both around how you

00:08:19.406 --> 00:08:21.176
distribute builds and how you

00:08:21.176 --> 00:08:22.056
manage testers.

00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:24.056
So I'd like to invite Tom Neglen

00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:25.356
up to the stage to talk to us

00:08:25.356 --> 00:08:25.946
about this.

00:08:26.516 --> 00:08:30.500
[ Applause ]

00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:32.035
>> Thanks, Daniel.

00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:35.416
I'm really excited to talk about

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:35.936
Test Flight.

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.236
In April, we introduced multiple

00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:39.966
build support.

00:08:41.236 --> 00:08:42.895
You're now able to distribute

00:08:42.895 --> 00:08:44.326
more than one build to your

00:08:44.326 --> 00:08:46.016
external testers at the same

00:08:46.016 --> 00:08:46.306
time.

00:08:46.856 --> 00:08:49.736
You can do this by organizing

00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:51.876
your testers into groups and

00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:54.176
assigning one or more builds to

00:08:54.766 --> 00:08:56.246
each group.

00:08:56.456 --> 00:08:58.236
Your internal iTunes Connect

00:08:58.236 --> 00:09:00.556
testers will now get access to

00:09:00.636 --> 00:09:01.776
all Test Flight builds.

00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:03.766
So when you upload a new build

00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:05.406
it's automatically made

00:09:05.406 --> 00:09:06.706
available to your internal

00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:07.206
testers.

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:11.036
We've also added individual

00:09:11.036 --> 00:09:12.926
tester metrics so you can see

00:09:13.336 --> 00:09:15.756
who is actively testing and who

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:16.886
is experiencing crashes.

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:20.186
Last, but not least, we added a

00:09:20.236 --> 00:09:21.516
"tester reinvite" button.

00:09:22.306 --> 00:09:23.806
It's really easy to go into

00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:25.546
iTunes Connect and send a new

00:09:25.546 --> 00:09:27.686
invite to a specific tester with

00:09:27.686 --> 00:09:28.246
one click.

00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:31.746
Now I'd like to show you what's

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:32.766
possible with these new

00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:33.236
features.

00:09:33.766 --> 00:09:36.716
Let's start with the simple

00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:38.946
example of using a group to send

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:40.116
a build to your testers.

00:09:40.636 --> 00:09:44.366
We can create a group by

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:45.726
clicking "new group" in the left

00:09:45.726 --> 00:09:48.266
nav and giving our group a name.

00:09:49.466 --> 00:09:50.326
We'll call this group "Beta

00:09:50.726 --> 00:09:50.976
Testers."

00:09:54.046 --> 00:09:55.036
Let's say we want to use this

00:09:55.066 --> 00:09:56.826
group to test major feature

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:57.206
changes.

00:09:58.166 --> 00:09:59.886
We might want to add our QA team

00:10:00.306 --> 00:10:02.376
or other individuals who don't

00:10:02.376 --> 00:10:03.916
mind finding an occasional bug.

00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:07.936
We can add testers to the group

00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:09.656
by clicking the plus button next

00:10:09.656 --> 00:10:11.636
to "testers" and selecting "add

00:10:11.636 --> 00:10:12.276
new testers."

00:10:12.856 --> 00:10:17.186
All that's required to invite a

00:10:17.186 --> 00:10:19.026
tester to our app is an email

00:10:19.026 --> 00:10:20.586
address and the name is

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:21.026
optional.

00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:27.036
So we've added some testers to

00:10:27.036 --> 00:10:28.656
the group, but they won't

00:10:28.656 --> 00:10:30.426
actually receive an invite to

00:10:30.426 --> 00:10:32.406
test the app until we've also

00:10:32.406 --> 00:10:34.106
added at least one build to the

00:10:34.106 --> 00:10:34.376
group.

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:38.086
And we can do that in the

00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:40.386
"build" sub tab by clicking the

00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:42.686
plus button.

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:44.076
We're given a dialogue where we

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:46.726
can browse all of our builds and

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:48.576
when we select a build we're

00:10:48.576 --> 00:10:50.256
given an opportunity to update

00:10:50.256 --> 00:10:52.016
the test information before that

00:10:52.016 --> 00:10:53.206
build goes out to testers.

00:10:54.546 --> 00:10:55.976
So we could add some notes here

00:10:56.106 --> 00:10:57.866
to let testers know what to look

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.966
for as they're testing this

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:02.066
build and if we've added a new

00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:03.676
feature or made some changes to

00:11:03.676 --> 00:11:05.286
an area of an app we might want

00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:05.976
to mention that here.

00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:10.946
And with that, the build has

00:11:10.946 --> 00:11:12.266
been added to the group and will

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:13.416
be delivered to our beta

00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:13.876
testers.

00:11:13.876 --> 00:11:16.406
So let's take a look at what

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:17.096
testers will see.

00:11:17.566 --> 00:11:21.506
Once they've been given access

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.086
to a build they receive an

00:11:23.086 --> 00:11:25.566
invite to test the app.

00:11:25.836 --> 00:11:27.656
We only send the invite once and

00:11:27.656 --> 00:11:29.306
testers won't have access to any

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:30.686
builds until they accept the

00:11:30.686 --> 00:11:31.000
invite.

00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:34.166
So here's what the invitation

00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:36.196
looks like and when testers tap

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.196
"view in test flight" it'll

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:37.966
launch the test flight app.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:44.136
Here, testers will be able to

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:45.756
accept the invitation and

00:11:45.756 --> 00:11:47.586
install the beta app.

00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:50.206
They'll also be able to see the

00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:51.876
notes we added on what to test

00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:55.106
and they can provide feedback by

00:11:55.106 --> 00:11:56.946
tapping "send feedback."

00:11:58.366 --> 00:11:59.846
Now let's say our testers have

00:11:59.926 --> 00:12:01.686
used our build for a while and

00:12:01.686 --> 00:12:03.066
they've given us feedback about

00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:03.776
a bug they've found.

00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:06.236
We could use the feedback to fix

00:12:06.236 --> 00:12:08.646
the bug and upload a new build.

00:12:09.336 --> 00:12:11.036
We'll want to add the build to

00:12:11.036 --> 00:12:14.086
our beta testers group and when

00:12:14.086 --> 00:12:15.876
we're prompted we'll want to

00:12:15.876 --> 00:12:17.116
update the test information to

00:12:17.116 --> 00:12:18.596
let testers know that the bug

00:12:18.596 --> 00:12:19.886
has been fixed.

00:12:21.696 --> 00:12:23.176
Once the build is added to the

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:24.986
group, it'll be delivered to our

00:12:24.986 --> 00:12:26.486
beta testers so they could

00:12:26.486 --> 00:12:29.816
install and verify the fix.

00:12:29.996 --> 00:12:32.086
So that's a simple way to use a

00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:33.566
group to send builds to your

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:33.886
testers.

00:12:34.816 --> 00:12:36.586
But aside from just finding bugs

00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:38.486
in your app, you might also want

00:12:38.486 --> 00:12:39.856
to use groups as a way to

00:12:39.906 --> 00:12:42.036
collect feedback, maybe from

00:12:42.036 --> 00:12:43.516
some of your power users who

00:12:43.516 --> 00:12:44.996
like giving feedback on early

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:47.156
iterations or maybe from your

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:49.216
CEO or potential investors.

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:52.096
You likely don't want to give

00:12:52.096 --> 00:12:53.716
them the same builds that you

00:12:53.716 --> 00:12:54.706
give your beta testers.

00:12:55.436 --> 00:12:56.606
You want to ensure that you've

00:12:56.606 --> 00:12:58.336
worked out all the issues before

00:12:58.336 --> 00:13:00.586
you send them a build.

00:13:00.776 --> 00:13:02.196
We can easily do this by

00:13:02.196 --> 00:13:04.046
creating an additional group.

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:06.436
Again, we'll click "new group"

00:13:06.436 --> 00:13:08.986
in the left nav and give our

00:13:08.986 --> 00:13:09.546
group a name.

00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:11.866
We'll call this group

00:13:12.276 --> 00:13:12.996
"stakeholders."

00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:15.886
We'll add some of our power

00:13:15.886 --> 00:13:17.856
users to this group and then

00:13:17.856 --> 00:13:19.266
when we're ready, we'll take a

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:20.776
build that's been thoroughly

00:13:20.776 --> 00:13:22.946
vetted by our beta testers and

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:24.026
add it to the stakeholders'

00:13:24.026 --> 00:13:24.276
group.

00:13:24.816 --> 00:13:26.276
The stable build will be

00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:27.896
delivered to our stakeholders so

00:13:27.896 --> 00:13:28.936
they could begin to provide

00:13:29.086 --> 00:13:29.476
feedback.

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:33.016
That shows how you can use the

00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:34.796
flexibility of groups to give

00:13:34.796 --> 00:13:36.106
different builds to different

00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:37.000
sets of testers.

00:13:39.646 --> 00:13:41.216
Taking this concept further, we

00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:42.446
can even create three different

00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:43.986
groups and give them names like

00:13:44.136 --> 00:13:46.636
"alpha," "beta," and maybe

00:13:46.636 --> 00:13:47.386
"release candidate."

00:13:47.916 --> 00:13:50.616
You could push frequent builds

00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:52.596
to your "alpha" group and insure

00:13:52.596 --> 00:13:54.876
that any issues are isolated to

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.106
the testers in that group.

00:13:56.676 --> 00:13:58.526
As your build becomes more

00:13:58.526 --> 00:14:00.486
stable, you could promote it to

00:14:00.486 --> 00:14:02.266
the larger "beta" group.

00:14:03.336 --> 00:14:04.866
And once you've reached the

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:06.016
level of confidence with the

00:14:06.016 --> 00:14:07.256
stability of your build, you

00:14:07.256 --> 00:14:08.656
could go onto promote it to the

00:14:08.656 --> 00:14:09.696
"release candidate" group.

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:12.636
Even if you've fixed all bugs at

00:14:12.636 --> 00:14:13.936
this point, you could still use

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.206
the testers in your "release

00:14:15.236 --> 00:14:16.776
candidate" group to collect

00:14:16.776 --> 00:14:18.166
further feedback before

00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:19.696
releasing a final version to the

00:14:19.696 --> 00:14:19.896
App Store.

00:14:24.056 --> 00:14:25.646
Another option would be to use

00:14:25.646 --> 00:14:28.586
groups for two separate lines of

00:14:28.586 --> 00:14:28.976
development.

00:14:32.156 --> 00:14:33.656
For example we can create an

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:35.316
additional group that we use

00:14:35.406 --> 00:14:37.036
solely for experimental

00:14:37.036 --> 00:14:37.546
features.

00:14:38.476 --> 00:14:39.816
And we can ensure that the

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:41.706
builds we add to this group are

00:14:41.706 --> 00:14:43.056
isolated from our standard

00:14:43.056 --> 00:14:45.196
releases and we can control

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:47.246
exactly which testers get access

00:14:47.246 --> 00:14:47.936
to these builds.

00:14:48.936 --> 00:14:51.186
So I showed a couple ways to use

00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:52.496
groups for build distribution

00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:53.566
and I'm sure you'll come up with

00:14:53.566 --> 00:14:53.826
more.

00:14:54.776 --> 00:14:56.176
Another example that I want to

00:14:56.176 --> 00:14:58.176
show is a way to organize

00:14:58.176 --> 00:14:59.836
testers before you even have a

00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:00.866
build that's ready for them.

00:15:01.606 --> 00:15:02.946
It might be nice to create a new

00:15:02.946 --> 00:15:04.476
group called "WWDC."

00:15:04.546 --> 00:15:06.936
You could add contacts that you

00:15:06.936 --> 00:15:08.856
meet at the conference who might

00:15:08.856 --> 00:15:10.346
later like to try a prereleased

00:15:10.346 --> 00:15:11.246
version of your app.

00:15:12.426 --> 00:15:13.526
They won't actually receive an

00:15:13.526 --> 00:15:15.216
invite until you have a build

00:15:15.216 --> 00:15:16.476
that's ready for them and you

00:15:16.476 --> 00:15:16.976
add it to the group.

00:15:21.106 --> 00:15:22.696
There's also a special default

00:15:22.696 --> 00:15:24.246
group called "iTunes Connect

00:15:24.446 --> 00:15:26.556
Users" and this is considered

00:15:26.556 --> 00:15:27.626
your internal group.

00:15:28.866 --> 00:15:31.396
Well, what does that mean?

00:15:31.536 --> 00:15:32.956
Only members of your iTunes

00:15:32.956 --> 00:15:35.066
Connect Team can be added as

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:36.356
testers to this group.

00:15:37.246 --> 00:15:39.616
And unlike other groups, members

00:15:39.616 --> 00:15:41.556
in your internal group will get

00:15:41.556 --> 00:15:42.816
access to all test flight

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:43.166
builds.

00:15:43.766 --> 00:15:45.226
So you might want to use this

00:15:45.226 --> 00:15:47.206
for your development team or

00:15:47.206 --> 00:15:48.616
those close to the development

00:15:48.616 --> 00:15:48.886
cycle.

00:15:48.886 --> 00:15:53.256
We've looked at a few different

00:15:53.256 --> 00:15:54.746
ways to organize testers and

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.066
give them access to different

00:15:56.066 --> 00:15:56.446
builds.

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:58.956
Let's take a look at how testers

00:15:58.956 --> 00:16:00.506
can interact with the builds

00:16:00.506 --> 00:16:04.096
that they have access to.

00:16:04.326 --> 00:16:05.566
Once they've been given access

00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:08.166
to a build -- I'm sorry -- in

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:09.816
the test flight app we always

00:16:09.816 --> 00:16:11.706
show testers the latest build

00:16:11.746 --> 00:16:14.556
that's available to them.

00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:16.406
Here they can see previous

00:16:16.456 --> 00:16:18.506
builds, but only ones that they

00:16:18.506 --> 00:16:19.306
have access to.

00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:22.516
They'll be able to see the notes

00:16:22.726 --> 00:16:24.736
on what to test and they can

00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:26.256
easily switch between versions

00:16:26.426 --> 00:16:27.556
by tapping "install."

00:16:28.986 --> 00:16:30.266
It's really nice to be able to

00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:31.366
switch between different beta

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:32.586
versions at any time.

00:16:32.966 --> 00:16:33.976
Our QA team really likes this.

00:16:38.046 --> 00:16:39.326
So let's take a look at tester

00:16:39.326 --> 00:16:39.806
management.

00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:42.616
Back in iTunes Connect under

00:16:42.616 --> 00:16:44.946
"all testers", we can see who

00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:46.666
has accepted the invite.

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:49.336
We could sort by status to find

00:16:49.336 --> 00:16:52.146
testers who have yet to accept

00:16:52.276 --> 00:16:53.996
and if we want, we can send them

00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:56.436
a new invite by clicking "resend

00:16:56.896 --> 00:16:57.066
invite."

00:16:58.676 --> 00:17:00.756
We also have a session count and

00:17:00.756 --> 00:17:02.466
this will tell us how many times

00:17:02.616 --> 00:17:04.786
each tester has used our app.

00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:07.935
If we want to remove a tester,

00:17:08.146 --> 00:17:09.256
we can easily do that by

00:17:09.256 --> 00:17:11.056
clicking "edit" and selecting

00:17:11.056 --> 00:17:12.386
the testers we'd like to remove.

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.736
Then we simply click "remove."

00:17:17.056 --> 00:17:18.486
Now, if you remove a tester from

00:17:18.486 --> 00:17:20.406
the "all testers" section, this

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:21.486
would remove that tester from

00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:21.816
your app.

00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:23.526
They'd be removed from all

00:17:23.526 --> 00:17:25.156
groups and would no longer have

00:17:25.156 --> 00:17:26.276
access to builds.

00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:28.746
You could, of course, simply

00:17:28.746 --> 00:17:30.186
remove a tester from a specific

00:17:30.186 --> 00:17:32.076
group and this would just remove

00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:33.746
their access to the builds in

00:17:34.666 --> 00:17:36.996
that group.

00:17:37.176 --> 00:17:39.166
Another metric that we have is

00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:41.016
the crash count and this will

00:17:41.016 --> 00:17:42.546
show us which testers are

00:17:42.546 --> 00:17:43.636
experiencing problems.

00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:45.426
And if they haven't provided

00:17:45.516 --> 00:17:47.176
feedback already it might be a

00:17:47.176 --> 00:17:47.956
good idea to reach out.

00:17:52.046 --> 00:17:53.626
These metrics are also available

00:17:53.626 --> 00:17:55.646
when looking at a group and the

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:57.326
numbers that you see will only

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.796
correlate to the builds in that

00:17:58.796 --> 00:17:59.000
group.

00:18:02.226 --> 00:18:03.336
So when you make builds

00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:05.296
available to testers they'll be

00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:06.826
installable up until they

00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:07.256
expire.

00:18:07.766 --> 00:18:09.736
When do builds expire?

00:18:11.296 --> 00:18:13.276
Builds will automatically expire

00:18:13.546 --> 00:18:15.336
90 days after they're uploaded.

00:18:15.906 --> 00:18:18.206
You could remove a build from

00:18:18.206 --> 00:18:20.016
distribution earlier by going to

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.286
the "build detail" page and

00:18:21.356 --> 00:18:21.976
clicking "expire build."

00:18:27.166 --> 00:18:28.496
This would prevent future

00:18:28.496 --> 00:18:30.186
installs, but testers who have

00:18:30.306 --> 00:18:32.196
already installed will still be

00:18:32.196 --> 00:18:33.706
able to launch the app until the

00:18:33.706 --> 00:18:34.826
original 90-day interval is

00:18:34.826 --> 00:18:34.976
reached.

00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:40.556
Also keep in mind you're

00:18:40.556 --> 00:18:42.606
currently limited to 2000

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:43.656
external testers.

00:18:44.716 --> 00:18:46.276
Later this year we're going to

00:18:46.276 --> 00:18:48.886
be increasing that number and

00:18:48.886 --> 00:18:50.086
we'll be increasing it to

00:18:50.086 --> 00:18:50.706
10,000.

00:18:51.516 --> 00:18:54.500
[ Applause ]

00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:56.406
We're really excited about this.

00:18:57.866 --> 00:19:00.646
So those are just a few tips to

00:19:00.646 --> 00:19:02.176
mention when using Test Flight

00:19:02.386 --> 00:19:03.516
to distribute prereleased

00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:04.856
versions of your app.

00:19:05.146 --> 00:19:06.386
You can find many more in the

00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:08.236
"Developer Guide" and you'll

00:19:08.236 --> 00:19:09.706
also find a link to the Test

00:19:09.706 --> 00:19:11.136
Flight Release Notes, where you

00:19:11.136 --> 00:19:12.326
can stay informed on new

00:19:12.326 --> 00:19:14.406
features and future STK support.

00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:16.526
With that I'll give the stage

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:17.176
back to Daniel.

00:19:17.416 --> 00:19:17.746
Thank you.

00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:23.500
[ Applause ]

00:19:26.116 --> 00:19:26.726
>> Thanks, Tommy.

00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:28.706
So those are some great new

00:19:28.706 --> 00:19:29.856
features we've added to Test

00:19:29.856 --> 00:19:32.456
Flight including the ability to

00:19:32.456 --> 00:19:34.356
distribute multiple builds to

00:19:34.356 --> 00:19:37.496
testers at the same time, group

00:19:37.496 --> 00:19:40.096
testers and distribute builds to

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.626
those groups, and of course the

00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:45.236
increase from 2000 to 10,000

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:45.826
testers.

00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:49.496
All right, now let's move on to

00:19:49.496 --> 00:19:51.356
talking about the new App Store.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.546
Now you've been hearing about

00:19:53.546 --> 00:19:54.546
this all week.

00:19:55.196 --> 00:19:56.366
We've gone back and we've

00:19:56.366 --> 00:19:57.646
redesigned the App Store from

00:19:57.646 --> 00:19:58.226
scratch.

00:19:58.806 --> 00:20:00.426
And we've done this not just to

00:20:00.426 --> 00:20:03.066
make it easier for customers to

00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:05.906
discover new apps, but also to

00:20:05.906 --> 00:20:07.536
surface the rich culture around

00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:09.566
our app ecosystem that exists

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:09.946
even today.

00:20:14.526 --> 00:20:16.466
It all begins on the "today"

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:16.816
tab.

00:20:17.246 --> 00:20:20.326
This tab is a daily destination

00:20:20.836 --> 00:20:22.186
that contains a collection of

00:20:22.186 --> 00:20:24.856
apps that are curated by our

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:26.866
editorial team into stories.

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:29.596
These stories tell customers not

00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:31.546
just what apps they love, but

00:20:31.546 --> 00:20:33.296
why they would love them.

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:37.576
By clicking or tapping on any of

00:20:37.576 --> 00:20:39.726
the icons on the "today" tab or

00:20:39.726 --> 00:20:40.916
anywhere else around the App

00:20:40.916 --> 00:20:43.706
Store you see the product page.

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:45.766
The product page is the home for

00:20:45.766 --> 00:20:47.756
one of our apps.

00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:49.166
Now the changes that have

00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:50.756
happened around iTunes Connect

00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:52.836
that effect the new App Store

00:20:52.996 --> 00:20:55.236
mostly surface on this page.

00:20:56.126 --> 00:20:57.046
So let's take a look at some of

00:20:57.046 --> 00:20:57.756
these changes.

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:00.756
First we'll take a look at the

00:21:00.756 --> 00:21:01.466
app icon.

00:21:02.646 --> 00:21:04.586
Beginning with iOS 11 and Xcode

00:21:04.586 --> 00:21:06.596
9, you'll no longer be managing

00:21:06.596 --> 00:21:08.446
your app icon in iTunes Connect.

00:21:09.276 --> 00:21:11.016
Instead you'll be including your

00:21:11.016 --> 00:21:14.216
icon in the asset catalogue of

00:21:14.266 --> 00:21:14.976
your app binary.

00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:20.500
[ Applause ]

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.396
Along with this change you'll be

00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:24.006
able to deliver wide gamut

00:21:24.246 --> 00:21:26.206
images for your icons that will

00:21:26.206 --> 00:21:28.296
be displayed in full fidelity on

00:21:28.296 --> 00:21:29.626
all supported devices.

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:33.196
And if you're working with

00:21:33.196 --> 00:21:35.166
multiple color spaces you can

00:21:35.166 --> 00:21:36.756
take advantage of Xcode's color

00:21:36.756 --> 00:21:39.076
management features to make sure

00:21:39.496 --> 00:21:41.996
your icons display accurately on

00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:43.436
all your target devices.

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:46.946
And thanks to app thinning you

00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:48.086
won't have to worry about the

00:21:48.086 --> 00:21:49.416
binary being delivered to your

00:21:49.416 --> 00:21:51.016
customer being unnecessarily

00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:52.356
large just because you've

00:21:52.356 --> 00:21:52.976
included an icon.

00:21:57.176 --> 00:21:58.156
Next, let's talk about the

00:21:58.156 --> 00:21:58.996
subtitle field.

00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:02.766
The subtitle is a new field

00:22:02.766 --> 00:22:04.126
that's meant to be a brief

00:22:04.126 --> 00:22:05.966
summary of your app's experience

00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:08.756
in a concise and compelling way.

00:22:10.076 --> 00:22:11.726
This field is up to 30

00:22:11.726 --> 00:22:13.226
characters in length and it's

00:22:13.226 --> 00:22:14.696
meant to compliment your app

00:22:14.736 --> 00:22:15.016
name.

00:22:15.786 --> 00:22:17.266
This means whenever your app

00:22:17.266 --> 00:22:18.796
name shows up around the store

00:22:19.276 --> 00:22:21.256
your subtitle shows up along

00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:21.576
with it.

00:22:22.286 --> 00:22:23.736
This could be the product page

00:22:23.736 --> 00:22:25.226
or the search page or any of the

00:22:25.226 --> 00:22:25.926
new tabs.

00:22:27.156 --> 00:22:28.366
Now many of you already include

00:22:28.366 --> 00:22:29.916
this information today with your

00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:30.366
apps.

00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:32.796
Your app name may look like

00:22:32.796 --> 00:22:33.500
this.

00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:37.066
Well, with the new subtitle

00:22:37.066 --> 00:22:38.216
field you can move this

00:22:38.216 --> 00:22:40.166
information out of your app name

00:22:40.836 --> 00:22:42.096
and really highlight your brand

00:22:42.096 --> 00:22:43.086
and let your app names

00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:45.616
standalone without sacrificing

00:22:45.616 --> 00:22:47.736
searchability or the context

00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:48.846
that the subtitle brings.

00:22:49.496 --> 00:22:53.906
As we move further down on the

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.556
product page, we get to app

00:22:55.556 --> 00:22:56.106
previews.

00:22:56.406 --> 00:22:59.596
With the new App Store you can

00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:01.566
submit up to three app previews

00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:05.006
and that's three previews per

00:23:05.006 --> 00:23:05.656
language.

00:23:06.216 --> 00:23:08.736
As your customers browse the

00:23:08.736 --> 00:23:11.116
store, your previews will

00:23:11.116 --> 00:23:12.466
automatically play bringing your

00:23:12.466 --> 00:23:14.506
apps to life and immediately

00:23:14.506 --> 00:23:16.126
engaging your customers.

00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:21.156
Below app previews, we see the

00:23:21.156 --> 00:23:25.166
description and prepended to

00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:27.326
this description is a

00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:28.586
promotional text field.

00:23:29.646 --> 00:23:30.936
In iTunes Connect, you'll find

00:23:30.936 --> 00:23:32.656
this new field that's always

00:23:32.656 --> 00:23:35.446
editable and is meant to contain

00:23:35.446 --> 00:23:37.176
frequently changing information.

00:23:38.006 --> 00:23:40.416
Today, you might let people know

00:23:40.416 --> 00:23:42.466
that your app is free for a

00:23:42.466 --> 00:23:44.106
limited time or maybe 40 percent

00:23:44.106 --> 00:23:45.316
off for a holiday weekend.

00:23:46.396 --> 00:23:49.086
Well, in the future, your

00:23:49.086 --> 00:23:50.986
description will be locked after

00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:53.666
app review, so please use this

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:54.836
field for this kind of

00:23:54.836 --> 00:23:55.386
information.

00:23:55.956 --> 00:23:59.656
And we have one more exciting

00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:01.346
feature that we'd like to talk

00:24:01.346 --> 00:24:03.126
about that allows to surface

00:24:03.126 --> 00:24:05.026
your in-app purchases directly

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:06.646
on the App Store and let your

00:24:06.646 --> 00:24:07.976
customers interact with those in

00:24:07.976 --> 00:24:09.366
app purchases right away.

00:24:10.356 --> 00:24:11.656
I'd like to invite Will Avrell

00:24:11.656 --> 00:24:12.666
up to the stage to tell you more

00:24:12.666 --> 00:24:12.976
about it.

00:24:13.516 --> 00:24:19.500
[ Applause ]

00:24:20.126 --> 00:24:20.646
>> Thanks, Daniel.

00:24:21.956 --> 00:24:23.036
We're extremely pleased to

00:24:23.036 --> 00:24:24.486
announce that for the first time

00:24:25.136 --> 00:24:26.496
we're making in app purchases

00:24:26.626 --> 00:24:28.116
discoverable on the App Store.

00:24:28.706 --> 00:24:28.806
[applause] Yeah!

00:24:29.776 --> 00:24:31.336
[applause] Give it up!

00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:34.046
[applause] In addition,

00:24:34.356 --> 00:24:36.056
customers will be able to start

00:24:36.056 --> 00:24:37.376
their in app purchase right on

00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:38.986
the App Store and be taken

00:24:38.986 --> 00:24:40.506
directly to your app to complete

00:24:40.506 --> 00:24:41.166
the purchase.

00:24:41.856 --> 00:24:42.986
Overall, we feel like this is a

00:24:42.986 --> 00:24:44.496
terrific way for developers to

00:24:44.496 --> 00:24:46.376
gain additional exposure for

00:24:46.376 --> 00:24:47.546
their in-app purchases on the

00:24:47.546 --> 00:24:47.966
App Store.

00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:50.466
So with that said, let's take a

00:24:50.466 --> 00:24:51.646
dive in and look at where

00:24:51.646 --> 00:24:53.266
promoted in-app purchases will

00:24:53.266 --> 00:24:55.566
be discoverable on the new App

00:24:56.636 --> 00:24:56.756
Store.

00:24:56.986 --> 00:24:58.916
So the first place that Daniel

00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:00.306
talked about is the product

00:25:00.306 --> 00:25:00.746
page.

00:25:01.236 --> 00:25:02.586
As you scroll down the product

00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:03.936
page, you'll find your promoted

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:05.956
in app purchases broken up in

00:25:05.956 --> 00:25:08.076
two -- into two distinct lists;

00:25:08.586 --> 00:25:10.096
your subscriptions and all

00:25:10.096 --> 00:25:11.566
in-app purchase -- all other

00:25:11.566 --> 00:25:12.586
in-app purchase types.

00:25:13.496 --> 00:25:14.636
It's important to note here that

00:25:14.636 --> 00:25:16.766
you are limited to 20 in app

00:25:16.766 --> 00:25:18.916
purchases per app.

00:25:19.316 --> 00:25:21.346
Also unique to the product page

00:25:21.346 --> 00:25:23.186
view is the ability to customize

00:25:23.276 --> 00:25:24.656
the order and visibility of your

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:26.646
promoted in-app purchases as

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:27.976
they appear on your product

00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:28.296
page.

00:25:29.066 --> 00:25:30.286
This means you can do things

00:25:30.286 --> 00:25:32.026
like hide subscriptions the user

00:25:32.026 --> 00:25:33.196
already has purchased on the

00:25:33.196 --> 00:25:35.126
device or if you have a puzzle

00:25:35.126 --> 00:25:36.276
game, you can show the most

00:25:36.356 --> 00:25:37.986
relevant levels earlier in the

00:25:37.986 --> 00:25:38.356
list.

00:25:38.906 --> 00:25:40.726
So for example, if the customer

00:25:40.726 --> 00:25:42.336
just beat level two in your game

00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:43.736
-- your puzzle game -- you can

00:25:43.736 --> 00:25:44.896
make sure that level three is

00:25:44.896 --> 00:25:45.936
the first thing that they see in

00:25:45.936 --> 00:25:46.496
this list.

00:25:47.636 --> 00:25:50.656
So moving on, promoted in app

00:25:50.656 --> 00:25:53.076
purchases are now searchable on

00:25:53.396 --> 00:25:54.956
the App Store.

00:25:55.176 --> 00:25:56.446
This means you can go to this

00:25:56.446 --> 00:25:58.216
search tab and you can search by

00:25:58.216 --> 00:25:59.796
the name or description of your

00:25:59.796 --> 00:26:01.236
promoted in-app purchase and see

00:26:01.236 --> 00:26:01.976
some results.

00:26:03.136 --> 00:26:04.386
Also we're adding a new

00:26:04.386 --> 00:26:06.536
"trending" section for promoted

00:26:06.536 --> 00:26:07.546
in-app purchase searches,

00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:09.826
similar to what exists today for

00:26:10.826 --> 00:26:10.916
apps.

00:26:11.476 --> 00:26:13.896
And finally, promoted in-app

00:26:13.896 --> 00:26:15.656
purchases are eligible to be

00:26:15.696 --> 00:26:16.826
featured by the App Store

00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:17.606
editorial team.

00:26:18.516 --> 00:26:20.116
This means that your app could

00:26:20.116 --> 00:26:23.136
be featured on the "today" apps

00:26:23.336 --> 00:26:24.246
or games tab.

00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:28.006
In this section, you get a nice

00:26:28.006 --> 00:26:29.176
little write up about your

00:26:29.176 --> 00:26:30.986
promoted in app purchase and

00:26:31.106 --> 00:26:32.286
tapping anything but the "buy"

00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:33.476
button here will forward you to

00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:35.536
the product page whereas

00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:36.906
clicking on the "buy" button

00:26:36.996 --> 00:26:38.236
will open the app and complete

00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:38.856
the purchase.

00:26:39.776 --> 00:26:42.186
So, I've talked a lot about what

00:26:42.186 --> 00:26:43.526
promoted in-app purchases are

00:26:43.526 --> 00:26:44.856
and where they appear on the new

00:26:44.856 --> 00:26:47.156
App Store, but let's discuss

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:48.456
what you as a developer need to

00:26:48.456 --> 00:26:51.066
do to implement and make an

00:26:51.066 --> 00:26:52.606
in-app purchase a promoted

00:26:52.606 --> 00:26:53.336
in-app purchase.

00:26:54.176 --> 00:26:56.096
So we've broken this down into

00:26:56.196 --> 00:26:58.256
three steps, the first two of

00:26:58.256 --> 00:26:59.376
which are managed in iTunes

00:26:59.376 --> 00:27:02.236
Connect, but critically you must

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:05.956
define some promotional data for

00:27:05.956 --> 00:27:07.346
your promoted in-app purchase.

00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:09.796
This is an image, a name, and a

00:27:09.796 --> 00:27:10.456
description.

00:27:11.696 --> 00:27:12.806
So these are the three pieces of

00:27:12.806 --> 00:27:14.436
information that are surfaced

00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:16.746
and visible on the App Store and

00:27:16.886 --> 00:27:18.326
because that's the case, they

00:27:18.326 --> 00:27:19.936
must be reviewed by the app

00:27:19.936 --> 00:27:20.476
review team.

00:27:21.716 --> 00:27:22.986
Also, you might be familiar with

00:27:22.986 --> 00:27:24.396
name and description, as these

00:27:24.396 --> 00:27:25.606
are fields that exist today in

00:27:25.696 --> 00:27:27.246
iTunes Connect, but we've

00:27:27.246 --> 00:27:29.256
adjusted the limits slightly and

00:27:29.256 --> 00:27:30.916
the new character limits are 30

00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:32.436
and 45 respectively.

00:27:33.696 --> 00:27:35.336
So once you've set up your

00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:36.586
promotional data in iTunes

00:27:36.586 --> 00:27:38.466
Connect you need to configure

00:27:38.466 --> 00:27:40.416
your in app purchase and you

00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:41.786
need to do things like activate

00:27:41.786 --> 00:27:42.756
it so we know to count it

00:27:42.786 --> 00:27:45.266
against your limit of 20 and you

00:27:45.266 --> 00:27:47.056
need to set a default order and

00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:48.646
visibility for your promoted

00:27:48.646 --> 00:27:50.186
in-app purchase as it would

00:27:50.186 --> 00:27:53.006
appear on the product page.

00:27:53.196 --> 00:27:55.056
Lastly, you need to implement

00:27:55.116 --> 00:27:56.926
some store kit APIs, well just

00:27:56.926 --> 00:27:58.986
one, but it is absolutely

00:27:58.986 --> 00:28:00.596
critical that you implement a

00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:02.736
single delegate method on the SK

00:28:02.736 --> 00:28:04.656
Payment Transaction Observer

00:28:04.656 --> 00:28:05.336
Protocol.

00:28:06.006 --> 00:28:07.326
If you do not implement this

00:28:07.326 --> 00:28:08.456
single delegate method, your

00:28:08.816 --> 00:28:10.406
promoted in app purchases will

00:28:10.406 --> 00:28:13.266
not appear on the App Store.

00:28:13.506 --> 00:28:14.996
So I mentioned the ability to

00:28:14.996 --> 00:28:16.236
customize the order and

00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:17.226
visibility of your promoted

00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:18.876
in-app purchases as they appear

00:28:18.876 --> 00:28:20.636
on the product page and that is

00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:22.086
accomplished through the SK

00:28:22.086 --> 00:28:23.586
Products Store Promotion

00:28:23.586 --> 00:28:24.416
Controller API.

00:28:25.536 --> 00:28:27.026
So again, like I said, using

00:28:27.026 --> 00:28:28.966
this API, you can show more

00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:30.016
relevant promoted in app

00:28:30.016 --> 00:28:31.516
purchases on your product page.

00:28:32.236 --> 00:28:33.346
I won't go into too much detail

00:28:33.346 --> 00:28:34.816
about how to implement this in

00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:38.296
code or the impressive array of

00:28:38.296 --> 00:28:39.946
options you can do with this

00:28:39.946 --> 00:28:42.366
optional store kit API, but be

00:28:42.366 --> 00:28:43.776
sure to check out the "What's

00:28:43.776 --> 00:28:44.906
New in Store Kits" session,

00:28:45.286 --> 00:28:47.326
which is tomorrow at 11 a.m. to

00:28:47.366 --> 00:28:48.596
figure out more about how to use

00:28:48.596 --> 00:28:49.966
these APIs and how to implement

00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:50.156
them.

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:52.846
So as I mentioned, the first two

00:28:52.846 --> 00:28:54.526
portions of implementing a

00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:55.856
promoted in-app purchase is done

00:28:55.856 --> 00:28:57.846
in iTunes Connect and I'd like

00:28:57.846 --> 00:28:59.596
to take this moment to demo for

00:28:59.596 --> 00:29:01.266
you exactly what it will look

00:29:01.266 --> 00:29:02.366
like to set up an in-app

00:29:02.406 --> 00:29:03.866
purchase as a promoted in-app

00:29:03.866 --> 00:29:05.346
purchase when this feature

00:29:05.346 --> 00:29:05.976
launches later this summer.

00:29:11.076 --> 00:29:12.426
So hopefully everyone's familiar

00:29:12.426 --> 00:29:13.566
with this view, but all I've

00:29:13.566 --> 00:29:15.596
done at this point is go to the

00:29:15.596 --> 00:29:17.266
iTunes Connect website and log

00:29:17.266 --> 00:29:18.116
in with my user name and

00:29:18.116 --> 00:29:18.576
password.

00:29:19.386 --> 00:29:21.666
So from here we're going to

00:29:21.666 --> 00:29:23.226
click on the "my apps" module

00:29:23.226 --> 00:29:25.906
and that'll take us to iTunes

00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:27.146
Connect and our my apps page

00:29:27.146 --> 00:29:28.146
where you get a nice little list

00:29:28.146 --> 00:29:29.136
of all of our apps.

00:29:30.136 --> 00:29:32.196
So we've been talking about

00:29:32.196 --> 00:29:34.346
Forest Xplorer and, in fact, we

00:29:34.346 --> 00:29:35.946
just launched a brand new

00:29:35.946 --> 00:29:37.016
subscription called Pro

00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:38.376
Subscription and we'd like to

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:39.936
make this promoted and visible

00:29:39.936 --> 00:29:40.646
on the App Store.

00:29:41.116 --> 00:29:42.316
So the first step here is to

00:29:42.316 --> 00:29:44.366
click on the Forest Xplorer app.

00:29:44.936 --> 00:29:46.356
This takes us into the app

00:29:46.566 --> 00:29:48.326
information view where we see

00:29:48.326 --> 00:29:49.456
some global information about

00:29:49.456 --> 00:29:50.396
our app as a whole.

00:29:50.396 --> 00:29:51.796
We can set our name, our

00:29:51.796 --> 00:29:54.356
subtitle, change the category.

00:29:54.706 --> 00:29:55.676
But this isn't really what we're

00:29:55.676 --> 00:29:57.046
concerned with here so we're

00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:58.276
going to click on the "features"

00:29:58.276 --> 00:30:00.516
tab and clicking the "features"

00:30:00.516 --> 00:30:01.946
tab automatically selects the

00:30:01.946 --> 00:30:03.846
in-app purchase left nav here

00:30:04.246 --> 00:30:05.546
and this takes us to all of our

00:30:05.546 --> 00:30:06.556
in-app -- purchases for the

00:30:06.556 --> 00:30:09.006
Forest Xplorer app.

00:30:09.006 --> 00:30:10.156
Again, I'm really concerned with

00:30:10.156 --> 00:30:11.816
the Pro Subscription so I'm

00:30:11.816 --> 00:30:12.476
going to go ahead and click on

00:30:12.476 --> 00:30:12.976
"Pro Subscription."

00:30:16.196 --> 00:30:17.816
Doing so took me into the in-app

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:19.976
purchase detail view and as we

00:30:19.976 --> 00:30:21.736
scroll down this page a lot of

00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:22.716
this should be familiar to you

00:30:22.716 --> 00:30:23.776
if you've used in app purchases

00:30:23.776 --> 00:30:25.516
in iTunes Connect, but there's a

00:30:25.516 --> 00:30:26.936
brand new section which is

00:30:26.936 --> 00:30:28.816
called App Store Promotion and

00:30:28.816 --> 00:30:30.166
this is how we begin setting up

00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:31.766
our in app purchase to be a

00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:32.996
promoted in-app purchase.

00:30:33.976 --> 00:30:35.256
So the first thing we have to do

00:30:35.256 --> 00:30:36.406
is upload an image.

00:30:36.556 --> 00:30:37.496
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:30:37.496 --> 00:30:39.726
click "choose file" and perfect,

00:30:39.726 --> 00:30:40.906
my image is ready right here.

00:30:41.396 --> 00:30:42.216
Let's just take a look.

00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:42.986
Yeah, that looks good.

00:30:44.116 --> 00:30:45.586
So we'll select this and

00:30:46.106 --> 00:30:47.386
immediately you'll notice that

00:30:47.386 --> 00:30:49.266
our image was masked and is now

00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:51.406
shown right next to our name and

00:30:51.406 --> 00:30:51.966
description.

00:30:52.346 --> 00:30:54.186
So this gives us a nice little

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:55.476
preview of what our promoted

00:30:55.476 --> 00:30:56.526
in-app purchase will look like

00:30:56.526 --> 00:30:57.226
on the App Store.

00:30:58.066 --> 00:30:59.316
Again, I'll just mention that

00:30:59.316 --> 00:31:00.676
since these three pieces of data

00:31:00.676 --> 00:31:02.016
are surfaced on the App Store

00:31:02.316 --> 00:31:03.696
they must be reviewed, even

00:31:03.696 --> 00:31:05.196
though our Pro Subscription in

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:06.646
app purchase is already approved

00:31:06.646 --> 00:31:09.756
and ready for sale.

00:31:09.976 --> 00:31:11.426
Additionally I'll talk to this

00:31:11.426 --> 00:31:13.456
checkbox right here, which is

00:31:13.456 --> 00:31:14.726
your default visibility.

00:31:15.336 --> 00:31:17.526
So in our case we have no plans

00:31:17.566 --> 00:31:18.946
to implement the optional store

00:31:18.946 --> 00:31:19.416
kit API.

00:31:19.936 --> 00:31:21.456
So it's best for us to leave

00:31:21.456 --> 00:31:22.646
this checked because if we were

00:31:22.646 --> 00:31:23.826
to uncheck this and not

00:31:23.826 --> 00:31:25.796
implement the store kit API, we

00:31:25.796 --> 00:31:26.706
would never override the

00:31:26.706 --> 00:31:27.896
visibility of false and it would

00:31:27.896 --> 00:31:29.016
never be displayed on the App

00:31:29.016 --> 00:31:29.296
Store.

00:31:29.296 --> 00:31:30.326
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:31:30.326 --> 00:31:31.066
leave that checked.

00:31:32.426 --> 00:31:33.986
Also, I noticed when I uploaded

00:31:33.986 --> 00:31:35.456
my image, my name and

00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:37.276
description field changed colors

00:31:37.276 --> 00:31:38.886
and that's because we introduced

00:31:38.886 --> 00:31:40.216
new limits for these fields.

00:31:40.476 --> 00:31:42.186
So my old name and description

00:31:42.236 --> 00:31:44.436
are longer than the allowable

00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:44.756
limits.

00:31:44.756 --> 00:31:45.666
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:31:45.666 --> 00:31:46.036
edit these.

00:31:46.036 --> 00:31:47.886
So I'm going to make this just

00:31:47.926 --> 00:31:48.976
Pro Subscription.

00:31:52.166 --> 00:31:53.226
And I'm going to remove the

00:31:53.226 --> 00:31:54.916
duration from the description

00:31:55.506 --> 00:31:55.596
here.

00:31:56.536 --> 00:31:57.476
So that's great.

00:31:57.476 --> 00:31:58.696
I'm now under the limits for

00:31:58.696 --> 00:32:00.176
both of these fields and I can

00:32:00.176 --> 00:32:01.336
go ahead and click "save."

00:32:02.696 --> 00:32:03.976
So I've set up the promotional

00:32:03.976 --> 00:32:05.196
data for this in-app purchase

00:32:05.706 --> 00:32:07.016
and I'm almost there, but I do

00:32:07.016 --> 00:32:07.916
need to configure it.

00:32:08.556 --> 00:32:09.556
To configure this in-app

00:32:09.556 --> 00:32:10.966
purchase and really make it a

00:32:10.966 --> 00:32:12.676
promoted in app purchase I need

00:32:12.676 --> 00:32:13.766
to go to the App Store

00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:15.036
promotions navigation here on

00:32:15.036 --> 00:32:17.226
the left and this takes me to a

00:32:17.226 --> 00:32:19.386
list of all my in app purchases

00:32:19.546 --> 00:32:20.886
that have promotional data

00:32:20.886 --> 00:32:21.826
associated with them.

00:32:22.356 --> 00:32:23.406
So you can see my Pro

00:32:23.406 --> 00:32:24.506
Subscription was added to the

00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:26.106
very top of this list, but it's

00:32:26.106 --> 00:32:27.516
not yet active, which means it

00:32:27.516 --> 00:32:28.756
will not be displayed on the App

00:32:28.756 --> 00:32:29.026
Store.

00:32:29.956 --> 00:32:31.356
So to activate my Pro

00:32:31.356 --> 00:32:32.796
Subscription, I simply click on

00:32:32.796 --> 00:32:34.366
the checkbox here and you'll

00:32:34.366 --> 00:32:35.456
notice that clicking the

00:32:35.456 --> 00:32:36.926
checkbox automatically gave it a

00:32:36.926 --> 00:32:37.866
sort position of one.

00:32:38.586 --> 00:32:40.276
So these orderings or sort

00:32:40.276 --> 00:32:41.716
positions are manageable by

00:32:41.716 --> 00:32:44.056
sliding each of these boxes.

00:32:44.316 --> 00:32:45.216
So I'm going to move it down to

00:32:45.276 --> 00:32:45.626
two.

00:32:45.626 --> 00:32:47.176
I'll move it down to three.

00:32:47.646 --> 00:32:50.366
And you can also click this

00:32:50.366 --> 00:32:51.416
arrow, which will conveniently

00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:52.426
take you to the very top of the

00:32:52.426 --> 00:32:53.266
list automatically.

00:32:53.826 --> 00:32:56.156
So as I mentioned, you are

00:32:56.156 --> 00:32:58.286
limited to 20 active promoted

00:32:58.386 --> 00:33:00.166
in-app purchases per app, but

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:01.546
you can have as many set up with

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:02.856
promotional data as you want.

00:33:03.226 --> 00:33:04.366
So potentially this list could

00:33:04.366 --> 00:33:06.806
get very long and to help manage

00:33:06.806 --> 00:33:07.886
that, we have a filter right

00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:08.446
here to the right.

00:33:08.446 --> 00:33:11.186
So you can filter promoted and

00:33:11.186 --> 00:33:12.536
not promoted in-app purchases.

00:33:13.996 --> 00:33:15.376
So we like the way this looks.

00:33:15.376 --> 00:33:16.366
We want our Pro Subscription

00:33:16.366 --> 00:33:17.566
number one in the list so we're

00:33:17.566 --> 00:33:18.526
going to go ahead and click

00:33:18.526 --> 00:33:18.936
"save."

00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:21.626
And that's how easy it is to set

00:33:21.626 --> 00:33:23.066
up a promoted in app purchase in

00:33:23.066 --> 00:33:23.876
iTunes Connect.

00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:25.266
At this point I'd like to give

00:33:25.266 --> 00:33:26.366
the stage back to Daniel.

00:33:26.366 --> 00:33:26.976
Thank you for your time.

00:33:27.516 --> 00:33:32.500
[ Applause ]

00:33:39.246 --> 00:33:39.736
>> Thanks, Will.

00:33:40.326 --> 00:33:44.276
So the ability to promote in app

00:33:44.306 --> 00:33:46.046
purchases will be available for

00:33:46.046 --> 00:33:47.346
all in app purchase types.

00:33:48.336 --> 00:33:50.126
And whether you have an iOS or a

00:33:50.126 --> 00:33:51.856
universal app you'll be able to

00:33:51.856 --> 00:33:53.346
take advantage of this feature.

00:33:54.606 --> 00:33:56.106
And, just like the rest of the

00:33:56.106 --> 00:33:58.216
new App Store, this will be

00:33:58.276 --> 00:34:00.246
available in iOS 11.

00:34:02.236 --> 00:34:04.346
Now let's move on to phased

00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:04.966
release.

00:34:06.466 --> 00:34:07.846
Now imagine with me for a minute

00:34:08.556 --> 00:34:10.295
that you're about to release a

00:34:10.295 --> 00:34:12.275
great new version of your app to

00:34:12.275 --> 00:34:12.746
the store.

00:34:13.545 --> 00:34:14.775
You put it through an extended

00:34:14.775 --> 00:34:16.866
period of beta testing and

00:34:16.866 --> 00:34:18.686
you've subjected it to multiple

00:34:18.686 --> 00:34:19.866
rounds of low testing.

00:34:21.016 --> 00:34:22.255
The moment you release it to the

00:34:22.255 --> 00:34:25.156
store, you watch your production

00:34:25.335 --> 00:34:26.755
environment crumble.

00:34:27.235 --> 00:34:30.926
Now we understand that

00:34:33.016 --> 00:34:34.636
production is always a unique

00:34:34.636 --> 00:34:36.136
environment, no matter how much

00:34:36.176 --> 00:34:36.906
testing you've done.

00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:40.136
And that's why we built Phase

00:34:40.136 --> 00:34:40.556
Release.

00:34:41.886 --> 00:34:42.926
So let's take a look at how this

00:34:42.926 --> 00:34:43.446
works.

00:34:45.856 --> 00:34:48.755
When you choose a version to be

00:34:48.755 --> 00:34:50.966
enabled for Phase Release and

00:34:50.966 --> 00:34:52.186
you push that version to this

00:34:52.186 --> 00:34:54.416
App Store, that version is

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:56.946
available immediately, just like

00:34:56.946 --> 00:34:58.046
any version is today.

00:34:58.696 --> 00:35:00.006
So if a customer goes to the App

00:35:00.006 --> 00:35:01.666
Store and does a manual update

00:35:02.126 --> 00:35:04.276
or downloads that app for the

00:35:04.276 --> 00:35:05.446
first time they will be

00:35:05.446 --> 00:35:06.866
receiving this newest version.

00:35:07.926 --> 00:35:09.196
Now the difference with Phase

00:35:09.196 --> 00:35:12.156
Release is that users who

00:35:12.396 --> 00:35:13.926
receive this version over

00:35:13.926 --> 00:35:16.866
automatic updates will receive

00:35:16.866 --> 00:35:18.886
it over a gradual seven-day

00:35:19.126 --> 00:35:19.566
period.

00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:23.946
So on day one up to one percent

00:35:24.266 --> 00:35:25.176
of your customers who are

00:35:25.176 --> 00:35:26.646
receiving this over automatic

00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:27.996
updates will have this available

00:35:28.026 --> 00:35:28.296
to them.

00:35:29.216 --> 00:35:30.666
By day two you'll be up to two

00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:31.136
percent.

00:35:32.086 --> 00:35:33.716
By day four; 10 percent.

00:35:34.856 --> 00:35:36.046
And when they get to day seven,

00:35:36.796 --> 00:35:38.466
all of your customers who are

00:35:38.466 --> 00:35:39.936
using automatic updates will

00:35:39.936 --> 00:35:40.906
have this latest version

00:35:40.906 --> 00:35:41.396
available.

00:35:42.446 --> 00:35:44.166
Now remember, if any of these

00:35:44.166 --> 00:35:45.646
customers do go directly to the

00:35:45.646 --> 00:35:47.636
App Store to either update or to

00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:48.816
download for the first time,

00:35:49.376 --> 00:35:50.846
during this period they will

00:35:50.846 --> 00:35:52.326
receive the latest version right

00:35:52.326 --> 00:35:52.656
away.

00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:55.236
So let's look at how we might

00:35:55.276 --> 00:35:56.646
set this up in iTunes Connect.

00:35:57.926 --> 00:35:59.106
So let's say we're about to

00:35:59.106 --> 00:36:00.816
release a brand new version of

00:36:00.816 --> 00:36:03.006
our Forest Xplorer app and we'd

00:36:03.006 --> 00:36:04.186
like to use Phase Release.

00:36:04.946 --> 00:36:07.836
In order to do this, before we

00:36:07.836 --> 00:36:09.806
release this version, we can go

00:36:09.806 --> 00:36:10.906
to the bottom of our version

00:36:10.906 --> 00:36:12.646
page and choose "release over a

00:36:12.646 --> 00:36:13.546
seven-day period."

00:36:14.886 --> 00:36:16.216
Once we've done this and the

00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:17.556
version is available on the

00:36:17.556 --> 00:36:20.086
store this area changes and we

00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:22.156
see a day counter instead.

00:36:23.296 --> 00:36:25.216
Under each day is a maximum

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:26.386
number of customers who will

00:36:26.386 --> 00:36:28.766
receive this over automatic

00:36:29.406 --> 00:36:29.626
updates.

00:36:31.096 --> 00:36:33.156
Now let's say on day three we

00:36:33.196 --> 00:36:35.456
realize that we have some

00:36:35.456 --> 00:36:36.766
concerns about production.

00:36:37.666 --> 00:36:38.626
At this point, we'd like to

00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:39.856
pause our phase release.

00:36:41.156 --> 00:36:42.256
In order to do this, we simply

00:36:42.256 --> 00:36:44.086
choose "pause phase release"

00:36:44.476 --> 00:36:45.516
from the radio buttons in this

00:36:45.516 --> 00:36:48.856
area and then this area turns

00:36:48.896 --> 00:36:49.256
gray.

00:36:50.226 --> 00:36:51.956
This means that no more of our

00:36:51.956 --> 00:36:53.566
customers are receiving this

00:36:53.616 --> 00:36:55.966
over automatic updates while

00:36:55.966 --> 00:36:56.576
we're paused.

00:36:57.646 --> 00:36:58.856
If customers go directly to the

00:36:58.856 --> 00:37:00.876
store, they will continue being

00:37:00.876 --> 00:37:02.496
able to pull the latest version.

00:37:03.146 --> 00:37:07.146
Now eight days later, we've

00:37:07.196 --> 00:37:08.916
addressed our performance issues

00:37:09.356 --> 00:37:10.986
and we're ready to resume our

00:37:10.986 --> 00:37:11.466
release.

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:12.896
So we simply, at this point,

00:37:13.366 --> 00:37:14.826
choose "resume phase release"

00:37:15.846 --> 00:37:16.816
and we're back in motion.

00:37:16.816 --> 00:37:20.666
Now we come to day five and

00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:22.266
we're confident that our

00:37:22.266 --> 00:37:24.236
production environment is ready

00:37:24.236 --> 00:37:25.436
to handle the full load.

00:37:26.266 --> 00:37:27.476
So we'd like to release this to

00:37:27.476 --> 00:37:29.756
all of our customers right away.

00:37:31.026 --> 00:37:33.136
In order to do this, we choose

00:37:33.456 --> 00:37:34.716
"release to all users" in the

00:37:34.716 --> 00:37:36.416
top right corner of the page and

00:37:36.416 --> 00:37:37.926
once we confirm this decision,

00:37:38.826 --> 00:37:40.566
this version is now available to

00:37:40.656 --> 00:37:41.856
all of our customers.

00:37:42.396 --> 00:37:45.336
The phase release is available

00:37:45.336 --> 00:37:47.976
to you today and no matter --

00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:54.646
[ Applause ]

00:37:55.146 --> 00:37:57.036
And no matter which version of

00:37:57.036 --> 00:37:58.436
iOS your customers are using,

00:37:59.186 --> 00:38:01.036
you can use this feature with

00:38:01.036 --> 00:38:04.166
all of them.

00:38:04.346 --> 00:38:05.366
And that's Phase Release.

00:38:06.346 --> 00:38:07.356
So we'd like to close out our

00:38:07.356 --> 00:38:08.956
session as we do every year,

00:38:09.246 --> 00:38:10.606
with some tips from app review

00:38:11.036 --> 00:38:12.906
about how to get your versions

00:38:12.946 --> 00:38:13.876
through review a little more

00:38:13.876 --> 00:38:14.456
smoothly.

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:18.406
So we'll start by talking about

00:38:18.916 --> 00:38:20.276
making sure your app functions

00:38:20.436 --> 00:38:21.906
throughout the review process.

00:38:22.886 --> 00:38:25.026
Now a lot of us have external

00:38:25.026 --> 00:38:27.556
services that our apps depend on

00:38:28.126 --> 00:38:29.046
to function correctly.

00:38:29.906 --> 00:38:31.346
So please make sure your

00:38:31.346 --> 00:38:32.986
external services continue to

00:38:32.986 --> 00:38:35.126
function, otherwise we can't

00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:37.156
complete the review of your apps

00:38:37.156 --> 00:38:39.506
that depend on them.

00:38:39.716 --> 00:38:42.186
Next, please run your versions

00:38:42.636 --> 00:38:44.626
on an actual device before you

00:38:44.626 --> 00:38:45.056
submit.

00:38:46.396 --> 00:38:48.786
Running on a simulator is not an

00:38:48.786 --> 00:38:49.566
actual device.

00:38:50.096 --> 00:38:53.566
Next, if there is any sign-in

00:38:53.566 --> 00:38:54.646
information that your app

00:38:54.646 --> 00:38:56.966
requires, please include this on

00:38:56.966 --> 00:38:57.866
the version page.

00:38:58.436 --> 00:38:59.966
We do get a lot of submissions

00:38:59.966 --> 00:39:01.266
where the sign in information is

00:39:01.266 --> 00:39:02.836
either missing or it's out of

00:39:02.836 --> 00:39:03.126
date.

00:39:03.686 --> 00:39:05.046
So when you do move from version

00:39:05.046 --> 00:39:07.026
to version please make sure that

00:39:07.026 --> 00:39:08.826
this information is current.

00:39:09.436 --> 00:39:13.806
If there are any obscure parts

00:39:13.806 --> 00:39:15.996
of your apps or just areas that

00:39:15.996 --> 00:39:17.706
are difficult to get to, please

00:39:17.706 --> 00:39:18.756
let us know in your app review

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:19.216
notes.

00:39:19.216 --> 00:39:20.486
If there's anything else we

00:39:20.486 --> 00:39:21.346
should know about your app,

00:39:21.346 --> 00:39:22.466
please feel free to use your

00:39:22.506 --> 00:39:23.706
field -- this field for that as

00:39:23.706 --> 00:39:23.976
well.

00:39:27.336 --> 00:39:28.746
And our binary compatibility

00:39:28.796 --> 00:39:31.016
team may reach out to you over

00:39:31.016 --> 00:39:32.886
resolution center if they have

00:39:32.886 --> 00:39:35.076
any concerns about your binary

00:39:35.076 --> 00:39:36.746
being compatible with say the

00:39:36.746 --> 00:39:37.106
OS.

00:39:37.566 --> 00:39:39.056
So don't be concerned if they do

00:39:39.386 --> 00:39:40.666
happen to send you a message.

00:39:41.236 --> 00:39:44.616
And finally, please use keywords

00:39:44.616 --> 00:39:46.546
that are relevant for your apps

00:39:47.116 --> 00:39:48.656
and keywords that you have the

00:39:48.656 --> 00:39:50.076
rights to use.

00:39:50.616 --> 00:39:53.536
[laughter] And those are some

00:39:53.596 --> 00:39:54.456
notes from app review.

00:39:55.536 --> 00:39:57.746
So in conclusion, we've talked

00:39:57.746 --> 00:39:59.226
about many new features that

00:39:59.626 --> 00:40:00.556
change the way you work with

00:40:00.556 --> 00:40:02.406
your apps, from new ways to

00:40:02.406 --> 00:40:04.186
distribute builds during beta

00:40:04.186 --> 00:40:06.716
testing to new controls over how

00:40:06.716 --> 00:40:08.386
you release your app versions to

00:40:08.386 --> 00:40:09.236
your customers.

00:40:09.746 --> 00:40:12.116
And once your apps are on the

00:40:12.116 --> 00:40:14.276
store we've created a new way

00:40:14.276 --> 00:40:15.836
for your customers to discover

00:40:15.836 --> 00:40:17.826
your apps and when your

00:40:18.046 --> 00:40:19.286
customers are ready to leave you

00:40:19.366 --> 00:40:21.146
feedback you now have new

00:40:21.146 --> 00:40:22.546
avenues to engage those

00:40:22.576 --> 00:40:24.586
customers and respond to their

00:40:24.976 --> 00:40:25.166
feedback.

00:40:26.146 --> 00:40:27.896
For more information about what

00:40:27.896 --> 00:40:30.786
we've talked about today and any

00:40:30.786 --> 00:40:32.576
related information such as app

00:40:32.576 --> 00:40:34.496
review, guideline updates, or

00:40:34.846 --> 00:40:36.236
changes to sales and trends

00:40:36.236 --> 00:40:38.696
around subscriptions, please

00:40:38.696 --> 00:40:40.406
visit this link.

00:40:41.536 --> 00:40:43.316
We also have a number of related

00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:43.836
sessions.

00:40:44.626 --> 00:40:45.896
If you are curious about how to

00:40:45.896 --> 00:40:47.606
work with your app icons in

00:40:47.606 --> 00:40:49.786
Xcode, please check out the

00:40:49.786 --> 00:40:51.166
"What's New in Cocoa Touch

00:40:51.476 --> 00:40:52.286
Session Recording?"

00:40:53.276 --> 00:40:54.886
We also had a great new session

00:40:54.886 --> 00:40:57.066
this morning that went into the

00:40:57.066 --> 00:40:58.486
design philosophy and the

00:40:58.486 --> 00:41:00.126
general thinking around the new

00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:02.196
App Store this morning called

00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:03.456
"Introducing the New App Store."

00:41:03.456 --> 00:41:05.166
So if you haven't seen that, be

00:41:05.166 --> 00:41:06.516
sure to check that out because

00:41:06.516 --> 00:41:07.616
it's very interesting.

00:41:08.546 --> 00:41:10.626
And tomorrow we have two store

00:41:10.626 --> 00:41:11.796
kit sessions; "What's New in

00:41:11.796 --> 00:41:12.416
Store Kit?"

00:41:12.766 --> 00:41:13.756
and "Advanced Store Kit."

00:41:14.756 --> 00:41:15.796
So if you want to learn more

00:41:15.796 --> 00:41:17.746
about the API side of the

00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:18.996
features we talked about today,

00:41:19.696 --> 00:41:20.586
come to those sessions.

00:41:22.716 --> 00:41:24.066
Thank you for attending our

00:41:24.066 --> 00:41:25.876
session and we hope that you

00:41:25.876 --> 00:41:26.496
enjoy the rest of your

00:41:26.496 --> 00:41:26.976
conference.
