00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:19.226
>> What are deep links, and how

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:20.716
can they be used to extend the

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:21.736
presence of your app?

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:23.586
Let's start with your app.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.226
It consists of information like

00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:27.076
videos, photos, or maybe places

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:29.096
and locations, as well as

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.586
functions like watching a video,

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:32.156
getting directions, or sharing

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:32.756
information.

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:34.866
The typical user experience

00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:35.896
involves knowing that the

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:37.496
content or function exists in

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:38.986
your app; then, navigating

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:40.456
through some hierarchy of use in

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:41.186
order to find it.

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:43.126
This is called the user journey

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:44.066
or user activity.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.516
Deep links are a way to offer

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.216
direct access to the content and

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:49.356
functions in your app.

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:51.526
The way it works is your app is

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:53.566
launched, you receive a link,

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:54.726
and the app displays the

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:55.206
content.

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:57.246
The same can be done to complete

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:58.236
a function in your app

00:00:58.326 --> 00:00:58.976
automatically.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:01.436
Here's an example of launching a

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:02.606
video from a deep link.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.296
Note the transitions to orient

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:06.876
the user where they are within

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:07.146
the app.

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:09.136
This helps the user establish

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.316
their place and subtly reminds

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.526
them of how they can navigate

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:12.866
back.

00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:15.606
The way you format a deep link

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:17.066
is called a Universal Link.

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:19.576
This is a secure mapping that

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:21.476
launches your app.

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:23.436
Best of all, they are universal,

00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:24.666
and if your app is not

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.896
installed, it can always fall

00:01:25.896 --> 00:01:26.676
back to Safari.

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:28.946
Here's what it looks like.

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.866
You have a scheme like https, a

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.046
domain, which is the same as

00:01:33.046 --> 00:01:34.626
your website, and a path to the

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:35.186
resource.

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.306
The way you get started with

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.456
Deep Links is you add an

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:41.036
entitlement for all web domains

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:42.046
that your app supports.

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:44.116
You create an app-site

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:45.786
association file, which is an

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:46.836
adjacent file which contains

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:48.276
data about the URLs that your

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:48.886
app can handle.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.276
You then upload that

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.866
app-site-association file to

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.346
your web server and implement

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.936
the continueUserActivity method

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:55.816
in your App Delegate.

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:57.126
This will pass you a

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:58.906
UserActivity object, which will

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:00.846
contain a URL for your Universal

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:01.116
Link.

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:03.256
There are many times you are

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.476
going to want a deep link to

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:06.016
somewhere in your app, and by

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:08.096
using Universal Links, you have

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:09.476
one clean and simple way of

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:09.916
doing that.

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:11.926
This presents many opportunities

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:13.566
to help new users discover your

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:14.636
app through its content.

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.186
For example, you can enable a

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:18.726
user to share content on social

00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:20.786
media, in messaging or email

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:22.106
with Universal Link.

00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:24.176
You can create those links on

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.796
the web, on your website, or

00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:26.866
others can link to it from their

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.936
website, and it can be

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:30.156
catalogued in Search like

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:30.636
Spotlight.

00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:33.656
Universal Links are also a way

00:02:33.656 --> 00:02:35.066
to encourage more engagement of

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:35.466
you app.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.306
The first way is to have your

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:38.996
app be recommended in Siri App

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:40.666
Suggestions and Hand Off by

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:41.706
registering your own

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:42.776
NSUserActivities.

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.666
You can create Deep Links in a

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.956
lock screen, which to make your

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:48.506
content, just a swipe and tap

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:48.836
away.

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:51.006
You can launch straight to the

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:52.566
content of your app from the App

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:53.986
icon with Quick Actions.

00:02:55.086 --> 00:02:56.396
If your app contains content

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:57.746
supported by SiriKit, you can

00:02:57.746 --> 00:02:59.266
map these to Universal Links.

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:01.856
Other apps can contain your

00:03:01.856 --> 00:03:03.586
Universal Links, which can pass

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:04.666
information to your app.

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:07.566
If you integrate with the TV

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:08.956
app, then you can use Universal

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:09.346
Links.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.286
A caveat here is that animation

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:13.126
is not necessary because the

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.596
system readies the interface for

00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:15.996
video content before launching

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:16.346
your app.

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:19.536
So, in summary, create Deep

00:03:19.536 --> 00:03:21.106
Links to all the app's content

00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:22.186
and functions that it makes

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:24.486
sense for; create a catalog of

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.176
these using Universal Links;

00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:28.406
expose all your links to

00:03:28.406 --> 00:03:29.816
increase discoverability and

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:31.006
engagement of your content.

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:33.086
Finally, when launching a

00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:34.896
Universal Link, use animation to

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:36.596
help keep the user oriented.

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:38.696
For more information, see the

00:03:38.696 --> 00:03:40.176
resource section of this video.

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:41.406
Thank you.
