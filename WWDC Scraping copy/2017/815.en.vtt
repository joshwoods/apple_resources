[ Background Sounds ]

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.996
>> I have a hunch that most of

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:26.186
you probably found yourself in

00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:27.156
this situation before.

00:00:28.706 --> 00:00:30.356
A long list of names, a lot of

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:33.666
scrolling, many doubts, until

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.686
you have to embrace the fact

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:35.386
that you don't know what you're

00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:36.576
doing, so you just wing it.

00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:39.116
But is there a better way to

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:39.636
pick fonts?

00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:41.476
Yes, there is.

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:43.866
You're probably familiar with a

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:45.806
San Francisco font, the system

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:45.986
font.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:48.896
It's minimal, functional, and it

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:50.496
provides great visual continuity

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:52.076
between the system and your app.

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:53.716
But sometimes, you need

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:54.436
something different.

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:57.026
Perhaps you want your app to

00:00:57.026 --> 00:00:58.096
exude sophistication?

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:00.266
Or feel literary?

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:02.506
Be awkward?

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.346
Or just loud and upfront?

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:09.776
How do you figure out which type

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:11.056
facing style is the right one

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:11.436
for your app?

00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:13.476
Well, you need to answer at

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:14.446
least two questions.

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.586
What is my intended use?

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:19.406
And this will touch on the

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:21.156
functional aspects, "What

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:22.346
impression do I want to make?"

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.026
This requires to look into how

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.446
style affects the visual mood of

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:26.106
an app.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.576
Once these questions have

00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:29.126
answers, you can stop thinking

00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:30.156
about the pairing of fonts.

00:01:31.506 --> 00:01:33.276
But first, I'd like to introduce

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:34.836
two terms in the context of

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.676
typography: Structure and

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:37.076
contrast.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:40.406
To better understand typography,

00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:42.296
it is usually helpful to look

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:43.106
into calligraphy.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:44.656
Calligraphy is the art of

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:46.136
writing, and to write, you need

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:46.356
a tool.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:48.616
For instance, here are three

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:50.586
commonly used tools around the

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:51.056
world.

00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:53.776
On the left, we have the brush,

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:55.616
which is essential to most East

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:56.606
Asian calligraphy and

00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:57.156
typography.

00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.526
In the middle, we have the

00:01:59.526 --> 00:02:00.826
Rodney pen or Kalamos.

00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:02.946
It has defined Roman letter

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:04.986
forms, the Arabic Naskh style,

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:06.556
or many index scripts.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:09.545
And on the right, we have the

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:11.196
pointed pen, the tool that gives

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.606
precise control of a stroke

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:14.276
modulation, a feature that

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:16.086
really shines with some Cyrillic

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.056
glyphs, for instance.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.876
But whatever the effect a

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:23.876
calligraphic tool has, it can

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.356
always be described in terms of

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:26.556
structure and contrast.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:28.746
And here's structure.

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.886
You can think of it as the path

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:32.176
a tool follows to achieve a

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:32.956
particular shape.

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:34.526
Those of us who like to be

00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:36.126
fancy, also use the Latin word

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:37.586
ductus to refer to structure.

00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:40.996
Now, to demonstrate contrast,

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:42.366
let me use a personal favorite

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:43.426
among the tools I just showed,

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:44.056
the pointed pen.

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.116
If I drag it across the screen,

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:48.386
I get a very simple line.

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:50.976
Now, if I do the same but this

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:52.716
time, pressing as I drag it, I

00:02:52.716 --> 00:02:53.596
introduce weight.

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:55.676
And this modulation of the

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:56.846
stroke is what we call

00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:57.356
"contrast."

00:02:58.516 --> 00:02:59.596
So, let's now apply this to

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:00.206
letter forms.

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:02.986
Here are two structures for

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:04.816
lowercase N, or two ducti for

00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:05.506
fancy people.

00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:08.516
The one on the left, can be

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:10.316
traced with a single stroke.

00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:11.566
This kind of structure is called

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:13.076
cursive, and is inherently

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:13.446
dynamic.

00:03:15.146 --> 00:03:16.506
The one on the right, requires

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.266
several constructed pen strokes,

00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:19.856
and therefore feels more static.

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:24.456
These monolinear designs have no

00:03:24.456 --> 00:03:25.476
contrast right now.

00:03:25.636 --> 00:03:26.516
So, let me add some.

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:29.636
As we add weight to the vertical

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:30.946
strokes, the difference between

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:33.196
thick and thin increases, until

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:34.536
we reach high contrast.

00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:38.196
If I now add weight to the thin

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:40.156
strokes, we move toward low

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:40.726
contrast.

00:03:41.246 --> 00:03:42.346
Now the main difference with our

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.046
starting point is mostly weight.

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:47.326
So, you may be thinking now,

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.316
"Well, this is all fine and

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:49.596
dandy, but why do I need to care

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.126
about this?"

00:03:51.386 --> 00:03:52.546
So, let's have a look at those

00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:53.496
two sentences.

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:55.316
At this particular size, the

00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:56.636
bottom line is much easier to

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:57.346
read than the top line.

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:00.256
And we can easily understand why

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:01.466
if we look closer at each

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:01.826
design.

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.366
On top, we have Big Caslon.

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:07.586
And below, Adobe Caslon prompt.

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:11.136
Both designs are revivals of the

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:12.456
work of British type founder

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:14.466
William Caslon, but one is

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:15.816
designed for this play, and the

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:16.776
other one for text.

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:18.946
Now what does this mean,

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:19.426
exactly?

00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:25.836
The thin strokes in Big Caslon,

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:28.386
produce high contrast, which is

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:29.616
an appealing graphical feature.

00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:31.256
It looks sharp.

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:32.966
But if you scale it down, the

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:34.196
thin strokes will eventually

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:35.516
disappear and will make reading

00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:36.546
quite unpleasant, if not

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.126
impossible.

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:40.416
On the other hand, Adobe Caslon

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:42.296
Pro has lower contrast and can

00:04:42.296 --> 00:04:43.686
be used as smaller point sizes,

00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:45.016
because of its sturdier design.

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:47.166
And now the key difference

00:04:47.196 --> 00:04:48.656
between those two designs is

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:49.126
spacing.

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:51.696
For optical reasons, reading

00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:53.476
stays comfortable if the space

00:04:53.506 --> 00:04:55.566
between letters increases as the

00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:56.846
point size decreases.

00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:59.816
Adobe Caslon Pro has looser

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:01.516
spacing and this contributes to

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:03.076
a nicer reading experience at

00:05:03.076 --> 00:05:03.666
smaller size.

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:07.506
Display and text are really just

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:09.206
loose terms describing usage.

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:11.766
This play type is meant to draw

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:12.276
attention.

00:05:13.136 --> 00:05:14.346
So, you typically use it at

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.726
bigger point sizes, which in

00:05:16.456 --> 00:05:18.586
turn allows you to use styles

00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:20.176
with more high -- with higher

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:21.656
contrast and more elaborate

00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:22.006
details.

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:23.756
Text type is about making the

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.386
reading experience comfortable.

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:29.096
When picking a text font, you'll

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.486
want to make sure the contrast

00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:32.246
of the type face is such that it

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:33.506
will scale down nicely.

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:35.406
The spacing should also feel

00:05:35.406 --> 00:05:36.586
comfortable at small size.

00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:38.946
And in general, try avoiding

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:40.476
extremes of weight or style.

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:42.006
A good reading experience is

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:42.786
usually the one you don't

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:43.176
notice.

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:46.246
For display, you have more

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:46.646
freedom.

00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:48.406
This is the right place to use

00:05:48.406 --> 00:05:49.936
the more extreme weights or

00:05:49.936 --> 00:05:50.766
decorative styles.

00:05:51.446 --> 00:05:52.916
Even in display though, stay

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:54.006
aware of spacing.

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:55.956
A headline usually looks better

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:56.816
if it's tightly spaced.

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:00.686
Alright, now let's talk about

00:06:00.686 --> 00:06:01.486
what everyone is really

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.776
interested in, style.

00:06:03.786 --> 00:06:04.886
Becoming better at selecting

00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:06.426
fonts as with most things,

00:06:06.426 --> 00:06:07.296
requires practice.

00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:08.896
There's a lot of stuff to learn

00:06:08.896 --> 00:06:10.016
and it's perfectly normal to

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:11.036
feel overwhelmed at first.

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:13.336
But there's really only one way

00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:13.846
forward.

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:15.356
You need to learn how style

00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:16.356
produces an impression.

00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:19.236
Remember that app I called

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:20.706
sophisticated in my intro?

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.706
Well, I picked that term but

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:24.126
it's by no means a universal

00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:24.846
qualification.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.216
What style conveys is strongly

00:06:28.326 --> 00:06:29.756
tied to subjectivity, and will

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.166
vary from one person to another.

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:33.076
There is one thing you can learn

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:34.686
about though, and that is what

00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:36.476
people come to associate with a

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:37.076
given style.

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:38.546
In other words, their

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:39.356
expectations.

00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:41.306
So, let's look at the type face

00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:42.346
used for the name of the app,

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:42.806
Cochin.

00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:45.476
The style itself is called

00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:46.796
transitional old style.

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:48.596
Most of you probably never heard

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:50.096
of it, but you've likely been

00:06:50.096 --> 00:06:51.626
exposed to it in books and/or

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:52.166
magazines.

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:55.066
Cochin has very small, lowercase

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.116
letters compared to the upper

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:56.556
case.

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:58.246
This gives a classic appearance,

00:06:58.946 --> 00:07:00.476
which will feel elegant to a lot

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:00.946
of people.

00:07:01.836 --> 00:07:03.046
But these proportions also

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:04.616
happen to be exaggerated, and

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:05.466
that makes it feel a bit

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:05.986
whimsical.

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:09.096
The companion to Cochin, Snell

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:10.616
Roundhand, is a design mimicking

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:11.116
calligraphy.

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:13.016
And you don't have to be a

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.256
calligrapher to get a sense of

00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:15.686
how much skill this calligraphic

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:16.406
style demands.

00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:18.456
It's elaborate structure and

00:07:18.516 --> 00:07:19.766
high contrast, lends some

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.966
preciousness to this design.

00:07:21.856 --> 00:07:24.106
So, if I round them up, I have

00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:26.146
elegant, whimsical, elaborate,

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:26.826
and precious.

00:07:27.106 --> 00:07:28.306
How's that for sophistication?

00:07:29.956 --> 00:07:32.076
So, why now would this feel

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:32.756
literary?

00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:35.016
The two typefaces we're looking

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:36.446
at right now, although there is

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:38.336
a display, and a textile, both

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:39.646
have typical features of a

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:40.706
classical book face.

00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:43.406
That's why we feel inclined to

00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:44.826
look at this choice as literary.

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:47.916
But that kind of association is

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:49.546
not natural at all.

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:50.696
It just comes from the fact that

00:07:50.696 --> 00:07:52.266
most of us have been exposed to

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:53.496
those styles in books.

00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:56.276
To complete this brief study in

00:07:56.356 --> 00:07:57.926
style, I'd like to look at the

00:07:57.926 --> 00:07:59.196
fame and crazed geometric

00:07:59.196 --> 00:07:59.846
sans-serif.

00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:01.946
This is a great example of how

00:08:01.946 --> 00:08:03.456
the feel of a typographic style

00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:05.346
comes both from form and usage.

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.326
The first appeal of that style

00:08:07.326 --> 00:08:08.856
is probably -- it's very simple,

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.686
geometry, and I'll venture into

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.126
saying that we've seen renewed

00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:13.546
interest recently in that style

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:14.966
because of our current design

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:16.316
infatuation with simplicity.

00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:19.696
But because this style is all

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:20.746
over the place right now, you

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:21.976
may be inclined to think that it

00:08:21.976 --> 00:08:23.186
feels very contemporary and

00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:23.656
fresh.

00:08:24.556 --> 00:08:25.976
But the nerd in me disagrees.

00:08:27.286 --> 00:08:28.676
This style is almost 100 years

00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:28.986
old.

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.316
And don't get me wrong, I love

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:32.236
old stuff, but I just won't call

00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:32.806
it fresh.

00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:35.296
But that's the beauty of style.

00:08:35.356 --> 00:08:37.275
It has many layers, and new

00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:38.326
layers of meaning get added

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:39.056
constantly.

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:41.196
To become better at picking font

00:08:41.196 --> 00:08:42.866
styles, you need to become aware

00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:44.556
of those layers, old and new.

00:08:47.336 --> 00:08:49.546
So, with our growing knowledge

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:51.096
of typographic style, let's look

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:52.356
at a few strategies to pair

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:52.716
fonts.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.816
Note the use of the verb "pair"

00:08:54.816 --> 00:08:55.086
here.

00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:56.746
There is no rule against using

00:08:56.746 --> 00:08:58.416
more than two typefaces, but

00:08:58.416 --> 00:08:59.356
trust me, you're better off

00:08:59.356 --> 00:09:00.106
starting small.

00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:02.166
You can always add style later

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.286
on if you really need them.

00:09:04.846 --> 00:09:05.966
The first point I'd like to make

00:09:06.016 --> 00:09:07.416
here, is about the impact of

00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:09.016
proportions when pairing fonts.

00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:12.426
Let's imagine for a moment, you

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:13.946
have to design an app for WWSC,

00:09:13.946 --> 00:09:16.526
the Worldwide Sign Painters

00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:17.016
Conference.

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.316
You start off nice and easy with

00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:21.186
this system font, but we're

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.666
missing that sign paintery-vibe.

00:09:23.366 --> 00:09:24.836
So, we go back to the font menu

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:26.876
and I kid you not, there's a

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:28.236
sign painter typeface in there.

00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:30.496
Sounds like a perfect match,

00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:30.736
right?

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:35.526
Well, I should mention that us

00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:36.816
type nerds have a term for that

00:09:36.816 --> 00:09:37.376
situation.

00:09:39.376 --> 00:09:40.976
When someone picks a typeface by

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.006
its name, we call that an LTypI,

00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:44.656
or Lack of Typographic

00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:45.286
Imagination.

00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:48.276
There's nothing wrong with it,

00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:49.666
but picking feature out just

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:50.586
because your app is about the

00:09:50.586 --> 00:09:51.856
future might be too much of a

00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:52.346
shortcut.

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:54.446
So, if you're going to pick it,

00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:56.246
make sure it's because the style

00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:57.906
is appropriate and it serves its

00:09:57.906 --> 00:09:59.536
functional purpose.

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:00.976
At the end of the day, a

00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:01.746
[inaudible] should really just

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:02.986
be the cherry on top of the

00:10:02.986 --> 00:10:03.246
cake.

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:06.126
So, back to this cherry, I'll

00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:07.116
risk offending a few of my

00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:07.616
peers.

00:10:09.956 --> 00:10:11.286
You start working on a schedule

00:10:11.286 --> 00:10:12.946
for the event, and you decide to

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.076
use both fonts for typographic

00:10:15.076 --> 00:10:16.756
contrast, SF and sign painter.

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:19.106
But something's off.

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:20.696
The title's look smaller.

00:10:21.546 --> 00:10:22.896
And to make them look matched,

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:24.216
we'll have to increase the point

00:10:24.216 --> 00:10:25.546
size on that sign painter style.

00:10:26.586 --> 00:10:27.716
Now, where does this difference

00:10:27.756 --> 00:10:28.136
come from?

00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:31.556
Type designers draw glyphs

00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:32.776
within the bounds of a virtual

00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.416
box called a font body.

00:10:35.326 --> 00:10:36.706
Inside this box, proportion will

00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.106
vary from one design to another.

00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:41.646
The height of a font's body is

00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:42.856
what is referred to as the point

00:10:42.886 --> 00:10:43.106
size.

00:10:43.656 --> 00:10:45.526
So, at the same point size, two

00:10:45.526 --> 00:10:46.516
fonts can appear to have

00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:48.096
different scales because of

00:10:48.096 --> 00:10:48.506
their design.

00:10:49.726 --> 00:10:51.036
Let me show you how this could

00:10:51.036 --> 00:10:51.676
be relevant.

00:10:53.756 --> 00:10:54.736
Let's say you're working on a

00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:55.356
dictionary app.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:57.426
Dictionaries require a lot of

00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:59.256
typographic hierarchy, and using

00:10:59.256 --> 00:11:01.296
only the weights and italics of

00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:01.836
a [inaudible] might not be

00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:02.116
enough.

00:11:02.886 --> 00:11:03.826
You have those descriptives

00:11:03.826 --> 00:11:04.856
stand out, for instance.

00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:07.306
So, we decide to go look for a

00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:08.546
serif typeface to create

00:11:08.546 --> 00:11:09.586
typographic contrast.

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:11.686
And to try and avoid to tweak

00:11:11.686 --> 00:11:12.936
point sizes left and right,

00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:14.396
let's find a serif typeface that

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:15.736
has close proportions to the

00:11:15.736 --> 00:11:17.346
[inaudible].

00:11:17.346 --> 00:11:18.836
This is easily done by setting

00:11:18.836 --> 00:11:20.116
all candidates side by side.

00:11:20.116 --> 00:11:21.426
They're the same point size and

00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:22.806
evaluating their apparent scale.

00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:24.776
There is nothing wrong with

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:26.546
picking a typeface of smaller or

00:11:26.546 --> 00:11:28.406
greater scale, but just bear in

00:11:28.406 --> 00:11:29.436
mind that you'll have to adjust

00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:31.116
point size if you go with that

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:31.436
twice.

00:11:32.056 --> 00:11:33.166
So, let's make our life easier

00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:34.326
here and look for the closest

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:34.936
match available.

00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:36.316
And we have a winner.

00:11:37.156 --> 00:11:39.166
Now, bringing that back in our

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.096
layout, we introduce typographic

00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:43.536
contrast, and we're done.

00:11:43.846 --> 00:11:45.196
No need to tweak point sizes.

00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:46.886
If you're worried that this

00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:47.786
approach might limit your

00:11:47.786 --> 00:11:49.426
stylistic options, please don't.

00:11:50.016 --> 00:11:51.056
There are thousands of good

00:11:51.116 --> 00:11:52.506
typefaces out there, and quite a

00:11:52.506 --> 00:11:53.806
few type designers release from

00:11:53.806 --> 00:11:55.486
families, with multiple styles

00:11:55.726 --> 00:11:56.966
of consistent proportions.

00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:00.946
So, let's now experiment a bit

00:12:01.046 --> 00:12:02.806
with pairing text and display

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:03.176
styles.

00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:05.456
So, let's start nice and easy

00:12:05.456 --> 00:12:06.836
again with a [inaudible] in a

00:12:06.836 --> 00:12:07.856
news story layout.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:09.896
This typographic layout has

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.516
strong stylistic continuity.

00:12:11.746 --> 00:12:13.106
The only difference between text

00:12:13.106 --> 00:12:14.846
and headline, are size and the

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:15.616
use of italics.

00:12:16.686 --> 00:12:17.896
But we might be after something

00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:18.956
with a bit more of a punch.

00:12:19.886 --> 00:12:21.626
And the first way to get there,

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.066
the easiest way to get there, is

00:12:23.066 --> 00:12:24.006
to first leverage weight.

00:12:25.186 --> 00:12:26.586
Sticking to a single typeface

00:12:26.586 --> 00:12:27.896
and pairing some of its variant,

00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:29.306
is a very efficient way to

00:12:29.306 --> 00:12:30.536
achieve design consistency.

00:12:31.426 --> 00:12:32.196
But since we're here to

00:12:32.196 --> 00:12:33.796
experiment, let's keep on trying

00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:34.076
things.

00:12:37.126 --> 00:12:38.376
We now change the kind of

00:12:38.476 --> 00:12:40.116
typographic contrast from a

00:12:40.116 --> 00:12:41.766
weight difference to a stylistic

00:12:41.766 --> 00:12:42.336
difference.

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:43.616
When doing these kind of

00:12:43.706 --> 00:12:45.056
pairings, make sure that the

00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:46.576
stylistic difference is strong

00:12:46.576 --> 00:12:47.836
enough to be obvious.

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:50.516
Here we have two typestyles of

00:12:50.516 --> 00:12:52.166
both different structures, and

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:54.056
stroke contrast, so we're in a

00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:54.516
good place.

00:12:57.346 --> 00:12:58.986
By the way, it is sometimes good

00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:00.826
enough to have a strong display

00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:03.596
typeface and using the system

00:13:03.636 --> 00:13:04.596
font at the same time.

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:06.366
You're defining your own style,

00:13:06.416 --> 00:13:08.136
but also taking advantage of

00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:09.176
[inaudible] performance as a

00:13:09.176 --> 00:13:10.356
typographic workhorse.

00:13:12.716 --> 00:13:13.916
But let's keep on experimenting

00:13:13.916 --> 00:13:14.336
anyway.

00:13:14.556 --> 00:13:15.736
I think I'd like to use a serif

00:13:15.736 --> 00:13:17.876
typeface down there.

00:13:18.836 --> 00:13:20.426
We return to an understated and

00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:21.856
calm effect like we had in the

00:13:21.856 --> 00:13:23.206
beginning, but with a quite

00:13:23.206 --> 00:13:23.856
different flavor.

00:13:24.696 --> 00:13:26.246
This will now feel more bookish

00:13:26.246 --> 00:13:27.546
because of the type choice, but

00:13:27.546 --> 00:13:28.776
also because of the subdued

00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:30.486
relationship between display and

00:13:30.536 --> 00:13:30.746
text.

00:13:31.496 --> 00:13:33.016
Books tend to go from

00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:34.186
[inaudible] typographic contrast

00:13:34.186 --> 00:13:35.436
because they're about long

00:13:35.436 --> 00:13:36.886
reading, and of grabbing your

00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:37.596
attention all the time.

00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:40.096
On the other hand, a news layout

00:13:40.146 --> 00:13:41.776
may be more [inaudible] this.

00:13:42.596 --> 00:13:44.236
Here we're using san serif for

00:13:44.236 --> 00:13:46.006
both display and textiles, but

00:13:46.056 --> 00:13:47.486
their structuring weights are so

00:13:47.486 --> 00:13:49.096
different that we still maintain

00:13:49.156 --> 00:13:50.616
clear and strong typographic

00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:51.006
contrast.

00:13:51.856 --> 00:13:53.066
The display style grabbed your

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:54.566
attention, provides context,

00:13:54.926 --> 00:13:55.816
this is what you're about to

00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:57.696
read, and makes the layout look

00:13:57.696 --> 00:13:59.696
appealing and then the textile

00:13:59.816 --> 00:14:01.166
will let you read the content

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:02.226
with ease and without

00:14:02.226 --> 00:14:02.726
disruption.

00:14:04.896 --> 00:14:05.976
So, as you've now seen, there's

00:14:05.976 --> 00:14:07.466
obviously a lot you can do in

00:14:07.516 --> 00:14:08.486
terms of style pairing.

00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:09.666
And I've only given you a

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.006
glimpse of the possibilities of

00:14:11.036 --> 00:14:11.296
course.

00:14:12.116 --> 00:14:13.486
The key element is typographic

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:13.986
contrast.

00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:15.476
Whether I did it through size,

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:16.876
weight, or style.

00:14:17.846 --> 00:14:18.966
Finally, if you want to become

00:14:18.966 --> 00:14:20.356
better at picking fonts, there

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:21.806
is really no way around learning

00:14:21.806 --> 00:14:23.246
more about typographic styles,

00:14:23.516 --> 00:14:24.766
their histories, and evolving

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:25.096
trends.

00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:27.236
This is how you'll become more

00:14:27.236 --> 00:14:28.506
confident in front of that font

00:14:28.506 --> 00:14:28.846
menu.

00:14:29.496 --> 00:14:30.726
And don't worry, you won't

00:14:30.726 --> 00:14:31.896
become typographic rock stars

00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:32.426
overnight.

00:14:32.946 --> 00:14:34.306
And yes, that's a thing.

00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:36.616
But at least you know where to

00:14:36.616 --> 00:14:37.066
start.

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:38.446
And I have no doubt that you'll

00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:39.636
soon grow into tremendous

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:40.786
typographers yourself.

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:42.266
Thank you.
