00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:02.906
you.

00:10:03.056 --> 00:10:05.496
Let's start with watch faces.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:06.806
Now, Apple Watch is great for

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:08.056
quickly glancing at information.

00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:08.866
And many people are using a

00:10:08.866 --> 00:10:10.066
watch face like this today.

00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:11.486
And now, you need to choose what

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:12.606
information shows up here.

00:10:12.606 --> 00:10:14.246
So for example weather, calendar

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.576
and workouts, or maybe you'd

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:16.826
like to look at the date and

00:10:16.826 --> 00:10:18.326
reminders and sunset.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.826
The information that you like to

00:10:19.896 --> 00:10:21.016
see actually varies based on

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:22.546
time and your location and your

00:10:22.546 --> 00:10:22.946
routines.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:24.616
What if we could actually show

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:25.906
you a selection of information

00:10:25.906 --> 00:10:26.606
that you might need

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:27.546
automatically?

00:10:28.526 --> 00:10:29.876
Well, Siri is becoming more and

00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:31.246
more a proactive assistant

00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:32.386
knowing what information you

00:10:32.386 --> 00:10:33.616
need when you need it.

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:35.246
And we've created a new watch

00:10:35.246 --> 00:10:36.726
face, which is powered by Siri

00:10:36.726 --> 00:10:37.326
intelligence.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.086
This is the new Siri watch face.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:40.906
Now, it automatically displays

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:41.966
the information that's most

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:42.716
relevant to you.

00:10:42.716 --> 00:10:44.296
And it can also access Siri by

00:10:44.296 --> 00:10:45.576
tapping on the new complication

00:10:45.576 --> 00:10:46.256
on the top left.

00:10:46.256 --> 00:10:48.146
And it automatically displays

00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:49.496
this information with the same

00:10:49.496 --> 00:10:50.626
type of intelligence we've

00:10:50.626 --> 00:10:51.676
applied on iOS.

00:10:52.116 --> 00:10:53.286
We're using machine learning to

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:54.606
adapt automatically based on

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:56.166
your routines and the apps that

00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:57.366
you use when you use them.

00:10:57.976 --> 00:10:59.016
So in the morning, I might see

00:10:59.016 --> 00:11:01.166
for example, can you time in my

00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:01.886
first meeting.

00:11:01.966 --> 00:11:03.466
And if I rotate the Crown, I can

00:11:03.466 --> 00:11:05.296
see more information from Siri.

00:11:05.626 --> 00:11:07.086
For example, reminders or even

00:11:07.086 --> 00:11:08.866
photo memories from the same

00:11:08.866 --> 00:11:10.086
time last year or maybe from

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:10.836
this location.

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:12.136
And throughout the day, whenever

00:11:12.136 --> 00:11:13.736
you raise your wrist, the face

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:14.996
will dynamically update with the

00:11:14.996 --> 00:11:15.826
information for you.

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:17.736
So for example at noon, I might

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:19.146
see a reminder to make a call

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:20.466
and I might get a pass to a

00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:21.316
flight that I'm taking that

00:11:21.316 --> 00:11:21.926
afternoon.

00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:23.576
So, relevant passes in Wallet

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:24.406
can appear here right in the

00:11:24.406 --> 00:11:26.136
face including from third party

00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:26.426
apps.

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:28.336
Now, at the end of the day, I

00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:29.396
might see what time the sun is

00:11:29.396 --> 00:11:30.626
going to set and also, I can get

00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:32.716
access to controls I tend to use

00:11:32.716 --> 00:11:34.016
in the home app at night.

00:11:34.456 --> 00:11:35.676
So this is an intelligent

00:11:35.676 --> 00:11:37.126
proactive assistant right on

00:11:37.126 --> 00:11:37.496
your wrist.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.086
And this is the new Siri face on

00:11:39.086 --> 00:11:39.716
Apple Watch.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:47.526
Now, sometimes you might like

00:11:47.526 --> 00:11:48.636
kind of less information and

00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:49.466
more graphics.

00:11:49.466 --> 00:11:50.636
And that's the soul of the new

00:11:50.636 --> 00:11:51.636
Kaleidoscope face.

00:11:51.636 --> 00:11:53.206
It displays a beautiful

00:11:53.276 --> 00:11:55.096
symmetrical pattern that slowly

00:11:55.096 --> 00:11:56.066
changes throughout the day.

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:57.616
And you can rotate the Crown and

00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:58.576
you can get this kind of trippy

00:11:58.576 --> 00:11:59.556
effect whenever you want.

00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:01.996

00:12:01.996 --> 00:12:02.806
can choose from.

00:12:02.866 --> 00:12:03.926
So for example if you use a

00:12:03.926 --> 00:12:05.306
photo like this, you can create

00:12:05.306 --> 00:12:06.426

00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:20.376
your Apple Watch, on an NFC

00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:21.616
reader on the gym equipment.

00:15:21.826 --> 00:15:22.746
Your watch will automatically

00:15:22.746 --> 00:15:23.796
launch the Workout App and you

00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:24.246
can connect.

00:15:24.396 --> 00:15:25.976
And then your heart rate is read

00:15:25.976 --> 00:15:27.266
by the watch and sent to the

00:15:27.266 --> 00:15:27.866
equipment.

00:15:27.866 --> 00:15:29.416
And data like incline and speed

00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:30.566
is sent from the equipment to

00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:31.166
your watch.

00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:32.436
And when you start and stop the

00:15:32.436 --> 00:15:33.696
workout in your gym machine, it

00:15:33.696 --> 00:15:34.706
does the same thing on your

00:15:34.706 --> 00:15:35.056

00:15:35.426 --> 00:15:36.446
So now, all the information

00:15:36.446 --> 00:15:38.146
matches, it's much easier and

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.166
it's a lot more accurate.

macOS, of course, is macOS

00:21:38.836 --> 00:21:39.296
Sierra.

00:21:39.696 --> 00:21:41.806
Now, Sierra brought Siri and

00:21:41.806 --> 00:21:43.966
Apple Pay to the Mac let you put

00:21:43.966 --> 00:21:45.626
your documents and your desktop

00:21:45.626 --> 00:21:47.566
in the cloud and even let you

00:21:47.566 --> 00:21:49.376
unlock your Mac automatically

00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:51.476
using the watch on your wrist.

00:21:52.386 --> 00:21:54.106
Now, people are loving Sierra

00:21:54.106 --> 00:21:55.036
and we love it too.

00:21:55.546 --> 00:21:57.096
So, we wanted to spend this year

00:21:57.636 --> 00:21:58.496
perfecting it.

00:21:59.206 --> 00:22:01.236
Of course, the question is, what

00:22:01.236 --> 00:22:01.856
do we call it?

00:22:02.016 --> 00:22:03.836
[ Laughter ]

00:22:03.836 --> 00:22:05.646
So we enlisted once again our

00:22:05.706 --> 00:22:07.256
crack marketing team.

00:22:07.256 --> 00:22:08.706
They were giddy to hop in their

00:22:08.706 --> 00:22:10.846
mini bus and this time, venture

00:22:10.906 --> 00:22:13.576
east, deep into the Sierras but

00:22:13.576 --> 00:22:16.146
this time, ascending its highest

00:22:16.486 --> 00:22:16.966
peaks.

00:22:17.346 --> 00:22:19.306
And when they finally came back,

00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:20.786
they had a name they said felt

00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:22.576
really, really good.

00:22:22.576 --> 00:22:24.226
And it's my privilege to

00:22:24.666 --> 00:22:26.966
announce for you today, macOS

00:22:27.316 --> 00:22:28.366
High Sierra.

00:22:29.516 --> 00:22:35.996
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:22:36.496 --> 00:22:38.656
Now, we talked to the guys and

00:22:38.656 --> 00:22:40.066
we said there might be-- this

00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:42.016
might be misconstrued but they

00:22:42.016 --> 00:22:43.766
assured us this name is fully

00:22:43.766 --> 00:22:44.166
baked.

00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:44.266
So--

00:22:45.016 --> 00:22:46.806
[ Laughter ]

00:22:46.806 --> 00:22:49.446
Now, High Sierra is all about

00:22:49.756 --> 00:22:51.926
deep technologies that provide a

00:22:51.926 --> 00:22:53.426
powerful platform for future

00:22:53.426 --> 00:22:54.766
innovations on the Mac.

00:22:54.886 --> 00:22:56.986
But we couldn't help ourselves,

00:22:56.986 --> 00:22:59.186
we also added some refinements.

00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:01.186
And it starts with Safari.

00:23:01.846 --> 00:23:03.556
Now, Safari is known for its

00:23:03.556 --> 00:23:05.246
efficiency and it's a legendary

00:23:05.246 --> 00:23:07.746
battery life but safari is also

00:23:07.746 --> 00:23:09.176
incredibly fast.

00:23:09.576 --> 00:23:11.666
In fact, we benchmarked Safari

00:23:11.666 --> 00:23:13.466
on the same hardware running

00:23:13.466 --> 00:23:15.616
macOS and Windows with all the

00:23:15.616 --> 00:23:17.866
popular browsers and Safari

00:23:17.926 --> 00:23:19.876
smokes them in benchmark after

00:23:19.876 --> 00:23:21.386
benchmark, JetStream,

00:23:21.386 --> 00:23:23.436
Speedometer, MotionMark.

00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:25.266
Safari tops them all.

00:23:25.686 --> 00:23:27.346
That's right, Safari is the

00:23:27.346 --> 00:23:29.546
world's fastest desktop browser

00:23:29.546 --> 00:23:30.286
with High Sierra.

00:23:31.516 --> 00:23:33.796
[ Applause ]

00:23:34.296 --> 00:23:35.886
And Safari's domination

00:23:35.886 --> 00:23:37.896
continues with the new modern

00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:39.156
version of JavaScript,

00:23:39.156 --> 00:23:40.586
ECMAScript 5.

00:23:40.616 --> 00:23:43.516
We can see Safari delivers 80%

00:23:43.516 --> 00:23:45.646
faster performance than Chrome.

00:23:46.446 --> 00:23:47.586
Now, in addition to being

00:23:47.586 --> 00:23:50.346
tremendously fast, Safari also

00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:52.296
helps give you a serene browsing

00:23:52.296 --> 00:23:53.076
experience.

00:23:53.146 --> 00:23:54.416
Now, you know, sometimes you go

00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:56.116
to read an article and instead

00:23:56.116 --> 00:23:57.226
of finding something to read,

00:23:57.226 --> 00:23:57.926
you get this.

00:23:58.016 --> 00:23:59.766
[ Music ]

00:23:59.766 --> 00:24:02.306
Just some loud audio and video

00:24:02.306 --> 00:24:04.166
that autoplays and disrupts your

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:05.206
whole reading vibe.

00:24:05.526 --> 00:24:07.896
Well, now, don't worry about it

00:24:07.896 --> 00:24:09.346
because we have autoplay

00:24:09.346 --> 00:24:10.916
blocking in Safari.

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:14.336
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:24:14.836 --> 00:24:16.936
Safari detects the sites that

00:24:16.936 --> 00:24:18.496
shouldn't be playing video and

00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:19.526
puts you in control.

00:24:19.526 --> 00:24:20.996
You can always push play.

00:24:21.596 --> 00:24:23.766
Now, Safari is also key in

00:24:23.766 --> 00:24:25.606
respecting your privacy.

00:24:25.996 --> 00:24:26.676
Now, have you ever had this

00:24:26.676 --> 00:24:27.976
experience where you go to buy

00:24:27.976 --> 00:24:29.416
something on the web and you

00:24:29.416 --> 00:24:30.716
even complete the purchase.

00:24:30.786 --> 00:24:32.986
And it seems like everywhere you

00:24:32.986 --> 00:24:34.956
go on the web, it just follows

00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:35.646
you around.

00:24:36.706 --> 00:24:37.786
It kind of feels like you're

00:24:37.786 --> 00:24:39.646
being tracked and that's because

00:24:39.646 --> 00:24:39.976
you are.

[ Laughter ]

00:24:41.846 --> 00:24:44.026

[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:24:52.246 --> 00:24:54.286
Safari uses machine learning to

00:24:54.286 --> 00:24:56.806
identify trackers, segregate the

00:24:56.806 --> 00:24:58.996
cross-site scripting data, put

00:24:58.996 --> 00:25:01.676
it away, so now, your privacy,

00:25:01.676 --> 00:25:02.956
your browsing history is your

00:25:02.956 --> 00:25:03.146
own.

00:25:03.316 --> 00:25:04.856
It's not about blocking ads, the

00:25:04.856 --> 00:25:06.706
web behaves as it always did,

00:25:06.816 --> 00:25:08.336
but your privacy is protected.

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.256
Next, I want to talk about some

00:25:10.256 --> 00:25:11.726
refinements to Mail and it

00:25:11.766 --> 00:25:12.866
starts with search.

00:25:13.406 --> 00:25:14.346
So in addition to providing

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:16.156
searches based on recency,

00:25:16.616 --> 00:25:18.486
search in Mail is now using

00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:20.296
Spotlight to identify your top

00:25:20.296 --> 00:25:20.526
hits.

00:25:20.556 --> 00:25:21.536
So the message you're looking

00:25:21.536 --> 00:25:23.246
for is almost always right there

00:25:23.246 --> 00:25:24.356
at the top.

00:25:24.496 --> 00:25:25.846
And if you're into using Mail in

00:25:25.846 --> 00:25:27.216
full-screen, well now, we

00:25:27.286 --> 00:25:29.116
support Split View for your

00:25:29.116 --> 00:25:29.886

00:25:29.886 --> 00:25:31.796
It's a great way to compose

ever.

00:25:38.146 --> 00:25:40.736
It actually uses 35% less disk

00:25:40.736 --> 00:25:42.146
space for storing your mail.

00:25:42.676 --> 00:25:44.596
Now, probably our biggest area

00:25:44.596 --> 00:25:46.826
of refinement in High Sierra is

00:25:46.826 --> 00:25:47.606
in photos.

00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:49.976
Now-- Yeah, photos has some

00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:52.276
editing tools.

00:25:52.276 --> 00:25:54.446
There's a persistent sidebar and

00:25:54.446 --> 00:25:56.226
a new view that has all your

00:25:56.226 --> 00:25:58.436
imports in chronological order.

00:25:58.436 --> 00:26:00.266
And in any view up here on the

00:26:00.266 --> 00:26:02.606
upper right, you can filter by

00:26:02.706 --> 00:26:04.556
your keywords, by your

00:26:04.686 --> 00:26:06.996
favorites, by just media types

00:26:06.996 --> 00:26:08.886
like video so it's really easy

00:26:08.886 --> 00:26:09.846
to get to just what you're

00:26:09.846 --> 00:26:10.616
looking for.

00:26:11.306 --> 00:26:12.576

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:21.586
categorizing and naming people,

00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:23.106

00:26:34.246 --> 00:26:35.156

right-hand side, all of your

00:26:37.446 --> 00:26:38.496

And there are bunch of great new

00:26:39.666 --> 00:26:41.826
ones, including Curves which

00:26:41.826 --> 00:26:43.636
allows you to fine-tune the

00:26:43.636 --> 00:26:45.066
color and contrast in your

00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:45.466

So those are some quick

00:27:32.516 --> 00:27:33.896
refinements but I want to return

00:27:33.896 --> 00:27:36.016
to the main story now and that's

00:27:44.366 --> 00:27:46.226
fundamentals are in the file

00:27:46.326 --> 00:27:46.736

00:28:21.556 --> 00:28:22.836
native encryption.

00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:25.236
And it's ultra responsive with

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.826
modern features like instant

00:28:26.876 --> 00:28:28.926
file and directory cloning and

00:28:28.926 --> 00:28:30.686
high performance parallellized

00:28:30.686 --> 00:28:31.906
metadata operations.

00:28:32.276 --> 00:28:33.276
Now, what does that really mean

00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:34.016
in practice?

00:28:34.356 --> 00:28:35.846
Well, let's take a look at a

00:28:35.946 --> 00:28:38.076
simple file duplication inside

00:28:38.076 --> 00:28:38.896
of Sierra.

00:28:38.896 --> 00:28:40.346
So we're going to go up to the

00:28:40.346 --> 00:28:40.956
File menu.

00:28:41.276 --> 00:28:42.536
It's like duplicate on this very

00:28:42.536 --> 00:28:43.556
large video files.

00:28:43.556 --> 00:28:45.106
And it's going to copy.

00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:45.826
And just like you'd expect,

00:28:45.826 --> 00:28:46.786
there's a lot of data to be

00:28:46.786 --> 00:28:48.396
copied here so it takes a little

00:28:48.396 --> 00:28:51.326
while, just about done, there we

00:28:51.326 --> 00:28:51.616
go.

00:28:51.616 --> 00:28:54.006
Now, let's watch that in High

00:28:54.006 --> 00:28:54.446
Sierra.

00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:55.656
Well, we're going to go up to

00:28:55.656 --> 00:28:56.886
the File menu, we're going to

00:28:56.886 --> 00:28:58.976
subduplicate, and we're done.

00:28:59.516 --> 00:29:04.436
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:29:04.936 --> 00:29:07.186
Next up, video.

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:08.936
Now, the current standard in

00:29:08.936 --> 00:29:10.416
video is H.264.

00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:12.366
In fact, H.264 has really

00:29:12.366 --> 00:29:13.386
enabled the revolution of

00:29:13.386 --> 00:29:15.266
streaming HD video on the

00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:15.726
Internet.

00:29:16.226 --> 00:29:17.046
But, of course, the game is

00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:21.836
moved from HD to 4K and 4K high

00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:23.406
dynamic range video.

00:29:23.976 --> 00:29:25.486
And there's a new standard to

00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:27.716
support this, it's H.265 or

00:29:27.716 --> 00:29:28.096
HEVC.

00:29:28.096 --> 00:29:30.566
And you want your video to look

00:29:30.566 --> 00:29:32.956
great, preserve all the detail

00:29:32.956 --> 00:29:34.946
and color, and HEVC does it

00:29:35.606 --> 00:29:38.326
while saving up to 40% better

00:29:38.326 --> 00:29:40.166
compression than H.264.

00:29:40.166 --> 00:29:41.796
Now, we're building in software

00:29:41.796 --> 00:29:42.836
encoder support in the High

00:29:42.836 --> 00:29:45.476
Sierra for all Macs and hardware

00:29:45.476 --> 00:29:48.356
acceleration of HEVC for the

00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:49.266
newest Macs.

00:29:49.446 --> 00:29:50.776
And we're also building it into

00:29:50.776 --> 00:29:52.966
ProTools, like Final Cut,

00:29:52.966 --> 00:29:54.686
Motion, and Compressor.

00:29:55.566 --> 00:29:56.816
Now, I want to return to our

00:29:56.816 --> 00:29:59.156
main story which is graphics and

00:29:59.156 --> 00:30:01.536
graphics are all about the GPU.

00:30:02.086 --> 00:30:03.536
The GPU has been the performance

00:30:03.536 --> 00:30:05.766
superstar of the last decade

00:30:06.066 --> 00:30:07.656
delivering incredible gains in

00:30:07.656 --> 00:30:10.046
computational performance.

00:30:10.046 --> 00:30:11.406
Now, our API for

00:30:11.406 --> 00:30:13.056
high-performance graphics is

00:30:13.056 --> 00:30:13.616
Metal.

00:30:13.616 --> 00:30:15.016
And developers have taken

00:30:15.016 --> 00:30:16.216
amazing advantage of Metal.

00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:18.026
This is Dawn of War III from

00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.536
Feral Interactive, incredible

00:30:19.536 --> 00:30:20.106
graphics.

00:30:20.856 --> 00:30:22.486
This is DaVinci Resolve from

00:30:22.486 --> 00:30:24.626
Blackmagic which can accelerate

00:30:24.626 --> 00:30:26.276
many editing operations.

00:30:26.406 --> 00:30:27.686
And, of course, we even use

00:30:27.686 --> 00:30:29.776
Metal inside of photos for doing

00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:31.086
machine learning in identifying

00:30:31.086 --> 00:30:31.706
your photos.

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:33.846
But we've learned a lot working

00:30:33.846 --> 00:30:34.806
with developers and their

00:30:34.806 --> 00:30:36.436
adoption of Metal and we have a

00:30:36.436 --> 00:30:37.826
new version to announce today.

00:30:37.826 --> 00:30:39.186
And you'll never guess what we

00:30:39.186 --> 00:30:39.636
called it.

00:30:40.496 --> 00:30:40.976
It's Metal 2.

00:30:41.016 --> 00:30:42.966
[ Laughter ]

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:45.806
Now, Metal 2 is tremendously

00:30:45.806 --> 00:30:46.326
fast.

00:30:46.326 --> 00:30:47.596
In fact, it has great

00:30:47.596 --> 00:30:49.456
optimizations and new APIs that

00:30:49.456 --> 00:30:52.146
when adopted, deliver another 10

00:30:52.146 --> 00:30:54.076
times improvement in draw call

00:30:54.076 --> 00:30:54.676
throughput.

00:30:54.846 --> 00:30:55.726
Now, some of you remember when

00:30:55.726 --> 00:30:57.466
Metal first came out, it itself

00:30:57.466 --> 00:30:58.746
had a 10 times improvement over

00:30:58.746 --> 00:30:59.286
OpenGL.

00:30:59.566 --> 00:31:00.736
You can multiply those numbers

00:31:00.736 --> 00:31:01.096
together.

00:31:01.096 --> 00:31:02.396
That's a hundred times

00:31:02.396 --> 00:31:03.016
improvement.

00:31:03.446 --> 00:31:05.216
Now, we've also provided

00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:09.366
better-- sorry, debugging and

00:31:09.416 --> 00:31:11.066
performance analysis tools for

00:31:11.066 --> 00:31:12.096
you to optimize your app for

00:31:12.096 --> 00:31:12.406
Metal.

00:31:12.406 --> 00:31:14.176
And we're so excited about the

00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:16.086
advances in Metal 2 that we've

00:31:16.086 --> 00:31:18.326
taken the Mac Window Server and

00:31:18.326 --> 00:31:19.796
put it on top of Metal,

00:31:19.796 --> 00:31:21.666
accelerating things like Mission

00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:22.296
Control.

00:31:22.296 --> 00:31:23.616
And some of our most challenging

00:31:23.616 --> 00:31:24.846
system animations are now

00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:27.026
buttery smooth all the time.

00:31:27.456 --> 00:31:29.546
Now, Metal is not just about

00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:30.146
graphics.

00:31:30.146 --> 00:31:32.246
We're also using it for machine

00:31:32.246 --> 00:31:32.836
learning.

00:31:32.836 --> 00:31:34.946
It can now accelerate-- yes, we

00:31:34.946 --> 00:31:36.636
have Metal performance shaders

00:31:36.856 --> 00:31:38.836
to accelerate all kinds of deep

00:31:38.836 --> 00:31:39.916
learning algorithms.

00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:41.866
Another piece of Metal news

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:44.216
today is Metal for external

00:31:44.216 --> 00:31:44.936
graphics.

00:31:45.966 --> 00:31:48.266
So, you know our MacBooks have

00:31:48.266 --> 00:31:50.146
this tremendous balance of

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:52.026
portability and power.

00:31:52.846 --> 00:31:54.106
But sometimes for some

00:31:54.106 --> 00:31:56.006
workflows, you need even more

00:31:56.006 --> 00:31:56.246
power.

00:31:56.246 --> 00:31:57.706
You want to take advantage of

00:31:57.706 --> 00:32:00.366
the incredible Thunderbolt IO on

00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:02.556
your MacBook Pros to access

00:32:02.556 --> 00:32:04.046
external graphics.

00:32:04.996 --> 00:32:05.966
So we're going to be making this

00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:07.186
possible in Metal 2.

00:32:07.606 --> 00:32:09.416
Now, we're starting with the

00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:10.376
Developer Kit that will be

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:11.316
available today.

00:32:11.316 --> 00:32:13.296
You can actually order a

00:32:13.296 --> 00:32:14.746
Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with a

00:32:14.746 --> 00:32:17.956
high-performance AMD GPU and

00:32:17.956 --> 00:32:19.616
tune your apps for

00:32:19.616 --> 00:32:20.866
high-performance external

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:21.356
graphics.

00:32:21.496 --> 00:32:22.766
And then we'll be rolling out

00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:24.716
support to all of our customers

00:32:25.116 --> 00:32:26.046
in the months to come.

00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:29.216
Now, with these graphics power,

00:32:29.486 --> 00:32:30.716
we're really doubling down on

00:32:30.716 --> 00:32:31.996
our focus on Pro content

00:32:31.996 --> 00:32:32.536
creation.

00:32:33.136 --> 00:32:34.756
And that's increasingly about VR

00:32:34.756 --> 00:32:36.896
content creation.

00:32:37.406 --> 00:32:40.666
And so, we're bringing Metal for

00:32:41.006 --> 00:32:41.766
VR to High Sierra.

00:32:42.516 --> 00:32:46.096
[ Applause ]

00:32:46.596 --> 00:32:47.686
Now Metal is delivering a

VR-optimized display pipeline

00:32:50.526 --> 00:32:51.806
that provides extremely high

00:32:51.806 --> 00:32:52.626
performance.

00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:55.196
And we're optimizing our Pro

00:32:55.196 --> 00:32:56.406
apps like Final Cut for doing

00:32:56.406 --> 00:32:57.536
things like editing spherical

00:32:57.536 --> 00:32:59.136
video right inside the VR

00:32:59.136 --> 00:32:59.626
environment.

00:33:00.176 --> 00:33:01.946
We're also working with Valve.

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:03.476
They're bringing the SteamVR,

00:33:03.476 --> 00:33:04.236
SVK to the Mac.

00:33:04.886 --> 00:33:07.896
And we work with Unity and

00:33:07.896 --> 00:33:09.676
Unreal to bring their engines

00:33:09.916 --> 00:33:11.276
for VR to the Mac.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:33:16.896 --> 00:33:18.086
It's really cool and you might

00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:19.356
just be seeing a little bit more

00:33:19.356 --> 00:33:20.796
from us later today on this

00:33:20.796 --> 00:33:21.266
topic.

00:33:21.686 --> 00:33:24.146
So that's a quick look at macOS.

00:33:24.176 --> 00:33:25.926
Some great technologies with the

00:33:25.926 --> 00:33:28.956
Apple File System, HEVC Video

00:33:29.046 --> 00:33:30.966
and incredible graphics with

00:33:30.966 --> 00:33:33.306
Metal 2 support for external

00:33:33.306 --> 00:33:35.286
graphics and VR support of the

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:37.436
Mac and, of course, a bunch of

00:33:37.496 --> 00:33:38.886
fantastic refinements.

00:33:39.306 --> 00:33:41.176
Now, macOS High Sierra is

00:33:41.176 --> 00:33:43.646
available for all of you today

00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:44.686
as a developer beta.

this month and, of course, it's

00:33:52.276 --> 00:33:53.906
shipping to everyone as a free

00:33:56.646 --> 00:33:57.706
that support Sierra.

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.586
Now, that's your update on macOS

00:34:00.586 --> 00:34:01.676
High Sierra and I'm going to

00:34:01.676 --> 00:34:03.006
turn it over to our vice

00:34:05.496 --> 00:34:06.906
tell you more about the Mac.

00:34:15.536 --> 00:34:16.466
>> Thank you, Craig.

00:34:17.616 --> 00:34:19.686
So, we have some great updates

00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:21.176
to talk about today that span

00:34:21.176 --> 00:34:22.666
much of the Mac product line.

00:34:23.036 --> 00:34:24.346
And let's begin with the iMac.

00:34:25.636 --> 00:34:27.246
Now, the iMac has been the gold

00:34:27.246 --> 00:34:28.786
standard of desktops for many

00:34:28.786 --> 00:34:30.076
years but we're going to raise

00:34:30.076 --> 00:34:31.315
the bar once again.

00:34:31.815 --> 00:34:33.315
And as always on the iMac, it

00:34:33.315 --> 00:34:34.496
starts with the display.

00:34:35.485 --> 00:34:37.275
Because the 4K and 5K Retina

00:34:37.456 --> 00:34:38.835
iMac displays with their high

00:34:38.835 --> 00:34:40.626
resolution, excellent brightness

00:34:40.786 --> 00:34:42.795
and P3 color gamut, are the best

00:34:42.795 --> 00:34:44.286
displays on any desktop.

00:34:44.286 --> 00:34:45.706
But we're going to make them

00:34:45.706 --> 00:34:46.275
even better.

00:34:46.985 --> 00:34:48.775
So these new displays are now

00:34:48.775 --> 00:34:50.335
going to be 500 nits.

00:34:50.376 --> 00:34:52.275
That's 43% brighter than the

00:34:52.275 --> 00:34:53.196
previous generation.

00:34:53.806 --> 00:34:55.456
And for the first time, we're

00:34:55.456 --> 00:34:56.545
going to support 10-bit

00:34:56.545 --> 00:34:57.856
dithering, which means these

00:34:57.856 --> 00:34:59.206
displays can reproduce up to a

00:34:59.206 --> 00:35:00.416
billion colors.

00:35:01.586 --> 00:35:02.776
So, your content is going to

00:35:02.776 --> 00:35:04.236
look more true to life than ever

00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:04.666
before.

00:35:05.566 --> 00:35:06.976
Now, in addition, we've got some

00:35:06.976 --> 00:35:08.456
great internal updates for these

00:35:08.546 --> 00:35:08.906
iMacs.

00:35:09.286 --> 00:35:10.496
So we'll start with the CPU

00:35:10.496 --> 00:35:11.826
because the whole line is moving

00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:13.666
to Intel's 7th-generation Core

00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:15.546
Processor, also known as Kaby

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:15.776
Lake.

00:35:16.166 --> 00:35:17.486
Now, Kaby Lake gets this better

00:35:17.486 --> 00:35:19.216
base and turbo frequencies for

00:35:19.216 --> 00:35:20.856
more performance as well as

00:35:20.856 --> 00:35:23.166
hardware-based 10-bit HEVC

00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:24.586
decode which is great for

00:35:24.586 --> 00:35:25.966
playing back high quality video.

00:35:27.016 --> 00:35:28.316
In addition, these iMacs are

00:35:28.316 --> 00:35:29.396
getting a boost when it comes to

00:35:29.396 --> 00:35:30.366
memory capacity.

00:35:30.766 --> 00:35:32.996
So the 21.5-inch systems can now

00:35:32.996 --> 00:35:34.766
be configured with up to 32 gigs

00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:35.236
of memory.

00:35:35.576 --> 00:35:37.176
And the 27-inch can go all the

00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:38.566
way up to 64 gigabytes of

00:35:38.566 --> 00:35:38.936
memory.

00:35:39.216 --> 00:35:40.446
Both of those are twice what the

00:35:40.446 --> 00:35:41.656
previous generation can do.

00:35:42.976 --> 00:35:44.466
Now, fast storage has always

00:35:44.516 --> 00:35:45.986
been a key part of the iMac.

00:35:45.986 --> 00:35:47.076
And so, we're going to now make

00:35:47.076 --> 00:35:49.166
our Fusion Drive standard on all

00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:50.276
27-inch configs.

00:35:50.276 --> 00:35:51.606
And it's also going to be

00:35:51.606 --> 00:35:52.806
standard on the high-end

00:35:52.806 --> 00:35:54.566
21.5-inch config as well.

00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:57.366
In addition, our SSD options are

00:35:57.366 --> 00:35:59.426
going to be up to 50% faster and

00:35:59.426 --> 00:36:01.336
now available up to 2 terabytes.

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:04.426
And the iMacs are getting an IO

00:36:04.426 --> 00:36:05.436
upgrade as well because we're

00:36:05.436 --> 00:36:07.706
giving them two USB-C connectors

00:36:07.746 --> 00:36:09.246
which support Thunderbolt 3.

00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:10.636
And we think our customers

00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:12.106
especially our Pro users are

00:36:12.156 --> 00:36:12.936
really going to love this

00:36:12.936 --> 00:36:13.926
because you can do some cool

00:36:13.996 --> 00:36:15.246
things like hook up a

00:36:15.246 --> 00:36:16.966
high-performance RAID array and

00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:18.866
an external 5K display at the

00:36:18.966 --> 00:36:20.126
same time.

00:36:20.656 --> 00:36:21.966
So now, let's talk about

00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:22.496
graphics.

00:36:22.496 --> 00:36:23.906
And as you heard earlier, we're

00:36:23.906 --> 00:36:25.386
investing heavily in graphic

00:36:25.386 --> 00:36:26.976
software technologies like Metal

00:36:27.086 --> 00:36:27.426
2.

00:36:27.426 --> 00:36:29.206
Well, we're also investing in

00:36:29.206 --> 00:36:30.166
graphics hardware.

00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:31.926
And every configuration in this

00:36:31.926 --> 00:36:33.236
new iMac line is going to get a

00:36:33.236 --> 00:36:35.066
big bump in its graphics

00:36:35.066 --> 00:36:35.706
performance.

00:36:36.346 --> 00:36:37.096
So we'll start with the

00:36:37.096 --> 00:36:37.906
entry-level iMac.

00:36:38.186 --> 00:36:39.496
Now this system gets a boost in

00:36:39.496 --> 00:36:41.386
its integrated GPU by way of

00:36:41.386 --> 00:36:43.206
Intel's Iris Plus Graphics which

00:36:43.206 --> 00:36:45.166
now has 64 megabytes of eDRAM.

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:46.626
And the performance that we're

00:36:46.626 --> 00:36:47.546
getting out of this is pretty

00:36:47.546 --> 00:36:49.096
amazing because this system is

00:36:49.096 --> 00:36:51.196
up to 80% faster in graphics

00:36:51.196 --> 00:36:51.946
than the previous generation.

00:36:52.516 --> 00:36:56.306
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:36:56.806 --> 00:36:59.296
Now next up is the 21.5-inch

00:36:59.436 --> 00:37:01.296
iMac with Retina 4K display.

00:37:01.296 --> 00:37:02.936
And the big news here is that

00:37:02.936 --> 00:37:04.056
we're going to be moving to

00:37:04.056 --> 00:37:05.516
discrete graphics and making it

00:37:05.516 --> 00:37:07.636
standard on all 4K iMacs.

00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:09.376
And that's going to come-- There

00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:09.576
you go.

00:37:09.576 --> 00:37:10.936
And that's going to come in this

00:37:10.936 --> 00:37:13.356
Radeon Pro series GPUs with up

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:15.026
to 4 gigabytes of VRAM.

00:37:15.656 --> 00:37:17.106
And again, this move to discrete

00:37:17.106 --> 00:37:18.046
graphics yield to pretty

00:37:18.046 --> 00:37:19.576
spectacular performance increase

00:37:19.966 --> 00:37:21.616
because this new system is up to

00:37:21.616 --> 00:37:23.256
three times faster than the

00:37:23.256 --> 00:37:24.286
previous generation for

00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:24.956
graphics.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:31.366
Now, lastly, we have our 27-inch

00:37:31.446 --> 00:37:31.716
iMAc.

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:32.936
And this is our most popular

00:37:32.936 --> 00:37:34.626
desktop for our Pro customers.

00:37:34.926 --> 00:37:36.206
So obviously, it's going to get

00:37:36.206 --> 00:37:37.346
a bump in graphics today as

00:37:37.346 --> 00:37:37.656
well.

00:37:38.036 --> 00:37:38.996
So it's going to have this

00:37:38.996 --> 00:37:41.566
Radeon Pro 500 series GPUs with

00:37:41.566 --> 00:37:43.246
up to 8 gigabytes of VRAM.

00:37:44.076 --> 00:37:45.186
And again, we get a great

00:37:45.186 --> 00:37:45.976
performance uplift.

00:37:45.976 --> 00:37:47.686
In fact, this 27-inch iMac can

00:37:47.686 --> 00:37:50.186
now deliver up to 5.5 teraflops

00:37:50.186 --> 00:37:51.176
of graphics to you.

00:37:58.416 --> 00:37:59.666
In fact, we've seated some

00:37:59.666 --> 00:38:01.476
developers with this new iMac in

00:38:01.476 --> 00:38:03.376

00:38:03.376 --> 00:38:04.686
what they can do with virtual

00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:05.566
reality on the Mac.

00:38:06.196 --> 00:38:07.356
And I'm really excited that we

00:38:07.356 --> 00:38:08.616
can give you a demo of some of

00:38:08.616 --> 00:38:10.006
this amazing work right now.

00:38:10.646 --> 00:38:11.866

development on the Mac so I'm

00:38:42.786 --> 00:38:43.946
really excited about these new

Thanks to the native VR support

00:39:22.446 --> 00:39:24.716
in macOS High Sierra, I can use

have my Radial Menu, which

accesses my artist palette.

00:39:37.666 --> 00:39:38.956
Now on the right, I have the

world and some fire here.

00:39:42.886 --> 00:39:43.696
So, let's try that out.

Can we go wide?

00:40:09.186 --> 00:40:10.216
>> Sure. I can grab on to them

00:40:10.216 --> 00:40:11.766
with two hands and scale myself

00:40:11.766 --> 00:40:11.966
up.

00:40:11.966 --> 00:40:14.716
I can also use this to rotate

00:40:23.096 --> 00:40:24.536
a half teraflops of GPU

performance, manipulating

00:40:25.816 --> 00:40:27.556
objects is super smooth and

00:40:27.556 --> 00:40:28.566
really intuitive.

00:40:30.076 --> 00:40:30.526
>> Great, all right.

00:40:30.526 --> 00:40:31.846
Can we have a squadron of those

00:40:31.846 --> 00:40:32.576
flying overhead?

00:40:33.316 --> 00:40:34.826
>> OK, what about from over

00:40:34.866 --> 00:40:37.386
there on the horizon.

And to recap, they have the best

Mac displays we've ever made,

00:43:11.906 --> 00:43:13.826
faster processors, higher memory

00:43:26.016 --> 00:43:27.786
there's one more change because

00:43:28.216 --> 00:43:29.256
we're going to bring even more

For the first time ever, we're

00:43:33.226 --> 00:43:34.706
going to have a 4K iMac that

00:43:34.706 --> 00:43:36.886

[ Applause ]

00:43:44.786 --> 00:43:46.176
But the updates don't stop with

00:43:46.176 --> 00:43:47.576
just the iMac because we're

00:43:47.576 --> 00:43:48.946
refreshing our notebooks today

00:43:48.946 --> 00:43:49.406
as well.

00:43:49.406 --> 00:43:51.916
And together, the MacBook and

00:43:51.916 --> 00:43:53.006
MacBook Pro make up the

00:43:53.006 --> 00:43:54.366
strongest line of notebooks

we've ever had.

00:43:55.436 --> 00:43:56.816
But we're going to make them

00:43:56.816 --> 00:43:57.876
even better because we're moving

00:43:57.876 --> 00:43:59.046
to Kaby Lake here as well.

00:43:59.966 --> 00:44:01.996
And we're bringing faster SSDs

00:44:01.996 --> 00:44:04.356
to our MacBook and faster

00:44:04.356 --> 00:44:06.446

we've been working really hard

00:44:48.346 --> 00:44:49.646

00:45:00.586 --> 00:45:00.736

00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:04.026

the most powerful iMac we've

00:46:36.336 --> 00:46:36.776

put workstation class

00:46:52.526 --> 00:46:53.916
Now to do that, the team had to

00:46:53.916 --> 00:46:55.456
completely rethink the thermal

00:46:55.456 --> 00:46:57.296

00:46:57.326 --> 00:46:58.916
with this really efficient dual

generates significantly more

greater than 80% increase in

unbelievable performance while

But we didn't want to stop there

00:47:59.526 --> 00:48:01.276
It features a completely new GPU

00:48:01.276 --> 00:48:03.176
core and high bandwidth on

00:48:03.176 --> 00:48:03.916
packaged memory.

00:48:03.916 --> 00:48:05.856
It's going to be available with

00:48:05.856 --> 00:48:08.236
up to 16 gigabytes of VRAM and

00:48:08.236 --> 00:48:10.476
over 400 gigabytes per second of

00:48:10.476 --> 00:48:11.246
memory bandwidth.

00:48:11.246 --> 00:48:12.596
And we aren't going to use an

00:48:12.596 --> 00:48:14.036
entry level configuration here

00:48:14.386 --> 00:48:15.836
because our implementation is

00:48:15.836 --> 00:48:16.986
going to offer up to 11

00:48:16.986 --> 00:48:18.706
teraflops of single precision

00:48:18.706 --> 00:48:19.396
compute power.

00:48:19.876 --> 00:48:21.256
That's three times more than the

00:48:21.256 --> 00:48:22.936
best GPU in the Mac Pro.

00:48:22.936 --> 00:48:24.786
But it actually gets even better

00:48:25.016 --> 00:48:26.676
because this Radeon Vega GPU can

00:48:26.676 --> 00:48:28.526
also do half precision compute.

00:48:28.876 --> 00:48:30.276
So that means the iMac Pro can

00:48:30.276 --> 00:48:33.536
deliver up to 22 teraflops of

00:48:33.536 --> 00:48:34.956
half precision computation.

00:48:36.466 --> 00:48:37.886
This is a really big deal for

00:48:37.886 --> 00:48:39.086
things like machine learning

00:48:39.086 --> 00:48:39.616
development.

00:48:40.126 --> 00:48:41.526
So the iMac Pro as you can see

00:48:41.526 --> 00:48:42.786
is going to be a monster when it

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.346
comes to graphics, but we didn't

00:48:44.346 --> 00:48:45.366
want to stop there either.

00:48:45.696 --> 00:48:46.396
So we're going to let you

00:48:46.396 --> 00:48:48.376
configure it with up to 128

00:48:48.376 --> 00:48:49.836
gigabytes of ECC memory.

00:48:50.426 --> 00:48:51.806
That's twice what you can do on

00:48:51.806 --> 00:48:53.236
a standard 27-inch iMac.

00:48:54.516 --> 00:48:57.486
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:48:57.986 --> 00:49:01.276
And up to 4 terabytes of 3

00:49:01.276 --> 00:49:02.306
gigabyte per second SSD.

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:05.226
Now, the iMac Pro is also going

00:49:05.226 --> 00:49:06.466
to have a full complement of

00:49:06.466 --> 00:49:08.106
high performance I/O including

00:49:08.206 --> 00:49:10.206
four Thunderbolt 3 ports and for

00:49:10.206 --> 00:49:12.116
the first time ever in any Mac,

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:14.476
built-in 10 gigabit Ethernet.

00:49:15.516 --> 00:49:19.206
[ Applause ]

00:49:19.706 --> 00:49:20.776
And with all that cutting edge

00:49:20.776 --> 00:49:22.056
I/O, you can do some pretty

00:49:22.056 --> 00:49:22.786
amazing things.

00:49:22.786 --> 00:49:24.846
So you can hook up two 5K

00:49:24.846 --> 00:49:26.566
displays in two high-performance

00:49:26.566 --> 00:49:28.216
RAID arrays, no iMac before

00:49:28.216 --> 00:49:29.046
could ever do that.

00:49:29.286 --> 00:49:30.316
And when you combine that with

00:49:30.316 --> 00:49:32.096
the internal display, that means

00:49:32.096 --> 00:49:34.896
the iMac Pro can drive up to 44

00:49:34.896 --> 00:49:35.826
million pixels.

00:49:37.236 --> 00:49:38.026
There's so much more.

00:49:38.026 --> 00:49:38.856
We don't even have time to get

00:49:38.856 --> 00:49:40.566
into things like a 1080p

00:49:40.566 --> 00:49:41.866
FaceTime camera, a user

00:49:41.866 --> 00:49:43.616
configurable VESA mount option,

00:49:43.896 --> 00:49:45.956
two times wider AVX instructions

00:49:45.956 --> 00:49:48.536
and even a UHS-II SD card slot.

00:49:49.216 --> 00:49:50.216
So with all these

00:49:50.216 --> 00:49:51.496
high-performance technologies

00:49:51.496 --> 00:49:53.326
and our incredible 5K display,

00:49:53.586 --> 00:49:55.016
this iMac Pro is going to be an

00:49:55.016 --> 00:49:56.476
awesome workstation for things

00:49:56.476 --> 00:49:58.286
like real-time 3D rendering,

00:49:58.606 --> 00:49:59.766
high frame rate, immersive VR,

00:49:59.766 --> 00:50:01.486
machine learning development,

00:50:01.706 --> 00:50:03.506
and with all those cores and all

00:50:03.506 --> 00:50:05.216
that memory, super fast code

00:50:05.216 --> 00:50:05.616
compiling.

00:50:07.126 --> 00:50:08.826
Now speaking of workstations, we

00:50:08.826 --> 00:50:10.226
wanted to compare the starting

00:50:10.226 --> 00:50:12.076
configuration of the iMac Pro to

00:50:12.076 --> 00:50:12.956
what's on the market.

00:50:13.476 --> 00:50:14.636
And so, if you were to go out

00:50:14.636 --> 00:50:16.156
and build a comparably spec

00:50:16.226 --> 00:50:18.496
system today, it will cost over

00:50:18.496 --> 00:50:19.716
$7000.

00:50:20.326 --> 00:50:21.146
And keep in mind, that's a

00:50:21.146 --> 00:50:22.226
system that doesn't have our

00:50:22.226 --> 00:50:23.686
best in class 5K display.

00:50:23.686 --> 00:50:25.556
It doesn't have the iMac Pro's

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:27.016
incredible all-in-one design.

00:50:27.016 --> 00:50:28.666
And then obviously doesn't run

configuration of the iMac Pro

00:50:32.976 --> 00:50:34.386
and we're going to price it at

Now, you all know in iOS 10, we

had iMessage apps and stickers.

them more discoverable and ever

00:53:09.766 --> 00:53:11.556

accessible right there at the

00:53:14.056 --> 00:53:15.266
bottom of the screen with just a

00:53:15.266 --> 00:53:16.836
tap, you can bring them up,

00:53:17.096 --> 00:53:18.976

Now, the big story with messages

though is messages in iCloud.

00:53:28.746 --> 00:53:30.656
Because now with your iMessages

So if you want to delete an

00:53:45.396 --> 00:53:46.536
embarrassing message that you

00:53:46.536 --> 00:53:47.706
don't want in your transcript,

00:53:47.706 --> 00:53:49.796

to optimize your device storage

00:53:55.446 --> 00:53:56.466
because with your messages in

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.866

00:53:57.866 --> 00:53:59.746
your most recent messages cached

00:53:59.746 --> 00:54:01.096
on the device and so that makes

00:54:01.096 --> 00:54:02.966
for smaller and faster backups

00:54:03.296 --> 00:54:05.386

[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:55:05.296 --> 00:55:06.676
So you can send and receive

money right in your transcript.

00:55:08.266 --> 00:55:09.446
Of course, when you send it, you

authenticate securely with Touch

00:55:11.963 --> 00:55:16.006
And if you receive money with

iMessage, it goes to your Apple

And, of course, you can pull it

00:55:27.636 --> 00:55:28.766
out and transfer it to your

these iOS devices and Apple

[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:55:40.026 --> 00:55:42.016
So next, let's turn to Siri.

00:55:42.016 --> 00:55:44.066
Now, Siri is used monthly for

00:55:44.066 --> 00:55:48.106
more than 375 million devices.

00:55:48.106 --> 00:55:49.296
It's absolutely huge.

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:50.706
And it's available in more

00:55:50.706 --> 00:55:52.196
languages, in more countries

00:55:52.536 --> 00:55:54.316
than any other system, 21

00:55:54.316 --> 00:55:56.496
languages and 36 countries.

00:55:57.046 --> 00:55:58.566
So for iOS 11, we're making a

00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:00.526
big upgrade to your primary

00:56:00.526 --> 00:56:02.256
interface in dealing with Siri,

00:56:02.326 --> 00:56:03.586
not Siri's voice.

00:56:04.716 --> 00:56:06.756
We've used deep learning now to

00:56:06.756 --> 00:56:08.106
create a really natural and

00:56:08.106 --> 00:56:09.346
expressive voice for Siri and

00:56:09.346 --> 00:56:10.236
I'd like you to hear it.

00:56:11.576 --> 00:56:12.556
>> Here's the forecast for the

00:56:12.556 --> 00:56:13.966
next 10 days.

00:56:18.206 --> 00:56:19.076
Very powerful.

00:56:19.466 --> 00:56:21.876
Now, Siri also has a male voice

00:56:21.876 --> 00:56:23.616
and it sounds fantastic too.

00:56:24.276 --> 00:56:25.636

00:56:25.636 --> 00:56:27.266

00:56:31.116 --> 00:56:32.116
>> So, Siri is a great new

00:56:32.116 --> 00:56:34.366
visual interface as well.

00:56:34.526 --> 00:56:35.556
And it's able to provide you

00:56:35.556 --> 00:56:37.186
with followup questions and

00:56:37.186 --> 00:56:39.436
answers with just a tap and

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:40.806
multiple results.

00:56:41.106 --> 00:56:42.756
When you make a query, it's

00:56:42.756 --> 00:56:43.496
really handy.

00:56:43.796 --> 00:56:46.016
Now, Siri also has a new

00:56:46.016 --> 00:56:48.346
capability, just translation.

00:56:48.826 --> 00:56:50.136
So, you can now ask something

00:56:50.136 --> 00:56:51.726
like, how do you say what are

00:56:51.726 --> 00:56:52.936
the most popular dishes in your

00:56:52.936 --> 00:56:54.506
restaurant in Chinese?

00:56:54.606 --> 00:56:55.976
And Siri can say,

00:57:06.396 --> 00:57:07.756
Now, translation initially will

00:57:07.756 --> 00:57:09.066
support translation from English

00:57:09.166 --> 00:57:11.056
to Chinese, French, German,

00:57:11.116 --> 00:57:12.926
Italian, and Spanish and we'll

00:57:12.926 --> 00:57:14.596
have more language combinations

00:57:14.596 --> 00:57:16.166
coming in the months to come.

00:57:16.796 --> 00:57:18.436
Now, when it comes to using Siri

00:57:18.436 --> 00:57:19.656
to access your other

00:57:19.656 --> 00:57:21.636
applications, we have SiriKit.

00:57:21.636 --> 00:57:23.636
And SiriKit can now do more than

00:57:23.676 --> 00:57:25.866
ever in iOS 11.

00:57:26.356 --> 00:57:27.966
So now, you can do task

00:57:28.196 --> 00:57:30.246
management by using Siri to make

00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:32.576

bring up a QR code in WeChat.

00:57:39.096 --> 00:57:40.426
Now, Siri isn't just a voice

00:57:40.426 --> 00:57:41.746
assistant, because with Siri

00:57:41.746 --> 00:57:43.636
Intelligence, Siri not only

00:57:43.636 --> 00:57:45.086
understands your voice, it

00:57:45.086 --> 00:57:46.796
understands the context.

00:57:47.116 --> 00:57:49.006
It understands your interest.

00:57:49.236 --> 00:57:50.426
It understands how you use your

00:57:50.426 --> 00:57:50.906
device.

00:57:50.906 --> 00:57:53.146
And this allows it to ultimately

00:57:53.146 --> 00:57:55.296
understand what you want next.

00:57:55.886 --> 00:57:57.726
Now, we've all experienced this

00:57:57.726 --> 00:57:58.926
where Siri can help us predict

00:57:59.306 --> 00:58:00.746
what apps we might want to use

00:58:00.746 --> 00:58:03.136
next, give us a time to leave

notification based on our

00:58:04.316 --> 00:58:06.976

00:58:08.976 --> 00:58:11.636
In iOS 11, Siri uses on-device

00:58:13.096 --> 00:58:14.816
about topics of interest to us.

00:58:16.636 --> 00:58:18.626
topics we might be interested in

00:58:18.626 --> 00:58:19.716
learning about in news.

00:58:19.716 --> 00:58:22.116
It can help us respond with our

00:58:22.116 --> 00:58:23.396
location for getting to an

00:58:23.396 --> 00:58:25.046

00:58:58.156 --> 00:59:00.096
And in fact, our customers now

00:59:00.096 --> 00:59:03.766
take a trillion photos per year.

00:59:04.036 --> 00:59:05.396
It's absolutely amazing.

00:59:05.396 --> 00:59:06.666
And they take a lot of video

00:59:06.666 --> 00:59:07.126
too.

00:59:07.126 --> 00:59:09.866
And today, they do it in H.264.

00:59:09.866 --> 00:59:11.936
But now with our latest iPhones

00:59:11.936 --> 00:59:16.416
in iOS 7, they get or using

00:59:16.416 --> 00:59:18.186
HEVC, which is giving us up to

00:59:18.186 --> 00:59:20.436
two times better compression for

00:59:20.436 --> 00:59:22.126
camera-captured videos, which

00:59:22.126 --> 00:59:23.936
means less storage space used on

00:59:23.936 --> 00:59:26.166
your device and less space used

00:59:26.166 --> 00:59:26.796
in the cloud.

provides awesome quality images

share completely compatibly with

00:59:53.036 --> 00:59:53.496
others.

00:59:53.986 --> 00:59:56.486
Now, with the iPhone 7 Plus, we

00:59:56.486 --> 00:59:58.066
love taking these beautiful

00:59:58.066 --> 00:59:58.976
portrait photos.

00:59:59.126 --> 01:00:01.756
And now, with iOS 11, we can

01:00:02.246 --> 01:00:05.866
take low light photographs using

01:00:05.916 --> 01:00:07.416
optical image stabilization,

incredible image quality.

information that we can capture

01:00:15.356 --> 01:00:17.026
with two cameras and exposing it

01:00:17.026 --> 01:00:18.926
to developers with a new Depth

01:00:18.926 --> 01:00:20.666
API which has allowed them to do

01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:22.236
incredibly fun and artistic

01:00:25.986 --> 01:00:26.446
Depth API.

01:00:26.446 --> 01:00:28.176
Now, when you're done taking

01:00:28.176 --> 01:00:29.926
your photos, you go to enjoy

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.606
them in the Photos app.

01:00:31.606 --> 01:00:32.986
And one of the ways I love

01:00:32.986 --> 01:00:33.716
enjoying them is with the

01:00:33.716 --> 01:00:35.676
Memories feature because

01:00:35.676 --> 01:00:37.726
Memories is able to scan my

01:00:40.386 --> 01:00:40.826
fun events.

01:00:40.826 --> 01:00:41.906

01:00:41.906 --> 01:00:42.116
ever.

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:43.826
It uses a machine learning to

01:00:43.826 --> 01:00:45.876
identify things like sporting

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.846

anniversaries, memories of your

01:00:50.256 --> 01:00:50.786
babies.

01:00:50.926 --> 01:00:51.736
It's really great.

01:00:52.006 --> 01:00:53.336
And when you go to play those

01:00:53.336 --> 01:00:55.616
back, you can see them not just

01:00:55.616 --> 01:00:56.866
in normal landscape orientation

01:00:56.866 --> 01:00:58.436
but now watch them in portrait

height of your display.

You can mark any part of the

video as your key photo and so

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:13.076
much more.

01:01:48.526 --> 01:01:49.366
single page.

It has sliders available so you

01:01:58.036 --> 01:01:59.386
can adjust volume like this.

01:01:59.386 --> 01:02:01.066
But it provides greater depth

01:02:01.406 --> 01:02:03.506
because with 3D Touch, 3D Touch

01:02:03.546 --> 01:02:04.896

access to more controls.

01:02:06.616 --> 01:02:08.336

these airports to start, and

01:08:31.796 --> 01:08:33.326

improvements to navigation.

01:08:36.816 --> 01:08:37.876

Now, we know in addition to

01:08:52.765 --> 01:08:54.716
more with their phones sometimes

01:08:54.716 --> 01:08:55.246
while driving.

And our safest solution for

doing this is CarPlay, lets you

01:08:59.286 --> 01:09:00.996
keep your eyes on the road while

01:09:00.996 --> 01:09:02.246
you're doing things like asking

01:09:02.246 --> 01:09:03.926
Siri to play music.

01:09:03.926 --> 01:09:05.376
Well, we wanted to bring this

same level of safety to everyone

who maybe doesn't have one of

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.576
the 200 models of cars that

01:09:11.576 --> 01:09:12.975
currently support CarPlay.

01:09:12.975 --> 01:09:15.046
And we're building on "Do Not

01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:18.566
call "Do Not Disturb While

When you're driving, you don't

01:09:23.895 --> 01:09:26.015
need to be responding to these

So now, when you install iOS 11,

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:35.576
we're going to use Bluetooth to

01:09:35.576 --> 01:09:36.676
understand if you're connected

01:09:36.676 --> 01:09:36.895
to a car.

Or even if you don't have

01:09:37.776 --> 01:09:39.345
Bluetooth, we're going to use

01:09:39.345 --> 01:09:41.685

01:09:41.685 --> 01:09:43.015
that you're moving in a car.

try to turn on your phone,

01:10:06.216 --> 01:10:07.466

sitting in the back seat in

Amazing. And just recently, we

01:14:55.726 --> 01:14:59.216
passed $70 billion paid out to

Yes. Thirty percent of that in

the last year alone, the apps

01:15:09.096 --> 01:15:09.826

with them that none of us have

01:15:12.076 --> 01:15:13.296
ever imagined.

Pokemon Go is from Niantic.

01:15:22.876 --> 01:15:24.066
It was one of the big hits from

01:15:24.066 --> 01:15:24.826
last year and there have been a

lot of big hits last year from

01:15:32.436 --> 01:15:34.096
app platform in the world.

incredible apps you make that we

01:15:42.566 --> 01:15:43.796
and our customers all love.

01:15:44.346 --> 01:15:45.976
It's not by chance that the App

01:15:45.976 --> 01:15:47.076
Store has become such a great

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:47.516
place.

01:15:47.766 --> 01:15:48.766
From the beginning, we've had

01:15:48.766 --> 01:15:50.916
two very important goals, to

01:15:50.916 --> 01:15:52.556
make the App Store a trusted and

01:15:52.556 --> 01:15:55.056
safe place for users and to make

01:15:55.056 --> 01:15:57.436
it a great opportunity for all

01:15:57.436 --> 01:15:58.206
developers.

01:15:58.516 --> 01:16:00.066
We continue to work really hard

01:16:00.066 --> 01:16:00.356
at that.

01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:02.136
Over the last year, the team has

01:16:02.136 --> 01:16:03.526
done a lot of great things to

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:04.966
make the App Store an even

01:16:04.966 --> 01:16:06.656
better store for all of us.

01:16:06.986 --> 01:16:08.116
There's many things we can talk

01:16:08.116 --> 01:16:09.566
about but I think one stands

01:16:09.566 --> 01:16:10.446
head and shoulders above the

01:16:10.446 --> 01:16:12.906
rest, faster app review times.

01:16:14.066 --> 01:16:18.746
Yes. I'm sure you're well aware

01:16:19.056 --> 01:16:20.116
that the majority of apps are

01:16:20.116 --> 01:16:22.116
all now reviewed in under 24

01:16:22.116 --> 01:16:23.986

01:16:24.716 --> 01:16:25.496
The team is going to keep

01:16:25.496 --> 01:16:26.386
working hard at that.

01:16:26.576 --> 01:16:28.456
And we have a lot more coming

01:16:28.456 --> 01:16:29.976
for the remainder of the year.

01:16:29.976 --> 01:16:31.066
I've highlighted a bunch of

01:16:31.106 --> 01:16:31.826
things here.

01:16:31.986 --> 01:16:33.406
I'll just point out one of them.

01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:34.946
You can read some of your

01:16:34.946 --> 01:16:36.096
favorite things up there.

01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.316
A big request in developers is

01:16:37.316 --> 01:16:38.836
called phased releases.

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:39.516
Now when you--

01:16:39.626 --> 01:16:39.796
>> Woo!

01:16:39.796 --> 01:16:42.076
>> Yes, woo for phased releases,

01:16:42.076 --> 01:16:42.516
come on.

01:16:42.686 --> 01:16:44.946
Phased releases means, when you

01:16:45.026 --> 01:16:47.156
submit an app, you can choose if

01:16:47.196 --> 01:16:48.546
you want it to be phased over

01:16:48.546 --> 01:16:49.946
time so it doesn't hit your

01:16:49.946 --> 01:16:51.556
infrastructure all at once and

01:16:51.556 --> 01:16:52.746
you can see how customers are

01:16:52.746 --> 01:16:54.296
responding to that update.

01:16:54.596 --> 01:16:56.086
So it's really great feature for

01:16:56.086 --> 01:16:57.086
you to take advantage of.

01:16:57.086 --> 01:16:58.566

01:16:58.616 --> 01:17:00.306
coming this year but there is

01:17:00.306 --> 01:17:03.416
one that is incredibly gigantic.

01:17:03.996 --> 01:17:04.866
And that is we're going to do

01:17:04.896 --> 01:17:06.136
something that we've never done

01:17:06.136 --> 01:17:07.176
before in the nine years of the

01:17:07.176 --> 01:17:07.716

Did you remember back the first

01:17:26.656 --> 01:17:27.846
time you started downloading

apps when you use the App Store

01:17:29.926 --> 01:17:31.406

every single day and discover

01:17:33.126 --> 01:17:34.096
the new apps that were

01:17:34.096 --> 01:17:34.566
appearing?

01:17:36.096 --> 01:17:36.686
feeling.

01:20:54.906 --> 01:20:55.366
the feed.

01:20:56.656 --> 01:20:58.036
Every day there's a new app of

01:20:58.036 --> 01:21:00.586
the day and a new game of the

01:21:00.586 --> 01:21:03.126
day and the daily list.

01:21:03.786 --> 01:21:04.806
These are great because they're

01:21:04.886 --> 01:21:06.616
focused on a theme or a goal

01:21:06.616 --> 01:21:07.956
like meditation.

01:21:08.736 --> 01:21:10.216
I've actually been trying some

01:21:10.216 --> 01:21:14.366
of these out to get ready for

01:21:14.646 --> 01:21:15.836
this and it's totally working.

01:21:16.116 --> 01:21:18.886
If I'm busy and miss a day, I

01:21:18.886 --> 01:21:21.486
can scroll down and see stories

01:21:21.486 --> 01:21:22.536
from earlier in the week.

01:21:23.096 --> 01:21:24.206
So that's the Today tab.

01:21:25.356 --> 01:21:27.926
If I only want to see games, now

01:21:27.926 --> 01:21:29.676
I can go to the New Games tab.

01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:31.026
This is huge.

01:21:31.216 --> 01:21:31.816
Let's check it out.

01:21:32.216 --> 01:21:33.836
Up at the top I can see the

01:21:33.836 --> 01:21:36.076
biggest new releases or just

01:21:36.196 --> 01:21:37.206
what the game editors are

01:21:37.206 --> 01:21:38.096
playing this week.

01:21:38.096 --> 01:21:40.406
If I scroll down I can watch a

01:21:40.406 --> 01:21:42.196
whole bunch of game videos.

01:21:42.306 --> 01:21:45.076
And it's not just previews but

01:21:45.076 --> 01:21:47.366
also tips and gameplay videos by

01:21:47.366 --> 01:21:48.246
editors too.

01:21:48.246 --> 01:21:50.536
If I scroll down, I can see

01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:53.056
charts that only feature games.

01:21:53.186 --> 01:21:54.756
So it's really easy to see what

01:21:54.756 --> 01:21:56.266
the most popular games are

01:21:56.516 --> 01:21:59.126
separate from apps.

01:21:59.126 --> 01:22:00.696
And now I can browse by game

01:22:00.786 --> 01:22:01.706
categories too.

01:22:03.236 --> 01:22:04.896
This page is just packed full of

01:22:04.896 --> 01:22:05.756
recommendations.

01:22:06.306 --> 01:22:07.596
This artsy game looks fun.

01:22:07.826 --> 01:22:08.606
Let's check it out.

01:22:08.666 --> 01:22:10.346
I'm going to tap on the icon and

01:22:10.716 --> 01:22:12.916
it opens up a redesigned app

01:22:13.146 --> 01:22:13.586
page.

01:22:13.686 --> 01:22:15.496
It's more beautiful and more

01:22:15.496 --> 01:22:16.046
useful.

01:22:16.486 --> 01:22:18.026
I can watch more videos that

01:22:18.026 --> 01:22:19.546
show me how fun this is.

01:22:19.546 --> 01:22:21.656
And this badge at the top tells

01:22:21.696 --> 01:22:23.626
me it was named editor's choice.

01:22:23.626 --> 01:22:26.116
If I scroll down, I can see

01:22:26.116 --> 01:22:27.596
ratings and reviews front and

01:22:27.596 --> 01:22:29.206
center so I can see what other

01:22:29.206 --> 01:22:30.966
customers think before making a

01:22:31.006 --> 01:22:31.346
choice.

01:22:31.866 --> 01:22:34.056
Like this review, it tells me

01:22:34.056 --> 01:22:35.506
this game is great for killing

01:22:35.676 --> 01:22:35.906
time.

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:38.446
Thanks, FuriousPotatoFace.

01:22:39.056 --> 01:22:42.246
For all the incredible apps on

01:22:42.246 --> 01:22:43.906
the store there's a new tab too,

01:22:44.106 --> 01:22:44.596
the Apps tab.

01:22:45.036 --> 01:22:45.616
Let's go there.

01:22:46.676 --> 01:22:48.466
It shares the same great design

01:22:48.776 --> 01:22:50.256
as the Games tab but with a

01:22:50.336 --> 01:22:51.646
focus just on apps.

01:22:51.896 --> 01:22:55.136
So that was just the first day

01:22:55.196 --> 01:22:56.306
on the new App Store.

01:22:56.466 --> 01:22:58.366
Now you can see why we're so

01:22:58.366 --> 01:23:00.006
excited to have a beautiful new

01:23:00.006 --> 01:23:02.216
place to share apps and games we

01:23:02.216 --> 01:23:02.996
love with you.

01:23:02.996 --> 01:23:04.316

01:23:11.566 --> 01:23:12.846
So that's your first glimpse of

01:23:12.846 --> 01:23:14.476
an entirely new App Store.

01:23:14.566 --> 01:23:15.496
We hope you love it.

01:23:15.496 --> 01:23:16.946
We hope customers love it and

01:23:17.146 --> 01:23:18.716
visit it every single day to

01:23:18.716 --> 01:23:20.196
download your incredible apps.

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.936
And that's it for the App Store.

01:23:22.936 --> 01:23:23.766
Back to you, Craig.

01:23:28.426 --> 01:23:29.736
The App Store looks just

01:23:29.786 --> 01:23:30.626
fantastic.

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:32.856
So those are some of the big

01:23:32.926 --> 01:23:35.216
features in iOS 11.

01:23:35.216 --> 01:23:37.026
But of course, there's also core

01:23:37.026 --> 01:23:37.726
technologies.

01:23:37.726 --> 01:23:39.626
Now, Metal 2 and HEVC coming to

01:23:39.786 --> 01:23:43.376
iOS as well, but there's more

01:23:43.376 --> 01:23:45.806
and it starts with machine

01:23:45.806 --> 01:23:46.186
learning.

01:23:46.916 --> 01:23:49.136
Now, you've seen the way we've

01:23:49.186 --> 01:23:50.626
used machine leaning throughout

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:52.766
the experiences on Apple Watch,

01:23:53.006 --> 01:23:54.256
for instance, and the predictive

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:55.456
Siri watch face.

01:23:56.536 --> 01:23:59.216
We use it on the iPad for palm

01:23:59.216 --> 01:24:00.256
rejection when you're writing

01:24:00.256 --> 01:24:01.126
with Apple Pencil.

01:24:01.126 --> 01:24:04.706
Of course, we use it to extend

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.046
your battery life by predicting

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:06.906
how you're going to use your

01:24:06.906 --> 01:24:07.486
device.

01:24:08.456 --> 01:24:09.746
And you've seen it throughout

01:24:09.876 --> 01:24:12.486
photos with memories and face

01:24:12.486 --> 01:24:13.086
recognition.

01:24:13.796 --> 01:24:14.916
Well now, for all of you

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.186
developers, we want to make

01:24:16.246 --> 01:24:18.046
powerful machine learning easy

01:24:18.046 --> 01:24:19.366
for you to incorporate in your

01:24:19.366 --> 01:24:19.706
apps.

01:24:19.926 --> 01:24:21.496
And we're doing it via set of

01:24:21.846 --> 01:24:22.786
new APIs.

01:24:23.196 --> 01:24:24.766
Starts with the vision API which

01:24:24.766 --> 01:24:26.496
provides face tracking, face

01:24:26.496 --> 01:24:27.926
detection, landmarks, all of

01:24:27.926 --> 01:24:29.206
these core features we use

01:24:29.206 --> 01:24:30.886
inside of our apps.

01:24:31.596 --> 01:24:33.336
And the natural language API

01:24:33.336 --> 01:24:35.186
that provides capabilities like

01:24:35.216 --> 01:24:36.836
tokenization and named entity

01:24:36.836 --> 01:24:37.516
recognition.

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:40.146
Now, these are all built on Core

01:24:40.396 --> 01:24:40.626
ML.

01:24:40.626 --> 01:24:44.366
And Core ML provides high

01:24:44.366 --> 01:24:46.196
performance implementations of

01:24:46.196 --> 01:24:47.756
deep neural networks, recurrent

01:24:47.756 --> 01:24:49.136
neural networks, convolution

01:24:49.136 --> 01:24:50.406
neural networks, support vector

01:24:50.406 --> 01:24:50.946
machines.

01:24:51.476 --> 01:24:52.666
And they allow you to take

01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:53.726
models that you've built with

01:24:53.726 --> 01:24:55.376
any of these popular third party

01:24:55.376 --> 01:24:55.806
tools.

01:24:56.156 --> 01:24:57.716
And using our machine leaning

01:24:57.716 --> 01:24:59.806

01:24:59.806 --> 01:25:02.056

carefully tuned compatibility

01:25:06.896 --> 01:25:08.736
with all of our platforms, and

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.476
the performance really is

01:25:10.476 --> 01:25:11.186

You look at this benchmark

01:25:12.596 --> 01:25:13.916
called Inception v3.

Next, I'd like to turn to AR.

01:25:32.156 --> 01:25:35.276
Now, with Multi-Touch, it really

01:25:35.276 --> 01:25:36.646
changed the way that you

01:25:36.646 --> 01:25:38.866
interact with the world on the

01:25:38.866 --> 01:25:39.936
screen of your iPhone.

01:25:40.756 --> 01:25:42.346
And with the camera, it allowed

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:44.496
you to capture the world around

01:25:44.496 --> 01:25:44.696
you.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.406
But when you bring these things

01:25:46.406 --> 01:25:48.186
together, the results can

01:25:48.246 --> 01:25:49.586
actually be quite profound.

01:25:50.026 --> 01:25:51.096
Now it's called the augmented

01:25:51.096 --> 01:25:53.306

01:25:53.306 --> 01:25:56.106
technology called ARKit to bring

it to all of you.

01:25:57.226 --> 01:25:58.676
And I'd like to show it to you

something for real.

01:26:14.926 --> 01:26:16.616

surfaces such as this table and

01:26:26.076 --> 01:26:27.726

01:26:55.516 --> 01:26:57.496
I'm going to move the cup and

01:27:38.976 --> 01:27:40.526

not the size of an elephant.

The implementation is possible

01:27:53.666 --> 01:27:54.516
because we're able to take

01:27:54.516 --> 01:27:55.456

01:28:01.536 --> 01:28:03.006
And when you bring the software

01:28:03.006 --> 01:28:05.546
together with these devices, we

Well, as you know, there's two

01:34:46.926 --> 01:34:48.206
models to iPad Pro today.

01:34:48.206 --> 01:34:50.226
There's a 13-inch and a

01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:51.316
9.7-inch.

01:34:51.666 --> 01:34:53.336
And the 9.7-inch is our most

01:34:53.376 --> 01:34:54.216
popular model.

01:34:54.786 --> 01:34:56.296
It has a screen large enough to

01:34:56.296 --> 01:34:57.776
get your work done, but it's in

01:34:57.776 --> 01:34:59.146
a thin and light enough package

01:34:59.146 --> 01:35:00.316
that allows you to take it with

01:35:00.346 --> 01:35:01.626
you everywhere you go.

01:35:02.516 --> 01:35:03.636
Well, today, we're going to

01:35:03.636 --> 01:35:05.556
introduce an all new iPad Pro.

01:35:06.356 --> 01:35:07.246
It's going to take everything

01:35:07.246 --> 01:35:09.776
you love about the 9.7-inch and

01:35:09.966 --> 01:35:10.996
give you a whole lot more to

01:35:10.996 --> 01:35:11.266
love.

01:35:11.776 --> 01:35:13.146
Let's take a look.

01:35:14.596 --> 01:35:16.756
This is the new iPad Pro.

01:35:17.516 --> 01:35:21.196
[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:35:21.696 --> 01:35:23.136
It's the first iPad Pro with a

01:35:23.136 --> 01:35:25.106
larger 10 and a half inch Retina

01:35:25.106 --> 01:35:25.836
display.

01:35:26.726 --> 01:35:27.976
Now, why 10 and a half inch?

01:35:28.566 --> 01:35:29.676
Well, for one, it's a lot

01:35:29.676 --> 01:35:30.146
larger.

01:35:30.376 --> 01:35:32.776
It's 20% larger than a 9.7-inch.

01:35:33.066 --> 01:35:34.306
But we are able to reduce the

01:35:34.306 --> 01:35:35.996
borders by nearly 40% which

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:37.436
allows us to submit it in this

01:35:37.436 --> 01:35:39.536
incredibly compact design that

01:35:39.536 --> 01:35:42.076
still weighs just one pound.

01:35:42.586 --> 01:35:45.456
And of course, 10.5-inch also

01:35:45.456 --> 01:35:46.396
allows us to do some other

01:35:46.466 --> 01:35:46.776
things.

01:35:47.146 --> 01:35:49.176
It's the perfect size to allow

01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:50.916
us to display a full-size

01:35:51.006 --> 01:35:52.396
on-screen keyboard.

01:35:53.516 --> 01:35:57.166
[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:35:57.666 --> 01:35:59.166
It's also the perfect size to

01:35:59.166 --> 01:36:00.526
allow us to have a full-size

01:36:00.526 --> 01:36:02.256
Smart keyboard as well.

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:04.306
And when we deliver the Smart

01:36:04.306 --> 01:36:05.106
keyboard, we're going to have

01:36:05.166 --> 01:36:06.646
support for more than 30

01:36:06.646 --> 01:36:08.576
languages at launch including

01:36:08.576 --> 01:36:10.416
Chinese, and for the very first

01:36:10.416 --> 01:36:12.976
time, a Japanese JIS keyboard.

01:36:13.516 --> 01:36:17.006
[ Applause ]

01:36:17.506 --> 01:36:19.556
Now, iPad Pro has always had the

01:36:19.636 --> 01:36:21.386
best displays in the industry.

01:36:21.706 --> 01:36:24.266
And both sizes are going to get

01:36:24.266 --> 01:36:25.946
really incredible new displays

01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:26.086
today.

01:36:26.086 --> 01:36:27.986
They're the best displays that

01:36:27.986 --> 01:36:28.866
we've ever made.

01:36:29.996 --> 01:36:31.076
They're packed with incredible

01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:32.246
features like True Tone for

01:36:32.246 --> 01:36:34.866
automatic white balance, P3 wide

01:36:34.866 --> 01:36:36.606
color gamut for the best color,

01:36:37.746 --> 01:36:39.626
ultralow reflectivity, the best

01:36:39.736 --> 01:36:40.746
in the industry.

01:36:41.466 --> 01:36:42.936
And they're 50% brighter with

01:36:43.066 --> 01:36:43.936
600 nits.

01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:46.226
And this extra brightness and

01:36:46.226 --> 01:36:47.546
the P3 wide color gamut means

01:36:47.546 --> 01:36:49.006
that with iOS 11, you'll be able

01:36:49.006 --> 01:36:51.086
to display HDR video for the

01:36:51.086 --> 01:36:53.256
first time in an iPad for really

01:36:53.256 --> 01:36:55.036
immersive cinematic experience.

01:36:55.436 --> 01:36:56.886
They're truly awesome displays.

01:36:57.616 --> 01:36:59.746
But our biggest breakthrough is

01:36:59.746 --> 01:37:01.566
a feature we call ProMotion.

01:37:02.366 --> 01:37:03.236
So what is ProMotion?

01:37:03.726 --> 01:37:05.026
Well, we were able to take our

01:37:05.026 --> 01:37:06.976
unique hardware and software

01:37:07.326 --> 01:37:09.746
capabilities and dramatically

01:37:09.746 --> 01:37:11.596
improve our display performance.

01:37:12.386 --> 01:37:13.836
Now, typically, up until today,

01:37:13.836 --> 01:37:15.436
mobile displays have refresh at

01:37:15.506 --> 01:37:16.746
60 hertz, means they update the

01:37:16.746 --> 01:37:18.806
content 60 times every second.

01:37:19.426 --> 01:37:22.446
Well, on the new iPad Pro, we've

01:37:22.446 --> 01:37:24.016
doubled that maximum refresh

01:37:24.016 --> 01:37:26.976
rate to an incredible 120 hertz.

01:37:27.516 --> 01:37:31.636
[ Applause ]

01:37:32.136 --> 01:37:33.326
So what does that mean to you?

01:37:33.326 --> 01:37:34.786
It means that all of your motion

01:37:34.786 --> 01:37:35.896
content on your screen is going

01:37:35.896 --> 01:37:38.646
to be smoother, crisper, more

01:37:38.696 --> 01:37:39.296
responsive.

01:37:40.306 --> 01:37:41.186
Now, this is something you have

01:37:41.186 --> 01:37:42.196
to really touch and feel

01:37:42.196 --> 01:37:43.796
yourself to appreciate because

01:37:43.796 --> 01:37:45.076
our projection systems just

01:37:45.076 --> 01:37:46.286
aren't capable of doing those

01:37:46.286 --> 01:37:47.276
type of refresh rates.

01:37:47.726 --> 01:37:48.896
But I'll tell you the difference

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:49.706
is dramatic.

01:37:49.706 --> 01:37:51.326
And when you scroll, it's

01:37:51.446 --> 01:37:52.296
buttery smooth.

01:37:53.446 --> 01:37:54.736
Now, the higher refresh rate

01:37:54.736 --> 01:37:56.466
also means it works even better

01:37:56.466 --> 01:37:57.416
with the Apple Pencil.

01:37:57.696 --> 01:37:58.836
We already have the

01:37:58.836 --> 01:38:00.366
industry-leading performance for

01:38:00.366 --> 01:38:01.726
drawing and writing with the

01:38:01.726 --> 01:38:02.726
Apple Pencil, but with

01:38:02.726 --> 01:38:04.316
ProMotion, it gets even better.

01:38:05.206 --> 01:38:06.516
It's more responsive and it

01:38:06.516 --> 01:38:07.936
reduces our latency to an

01:38:07.936 --> 01:38:10.566
industry best 20 milliseconds.

01:38:11.516 --> 01:38:14.826
[ Applause ]

01:38:15.326 --> 01:38:17.206
So drawing is incredibly fluid

01:38:17.206 --> 01:38:18.626
and even more natural, you're

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:20.486
going to love using the Apple

01:38:20.486 --> 01:38:22.166
Pencil of the new iPad Pro.

01:38:22.436 --> 01:38:23.446
Another breakthrough of

01:38:23.446 --> 01:38:25.076
ProMotion is that these become

01:38:25.076 --> 01:38:26.516
the first mobile displays to be

01:38:26.516 --> 01:38:28.266
able to dynamically adjust the

01:38:28.266 --> 01:38:29.926
refresh rate, depending on what

01:38:29.926 --> 01:38:30.956
you're looking at.

01:38:30.956 --> 01:38:31.966
This is a really big

01:38:31.966 --> 01:38:33.166
breakthrough for both display

01:38:33.166 --> 01:38:35.416
quality, as well as for power

01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:35.876
savings.

01:38:36.356 --> 01:38:37.686
So when you have dash-moving

01:38:37.686 --> 01:38:38.826
content, they can update

01:38:38.826 --> 01:38:39.306
quickly.

01:38:40.056 --> 01:38:42.266
But they can also update slower

01:38:42.266 --> 01:38:43.516
when you don't need that type of

01:38:43.516 --> 01:38:44.016
refresh rate.

01:38:44.016 --> 01:38:45.816
For example, a still image, this

01:38:45.816 --> 01:38:46.886
allows us to save a lot of

01:38:46.886 --> 01:38:47.926
energy and give you better

01:38:47.926 --> 01:38:48.656
battery life.

01:38:49.406 --> 01:38:50.606
So, hopefully you see why these

01:38:50.606 --> 01:38:52.176
are not just the best displays

01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:54.006
that we've ever made, but we

01:38:54.006 --> 01:38:54.996
think they're the most advanced

01:38:55.026 --> 01:38:56.026
displays in the planet.

01:38:57.516 --> 01:38:58.506
Next, let's talk about

01:38:58.506 --> 01:38:58.976
performance.

01:39:00.296 --> 01:39:02.296
iPad is already best in class

01:39:02.296 --> 01:39:03.046
for performance.

01:39:03.436 --> 01:39:04.466
But we're not resting on our

01:39:04.466 --> 01:39:05.066
laurels.

01:39:05.656 --> 01:39:07.406
These are the fastest we've ever

01:39:07.406 --> 01:39:07.906
created.

01:39:08.496 --> 01:39:10.066
Inside them, they're powered by

01:39:10.066 --> 01:39:12.756
the A10X Fusion chip.

01:39:12.756 --> 01:39:15.506
The A10X has a six-core CPU,

01:39:15.546 --> 01:39:16.886
three high-performance cores,

01:39:17.216 --> 01:39:18.716
three high-efficiency cores, all

01:39:18.716 --> 01:39:20.406
automatically managed by the

01:39:20.406 --> 01:39:22.196
Apple performance controller.

01:39:22.826 --> 01:39:25.406
It also has a 12-core GPU.

01:39:25.676 --> 01:39:27.616
This is a powerhouse.

01:39:28.116 --> 01:39:30.946
And it delivers 30% faster CPU

01:39:30.946 --> 01:39:32.926
performance over our already

01:39:32.926 --> 01:39:35.666
industry leading A9X and 40%

01:39:35.666 --> 01:39:37.836
faster graphics performance.

01:39:38.516 --> 01:39:43.096
[ Applause ]

01:39:43.596 --> 01:39:45.416
Our chip team has done just an

01:39:45.416 --> 01:39:47.646
amazing job over the years with

01:39:47.646 --> 01:39:48.806
the performance improvements and

01:39:48.806 --> 01:39:50.206
results have been staggering.

01:39:50.546 --> 01:39:51.146
They're delivering an

01:39:51.146 --> 01:39:52.296
industry-leading graphics

01:39:52.376 --> 01:39:54.596
performance that's more than 500

01:39:54.596 --> 01:39:56.086
times the original iPad from

01:39:56.086 --> 01:39:57.646
just a few years ago.

01:39:58.866 --> 01:40:00.636
But of course, numbers only tell

01:40:00.636 --> 01:40:01.426
part of the story.

01:40:02.186 --> 01:40:03.396
To demonstrate the real-world

01:40:03.396 --> 01:40:04.776
performance of the A10X in the

01:40:04.776 --> 01:40:06.896
new iPad Pro, I'd like to invite

01:40:06.896 --> 01:40:09.506
Ash Hewson of Serif to give you

01:40:09.506 --> 01:40:10.936
a demo of their new Pro photo

01:40:10.936 --> 01:40:12.426
editing app called Affinity

[ Applause ]

01:40:16.006 --> 01:40:16.406
>> Thanks, Joz.

01:40:18.926 --> 01:40:19.986
So I'm thrilled today to be able

01:40:19.986 --> 01:40:21.396
to show you the iPad version of

01:40:21.396 --> 01:40:22.206
Affinity Photo.

01:40:22.766 --> 01:40:24.056
This is a truly high-end

01:40:24.126 --> 01:40:25.876
professional photo editing tool.

01:40:26.256 --> 01:40:28.306
And on this latest iPad Pro, we

01:40:28.306 --> 01:40:29.116
can achieve levels of

01:40:29.116 --> 01:40:30.676
performance which is simply

01:40:30.676 --> 01:40:32.486
unattainable on any other

01:40:32.786 --> 01:40:33.176
device.

01:40:33.176 --> 01:40:33.926
And I'm going to try and show

01:40:33.926 --> 01:40:35.536
you that today by creating a

01:40:35.536 --> 01:40:36.286
movie poster.

01:40:36.286 --> 01:40:37.136
I've already set up a few

01:40:37.136 --> 01:40:37.466
layers.

01:40:37.466 --> 01:40:38.286
I've kind of got this great

01:40:38.286 --> 01:40:39.636
background of some stormy sky.

01:40:39.636 --> 01:40:41.666
I've got a turbulent sea and

01:40:41.666 --> 01:40:42.156
this ship.

01:40:42.466 --> 01:40:43.116
Now, the first thing you'll

01:40:43.116 --> 01:40:44.276
notice when you're using this is

01:40:44.276 --> 01:40:45.486
as you're kind of moving layers

01:40:45.486 --> 01:40:47.576
around, rotating them or even

01:40:47.576 --> 01:40:49.736
just sort of panning and zooming

01:40:49.736 --> 01:40:51.336
around your work, I'm seeing all

01:40:51.336 --> 01:40:53.336
of these now at 120 frames a

01:40:53.336 --> 01:40:53.696
second.

01:40:53.696 --> 01:40:54.946
So it just feels incredibly

01:40:55.006 --> 01:40:55.426
smooth.

01:40:55.426 --> 01:40:57.106
But when you come to edit

01:40:57.106 --> 01:40:59.506
layers, because of Metal, we can

01:40:59.506 --> 01:41:00.576
achieve performance more than

01:41:00.706 --> 01:41:04.166
four times than i7 quad core

01:41:04.166 --> 01:41:04.986
desktop PC.

01:41:04.986 --> 01:41:06.436
And I'll show you what that

01:41:06.436 --> 01:41:06.766
means.

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:08.416
On this sea, I'm going to apply

01:41:08.736 --> 01:41:09.576
a 12 filter.

01:41:09.906 --> 01:41:11.606
And look, just with my finger, I

01:41:11.606 --> 01:41:13.226
can kind of push this sea

01:41:13.226 --> 01:41:14.376
around, or I can even just like

01:41:14.376 --> 01:41:16.776
flick away right over the side

01:41:16.776 --> 01:41:17.696
of the ship.

01:41:17.796 --> 01:41:19.566
It's a totally new way to kind

01:41:19.566 --> 01:41:21.676
of interact with your designs.

01:41:22.146 --> 01:41:23.206
And actually, everything is this

01:41:23.206 --> 01:41:23.326
fast.

01:41:23.326 --> 01:41:25.456
So let's-- So I wanted to set

01:41:25.456 --> 01:41:27.716
this ship on fire, for example.

01:41:28.116 --> 01:41:29.366
I've got this fire up all here.

01:41:29.456 --> 01:41:30.666
I can move this over the back of

01:41:30.666 --> 01:41:31.006
the ship.

01:41:31.006 --> 01:41:31.906
But to make that look more

01:41:31.906 --> 01:41:33.886
realistic, I need to apply blend

01:41:33.886 --> 01:41:34.096
mode.

01:41:34.096 --> 01:41:35.796
Now normally, blend modes is

01:41:35.796 --> 01:41:36.836
something that takes a lot of

01:41:36.836 --> 01:41:37.376
trial and error.

01:41:37.376 --> 01:41:38.816
But now, look at this.

01:41:38.816 --> 01:41:40.166
So I can just scrub down here

01:41:40.546 --> 01:41:42.036
and I'll get an instant preview

01:41:42.036 --> 01:41:42.936
of all the different blend

01:41:42.936 --> 01:41:43.106
modes.

01:41:43.106 --> 01:41:44.036
So it makes it really, really

01:41:44.036 --> 01:41:45.926
easy to select the right blend

01:41:45.926 --> 01:41:47.256
modes that I want.

01:41:47.256 --> 01:41:49.306
Now of course, everything I've

01:41:49.306 --> 01:41:50.556
done so far, I've done using

01:41:50.556 --> 01:41:50.956
touch.

01:41:50.956 --> 01:41:52.606
But with iPad Pro, we have the

01:41:52.656 --> 01:41:54.246
best stylus that's ever been

01:41:54.246 --> 01:41:54.576
made.

01:41:54.726 --> 01:41:56.256
And we can do some great stuff

01:41:56.256 --> 01:41:57.326
with Apple Pencil, too.

01:41:57.606 --> 01:41:59.196
A really good example of that is

01:41:59.196 --> 01:42:00.206
our lighting filter.

01:42:00.326 --> 01:42:01.556
So here, I'll choose lighting,

01:42:02.446 --> 01:42:03.346
and make that a bit bigger.

01:42:03.606 --> 01:42:04.936
And look, I can actually control

01:42:04.936 --> 01:42:06.816
now the angle and the tilt of

01:42:06.816 --> 01:42:08.866
that light using Apple Pencil.

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:10.576
There's no latency, whatsoever.

01:42:10.576 --> 01:42:12.356
So it's a really immersive way

01:42:12.806 --> 01:42:13.376
to work.

01:42:13.376 --> 01:42:15.916
Now, I said at the start, I was

01:42:15.916 --> 01:42:17.486
creating a movie poster.

01:42:17.486 --> 01:42:18.576
And in fact, what I'm actually

01:42:18.576 --> 01:42:19.926
doing is creating a pirate movie

01:42:19.926 --> 01:42:20.316
poster.

01:42:20.316 --> 01:42:21.436
So now, I need a pirate.

01:42:21.946 --> 01:42:22.846
And I've got Captain Jack

01:42:22.846 --> 01:42:23.506
Sparrow here.

01:42:23.506 --> 01:42:25.256
But at the moment, of course,

01:42:25.256 --> 01:42:26.616
he's on the wrong background.

01:42:26.616 --> 01:42:27.666
So what I need to do is cut him

01:42:27.666 --> 01:42:27.846
out.

01:42:27.846 --> 01:42:28.666
And I'm going to use some

01:42:28.666 --> 01:42:29.896
selection tool to do that.

01:42:29.896 --> 01:42:30.646
So, to start with, I'm just

01:42:30.646 --> 01:42:31.996
going to do-- and you can see

01:42:31.996 --> 01:42:33.806
how quick it is to do a really

01:42:33.996 --> 01:42:35.906
quick selection with pencil to

01:42:35.906 --> 01:42:37.146
sort of snap around the edges.

01:42:37.456 --> 01:42:38.496
But of course, with selections,

01:42:38.496 --> 01:42:39.676
what often happens is you need

01:42:39.676 --> 01:42:40.686
to do a much more accurate

01:42:40.686 --> 01:42:41.726
selection around hair.

01:42:41.726 --> 01:42:42.656
And to do that, we're going to

01:42:42.656 --> 01:42:43.816
do a selection refinement.

01:42:44.276 --> 01:42:45.226
This is something that takes a

01:42:45.226 --> 01:42:47.266
huge amount of CPU power, but on

01:42:47.266 --> 01:42:48.886
this latest iPad, it's twice as

01:42:48.886 --> 01:42:49.946
fast as ever before.

01:42:50.236 --> 01:42:51.266
And you can see pretty much

01:42:51.306 --> 01:42:52.636
instantly, I'll get a selection

01:42:52.636 --> 01:42:54.046
down to individual strands of

01:42:54.046 --> 01:42:54.326
hair.

01:42:55.516 --> 01:42:59.606
[ Applause ]

01:43:00.106 --> 01:43:01.556
And that's it, that's my poster

01:43:01.556 --> 01:43:03.496
complete, a professional looking

01:43:03.496 --> 01:43:06.826
poster created on a device that

01:43:06.826 --> 01:43:08.916
I can hold in my hands.

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.946
It's really incredible.

01:43:11.116 --> 01:43:12.316
I really think that iPad Pro,

01:43:12.366 --> 01:43:14.446
alongside Affinity Photo, is a

01:43:14.446 --> 01:43:16.146
truly game-changing experience

01:43:16.146 --> 01:43:17.376
for professional photo editing.

01:43:17.376 --> 01:43:18.226
And the best thing of all is

01:43:18.226 --> 01:43:19.646
that you can now experience it

01:43:19.646 --> 01:43:21.436
now, because I'm delighted to

01:43:21.546 --> 01:43:23.236
announce that Affinity Photo for

01:43:23.286 --> 01:43:24.736
iPad is available on the App

01:43:24.736 --> 01:43:25.956

01:43:25.956 --> 01:43:27.246
Thank you.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

01:43:31.996 --> 01:43:34.836
>> Wow. Thank you, Ash.

01:43:34.876 --> 01:43:36.206
That's amazing performance,

01:43:36.206 --> 01:43:37.436
again, especially for a device

01:43:37.436 --> 01:43:38.956
that's so thin and light in a

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:40.226
simple one-pound package you

01:43:40.226 --> 01:43:41.386
could take with you everywhere

01:43:41.386 --> 01:43:41.816
you go.

01:43:42.646 --> 01:43:44.056
And what's also cool is despite

01:43:44.096 --> 01:43:45.486
all this performance to new,

01:43:45.806 --> 01:43:48.036
iPad Pro still delivers the same

01:43:48.086 --> 01:43:49.706
all day 10-hour battery life

01:43:49.736 --> 01:43:50.996
that our iPad users love.

01:43:51.446 --> 01:43:53.956
Next, let's talk about cameras.

01:43:54.766 --> 01:43:56.896
The new iPad Pro features the

01:43:56.896 --> 01:43:58.396
latest camera system from our

01:43:58.396 --> 01:43:59.066
iPhone 7.

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:00.536
That means the same high

01:44:00.656 --> 01:44:03.396
performance 12 megapixel sensor

01:44:03.676 --> 01:44:04.626
with optical image

01:44:04.626 --> 01:44:05.466
stabilization.

01:44:05.466 --> 01:44:07.376
And it has the ability to even

01:44:07.706 --> 01:44:09.576
capture and, of course, edit 4K

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:10.816
video on the go.

01:44:10.816 --> 01:44:12.016
They're absolutely fantastic

01:44:12.016 --> 01:44:12.486
cameras.

01:44:13.076 --> 01:44:14.196
The front-facing cameras from

01:44:14.196 --> 01:44:15.636
the iPhone 7 as well got all

01:44:15.636 --> 01:44:18.086
these great features, like wide

01:44:18.086 --> 01:44:20.156
color gamut capture, auto image

01:44:20.156 --> 01:44:21.506
stabilization and the entire

01:44:21.506 --> 01:44:22.756
display can light up to become

01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:24.666
the world's brightest and

01:44:24.666 --> 01:44:26.156
largest Retina flash.

We have great accessories as

01:44:28.606 --> 01:44:29.066
well.

01:44:29.996 --> 01:44:32.696
The iPad Pro supports USB 3,

01:44:33.006 --> 01:44:33.896
which means that you're going to

01:44:33.896 --> 01:44:35.906
get faster transfers with your

01:44:35.906 --> 01:44:37.276
USB and SD camera adapters.

And this also-- We also support

01:44:40.346 --> 01:44:42.056
fast charging, means any of our

01:44:42.116 --> 01:44:44.716
USB-C charge adapters will now

01:44:44.716 --> 01:44:46.216
allow you to charge at half the

01:44:46.286 --> 01:44:46.636
time.

polyurethane and then we're

01:44:52.486 --> 01:44:53.636
bringing back the popular

01:44:53.636 --> 01:44:54.716
leather as well.

01:44:54.716 --> 01:44:56.326
And then we've designed an all

01:44:56.326 --> 01:44:57.646
new leather sleeve with a

built-in storage for your Apple

01:44:59.026 --> 01:44:59.426

01:45:00.376 --> 01:45:01.606
So that's the new iPad Pro

01:45:01.606 --> 01:45:03.196

01:45:14.486 --> 01:45:16.066
expect, we make all this in

01:45:17.386 --> 01:45:18.066

amount of memory that comes at

01:45:23.646 --> 01:45:24.436
the beginning of these

01:45:24.436 --> 01:45:25.356

64 gigs will now be at $649 and

01:45:40.936 --> 01:45:43.466
it's just $150 more to move up

01:45:43.466 --> 01:45:47.916
to the bigger display at $799.

including your continuity apps.

And now you can summon the dock

01:47:05.126 --> 01:47:06.486
from anywhere right from the

01:47:06.486 --> 01:47:08.456
bottom of the screen and use it

01:47:08.456 --> 01:47:10.616
for switching apps just like

01:47:10.616 --> 01:47:11.066
that.

And what's incredible is how

01:47:12.866 --> 01:47:14.516
it's used for multitasking.

01:47:14.866 --> 01:47:16.396
So now if you're in an app and

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:18.146
you swipe up, we can pull an app

01:47:18.146 --> 01:47:21.676
out just like that into Slide

01:47:32.606 --> 01:47:34.306
really cool is the new app

ultimate multi-handed,

so excited to bring drag and

drag text, you can drag URLs,

01:47:58.566 --> 01:47:59.906
you can multi-select and

But of course sometimes you have

01:48:06.596 --> 01:48:07.596
to type and so we made the

01:48:07.656 --> 01:48:09.126
keyboard even more productive as

01:48:09.126 --> 01:48:09.516
well.

01:53:37.506 --> 01:53:39.356
up right there and share it.

Pencil deeply into Notes.

01:53:49.796 --> 01:53:51.076
So if you're working on a note

01:53:51.076 --> 01:53:52.216
and later you're at the lock

01:53:58.966 --> 01:54:01.026

01:54:01.026 --> 01:54:02.476
So we can now search handwriting

01:54:02.476 --> 01:54:03.616
and we use deep learning to

01:54:03.616 --> 01:54:05.096
recognize what you write.

01:54:05.896 --> 01:54:07.936
And if you're doing primarily

01:54:08.016 --> 01:54:10.006
typed notes, you can now also do

01:54:10.006 --> 01:54:12.236
inline drawings, right there.

01:54:12.236 --> 01:54:15.306

01:54:19.336 --> 01:54:20.596
still have to deal with paper,

01:54:20.866 --> 01:54:22.596
so Notes now has a built-in

01:54:22.666 --> 01:54:23.796
document scanner.

01:54:23.796 --> 01:54:25.756
It can correct perspective and

01:54:25.756 --> 01:54:26.456
contrast.

01:54:28.006 --> 01:54:29.166
And when you bring the note in,

01:54:30.346 --> 01:54:31.616
you can mark it up, write with

01:54:31.656 --> 01:54:31.976

Well, the first thing I want to

01:54:59.306 --> 01:55:01.046
show you is a quick way of

01:55:01.046 --> 01:55:03.026
getting to your notes using your

01:55:03.026 --> 01:55:03.726
Apple Pencil.

01:55:04.736 --> 01:55:06.206
You just tap on the lock screen

01:55:06.206 --> 01:55:08.566
like this and it slides up to

01:55:08.566 --> 01:55:10.136
reveal your notes beneath it.

01:55:10.726 --> 01:55:11.856
Now you can see here I've got a

01:55:12.046 --> 01:55:13.546
handwritten note and I want to

01:55:13.546 --> 01:55:14.936
show you how easy it is to

01:55:14.936 --> 01:55:17.036
create one of these.

01:55:17.036 --> 01:55:18.206
Watch at the top of the note

01:55:18.206 --> 01:55:19.556
here as I edit the title.

01:55:19.916 --> 01:55:21.356
Just by putting the pencil down

01:55:21.856 --> 01:55:24.876
and writing like this, after the

01:55:25.056 --> 01:55:29.076
2017 keynote.

01:55:30.216 --> 01:55:31.526
It's as natural as putting

01:55:31.526 --> 01:55:32.576
pencil to paper.

01:55:33.156 --> 01:55:34.626
Now something paper can't help

01:55:34.626 --> 01:55:35.986
you with is finding your notes

01:55:35.986 --> 01:55:36.776
again later.

01:55:37.276 --> 01:55:38.636
We're using machine learning to

01:55:38.636 --> 01:55:40.666
recognize your handwriting and

01:55:40.666 --> 01:55:42.016
index it in Spotlight.

01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:44.316
Let's switch into Spotlight now

01:55:44.316 --> 01:55:45.906
and we'll search for that text

01:55:45.986 --> 01:55:47.126
that I just wrote down.

01:55:47.816 --> 01:55:48.746
You can see here I've got the

01:55:48.746 --> 01:55:50.306
new flick keyboard which makes

01:55:50.306 --> 01:55:52.006
it really easy to enter numbers

01:55:52.376 --> 01:55:54.466
just by swiping down on the keys

01:55:54.466 --> 01:55:55.316
like this.

different note now, because I

01:56:11.846 --> 01:56:13.066
want to show you how you can mix

01:56:13.066 --> 01:56:15.116

other great features.

01:56:18.286 --> 01:56:19.476
This is a note that my young

01:56:19.476 --> 01:56:20.826
daughter shared with me as part

01:56:20.826 --> 01:56:22.826
of a school assignment where she

01:56:22.826 --> 01:56:24.086
had to work with her parents to

01:56:24.086 --> 01:56:26.056
develop an idea for a new app.

01:56:26.696 --> 01:56:27.886
Now, she asked me how many

01:56:27.886 --> 01:56:29.346
copies of our app I thought I

01:56:29.346 --> 01:56:31.376
might sell-- We might sell.

01:56:31.376 --> 01:56:32.976
And so, I want to quickly draw a

01:56:32.976 --> 01:56:35.056
graph to give her some idea of

01:56:35.056 --> 01:56:35.146
that.

01:56:35.146 --> 01:56:36.986
I'm just going to press down

01:56:36.986 --> 01:56:38.116
here with the pencil to make

01:56:38.116 --> 01:56:40.576
some space for my drawing and

01:56:40.576 --> 01:56:41.536
then we can take that little

01:56:41.536 --> 01:56:43.446
grabber and open up some more

01:56:43.446 --> 01:56:43.696
room.

01:56:44.066 --> 01:56:46.696
Now, I am really bad at drawing

01:56:46.796 --> 01:56:48.406
but I just love doing it.

01:56:48.776 --> 01:56:50.026
And what's great about drawing

01:56:50.026 --> 01:56:51.956
on the iPad is it works the same

01:56:51.956 --> 01:56:53.376
way as it does with paper.

01:56:53.376 --> 01:56:55.286
And that means it's really easy

01:56:55.396 --> 01:56:56.986
for me to draw really badly

01:56:57.386 --> 01:56:58.066
right here.

01:56:58.646 --> 01:57:01.106

01:57:01.966 --> 01:57:03.986
pencil down and just like that,

01:57:05.536 --> 01:57:05.996
zoom.

01:57:06.486 --> 01:57:07.936
It's so simple, and I think

01:57:07.936 --> 01:57:09.376
you're going to have a lot of

01:57:09.376 --> 01:57:10.916

01:57:10.916 --> 01:57:11.356

01:57:11.966 --> 01:57:13.476
But let's move on now.

01:57:13.876 --> 01:57:15.926
So, my daughter's learned a few

01:57:15.996 --> 01:57:17.266
things from me about how Apple

01:57:17.266 --> 01:57:17.646
works.

01:57:17.646 --> 01:57:19.066
And before I left this morning,

01:57:19.276 --> 01:57:21.106
she gave me an NDA to sign.

01:57:22.146 --> 01:57:24.896
I'm going to use the new

01:57:24.896 --> 01:57:26.616
document scanner notes and my

01:57:26.616 --> 01:57:28.566
pencil to take care of that in a

01:57:28.566 --> 01:57:29.106

We'll just tap the plus button

01:57:31.216 --> 01:57:32.456
here to bring up the document

01:57:32.456 --> 01:57:34.536

01:57:34.536 --> 01:57:36.336
point the camera at the piece of

01:57:36.336 --> 01:57:36.876
paper.

01:57:37.366 --> 01:57:38.576

01:57:40.826 --> 01:57:41.806

01:57:43.186 --> 01:57:44.866

01:57:44.866 --> 01:57:46.096
blanks with my pencil.

01:57:48.436 --> 01:57:50.566
And just like that, I've got a

01:57:50.566 --> 01:57:52.906
signed copy of the NDA saved

01:57:52.906 --> 01:57:54.056
away in my notes.

01:57:54.736 --> 01:57:56.126
Now I see my daughter sent me a

01:57:56.126 --> 01:57:57.376
message and it must be pretty

01:57:57.376 --> 01:57:58.676

01:57:58.676 --> 01:57:59.156

going to tap on that and see

02:01:19.546 --> 02:01:22.686
the new iPad Pro and iOS 11 as

02:01:22.686 --> 02:01:23.346
we are.

02:01:23.936 --> 02:01:29.486
Now, we've got one last thing to

02:01:29.486 --> 02:01:30.356
talk to you about.

02:01:33.036 --> 02:01:35.306
Let's turn our attention to

02:01:35.306 --> 02:01:35.916
music.

02:01:36.486 --> 02:01:38.936
Music has always been a part of

02:01:38.936 --> 02:01:40.176
Apple's DNA.

02:01:40.806 --> 02:01:43.386
We first revolutionized the

02:01:43.386 --> 02:01:45.466
music industry with iTunes.

02:01:46.796 --> 02:01:49.256
Then we forever changed the way

02:01:49.416 --> 02:01:51.116
people listen to music on the go

02:01:51.116 --> 02:01:52.206
with the iPod.

02:01:52.966 --> 02:01:55.396
And today, iPhone has become the

02:01:55.396 --> 02:01:57.956
best portable music player in

02:01:57.956 --> 02:02:00.276
the world and it's even better

02:02:00.746 --> 02:02:01.956
when it's paired with Apple

02:02:01.956 --> 02:02:02.446

02:02:03.366 --> 02:02:07.396
You now have 40 million songs in

02:02:07.396 --> 02:02:08.726
your pocket.

02:02:09.366 --> 02:02:12.976
And when you add AirPods, it

02:02:12.976 --> 02:02:15.166
brings an absolutely magical

02:02:15.166 --> 02:02:17.936
experience to wireless audio.

02:02:19.476 --> 02:02:22.266
Now, so we have such a great

02:02:22.576 --> 02:02:24.046
portable music experience.

02:02:24.956 --> 02:02:26.866
But what about our homes?

02:02:28.406 --> 02:02:32.166
We think we can do a lot to make

02:02:32.166 --> 02:02:35.766
this experience much better.

02:02:35.966 --> 02:02:37.976
Just like we did with portable

02:02:38.206 --> 02:02:41.726

02:02:43.346 --> 02:02:45.736
And I'd like to invite Phil up

02:02:45.736 --> 02:02:46.746

02:03:05.726 --> 02:03:07.486
I can't think of anything that

02:03:07.486 --> 02:03:10.926
matters more to so many of us.

02:03:11.196 --> 02:03:13.016
Why hasn't this happened yet?

02:03:13.456 --> 02:03:14.856
There certainly are a lot of

02:03:14.896 --> 02:03:17.196
companies hard at work making

02:03:17.196 --> 02:03:18.816

02:03:19.756 --> 02:03:20.816
But none of them have quite

02:03:21.046 --> 02:03:21.716
nailed it yet.

02:03:22.406 --> 02:03:24.286
Some have worked hard to make

02:03:24.286 --> 02:03:25.976
wireless music sound good around

02:03:25.976 --> 02:03:27.676
our homes, but these aren't

02:03:27.676 --> 02:03:28.656
smart speakers.

02:03:29.696 --> 02:03:31.886
Others have worked to make smart

02:03:31.886 --> 02:03:33.386
speakers that you can talk to,

02:03:33.456 --> 02:03:34.986
but they don't sound so great

02:03:34.986 --> 02:03:35.996
when you listen to music.

02:03:35.996 --> 02:03:38.626
We want to combine all these in

02:03:38.626 --> 02:03:40.046
a product that can really

02:03:40.046 --> 02:03:42.146
deliver a breakthrough

02:03:42.146 --> 02:03:42.946
experience.

02:03:42.946 --> 02:03:44.076
And our team has been hard at

02:03:44.076 --> 02:03:46.516
work for many years now on a

02:03:46.516 --> 02:03:48.786
breakthrough home speaker.

02:03:50.166 --> 02:03:51.246
And it has to do a few things

02:03:51.246 --> 02:03:52.566
really great if it's going to be

02:03:52.566 --> 02:03:54.216
a great breakthrough speaker.

02:03:55.546 --> 02:03:57.326
First, it needs to rock the

02:03:57.326 --> 02:03:58.646
house, right?

02:03:59.096 --> 02:04:00.746
We need to enjoy our music,

02:04:00.746 --> 02:04:02.706
whatever genre you love, really

02:04:02.706 --> 02:04:05.146
low or really loud, free from

02:04:05.146 --> 02:04:05.806
distortion.

02:04:07.086 --> 02:04:09.916
Second, it needs to be spatially

02:04:09.916 --> 02:04:10.856
aware.

02:04:11.126 --> 02:04:12.186
It's going to fit in different

02:04:12.186 --> 02:04:13.176
rooms in our house and it needs

02:04:13.176 --> 02:04:14.306
to be smart enough to know what

02:04:14.306 --> 02:04:15.756
to do to make the music sound

02:04:15.756 --> 02:04:16.086
great.

02:04:17.656 --> 02:04:19.726
Third, it has to be really fun

02:04:19.726 --> 02:04:20.186
to use.

02:04:20.186 --> 02:04:21.206
It has to have a built-in

02:04:21.206 --> 02:04:23.306

02:05:32.086 --> 02:05:34.736
to reinvent music in our homes.

features.

02:05:37.166 --> 02:05:38.866
First, rock the house.

02:05:39.656 --> 02:05:41.526
The HomePod is just under 7

02:05:41.526 --> 02:05:42.676
inches tall.

02:05:43.396 --> 02:05:45.436
It's covered in a seamless 3D

02:05:45.436 --> 02:05:46.826
mesh fabric that has incredible

02:05:46.826 --> 02:05:48.736
acoustic properties, and it

02:05:48.736 --> 02:05:51.176
hides within it amazing audio

02:05:51.176 --> 02:05:51.926
technology.

02:05:53.026 --> 02:05:56.546
For example, along the bottom is

02:05:56.786 --> 02:06:00.266
a 7 array beam-formed tweeter

02:06:00.266 --> 02:06:01.636
pack that's packed with seven

02:06:01.636 --> 02:06:03.216
tweeters, each with their own

02:06:03.216 --> 02:06:04.386
individual driver.

02:06:04.856 --> 02:06:06.706
They're precision acoustic horns

02:06:07.086 --> 02:06:09.126
that drive the audio from within

02:06:09.126 --> 02:06:10.736
and then out along the bottom

02:06:10.936 --> 02:06:12.306
with tremendous directional

02:06:12.346 --> 02:06:12.946
control.

02:06:12.946 --> 02:06:14.216
And that will become really

02:06:14.216 --> 02:06:15.586
clear in a bit as we talk about

02:06:15.586 --> 02:06:16.016
how it works.

02:06:17.316 --> 02:06:18.936
It has a really big woofer,

02:06:18.936 --> 02:06:20.916
4-inch woofer upward facing with

02:06:20.916 --> 02:06:22.276
a large motor to move a lot of

02:06:22.276 --> 02:06:22.676
air.

02:06:22.676 --> 02:06:23.946
It has automatic bass

02:06:23.946 --> 02:06:25.426
equalization and dynamic

02:06:25.426 --> 02:06:26.756
software modeling so that as we

02:06:26.756 --> 02:06:28.536
turn the volume up, it's free

02:06:28.536 --> 02:06:29.356
from distortion.

02:06:30.466 --> 02:06:32.886
And all of this is controlled by

02:06:32.886 --> 02:06:34.476

02:06:42.596 --> 02:06:44.566

02:06:44.566 --> 02:06:45.626

02:07:12.056 --> 02:07:12.766

02:07:13.246 --> 02:07:14.446
And it's compact enough that you

02:07:14.446 --> 02:07:15.586
can put it mostly anywhere in

02:07:15.586 --> 02:07:16.036
your house.

02:07:16.036 --> 02:07:17.396

02:07:23.906 --> 02:07:24.316
within.

02:07:24.316 --> 02:07:27.476

adjust the audio, to balance it,

02:07:29.286 --> 02:07:30.846

but within it, HomePod detects

02:08:19.636 --> 02:08:21.326
the center vocals and can use

02:08:21.406 --> 02:08:22.606

02:09:44.926 --> 02:09:48.086
Next, a musicologist.

02:09:48.416 --> 02:09:50.396
This intelligent helper to help

02:09:50.396 --> 02:09:52.416
us discover the music we love.

02:09:53.536 --> 02:09:56.956
HomePod has an incredible

02:09:56.956 --> 02:09:58.316
speaker system that works

02:09:58.316 --> 02:10:00.556
together with our Apple Music

02:10:00.556 --> 02:10:01.246
subscription.

02:10:01.246 --> 02:10:02.356
From the beginning, it's

02:10:02.356 --> 02:10:02.976
designed to work with that.

02:10:03.076 --> 02:10:05.646
Now, Apple Music as you know

02:10:05.646 --> 02:10:07.316
provides music in the cloud and

02:10:07.316 --> 02:10:08.176
if the speaker can get it

02:10:08.176 --> 02:10:10.366
directly from the cloud, it can

02:10:10.366 --> 02:10:12.166
get 40 million tracks, two

02:10:12.166 --> 02:10:13.116
million artists, tens of

02:10:13.116 --> 02:10:14.176
thousands of playlists.

02:10:14.176 --> 02:10:15.756
But not just any music library,

02:10:15.756 --> 02:10:17.226
this is your music library.

02:10:17.386 --> 02:10:18.536
It knows the playlists you've

02:10:18.536 --> 02:10:20.006
set up, it knows the artist you

02:10:20.006 --> 02:10:21.846
love and all of them stream

02:10:21.846 --> 02:10:23.986
directly to your HomePod.

02:10:24.846 --> 02:10:27.086
It works with an array of six

02:10:27.086 --> 02:10:28.486
microphones around the middle,

02:10:28.486 --> 02:10:30.536
so as you talk to it and you say

02:10:30.536 --> 02:10:33.056
those magic words, "Hey Siri,"

02:10:33.056 --> 02:10:35.536
you see a waveform light up on

02:10:35.536 --> 02:10:37.406
top and now it can respond to

02:10:37.556 --> 02:10:39.096
your commands and help serve up

02:10:39.096 --> 02:10:40.516
the music you want to hear.

02:10:42.736 --> 02:10:44.326
The Siri team has worked very

02:10:44.326 --> 02:10:46.396
hard to adapt the domain of

02:10:46.396 --> 02:10:48.386
music in Siri to be even greater

02:10:48.386 --> 02:10:50.156
and understand more of the

02:10:50.156 --> 02:10:51.186
questions we're going to ask

02:10:51.306 --> 02:10:51.926
about music.

02:10:52.206 --> 02:10:53.436
Simple things obviously like

02:10:53.596 --> 02:10:54.756
Play Beats 1 Radio.

02:10:55.236 --> 02:10:56.426
We all want to do that.

02:10:56.426 --> 02:10:57.906
Or play "I'm Poppy".

02:10:58.236 --> 02:10:59.216
Check it out if you don't know

02:10:59.216 --> 02:10:59.916
what that's about.

02:11:01.026 --> 02:11:02.326
Play something new.

02:11:02.326 --> 02:11:03.486
Who's singing on this track?

02:11:03.486 --> 02:11:04.576
Something I ask all the time.

02:11:04.576 --> 02:11:05.756
Who's playing drums on this

02:11:05.756 --> 02:11:06.086
track?

02:11:06.416 --> 02:11:07.846
To complex questions like, what

02:11:07.846 --> 02:11:09.736
was the top song on May 5th,

02:11:09.736 --> 02:11:11.216
2016.

02:11:11.436 --> 02:11:13.336
You just play more like that or

02:11:13.336 --> 02:11:14.446
I like that song.

02:11:15.236 --> 02:11:16.276
It's a free form.

02:11:16.406 --> 02:11:17.886
Siri doesn't need a specific

02:11:17.886 --> 02:11:18.526
list of commands.

02:11:18.526 --> 02:11:19.816
It can interpret what you're

02:11:19.816 --> 02:11:21.746
saying and help you discover the

02:11:21.746 --> 02:11:22.526
music you love.

02:11:23.226 --> 02:11:24.586
And even better, you don't have

02:11:24.586 --> 02:11:26.696
to just sit next to the HomePod

02:11:26.696 --> 02:11:27.426
to talk to it.

02:11:27.426 --> 02:11:29.446
It can be across the room and

02:11:29.446 --> 02:11:31.046
speak to the HomePod even while

02:11:31.046 --> 02:11:32.636
loud music is playing and the

02:11:32.636 --> 02:11:33.476
speaker array and the

02:11:33.476 --> 02:11:35.156
microphones can pick it up and

02:11:35.156 --> 02:11:36.036
hear what you're saying.

02:11:37.196 --> 02:11:39.816
So HomePod, it has the power to

02:11:39.816 --> 02:11:42.116
rock the house in a spatial

02:11:42.116 --> 02:11:43.476
awareness so that it understands

02:11:43.476 --> 02:11:45.306
the rooms we place it within.

02:11:45.306 --> 02:11:47.736
And it has the fun interactivity

02:11:47.736 --> 02:11:49.686
of Siri becoming a musicologist

02:11:49.836 --> 02:11:51.176
and helping us to listen to the

02:11:51.176 --> 02:11:51.976
music we love.

02:11:51.976 --> 02:11:53.866
And since Siri is built in there

02:11:53.866 --> 02:11:55.366
and you can speak to it, well,

02:11:55.366 --> 02:11:56.546
the team has also worked hard to

02:11:56.546 --> 02:11:58.476
make it a great and helpful home

02:11:58.476 --> 02:11:59.836
assistant as well.

02:11:59.966 --> 02:12:03.316
We said the domain of music is

02:12:03.316 --> 02:12:04.636
something Siri knows really well

02:12:04.636 --> 02:12:05.226
in HomePod.

02:12:05.296 --> 02:12:07.096
There are other domains as well.

02:12:07.256 --> 02:12:08.176
We've worked hard to pick the

02:12:08.396 --> 02:12:09.706
first ones that we think matter

02:12:09.706 --> 02:12:11.346
most in a product like HomePod,

02:12:11.346 --> 02:12:12.636
so of course, it can play your

02:12:12.636 --> 02:12:13.266
podcasts.

02:12:13.266 --> 02:12:15.386
But it can also do things like

02:12:15.736 --> 02:12:17.626
give you news, give you weather,

02:12:17.626 --> 02:12:18.896
traffic, sports.

02:12:18.896 --> 02:12:20.206
You can ask it to set a

02:12:20.206 --> 02:12:23.286
reminder, set a timer, text

02:12:23.286 --> 02:12:24.486
someone with messages.

02:12:24.876 --> 02:12:26.436
And if you have HomeKit devices

02:12:26.436 --> 02:12:27.446
set up in your home, you can

02:12:27.446 --> 02:12:28.776
speak to your HomePod and

02:12:28.776 --> 02:12:30.506
control your HomeKit devices.

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:34.716
So for example, for the HomePod

02:12:34.716 --> 02:12:36.636
set up, you can say, "When do

02:12:36.636 --> 02:12:37.956
the Red Sox play next?"

02:12:38.046 --> 02:12:39.096
They're going to beat the

02:12:39.096 --> 02:12:39.966
Yankees, trust me.

02:12:40.696 --> 02:12:43.836
Tune to NPR instead, flip a

02:12:43.836 --> 02:12:45.596
coin, remind me to bring snacks

02:12:45.596 --> 02:12:46.226
to a party.

02:12:46.806 --> 02:12:49.106
You can set up reminders, check

02:12:49.106 --> 02:12:50.646
all the sports news and weather,

02:12:51.006 --> 02:12:52.416
all directly with your voice,

02:12:52.656 --> 02:12:53.846
talk to a HomePod that gets the

02:12:53.846 --> 02:12:55.496
information directly from the

02:12:55.496 --> 02:12:55.926
cloud.

02:12:55.996 --> 02:12:58.196
And if you have HomeKit devices

02:12:58.196 --> 02:12:59.826
set up, you can say simple

02:12:59.826 --> 02:13:01.556
things like, are the lights on,

02:13:01.896 --> 02:13:03.776
turn the heat up, turn on the

02:13:03.776 --> 02:13:05.396
air conditioning, bring the

02:13:05.396 --> 02:13:08.026
shades down halfway, turn off

02:13:08.026 --> 02:13:09.456
the lights in the bedroom.

02:13:10.076 --> 02:13:11.466
And if you've set up scenes in

02:13:11.466 --> 02:13:12.736
HomeKit you can control those as

02:13:12.736 --> 02:13:13.146
well.

02:13:13.356 --> 02:13:14.696
You can say, "I'm home.

02:13:15.146 --> 02:13:16.036
It's movie time.

02:13:16.036 --> 02:13:17.466
I'm leaving now."

02:13:17.466 --> 02:13:18.696
And the whole scene can

02:13:18.696 --> 02:13:20.996
automatically happen just by

02:13:20.996 --> 02:13:22.316
talking to your HomePod.

02:13:23.126 --> 02:13:26.366
And because there is a HomePod

02:13:26.366 --> 02:13:27.756
base-- the HomeKit base built

02:13:27.756 --> 02:13:29.446
into HomePod, that means

02:13:29.446 --> 02:13:30.896
anywhere in the world, once you

02:13:30.896 --> 02:13:32.286
set up your first HomePod, you

02:13:32.286 --> 02:13:34.116
control your HomeKit devices

02:13:34.116 --> 02:13:35.906
remotely using the built-in Home

02:13:35.906 --> 02:13:38.066
app on your iPhone or iPad.

02:13:38.066 --> 02:13:41.266
Now, setting up a HomePod and

02:13:41.266 --> 02:13:42.886
its microphone array in your

02:13:42.886 --> 02:13:44.016
home, you probably have a

02:13:44.016 --> 02:13:44.926
question that we've worked

02:13:45.306 --> 02:13:46.736
really hard to deal with, which

02:13:46.736 --> 02:13:47.706
is privacy.

02:13:48.046 --> 02:13:49.916
Our team cares deeply about your

02:13:49.916 --> 02:13:50.686
privacy.

02:13:51.106 --> 02:13:52.996
So for example, it has that

02:13:52.996 --> 02:13:54.456
magic phrase, hey Siri.

02:13:54.656 --> 02:13:56.776
Until you say it, nothing is

02:13:56.776 --> 02:13:57.626
being sent to Apple.

02:13:58.866 --> 02:14:00.756
It recognizes when you do say it

02:14:00.756 --> 02:14:02.056
and from that point it sends an

02:14:02.086 --> 02:14:04.366
anonymous Siri ID in order to

02:14:04.366 --> 02:14:05.496
help you with the command you're

02:14:05.496 --> 02:14:06.116
looking for.

02:14:06.116 --> 02:14:07.936
And of course that communication

02:14:08.246 --> 02:14:09.436
is all encrypted.

02:14:09.906 --> 02:14:12.406
So this is the HomePod.

02:14:12.846 --> 02:14:14.106
It's a breakthrough home

02:14:14.106 --> 02:14:14.926
speaker.

02:14:16.256 --> 02:14:18.176
Typically Wi-Fi speakers, if

02:14:18.176 --> 02:14:20.756
they're a good quality, of $300

02:14:20.756 --> 02:14:22.936
to $500.

02:14:22.936 --> 02:14:24.306
And a smart speaker might cost

02:14:24.306 --> 02:14:26.306
you $100 to $200.

02:14:27.126 --> 02:14:28.256
So it's not unreasonable for a

02:14:28.256 --> 02:14:29.396
HomePod to be priced in the

02:14:29.396 --> 02:14:32.266
range of $400 to $700.

02:14:33.086 --> 02:14:34.666
So we're really excited to tell

02:14:34.666 --> 02:14:36.546
you that HomePod is going to be

02:14:36.546 --> 02:14:38.976
priced for $349.

bringing it around the world.

02:14:57.906 --> 02:14:59.166

02:15:48.156 --> 02:15:51.216
will push the macOS experience

02:15:51.216 --> 02:15:51.716
forward.

02:16:35.575 --> 02:16:37.876
It's the biggest release for

02:16:37.876 --> 02:16:38.835
iPad ever.

02:16:40.146 --> 02:16:41.726
And of course a new line up of

02:16:41.766 --> 02:16:45.126
iPad Pro with an all new perfect

10.5-inch size with advanced

02:16:49.036 --> 02:16:52.236
displays, powerful new features

02:16:52.585 --> 02:16:54.255
that enable people to do more

02:16:54.255 --> 02:16:55.495
with their iPads than ever

02:16:55.495 --> 02:16:56.116
before.

02:16:56.776 --> 02:17:00.016

02:17:00.016 --> 02:17:02.156
iMac Pro, an entirely new

02:17:02.206 --> 02:17:03.816
workstation class of products

02:17:04.126 --> 02:17:06.386
that we design specifically for

02:17:06.386 --> 02:17:07.335
our Pro users.

02:17:08.456 --> 02:17:11.366

02:17:11.366 --> 02:17:14.005
home speaker with amazing sound

02:17:14.486 --> 02:17:16.376
and incredible intelligence.

02:17:17.296 --> 02:17:19.366
It will reinvent home audio.

02:17:19.366 --> 02:17:24.466

02:17:24.466 --> 02:17:27.005

02:17:30.165 --> 02:17:31.866
And for all developers, we

02:17:31.866 --> 02:17:34.206

02:18:00.175 --> 02:18:02.585
to highlighting and encouraging

02:18:02.585 --> 02:18:05.446
young people, women and doers.

02:18:27.186 --> 02:18:29.486
