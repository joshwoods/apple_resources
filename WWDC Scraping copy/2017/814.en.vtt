00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:16.500
[ Applause and cheers ]

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:21.676
>> In this session we're going

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:23.756
to discuss the best practices of

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:24.756
subscriptions.

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:26.776
We'll focus on effectively

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.116
communicating the value of your

00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:30.866
subscriptions, streamlining the

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.046
signup flow, and providing

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:34.856
positive and effortless

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.756
subscription experiences.

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:38.986
Lauren, back to you.

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:39.996
>> All right.

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:41.276
Thanks, Doug.

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:42.976
We're going to try this again.

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.331
[ Laugh ]

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.296
Subscriptions are the fastest

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:48.476
growing business model in the

00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:49.026
App Store.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:50.966
Why is it almost every time

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.446
you're ready to sign up for an

00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:55.326
awesome new service or to

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.036
subscribe to some amazing new

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.526
content, this is the feeling

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.086
that you get?

00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:02.336
That's because it's all too

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:04.396
common for subscriptions to feel

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:07.756
complicated, confusing, or just

00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:09.986
take too long to sign up.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.026
So, for a great user experience,

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:13.466
make your subscription

00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:16.046
effortless, transparent, and

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:16.606
engaging.

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:18.526
Let's focus on each of these

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:19.996
principles to improve the user

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.476
experience and design for

00:01:21.476 --> 00:01:22.426
subscription success.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:26.416
The first step we'll talk about,

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:27.916
being effortless.

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:29.846
So what does it mean for your

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:31.156
subscription to be effortless?

00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:33.146
It means that people should know

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:34.556
that you have a subscription.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:36.936
That way they shouldn't have to

00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:39.606
look for how to sign up.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.766
So it's important to be visible.

00:01:42.186 --> 00:01:43.956
Get out there and don't be shy.

00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:45.806
Let people know that you have a

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.626
subscription offer, and ask them

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:48.916
to sign up.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:50.896
One approach would be to persist

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:52.516
a Subscribe button in your app's

00:01:52.516 --> 00:01:53.086
interface.

00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:55.476
Here in "The New York Times"

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.566
they do a great job persisting a

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:58.476
Subscribe button.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.446
And they do this tastefully

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:01.476
throughout the entire UI.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.456
It's very visible.

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:05.216
And it's across each article.

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:07.576
This is done really well.

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:10.106
And it's not annoying or pushy,

00:02:10.506 --> 00:02:12.016
because it families together

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:12.926
with their interface.

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:16.016
Don't present your subscription

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:17.446
like a popup add or a

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:18.306
notification.

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.976
Because popups and notifications

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:22.626
are intended to be dismissed.

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:24.216
And you don't want people to

00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:25.716
dismiss your subscription offer.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:27.986
Another way to present your

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:29.686
subscription would be to be

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:31.336
visible and present it when

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:32.996
someone has expressed interest

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:35.206
in a piece of content or in a

00:02:35.206 --> 00:02:36.616
feature that you offer through a

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:37.746
subscription.

00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:40.846
This is the dating app Her.

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:43.006
So let's just say you're swiping

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:45.226
through a few profiles and you

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:46.496
accidentally pass on somebody

00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:46.986
who's cute.

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:48.876
So you attempt to rewind that

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:51.056
profile, and in that moment, the

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.226
app Her tastefully presents an

00:02:53.226 --> 00:02:54.536
option for you to subscribe.

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:56.686
Because the rewind feature is

00:02:56.686 --> 00:02:57.616
what they offer as a

00:02:57.616 --> 00:02:58.356
subscription.

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:00.406
And this is great.

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:01.806
It's an appropriate time for Her

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.126
to present you with this offer

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:04.526
because you've shown interest.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:06.796
Her does a wonderful job

00:03:06.796 --> 00:03:07.976
presenting the values of your

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:09.876
subscription right here as well

00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:11.806
with this beautiful, light

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:12.436
animation.

00:03:13.856 --> 00:03:16.476
So whether you choose to make it

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:17.696
persistent in your user

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.866
interface, or present the option

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.666
to subscribe when someone has

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:25.186
expressed interest, make sure

00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:26.876
that it is visible to people so

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:27.636
they know you have a

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:28.716
subscription.

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:31.236
And no matter what you choose,

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:33.286
all subscription apps should

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:35.136
include a place to sign up in

00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:37.226
Settings or Accounts, because

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:39.046
it's a very intuitive place for

00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:40.246
place for people to look to sign

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:40.483
up.

00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:42.976
All right.

00:03:43.596 --> 00:03:45.166
Also, to make your subscription

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:47.136
effortless, you need to remove

00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:47.886
friction.

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:50.686
Friction is asking for too much

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:52.916
information, having too many

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:55.116
steps, and taking too much time

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:56.096
for somebody to sign up.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.096
But how do you know when you've

00:03:58.096 --> 00:03:59.176
asked for too much?

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:01.316
This data should help.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:03.986
This graph represents a snapshot

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:05.796
of one month of data from the

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:08.006
three top video streaming apps

00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:09.266
in the US.

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:10.896
Now, while their names have been

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:13.086
removed, all the important data

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.446
here is the clicks to conversion

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:15.046
ratio.

00:04:15.796 --> 00:04:18.755
A subscription flow that has

00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:21.456
three clicks led to a 61%

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:22.216
conversion rate.

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.056
And a subscription flow with

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:26.576
four clicks led to a 48%

00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:27.276
conversion rate.

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:29.436
However, as soon as there was

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.706
nine clicks, it dropped

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:32.846
significantly down to 7%.

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:34.696
Now, while this is just a

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.576
sample, it's clear that you

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:37.916
should only ask for what is

00:04:38.096 --> 00:04:39.766
absolutely necessary for someone

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:40.386
to sign up.

00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:43.596
Because quite literally, less is

00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:43.986
more.

00:04:44.626 --> 00:04:47.356
Less clicks, less friction, will

00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:49.336
lead to more conversion and more

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.066
subscribers.

00:04:51.016 --> 00:04:52.736
So focus on people on just

00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:53.786
signing up first.

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:55.846
Things like favoriting,

00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:57.876
personalization, and asking for

00:04:57.876 --> 00:04:59.256
additional personal details can

00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:01.076
all wait until after someone has

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:02.166
signed up.

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:04.756
So, by being visible, and

00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:06.986
removing friction, your app

00:05:06.986 --> 00:05:08.356
subscription will be effortless

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:09.726
and easier for people to

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:10.246
subscribe.

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:14.146
Next, let's talk about being

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:15.136
transparent with your

00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:16.006
subscription.

00:05:16.676 --> 00:05:18.576
Because transparency is the best

00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:19.146
policy.

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:21.356
And you need to provide clear

00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:23.856
terms so people understand what

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:24.906
they're signing up for.

00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:27.696
Strive to be glance-able.

00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:30.086
All in one view and in just a

00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:31.756
few seconds, people should be

00:05:31.756 --> 00:05:33.566
able to clearly understand what

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.316
your subscription offer is and

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:37.106
how to sign up.

00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:37.966
So when you're making your

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:40.876
subscription, always include: a

00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:43.566
concise value proposition, a

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:46.696
strong call to action, a place

00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:48.426
for people to log in if they are

00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:49.636
existing subscribers.

00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:52.636
Also the ability to restore if

00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:53.676
someone has a new device.

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.666
And a place to sign up that

00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:58.716
includes clear pricing and

00:05:58.716 --> 00:05:59.216
terms.

00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:01.906
And always offer multiple tiers.

00:06:02.276 --> 00:06:03.456
Because you don't know if

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:04.886
somebody wants to sign up for a

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.626
day, a week, a month, or two

00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:08.076
years.

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:10.596
So try offering three or four

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:12.656
different tiers to find out what

00:06:12.656 --> 00:06:14.356
works best for your audience.

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.986
The MLB At Bat app does a great

00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:20.006
job and offers all of this in

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:21.686
one easy-to-understand

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:22.886
glance-able view.

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:25.466
And this is important because

00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:27.216
most of us are signing up on our

00:06:27.216 --> 00:06:27.666
phones.

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:29.526
So please, keep it simple.

00:06:31.176 --> 00:06:33.326
By providing clear terms, people

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:34.686
will be able to make an informed

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:36.446
decision on how to subscribe.

00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:37.926
All right.

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:40.046
I saved the best for last.

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:43.316
Your app needs to be engaging

00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:45.786
from the start, before people

00:06:45.786 --> 00:06:46.396
subscribe.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.446
And the best way to engage them

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:49.886
is through experience.

00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:52.776
Let them experience your app and

00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:54.616
your app's content before having

00:06:54.616 --> 00:06:55.456
them subscribe.

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:57.786
Because being able to experience

00:06:57.786 --> 00:06:59.656
and try before you buy is a part

00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:00.686
of how we make purchase

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:01.346
decisions today.

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:04.896
From trying on clothes to

00:07:04.896 --> 00:07:07.696
attending an open house, or even

00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:09.046
test driving a car before you

00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:10.156
buy or lease it.

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:13.026
All of these are experiences

00:07:13.026 --> 00:07:14.456
that you can do that help you

00:07:14.456 --> 00:07:15.716
make a decision before you

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:16.086
purchase.

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:18.936
And the same applies for your

00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:19.046
app.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:21.756
There are three ways to engage

00:07:21.756 --> 00:07:22.886
people through experience.

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:24.506
And it'll make it much easier

00:07:24.506 --> 00:07:25.536
for them to subscribe.

00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:28.516
First, you can offer a free

00:07:28.516 --> 00:07:29.026
trial.

00:07:29.536 --> 00:07:31.016
That way, people can try out the

00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:32.996
entire app for free for a

00:07:32.996 --> 00:07:33.756
limited time.

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:37.006
This works well for established

00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:38.386
brands and when people have an

00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:40.156
idea of what's included with the

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:40.896
subscription.

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:43.276
So, if you have an established

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:45.206
brand, a free trial is a great

00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:46.766
way to let people engage with

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.186
your app and its contents before

00:07:49.186 --> 00:07:49.856
they subscribe.

00:07:50.496 --> 00:07:53.106
You can also make the majority

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:54.886
of your app available for free

00:07:54.936 --> 00:07:57.026
and offer a premium feature as a

00:07:57.026 --> 00:07:57.766
subscription.

00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:00.056
For example, in the app Sleep

00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:02.096
Cycle, you can use the entire

00:08:02.096 --> 00:08:04.436
app for free, except the trends

00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:07.026
feature shown here is what is

00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:09.016
available to people who have

00:08:09.016 --> 00:08:09.606
subscribed.

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:12.416
And Sleep Cycle makes it really

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:13.856
easy for people to sign up right

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:14.316
from here.

00:08:14.896 --> 00:08:16.546
It's a great technique to offer

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:18.296
a peek of content behind this

00:08:18.366 --> 00:08:18.766
blur.

00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:21.466
That way potential subscribers

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:23.086
can see what kind of content

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.806
they would have access to if

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:25.916
they did subscribe.

00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:29.726
And finally, you can allow

00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:31.086
people to sample content.

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:32.936
It's a great way to engage

00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:33.746
through experience.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:35.076
And it works great for the

00:08:35.076 --> 00:08:36.226
majority of apps.

00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:39.135
This is "The New York Times."

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:40.486
And you're able to read ten

00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:42.736
articles for free per month.

00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:44.856
And this is a wonderful sampling

00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:46.716
experience because "The New York

00:08:46.716 --> 00:08:48.776
Times" lets people have control

00:08:48.776 --> 00:08:50.386
over what content they're able

00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:51.026
to sample.

00:08:51.816 --> 00:08:53.306
That allows people to find the

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:54.476
content that they're interested

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:55.976
in and helps them better

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:57.466
understand the value of the

00:08:57.466 --> 00:08:58.196
subscription.

00:08:59.496 --> 00:09:01.276
The objective is to let people

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:03.186
experience and become familiar

00:09:03.186 --> 00:09:04.836
with your app and its content.

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:06.806
And that will make it easier for

00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:07.626
them to subscribe.

00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:10.216
And no matter which option you

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.236
choose, make sure that it works

00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:13.476
for your audience.

00:09:13.976 --> 00:09:15.316
And you know them best.

00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:17.166
Think about their current user

00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:19.156
experience, the type of content

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:20.566
they have currently available in

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:22.366
your app, and how adding

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.716
subscriptions could impact that

00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:24.366
experience.

00:09:25.936 --> 00:09:27.326
So design your subscription to

00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:29.306
be effortless by being visible

00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:30.826
and reducing friction.

00:09:31.376 --> 00:09:32.876
By being transparent with your

00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:35.206
terms and pricing, and engaging

00:09:35.206 --> 00:09:37.186
people through experiencing your

00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:38.926
app and its rich contents.

00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:41.746
That way it'll be really easy

00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:43.526
for people to sign up.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:43.956
Thank you.
