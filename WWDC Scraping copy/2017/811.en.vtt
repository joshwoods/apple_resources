00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:23.126
>> From first launch to your

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:24.486
tutorial through your user

00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:26.356
interface, there's a lot that

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:28.056
people experience in addition to

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:29.216
your game's gameplay.

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:31.076
So, in the next few minutes, I'm

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:33.206
going to cover 10 design tips to

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:36.156
create great experiences as soon

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:37.826
as someone taps your app icon.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:40.246
And many of these tips can be

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:41.826
applied to apps that are looking

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.096
to be just as immersive,

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.756
engaging, and fun.

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:46.166
So, let's start.

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:48.676
First up is first Launch.

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:51.066
This is the first experience

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:53.046
people have with your game and

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:54.486
your first impression matters.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.086
So, no matter what you need to

00:00:56.086 --> 00:00:57.716
say first, whether it is Accept

00:00:57.816 --> 00:01:00.196
Terms, or Headsets Recommended,

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:02.276
design the first screen to fit

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:03.796
within the style of your game.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.786
That way, they're immersed

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:06.596
immediately.

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:08.666
This edge to edge illustration

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.426
from Pokemon Go does a great

00:01:10.426 --> 00:01:12.526
job, and it communicates just as

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:14.156
much as the text on screen.

00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:17.266
So, take the time to design what

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.746
people see first as soon as they

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:19.556
launch your game.

00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:21.636
When this is done well, it'll

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:23.026
make a lasting impression and

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:24.256
set the tone for the rest of

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:24.766
your game.

00:01:26.036 --> 00:01:28.086
Next, is Loading because

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:29.526
sometimes it takes just a few

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:30.946
seconds to pull data through

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:31.546
space.

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:33.706
So, why not take advantage of

00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:35.056
what we all know to be true,

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:37.526
time flies when you're having

00:01:37.526 --> 00:01:37.936
fun.

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.766
So, during Loading, make it fun

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.706
by educating or entertaining;

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:44.616
then, Loading won't see to take

00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:45.216
as long.

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:48.286
This is Don't Starve Pocket

00:01:48.286 --> 00:01:50.156
Edition, and in this game

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:51.766
Loading is masked by this

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:53.466
beautifully creepy animation,

00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:55.476
players are entertained, and

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:56.986
time seems to fly by.

00:01:58.396 --> 00:02:00.546
Loading is also a great time to

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:01.006
educate.

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.326
In Clash Royale, as you prepare

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:05.466
for battle, a gameplay tip is

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.486
shown on screen.

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:08.455
Now, if you choose to do this,

00:02:08.846 --> 00:02:10.036
make sure that players have

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:12.366
enough time to read the tip and

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:13.926
also be intelligent about what

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:14.676
you show people.

00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:16.396
If someone's already seen a tip,

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:17.846
don't repeat it in the same

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:18.396
session.

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:20.686
And finally, to show Loading

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.826
progress, always favor progress

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:24.656
bars over activity indicators

00:02:24.996 --> 00:02:26.126
because they do a much better

00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:27.336
job communicating what's

00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:28.946
happening and how long it will

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:29.276
take.

00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.156
So, no matter when your game

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:33.476
needs to load, entertain,

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.946
educate, and show progress.

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:39.636
All right, next is Quick Start.

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:41.896
Being able to start quickly and

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:43.846
jump into your game is key to a

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:45.286
great game experience.

00:02:46.096 --> 00:02:47.976
This is INKS, and it's an Apple

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:49.516
Design Award winner from last

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:49.776
year.

00:02:50.356 --> 00:02:51.716
It's really fun that you're able

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:53.146
to get a feeling for the game

00:02:53.146 --> 00:02:55.106
right from launch, but also they

00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:56.876
do a great job making it obvious

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.216
on how to start the game with

00:02:58.216 --> 00:02:59.566
this large turquoise Play

00:02:59.566 --> 00:02:59.936
button.

00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:02.306
And as soon as you tap it, there

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:03.926
are only two screens before

00:03:03.926 --> 00:03:05.456
you're in and playing the game,

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:06.766
which is awesome.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:08.696
So, let people get into your

00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:10.686
game easily and quickly.

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:13.016
Don't ask players to make too

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:14.146
many choices before they

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:15.706
understand what it means in your

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:16.116
game.

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:18.846
And for more complex games, I

00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:19.956
know there are important things

00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:20.756
that you want to show your

00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:21.196
players.

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:23.756
And game Main Menus have become

00:03:23.756 --> 00:03:25.656
increasingly busy with news,

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.226
tournaments, stores, and more.

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:29.896
And these can all be on your

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.906
interface, but make sure that

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:34.396
the main call to action to play,

00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:37.386
start, battle, or begin a new

00:03:37.386 --> 00:03:39.496
game is the most dominant in

00:03:39.496 --> 00:03:40.426
your Main Menu UI.

00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:44.716
All right, tip 4 is all about

00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:46.236
our game's interface, and before

00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:47.876
we jump into this tip, you

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:49.456
should know something about me,

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.336
and that's, I have a soft spot

00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:53.636
for classic arcade games.

00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:56.756
So, this fake alien monster game

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:58.166
is going to help us with a few

00:03:58.166 --> 00:03:59.946
user interface best practices,

00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:02.486
starting with consistency.

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:06.536
Consistency improves usability

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:08.536
because it helps people mentally

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:09.486
map your interface.

00:04:09.986 --> 00:04:12.056
It's much easier to play and

00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:13.406
navigate when controls are in

00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:14.536
predictable locations.

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:16.766
So, be consistent in the layout

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:17.856
of your game's menu.

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:19.726
That way, people can spend their

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.625
energy playing your game versus

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:23.516
trying to recall where was that

00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:24.246
Settings button.

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:26.246
So, let's look at this exact

00:04:26.346 --> 00:04:28.256
same flow with an inconsistent

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:28.436
UI.

00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:31.796
The Back button is all over the

00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:34.136
place, and Settings disappears

00:04:34.136 --> 00:04:35.686
on the Choose Character screen.

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:38.936
This inconsistency disrupts a

00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:41.156
player's experience because it

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.686
takes more effort to mentally

00:04:42.686 --> 00:04:43.526
map the interface.

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:45.636
So, when you're designing, to

00:04:45.636 --> 00:04:47.356
accommodate for consistency, lay

00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:49.116
out all of your screens and

00:04:49.116 --> 00:04:49.716
check them.

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:51.426
That way, you'll be able to tell

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:52.696
whether the controls are in the

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:53.256
same place.

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:57.106
Okay. The next UI best practice

00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.426
is all about clarity.

00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:00.736
It needs to be clear to players

00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:02.056
what's interactive and what's

00:05:02.096 --> 00:05:02.456
not.

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.206
If people have to think too much

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:05.936
about what to tap, they're going

00:05:05.936 --> 00:05:06.996
to be taken out of your game's

00:05:06.996 --> 00:05:07.686
experience.

00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:10.596
So, items that are tappable need

00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:11.536
to look different from items

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:12.466
that are not tappable.

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:14.556
So, in the top center of this

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:17.016
screen, my Lives is actually

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.796
just status, but with this

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:20.096
visual appearance, it could be

00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:21.466
confused for something that's

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:22.096
interactive.

00:05:22.726 --> 00:05:23.896
This is common in a lot of

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:25.456
games, and there is an easy fix.

00:05:26.296 --> 00:05:27.776
Make non-interactive elements

00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:29.336
look different by using color

00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:32.026
and shape, like this or this.

00:05:32.676 --> 00:05:34.836
Or you can remove and put status

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.506
items away from interactive

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:37.056
elements.

00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:39.836
In your interface, for clarity,

00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:41.726
it's important always to include

00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:43.776
three visual states for buttons

00:05:43.826 --> 00:05:46.186
and controls because a lack of

00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:47.506
visual feedback can confuse

00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:48.016
players.

00:05:48.966 --> 00:05:50.746
Be sure to use a Normal state to

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:51.736
show people that something's

00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:52.276
tappable.

00:05:52.966 --> 00:05:54.986
Use a Press state when something

00:05:54.986 --> 00:05:56.486
has been tapped.

00:05:56.486 --> 00:05:58.066
And finally, use a Disabled

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.416
state for control that's not

00:05:59.416 --> 00:06:01.156
currently active or enabled.

00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:04.246
Many developers struggle if they

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:06.246
should remove or hide a control

00:06:06.246 --> 00:06:08.506
if it cannot be activated, but

00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:10.546
if you do that, when it does pop

00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:11.706
back it could be really

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:13.976
confusing to players, especially

00:06:13.976 --> 00:06:15.366
if this happens during gameplay.

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:17.916
So, for a much better user

00:06:17.916 --> 00:06:19.536
experience, use a Disabled

00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:19.916
state.

00:06:20.586 --> 00:06:21.586
This lets people know the

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:23.706
control's location and action

00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:25.146
that will be possible soon when

00:06:25.146 --> 00:06:26.356
that control is enabled.

00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:28.826
And finally, make sure that

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:30.346
everything that's interactive on

00:06:30.346 --> 00:06:31.726
your game's interface meets the

00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:34.216
minimum tap targets on iOS which

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:35.986
is 44 by 44 points.

00:06:37.186 --> 00:06:39.056
Your interface is a tool to make

00:06:39.056 --> 00:06:41.236
sense of your game's world, so

00:06:41.236 --> 00:06:42.946
make it consistent and clear.

00:06:43.386 --> 00:06:44.776
That way, people will be able to

00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:46.396
stay engaged in your game.

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:48.816
All right, I hope you all enjoy

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:50.196
that fake alien monster game.

00:06:50.196 --> 00:06:51.656
It'll come back in a bit to help

00:06:51.656 --> 00:06:54.696
us with a few other design tips.

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:56.646
We're already halfway through at

00:06:56.646 --> 00:06:57.406
number 5.

00:06:58.066 --> 00:06:59.576
This tip and the next few are

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:00.946
about game tutorials.

00:07:01.716 --> 00:07:03.276
Successful tutorials teach

00:07:03.276 --> 00:07:04.996
gradually and in context through

00:07:04.996 --> 00:07:06.066
progressive disclosure.

00:07:07.056 --> 00:07:08.366
Your tutorial should be made up

00:07:08.366 --> 00:07:10.446
of three basic parts that align

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:12.096
to the core loop of your game.

00:07:12.716 --> 00:07:14.846
For example, it might be that

00:07:14.846 --> 00:07:16.786
you have to fight monsters to

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:18.706
get some gold, and then buy some

00:07:18.706 --> 00:07:20.786
stuff to fight more challenging

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:21.316
monsters.

00:07:22.136 --> 00:07:24.686
But be sure, in your tutorial,

00:07:24.686 --> 00:07:26.526
it stays to those three basic

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:27.046
parts.

00:07:27.806 --> 00:07:29.576
If you have to keep, if you have

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:31.286
to teach about economy in your

00:07:31.286 --> 00:07:34.016
game, keep it simple because

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.326
remember you're teaching

00:07:35.326 --> 00:07:36.856
somebody something brand new.

00:07:37.496 --> 00:07:39.956
So, avoid overwhelming people

00:07:39.956 --> 00:07:41.266
and including information in

00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:42.596
your tutorial that is not

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:43.706
essential to gameplay.

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:47.066
All of this, such as upgrades,

00:07:47.206 --> 00:07:48.826
tournaments, messages, and your

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:51.056
store can all be discovered

00:07:51.276 --> 00:07:52.176
after your tutorial.

00:07:53.366 --> 00:07:55.006
And also, in your tutorial it's

00:07:55.006 --> 00:07:56.446
really important to provide

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.666
clear direction.

00:07:58.256 --> 00:07:59.926
If you have characters in your

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.856
game, it's pretty common to have

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.346
a character walk you through the

00:08:03.346 --> 00:08:03.966
tutorial.

00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:06.216
So, let's say we have this

00:08:06.216 --> 00:08:09.256
adorable alien monster, keep

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:11.406
directions short and simple to

00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:12.086
be effective.

00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:14.166
So, whether you teach with a

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.676
character or through in-game

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:18.636
instructional text, a single

00:08:18.636 --> 00:08:19.816
clear direction is going to be

00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:20.776
the most effective.

00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:23.406
And please, don't repeat

00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:24.096
directions.

00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:26.776
Respect your players and treat,

00:08:26.776 --> 00:08:27.906
and don't treat them like

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:28.456
children.

00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:30.566
Even if your players are

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:31.876
children, kids are smart.

00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:34.096
So, repeating directions

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:35.916
unnecessarily lengthens your

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:38.025
tutorial, and that makes it less

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:39.466
effective and less fun.

00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:42.076
And learning is really fun,

00:08:42.116 --> 00:08:43.416
especially when the teacher is

00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:45.956
engaging, creative, and

00:08:45.956 --> 00:08:46.596
inventive.

00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:48.726
So, be the cool teacher.

00:08:49.106 --> 00:08:50.566
Don't just do what you've seen

00:08:50.566 --> 00:08:51.216
others do.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.226
If your game is unique, your

00:08:53.226 --> 00:08:54.406
tutorial should be too.

00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:57.166
For example, think about how you

00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:58.736
can teach before your game

00:08:58.736 --> 00:08:59.266
begins.

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:02.506
This is Splitter Critters, and

00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:04.556
in this game you split the world

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:06.166
with a swipe of your finger and

00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:07.326
then rearrange it to guide

00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:08.216
critters back to their

00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:08.786
spaceship.

00:09:09.326 --> 00:09:10.656
And from the Start screen,

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:12.216
you're taught this key game

00:09:12.216 --> 00:09:12.776
mechanic.

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.436
And one of the least effective

00:09:15.436 --> 00:09:17.296
ways to teach is with a bouncing

00:09:17.296 --> 00:09:17.706
arrow.

00:09:18.406 --> 00:09:21.256
It's not effective because

00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:22.616
people just end up playing tap

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:24.286
the pointing arrow game and not

00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:24.756
learning.

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:26.946
And the same goes for the

00:09:26.946 --> 00:09:27.666
floating hand.

00:09:28.476 --> 00:09:30.166
Not only do you not learn, but

00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:31.226
this method is really

00:09:31.226 --> 00:09:32.846
problematic because it hides you

00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:33.866
from the interface that you're

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:35.366
trying to be learning about.

00:09:36.196 --> 00:09:37.706
So, there are much better

00:09:37.706 --> 00:09:39.136
attention-getting devices that

00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:40.456
are way more natural and

00:09:40.456 --> 00:09:42.716
immersive, such as animation.

00:09:44.076 --> 00:09:46.676
This is Reigns, and I was really

00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:47.736
excited to hear that the

00:09:47.736 --> 00:09:49.496
developer is soon updating to

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:50.746
remove the floating hand.

00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:53.496
On the right, is the new

00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:55.296
experience and, as you can see,

00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:57.216
it's much more immersive; it's

00:09:57.216 --> 00:09:59.086
just as effective, and it does a

00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:00.816
great job getting you right into

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:01.886
the world of Reigns.

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:04.306
And being in the world of your

00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:05.756
game is the best.

00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:08.456
So, if you can let people jump

00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:10.786
right in and learn through play,

00:10:10.846 --> 00:10:12.466
that is going to be the most

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:14.306
effective way to teach them your

00:10:14.306 --> 00:10:14.716
game.

00:10:15.306 --> 00:10:18.336
So, this is Mars: Mars on Apple

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:18.736
TV.

00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:20.966
And it is really fun to be able

00:10:20.966 --> 00:10:22.266
to jump right into the game.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.866
So right now, I'm on Mars, and

00:10:24.866 --> 00:10:26.066
the controls are intuitive, so

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:26.886
I'm going to start clicking

00:10:26.886 --> 00:10:27.366
around.

00:10:27.936 --> 00:10:31.496
And after one hilarious death, I

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:32.656
quickly realize that the

00:10:32.656 --> 00:10:34.896
objective is to land safely on

00:10:34.896 --> 00:10:35.616
the stations.

00:10:36.586 --> 00:10:38.066
So, for the best experience,

00:10:38.536 --> 00:10:40.986
teach people through play.

00:10:41.676 --> 00:10:44.896
All right, we're already at

00:10:44.896 --> 00:10:47.326
number 9, which is all about

00:10:47.326 --> 00:10:48.916
letting people skip and get

00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:50.096
right into your game.

00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:52.866
Give the player control, and

00:10:52.866 --> 00:10:54.886
that way Skip can create a much

00:10:54.916 --> 00:10:56.346
better user experience.

00:10:57.976 --> 00:10:59.316
Now, I love this opening

00:10:59.316 --> 00:11:00.956
sequence from Icycle: On Thin

00:11:01.006 --> 00:11:01.486
Ice.

00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:03.666
It's clever, has a striking

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:05.076
style, and it provides you with

00:11:05.076 --> 00:11:06.296
the motivation of the main

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:07.666
character, Dennis.

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:09.906
But when you tap on the screen,

00:11:09.976 --> 00:11:11.516
a very subtle Skip button

00:11:11.516 --> 00:11:11.986
appears.

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:14.846
And that is great because

00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:16.906
revealing Skip on tap is a

00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:17.856
wonderful technique.

00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:20.006
Players who are ready to jump

00:11:20.006 --> 00:11:22.086
right into your game can, and

00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:23.266
people who want to watch the

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:24.806
entire sequence can stay

00:11:24.806 --> 00:11:25.936
immersed with edge to edge

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:26.296
playback.

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:29.936
Now, letting players Skip also

00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:31.636
applies to tutorials.

00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:34.936
This is Zombie Gunship, and

00:11:34.936 --> 00:11:36.076
check out the upper left-hand

00:11:36.076 --> 00:11:36.476
corner.

00:11:36.876 --> 00:11:37.786
It's awesome.

00:11:37.786 --> 00:11:39.366
There is a Skip Tutorial button,

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.036
and it feels great to be able to

00:11:41.036 --> 00:11:42.396
jump right into the game.

00:11:43.976 --> 00:11:45.556
Just be sure if you allow people

00:11:45.556 --> 00:11:47.366
to Skip your tutorial, they're

00:11:47.366 --> 00:11:49.286
able to relaunch or replay the

00:11:49.286 --> 00:11:50.736
tutorial in case they need a

00:11:50.736 --> 00:11:51.816
refresher on the rules.

00:11:52.376 --> 00:11:54.316
Now, I understand that this may

00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:55.786
not work for every game.

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:57.506
So, if it's critical to your

00:11:57.506 --> 00:11:59.336
game's progression to include a

00:11:59.336 --> 00:12:01.186
tutorial level, teach the

00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:03.786
basics, gradually adding context

00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:05.006
through progressive disclosure,

00:12:05.396 --> 00:12:06.636
and then get out of the way.

00:12:08.346 --> 00:12:10.296
Letting players Skip is about

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:11.906
putting the player's experience

00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:14.316
first because you don't know

00:12:14.616 --> 00:12:17.116
someone's skill level or how

00:12:17.116 --> 00:12:18.576
much time they have to play your

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:18.996
game.

00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:22.416
And I'm sure we have all button

00:12:22.416 --> 00:12:24.016
smashed and clicked as quickly

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:25.216
as possible to get through a

00:12:25.216 --> 00:12:26.646
tutorial just to get into the

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:27.066
game.

00:12:27.766 --> 00:12:29.166
So, for a much better user

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:31.786
experience, provide a Skip

00:12:31.786 --> 00:12:32.626
Tutorial button.

00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:36.776
So, respect the player and that

00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:38.556
way, they will be able to have a

00:12:38.556 --> 00:12:40.066
much better user experience.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.916
The final design tip today is

00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:45.426
about being inclusive.

00:12:46.356 --> 00:12:48.286
There's a lot that you can do to

00:12:48.286 --> 00:12:50.356
make your game more accessible,

00:12:50.826 --> 00:12:52.336
such as adding Closed Captions

00:12:52.546 --> 00:12:53.936
or supporting Dynamic Type.

00:12:54.746 --> 00:12:56.606
You can also, just like in

00:12:56.606 --> 00:12:59.606
Mushroom 11, support Left and

00:12:59.606 --> 00:13:02.206
Right-Hand Mode, or you can

00:13:02.206 --> 00:13:03.816
support Color Blind Mode, like

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:04.726
in KAMI 2.

00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:06.586
And one of the coolest

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:07.896
Accessibility updates that I

00:13:07.896 --> 00:13:09.706
have seen is from Blackbox,

00:13:10.326 --> 00:13:12.166
which is a visual puzzler that

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.016
now includes sonic interfaces to

00:13:14.016 --> 00:13:15.806
let players with low or no

00:13:15.806 --> 00:13:17.326
vision play through solving

00:13:17.326 --> 00:13:18.416
puzzles with sound.

00:13:19.386 --> 00:13:21.916
With 285 million blind or

00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:23.236
low-vision people in the world,

00:13:23.686 --> 00:13:25.026
everybody should be able to play

00:13:25.026 --> 00:13:28.516
games and have fun.

00:13:28.736 --> 00:13:30.386
All right, with these 10 design

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:31.716
tips, you'll be able to create

00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:33.246
great experiences from the

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:35.406
moment someone taps your icon.

00:13:36.076 --> 00:13:38.126
But remember, of all things,
