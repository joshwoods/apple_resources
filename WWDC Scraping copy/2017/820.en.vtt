00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:16.500
[ Cheering ]

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:22.746
>> Today I am going to talk

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:23.886
about iMessage apps.

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.656
The iMessage App Store is only a

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:27.116
year old, and there are already

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.806
so many great apps, and so many

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:29.796
new experiences.

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:31.636
There are also many more yet to

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:32.345
be discovered.

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:33.866
An essential part of the

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.006
iMessage App experience is

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:36.486
Stickers.

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:38.556
Stickers have done so much to

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:39.846
brighten our conversations.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:41.026
There are so many different

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:42.676
types of Stickers, even animated

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:43.066
ones.

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:44.356
Look at all the Stickers here.

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:45.766
And these are only the Apple

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:46.256
ones.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.546
Let's take a look at what makes

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:48.166
them so great.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:50.416
Going to jump into a

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.996
conversation, and my friend sent

00:00:51.996 --> 00:00:53.386
me this image of a show that we

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:53.806
went to.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:54.536
I'm going to react with a

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:54.966
Sticker.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:58.086
Going to pick this thumbs-up one

00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:00.516
here, tap and hold to peel, and

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:02.286
put it where I want it, scale,

00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:03.706
rotate, and drop it there.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:05.075
I'm going to add another

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.686
Sticker, just to be extra fun

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:07.076
with it.

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:08.416
Pick this one.

00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:09.316
And I think I'm going to send

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:10.436
this one with a full screen

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:10.776
effect.

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:13.286
This new echo one that Mac

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:14.046
worked on is great.

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:17.956
What makes the Sticker

00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:19.666
experience so effective is that

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:20.146
it's flexible.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.866
With the expandable App drawer,

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.256
I can use the half screen and

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:26.186
full screen view to find exactly

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.186
the Sticker that I want.

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.116
It is fast.

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:29.516
It is easy, and light.

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:32.256
In other words, it's convenient.

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:36.096
Prior to Stickers, you could not

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.496
respond to an older bubble in

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:38.586
the conversation, and you

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:40.066
definitely couldn't overlay

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.296
images on top of bubbles.

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:42.726
That is a game changer.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:44.516
I could pick my Sticker, and put

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:45.796
it exactly where I want it,

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.436
transforming the conversation

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.716
for both of us to enjoy.

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:53.466
Using Stickers is playful, and

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:53.866
personal.

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:56.936
There are so many different

00:01:56.936 --> 00:01:58.266
types of ways to send Stickers,

00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:00.106
expressing yourself in unique

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:01.766
and colorful ways is fun.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:07.846
That animation is so cool.

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:09.436
We've seen how being convenient,

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:11.096
personal and fun are part of

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:12.306
what makes Stickers such a great

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:13.046
experience.

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:15.776
But what works for Stickers can

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:16.926
also work for other apps.

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:19.926
Like expressive apps, sharing

00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:21.216
apps, and collaborative apps.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:23.946
Let's focus on expressive apps.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:27.356
Here is one that I love.

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:31.176
Tumblr. Tumblr's iOS app is a

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:32.486
social media destination

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:34.266
optimized for sharing photos and

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.396
gifts, but that doesn't

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.116
necessarily translate into

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:38.646
person to person communication.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:39.826
So they made something

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:40.266
different.

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:41.726
They made a GIF generator.

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:44.426
Going to jump into another app

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:45.576
here, and pick a video that I

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:45.886
made.

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:49.436
Cool. I can set the playback

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:51.776
behavior, and speed it up a

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:52.836
little bit.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:55.726
My friend is having a bad day,

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:56.866
so I'm going to send him a fun

00:02:56.866 --> 00:02:57.536
little message.

00:02:58.336 --> 00:02:59.246
Bounce back, Homey!

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:02.996
I could pick the color.

00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:06.296
And change the font.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:09.596
Scale and rotate.

00:03:09.936 --> 00:03:11.156
Get that frog in there, nice.

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:12.856
And send it.

00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:16.746
Cool.

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:21.076
Tumblr made a robust GIF editor

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.746
allowing you to trim your video,

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:24.536
control the play speed, and set

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:25.446
playback behavior.

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:27.716
It is so powerful, and lives

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:28.856
right within messages.

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:30.776
The whole process is lightweight

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:31.516
and convenient.

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:35.526
You can also customize text,

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:37.496
setting the font style, color,

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:39.066
scale and rotation to

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.126
personalize your GIF.

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:42.116
All these decisions make your

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:43.966
GIF special for both you and the

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:45.016
person you're sending it to.

00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:51.436
And it's fun to see the GIF that

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:53.006
you just created looping in your

00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:53.816
conversation.

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:54.996
I know this is going to get a

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:55.736
good reaction.

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:59.736
We've seen how Tumblr has made a

00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:01.526
robust, expressive app that is

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:03.746
so different from Stickers, yet

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:05.296
it maintains the core qualities

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:08.116
of a successful iMessage app.

00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:09.276
Let's see how it works for a

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:09.956
sharing app.

00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:12.196
Here is an awesome app.

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:13.186
Dunkin Donuts.

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:17.766
Their iOS app is filled with all

00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:18.606
kinds of stuff.

00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:20.505
You can see your rewards, find

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.926
locations, see the menu, order

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:23.356
drinks.

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:24.916
But all these features don't

00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:26.756
necessarily translate into a

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:28.206
conversational experience.

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:29.816
But one part definitely does.

00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:30.956
Gift cards.

00:04:30.956 --> 00:04:33.106
Going to go in here.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.586
My friend just helped me move,

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:35.426
so I'm going to send him a gift

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:35.766
card.

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.506
And he was kind of lazy, so I'm

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:39.406
only going to send him five

00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:39.756
bucks.

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:43.456
Going to pick the right gift

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:43.796
card.

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:44.726
How about "You're one in a

00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:45.176
million"?

00:04:45.176 --> 00:04:46.206
That is kind of silly, right?

00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:49.336
And use the Apple Pay sheet, and

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.506
boom, just like that.

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:53.506
I just sent a gift card.

00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:58.556
Apple Pay allows you to perform

00:04:58.556 --> 00:04:59.856
financial transactions without

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:00.786
leaving messages.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.106
It is super convenient.

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:05.306
These cards look really nice.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:06.846
Maybe it's your nephew's

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:08.376
graduation or a friend's

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:09.746
birthday, or you want to let

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:10.456
someone know that you're

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:11.196
thinking about them.

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:12.596
Sending a gift card is a great

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:13.166
way to do it.

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:14.526
Everyone loves donuts.

00:05:16.686 --> 00:05:18.636
And giving is fun.

00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:20.056
Being kind is fun.

00:05:20.276 --> 00:05:21.466
The person receiving this is

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:22.576
probably going to be really

00:05:22.576 --> 00:05:23.176
surprised.

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:30.146
So the Dunkin Donuts app is so

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:31.386
different than Stickers and

00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:33.106
Tumblr, it still works well

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:34.206
because it embodies the same

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:34.936
three qualities.

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:38.136
There are also collaborative

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:39.876
apps, like games and polling.

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:42.166
Games and polling rely on both

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:44.106
parties to participate, to make

00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:45.506
the most of the app experience.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:46.796
I'm going to share with you one

00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:48.266
of my favorite apps.

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:52.586
Tinder. Tinder is a popular

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:53.956
dating app, but you're probably

00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:55.386
asking yourself how does a

00:05:55.386 --> 00:05:56.556
dating app find its way into

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.226
messages?

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:00.356
One of the core features of

00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:01.496
Tinder is Stacks.

00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:03.316
A data can upload a set of

00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:05.396
images, or create a stack, to

00:06:05.396 --> 00:06:06.716
attract potential connections.

00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:09.786
I am going to go here and create

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:10.226
a stack.

00:06:10.676 --> 00:06:11.766
I'm having a little personal

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:14.096
crisis today, so maybe my friend

00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:14.566
could help me.

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:16.236
I really need to know what shoes

00:06:16.236 --> 00:06:17.846
I should wear today.

00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:19.986
Going to pick my images, name my

00:06:19.986 --> 00:06:25.046
stack, and vote on my own stack.

00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:26.376
I really love all of these, so

00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:27.976
hopefully I can get some help.

00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:30.756
Then I just sent a poll.

00:06:33.056 --> 00:06:34.456
Imagine if you had to create a

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:36.566
poll without using this app.

00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:37.376
You would have to send these

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:38.756
images individually.

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.166
And how would people vote for

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:40.436
them?

00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:42.676
They would have to say leather

00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:43.986
boots, or yellow sneakers.

00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:45.306
But here, they could just cast

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:45.806
their vote.

00:06:46.256 --> 00:06:47.806
Making polls with Tinder is so

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:48.286
easy.

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:50.596
I have the Tinder app just so I

00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:51.516
could use this feature

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:54.526
[laughter].

00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:56.646
Taking a poll is personal.

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:57.956
You're sharing a personal set of

00:06:57.956 --> 00:07:01.006
images, selfies, sneakers, food,

00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:02.586
or whatever, you're asking a

00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:04.166
trusted person for their opinion

00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:04.976
because you care.

00:07:07.996 --> 00:07:08.516
And it's fun.

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:10.186
It's fun to pick people's

00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:10.636
brains.

00:07:10.836 --> 00:07:12.836
It's fun to agree and disagree.

00:07:13.206 --> 00:07:14.816
The poll evolves as people vote,

00:07:14.816 --> 00:07:16.476
and becomes an enjoyable event

00:07:16.476 --> 00:07:17.036
for everyone.

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:20.346
So whether you're making a

00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:23.036
sticker pack, a GIF generator, a

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:24.726
gifting experience, or an image

00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:27.836
poll, making them convenient,

00:07:27.836 --> 00:07:29.956
personal and fun can make a huge

00:07:29.956 --> 00:07:31.336
difference in the success of

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:31.926
your app.

00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:36.166
Here are some tips to get

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:36.666
started.

00:07:38.096 --> 00:07:40.426
Tumblr, Dunkin Donuts and Tinder

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:41.616
do not set out to put their

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:43.646
entire apps into messages, and

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:44.616
thankfully they didn't.

00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:46.396
They integrated only features

00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:47.246
that were focused on

00:07:47.246 --> 00:07:47.996
communication.

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:52.206
Handcrafted messages are fun to

00:07:52.206 --> 00:07:53.146
send and receive.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.926
Find ways to let your users

00:07:54.926 --> 00:07:56.156
create and customize the

00:07:56.156 --> 00:07:56.916
experience.

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:58.586
You may find that there are ways

00:07:58.586 --> 00:07:59.826
to use your app that you never

00:07:59.826 --> 00:08:00.596
even imagined.

00:08:01.116 --> 00:08:02.826
You may discover new user bases,

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:04.366
like my experience with Tinder.

00:08:07.646 --> 00:08:09.096
There are so many platform

00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:10.966
tools, peel and place stickers,

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:12.866
Apple Pay sheet, access to the

00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:14.656
microphone, camera and photos.

00:08:14.986 --> 00:08:16.066
Think about what is best for

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:17.626
your app, and improve on an

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:19.336
existing experience, or create a

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:19.796
new one.

00:08:21.386 --> 00:08:23.276
Because in the end, you want to

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:24.866
create a wonderful experience

00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.376
for your family and friends.

00:08:27.676 --> 00:08:28.356
Thank you.

00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:30.000
