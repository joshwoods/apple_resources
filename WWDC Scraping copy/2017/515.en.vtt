WEBVTT

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:19.326
>> Welcome, my name is Eryk

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:21.236
Vershen, I'm am AVFoundation

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:22.166
engineer at Apple.

00:00:22.936 --> 00:00:25.006
This is session 515 which is

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:27.286
about HLS authoring and the HLS

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:27.686
tools.

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.686
HLS is an abbreviation for HTTP

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:32.466
Live Streaming.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:34.696
HLS is the way you stream

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:36.916
content to all Apple devices.

00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:38.936
I'm going to be talking about

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:40.456
the document HLS Authoring

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:42.596
Specification for Apple Devices

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:44.366
and the tools we distribute for

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.996
creating and validating HLS

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:46.526
content.

00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:50.356
The Authoring Specification and

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:52.316
other important documents about

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:53.906
HLS can be found at this URL

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.776
developer.apple.com/streaming.

00:00:57.486 --> 00:00:59.326
The Authoring Specification is

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.336
Apple's advice for authoring HLS

00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:01.866
content.

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:04.756
We wanted the HLS specification,

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:06.126
the Internet draft, to include

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:07.676
only absolutely necessary

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:08.486
requirements.

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:10.626
The Authoring Specification, on

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:11.756
the other hand, includes

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:12.996
requirements that are specific

00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:15.016
to Apple's players, as well as

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:16.066
things that, while not

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.906
absolutely required, are part of

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:18.726
best practice.

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:23.016
The big news this year is we've

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.726
added support for HEVC.

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:27.406
Here are the limits on what is

00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:27.896
playable.

00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:31.776
Main 10 Profile, Level 5.0, High

00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:32.116
Tier.

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:36.036
Now that we support HEVC content

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:37.746
we've added bit rate guidelines

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:38.516
for that as well.

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:40.136
You should treat those

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:41.326
recommendations as very

00:01:41.326 --> 00:01:41.966
preliminary.

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:44.336
HEVC encoders are still

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.196
evolving, we expect to see

00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:47.856
improvements over time so we may

00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:49.116
revise our guidelines in the

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:49.606
future.

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:52.076
You should also remember that

00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:53.446
the bit rate recommendations in

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.526
the Authoring Specification are

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:56.226
guidelines, they are not cast in

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:56.636
stone.

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:59.106
We are aware that all content is

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:00.816
different, a bit rate that works

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:01.806
for a video of two people

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:03.726
talking is not likely to work

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:04.656
for a sporting event.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.366
And you may have different

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:07.446
constraints on the number of bit

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:08.346
rate variants that you can

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:08.806
provide.

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.686
So, use the bit rate guidelines

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:11.606
as a starting point.

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:14.486
Having HEVC means that you can

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:17.356
have both H.264 and HEVC content

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:18.676
in the same master playlist.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.516
So, we've come up with some best

00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:21.196
practices.

00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:24.696
First and most important, always

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:26.086
use the CODECS attribute.

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:28.006
You need this so that older

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:29.356
players don't try to play the

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:30.376
HEVC content.

00:02:32.156 --> 00:02:34.226
Second and almost as important,

00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:36.096
always include some H.264

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:36.556
content.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.516
You need this so older players

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:39.376
will have something that they

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:39.796
can play.

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:43.576
Now the player will switch

00:02:43.606 --> 00:02:46.496
between H.264 and HEVC.

00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:48.136
However, for two variants with

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.486
similar bit rates the player

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:50.926
will typically favor the HEVC

00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:51.446
content.

00:02:51.446 --> 00:02:54.526
While H.264 content could be in

00:02:54.526 --> 00:02:56.656
FMP4 files for maximum

00:02:56.656 --> 00:02:59.906
compatibility keep your H.264 in

00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:00.916
transport streams.

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.816
The last point I want to make is

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.606
that these same rules apply to

00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:05.906
so-called trick play content,

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.736
that is I-frame-only content.

00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:10.826
Along with adding HEVC support

00:03:10.826 --> 00:03:12.426
we also added support for a

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.796
second subtitle format, IMSC.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.326
If you want more detail on our

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:19.066
support for IMSC1 you should

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:20.766
look at this year's Advances in

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.286
HTTP Live Streaming talk.

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.586
IMSC1 is based on TTML, the

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:27.616
timed text markup language and

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.026
it's compatible with standards

00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:32.096
from the EBU and SMPTE.

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:35.596
Let's talk about best practices

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:37.086
for subtitle content.

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:39.666
We support the text profile of

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:42.186
IMSC and note that IMSC content

00:03:42.186 --> 00:03:44.356
must be in fragmented MP4 files,

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:46.046
you can't use plaintext files.

00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:49.176
WebVTT is the same as it has

00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:50.996
been, text files typically

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:53.456
having an extension of .VTT or

00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:54.326
.webVTT.

00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:56.516
Remember that you can mix up

00:03:56.516 --> 00:04:00.556
IMSC and webVTT with H.264 HEVC

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:02.006
content however you want,

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:03.366
they're completely independent.

00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:06.336
You should always use the IMSC1

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:07.426
CODECS value.

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:09.576
Including that value ensures

00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:11.036
that older clients will ignore

00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:11.656
the variant.

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:13.246
However, for maximum backward

00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:15.046
compatibilities don't put in the

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.875
value for the webVTT content.

00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:19.896
I want to change gears and talk

00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:21.266
about the HLS tools and the

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:22.266
changes we've made there.

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:24.416
The tools are available on the

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:25.916
developer site and you can find

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:27.666
them through the same URL I

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:28.546
mentioned earlier,

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.716
developer.apple.com/streaming.

00:04:32.246 --> 00:04:33.666
The tools fall into three rough

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.726
categories, tools for segmenting

00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:37.746
video and audio, tools for

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:39.176
validating content and making

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.526
validation reports and finally,

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.296
tools for creating subtitles,

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:44.446
iv3 metadata and master

00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:45.026
playlists.

00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:47.386
Now the validator does not do

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:49.066
low-level bitstream checks, you

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:50.236
should be using third-party

00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:51.536
tools if you think you may have

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:53.006
issues with your encoders.

00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:54.576
Let's look at some of the

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:57.186
specific changes we made in the

00:04:58.076 --> 00:04:58.216
tools.

00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:00.036
Well firstly, we've added the

00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:02.056
ability for MediaStreamValidator

00:05:02.056 --> 00:05:03.316
to check local files.

00:05:03.766 --> 00:05:04.846
You no longer have to put an

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.536
HTTP server to validate your

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:07.176
streams.

00:05:08.206 --> 00:05:10.356
If you have direct file access

00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:11.776
you can check them that way and

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.296
you can use relative paths,

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:15.256
absolute paths or file URLs.

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:17.476
However, I should note that you

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:20.506
can't mix file URLs and HTTP,

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:21.896
that is if the master playlist

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.666
is a file path then the media

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:26.016
playlist it references can't be

00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:27.166
HTTP URLs.

00:05:28.016 --> 00:05:29.646
Of course, we added support for

00:05:29.646 --> 00:05:31.256
HEVC into the tools.

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:33.856
We've also made a lot of general

00:05:33.856 --> 00:05:35.046
improvements to the tools,

00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:35.776
principally the

00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:37.516
MediaStreamValidator and HLS

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:37.936
report.

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:39.886
We check more things about the

00:05:39.886 --> 00:05:40.446
stream.

00:05:40.796 --> 00:05:42.066
There are too many to list, but

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:42.986
for example, we're now

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:44.426
validating the CODEC usage.

00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:46.646
We have better handling for

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:47.876
errors on the stream during

00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:48.616
validation.

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:50.286
And we made the ordering of

00:05:50.286 --> 00:05:51.496
variants renditions in the

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:53.486
reports be more consistent.

00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:57.046
We've added several new options,

00:05:57.046 --> 00:05:58.326
I want to call out just three of

00:05:58.326 --> 00:05:58.606
them.

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:01.386
First, the description option on

00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:02.476
MediaStreamValidator.

00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:04.816
The URLs for a stream don't

00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:06.166
necessarily make clear what the

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:06.936
content is.

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:08.696
This option allows you to add

00:06:08.696 --> 00:06:10.226
some text describing the stream.

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:12.126
For example, such and such show,

00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:13.636
season two, episode five.

00:06:14.116 --> 00:06:15.386
The text will appear at the top

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:16.656
of the report near the URL.

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:20.786
For HLS report, we've added some

00:06:20.786 --> 00:06:22.076
new optional columns.

00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:24.376
Rather than continue the way we

00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:25.686
had previously with separate

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:27.716
options for each column, instead

00:06:27.716 --> 00:06:29.216
we've added a columns option

00:06:29.386 --> 00:06:30.516
that takes a list of column and

00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:31.366
identifiers.

00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:33.386
The set of available column

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:34.796
identifiers can be found using

00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:36.336
the Help option or in the

00:06:36.336 --> 00:06:36.796
[inaudible] page.

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:39.916
The old id and pl options that

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:41.736
gave you data id values and

00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:42.896
playlist bit rates are still

00:06:42.896 --> 00:06:44.546
supported, but are deprecated in

00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:46.156
favor of column identifiers.

00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:47.986
And the column identifiers for

00:06:47.986 --> 00:06:49.966
those are just id and pl.

00:06:51.376 --> 00:06:53.956
Last year we added hdcp-level

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:55.466
support, but we forgot to tell

00:06:55.466 --> 00:06:57.846
you about the hdcp-level option

00:06:57.846 --> 00:06:59.036
on MediaFileSegmenter.

00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:01.536
This allows you to set the

00:07:01.536 --> 00:07:02.186
hdcp-level.

00:07:03.136 --> 00:07:05.066
The hdcp-level is included in

00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:06.656
the Plist that gets generated by

00:07:06.656 --> 00:07:07.746
MediaFileSegmenter.

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:10.006
And you can pass that Plist to

00:07:10.006 --> 00:07:11.546
the variant playlist creator to

00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:13.846
get the hdcp-level attribute in

00:07:13.846 --> 00:07:15.396
the generated master playlist.

00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:19.356
Here's a quick look of a sample

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:19.816
report.

00:07:20.626 --> 00:07:23.556
Notice the second line, that's

00:07:23.556 --> 00:07:24.696
from the description option that

00:07:24.696 --> 00:07:25.226
we passed in

00:07:25.226 --> 00:07:26.306
MediaStreamValidator.

00:07:27.756 --> 00:07:28.956
And notice that we've now added

00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:31.206
a CODECS column so you can see

00:07:31.206 --> 00:07:34.766
which variants are H.264 and

00:07:35.576 --> 00:07:36.016
HEVC.

00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:37.226
Now we use the AVC, the

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:40.426
alternate name of H.264 so that

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:41.396
we'll have more visible

00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:42.886
separation between the two CODEC

00:07:42.886 --> 00:07:43.356
types.

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:47.096
As part of the changes in the

00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:48.006
ordering of variants and

00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:50.506
renditions, we now keep audio,

00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:52.126
closed caption and subtitle

00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:53.176
renditions separate.

00:07:54.366 --> 00:07:57.836
To summarize, remember that URL,

00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:00.266
developer.apple.com/streaming,

00:08:01.006 --> 00:08:02.246
everything you need to know is

00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:03.506
pointed to from that page.

00:08:04.106 --> 00:08:05.456
Besides the various documents it

00:08:05.456 --> 00:08:06.666
also has links to sample

00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:08.506
streams, to the tools download,

00:08:09.136 --> 00:08:11.246
to past videos about HLS, the

00:08:11.246 --> 00:08:12.306
information about FairPlay

00:08:12.306 --> 00:08:14.126
Streaming and so on.

00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:16.556
I encourage you all to read the

00:08:16.556 --> 00:08:17.946
HLS Authoring Specification for

00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:20.306
Apple Devices and the HLS spec.

00:08:21.726 --> 00:08:23.496
For more information go to the

00:08:23.496 --> 00:08:24.746
webpage for this talk,

00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:30.226
developer.apple.com/WWDC17/515.

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:34.596
We have some related video

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:37.416
sessions, Advances in HTTP Live

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:37.946
Streaming.

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:41.186
This has more discussion of HEVC

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:43.645
and IMSC1, as well as some other

00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:44.636
interesting topics.

00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:46.706
And Error Handling Best

00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:48.356
Practices for HTTP Live

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:48.806
Streaming.

00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:50.466
That will help you understand

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:52.306
what your server needs to do to

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:53.776
be a good HLS server.

00:08:54.586 --> 00:08:55.976
You can watch either of these

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:57.836
videos via the web or in the

00:08:57.836 --> 00:08:59.066
WWDC app.

00:08:59.786 --> 00:09:01.136
I hope you found the talk

00:09:01.136 --> 00:09:02.436
useful, thanks for watching.
