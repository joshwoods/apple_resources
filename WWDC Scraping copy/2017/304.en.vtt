00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.101
[ Applause ]

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.976
>> Good afternoon.

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:27.876
Welcome to Session 304, What's

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:28.916
New in Device Management.

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:30.996
I'm Todd Fernandez and I'm very

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.356
pleased to be your host on this

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:33.846
tour through new developments

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:35.326
and how Apple devices can be

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.796
managed in schools and

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:38.426
businesses around the world.

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:42.626
I just love this photo.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:45.586
As Tim said on Monday, iPad has

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:47.806
changed the way we teach, learn

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:50.096
and create, which is why we work

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:52.276
so hard to make it easy to bring

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.936
Apple devices into schools so

00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:56.456
that students like these girls

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:58.266
can do amazing things with their

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.546
iPads or Macs as the case may be

00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:02.616
and get excited about learning

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:03.516
and creating.

00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:07.186
We also want to unlock new

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:09.366
solutions in enterprise to help

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.956
employees be more productive and

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:13.156
enable businesses to create new

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.966
ways of serving their customers

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:17.046
by providing experiences in

00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:19.096
their hotels, restaurants and

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:20.636
hospitals that were not

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:21.596
previously possible.

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:25.486
Last year, we introduced three

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:26.706
huge new device management

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:28.336
features to support iPad

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:29.536
deployments in schools.

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:33.036
Classroom, an assistant which

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:34.916
helps teachers focus on teaching

00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.446
rather than managing student

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:37.096
devices.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.486
Shared iPad, a great way to

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:42.716
provide a personalized

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:44.726
experience on an iPad shared by

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:46.666
many students each day in the

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:47.286
classroom.

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:50.666
And last but not least, Apple

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.736
School Manager, one place for

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.336
school IT administrators to

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:56.106
create and manage all of their

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:58.226
schools' accounts, devices and

00:01:58.226 --> 00:01:58.706
content.

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:04.486
Just like 2016, 2017 has already

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:06.036
been another big year for device

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:07.746
management as our releases

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:09.806
earlier this spring continued to

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:11.736
address the most important needs

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:13.466
in education and enterprise.

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.336
Introducing many more

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.106
capabilities to management via

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:19.866
MDM and configuration profiles.

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:23.626
Connecting Apple TV fully into

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:27.006
device management and conversely

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:28.086
removing the management

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:29.826
requirement for classroom by

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:31.296
empowering teachers to create

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.046
their own classes bringing

00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:34.496
Classroom to a much wider

00:02:34.496 --> 00:02:36.276
audience, including enabling

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:37.436
schools with bring your own

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:39.056
device programs around the

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.686
world, good day Australia, can

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:42.536
take advantage of Classroom.

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:44.626
But of course, we didn't stop

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:44.916
there.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:46.986
Today we'll announce a number of

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.636
additional capabilities in each

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:50.536
of these areas to enable people

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:52.296
to make use of Apple devices in

00:02:52.296 --> 00:02:53.486
new and exciting ways.

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:54.816
I don't want to spoil the

00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:56.766
surprises so we'll cover each as

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:57.916
it comes up during today's

00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:58.316
session.

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:02.186
As has become tradition, today's

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:03.476
session will follow deployment

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:04.926
lifecycle, beginning with

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:06.416
enrollment, getting your devices

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:07.476
ready to be managed.

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:09.346
Continuing with distribution,

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:10.676
loading those devices with

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:11.996
compelling apps and content.

00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:14.216
Management, performing the

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:15.726
ongoing day-to-day management of

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:16.736
all of your devices.

00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:18.636
And finally, I'll give a brief

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:20.516
update on Apple's tools for both

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:22.486
administrators and our MDM

00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:24.016
solution partners which take

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:25.406
advantage of all of these new

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:25.996
features.

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:28.666
In a break from tradition, I

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:30.116
will mostly serve as an emcee

00:03:30.116 --> 00:03:31.296
this year and leave the

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:32.726
presentation to the engineers

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:34.426
who have designed, built and

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:35.546
tested all of the new

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:36.636
capabilities we will cover

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:37.006
today.

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:39.136
We have so much to share I've

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.626
brought along a supporting cast

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:41.946
larger than the Game of Thrones,

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:44.606
well okay seven engineers, to

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:45.936
help me get through it all.

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:47.326
But I promise that we will

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.636
conclude in less time than it

00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:49.546
takes the Oscars.

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:52.096
So, without further ado, I'd

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:53.486
like to ask Bob Whiteman to come

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:55.466
on stage and get us started by

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:56.786
telling you all about how we've

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:58.076
improved enrollment this year.

00:03:58.466 --> 00:03:58.756
Bob.

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:04.686
[ Applause ]

00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:05.986
>> Game of Thrones, will we make

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:07.106
it through the season, who

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:08.466
knows.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.656
I'm Bob Whiteman, one of the

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.606
Apple engineers responsible for

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:13.536
the new device management

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:14.516
features you'll see today.

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:16.856
In this section, you'll find out

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.516
about major additions to Apple

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:20.966
TV management, new features of

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:22.196
the Device Enrollment Program,

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.836
security enhancements of the MDM

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:27.986
protocol, best practices for MDM

00:04:27.986 --> 00:04:29.746
administrators and MDM server

00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:31.996
developers, and a major update

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:33.016
to Apple School Manager.

00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:36.326
First of Apple TV.

00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:38.766
I'm happy to say that Apple TV

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.166
can now participate in the

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:41.486
Device Enrollment Program.

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:45.556
[ Applause ]

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.316
Apple TV devices have all the

00:04:47.316 --> 00:04:49.086
same features as iOS devices,

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:50.756
zero touch configuration,

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:52.946
streamline setup, and wireless

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:53.596
supervision.

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:56.596
You plug in power, an ethernet

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.426
and the device is automatically

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:00.226
configured, you don't even need

00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:01.466
the remote.

00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:04.626
There's also a change to the

00:05:04.626 --> 00:05:06.106
supervision of Apple TVs,

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:08.036
previously all Apple TVs were

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:10.386
treated as supervised now they

00:05:10.386 --> 00:05:12.116
are unsupervised by default.

00:05:12.356 --> 00:05:14.466
If you don't want the elevated

00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:16.136
privileges of supervision you

00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:19.196
don't need to claim them.

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:21.256
We've expanded the Device

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:22.716
Enrollment Program with a new

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:24.476
way to introduce devices into

00:05:24.476 --> 00:05:25.146
the program.

00:05:25.936 --> 00:05:27.966
Previously, DEP only supported

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:29.656
devices that were purchased from

00:05:29.656 --> 00:05:30.826
a supported sales channel.

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:33.976
Now you can also enroll your own

00:05:33.976 --> 00:05:36.616
devices in DEP regardless of how

00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:37.426
you purchased them.

00:05:38.106 --> 00:05:39.066
This will particularly help

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:40.566
schools that received donated

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:40.976
devices.

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:46.646
[ Applause ]

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:48.986
Now this new enrollment method

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:50.166
differs in two ways.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:52.046
The first is that the device is

00:05:52.096 --> 00:05:53.786
always supervised and MDM

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:55.876
management is always mandatory.

00:05:57.076 --> 00:05:58.986
The second is a 30-day

00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:01.866
provisional period, when you add

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:04.026
a device to DEP it erases the

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:04.616
device.

00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:06.446
Then the provisional period

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:08.656
starts when the device is

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:10.116
subsequently activated.

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:12.356
During the provisional period

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:13.966
the lock screen and setup

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.646
assistant indicates the device

00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:17.996
is provisionally enrolled and

00:06:18.156 --> 00:06:19.816
the user can remove the device

00:06:19.876 --> 00:06:22.146
from DEP and set up assistant or

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:24.576
settings, which also erases the

00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:25.236
device.

00:06:26.016 --> 00:06:27.946
But after the 30 days expire,

00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:29.876
the user can no longer do so.

00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:32.746
Both during and after the

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:34.966
provisional period all DEP

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:36.286
features are available,

00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:38.676
including streamline setup and

00:06:38.676 --> 00:06:40.006
mandatory MDM enrollment.

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:44.026
Now let's switch over to the

00:06:44.026 --> 00:06:46.146
other DEP enrollment method.

00:06:46.686 --> 00:06:48.356
When you add a device to DEP

00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:50.306
while purchasing the device from

00:06:50.306 --> 00:06:52.466
an approved sales channel, the

00:06:52.466 --> 00:06:53.666
device does not need to be

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:55.896
supervised and MDM management

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:57.736
can be optional, which lets the

00:06:57.736 --> 00:06:59.686
user opt out of MDM management.

00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:01.996
But only a vanishingly small

00:07:01.996 --> 00:07:03.196
number of devices are in this

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:04.506
state and it was always kind of

00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:07.196
an odd fit for DEP so we're

00:07:07.196 --> 00:07:08.196
deprecating these.

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:10.256
In the future, all DEP enrolled

00:07:10.256 --> 00:07:11.526
devices will need to be

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:13.546
supervised and MDM enrollment

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:14.576
will be mandatory.

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:18.866
And here's a little

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:20.306
housekeeping, with each new

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.106
release of iOS there are new

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:23.536
panes in the setup assistant.

00:07:23.856 --> 00:07:25.586
DEP configuration allows you to

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:27.776
skip these panes, so these are

00:07:27.776 --> 00:07:29.046
the new skip keys.

00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:30.166
I won't go over each one of

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:32.376
these, but let me mention that

00:07:32.636 --> 00:07:34.216
the keyboard user's pane only

00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:37.286
appears on devices which are

00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:39.216
non-US English regions, such as

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:39.906
China and Japan.

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:45.186
Moving on to some security

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:45.926
enhancements.

00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:48.666
In iOS 10.3 we introduced

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:50.286
partial trust for manually

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:51.826
installed certificates and

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:53.116
certificate profiles.

00:07:53.776 --> 00:07:55.266
When a certificate has partial

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.386
trust, it is trusted for all

00:07:57.386 --> 00:07:58.966
purposes except SSL.

00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:01.246
When a certificate is installed

00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:03.276
noninteractively via MDM or

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:05.006
Configurator the certificate is

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:07.336
given full trust, but if it's

00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:09.126
installed manually the

00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:10.686
certificate gets partial trust

00:08:10.686 --> 00:08:11.426
at first.

00:08:11.756 --> 00:08:13.686
The user can go to Settings,

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.576
About, Certificate Trust

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:17.446
Settings and enable Full Trust

00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:19.126
which gives an appropriate

00:08:19.126 --> 00:08:20.006
additional warning.

00:08:20.726 --> 00:08:22.866
Now this is a speedbump that

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:24.976
gets users to reconsider whether

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:26.666
they should trust whatever

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.326
certificate they have just been

00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:29.546
asked to trust.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:31.966
Often MDM enrollments require

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:33.226
trusting the MDM server

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:33.836
certificate.

00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:36.226
To avoid complicating MDM

00:08:36.226 --> 00:08:39.696
onboarding we put a small gap in

00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:40.405
the speedbump.

00:08:40.696 --> 00:08:42.525
If the certificate is manually

00:08:42.525 --> 00:08:45.316
installed by a profile that also

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.416
contains an MDM payload that

00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:49.316
certificate is given full trust.

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:51.526
So, if your MDM deployment

00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:53.946
requires trust, make sure you're

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:55.626
distributing the certificate in

00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:57.456
the same profile as the MDM

00:08:57.456 --> 00:08:59.386
enrollment payload to make sure

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:02.366
that you're driving your users

00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:03.396
through that gap in the

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:03.866
speedbump.

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:10.886
In 2018, MDM will require your

00:09:10.986 --> 00:09:12.766
server to support App Transport

00:09:12.766 --> 00:09:14.916
Security or ATS.

00:09:15.316 --> 00:09:16.606
This is a set of security

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:18.246
requirements for secure

00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:19.756
communication introduced

00:09:19.756 --> 00:09:20.256
previously.

00:09:21.106 --> 00:09:22.966
ATS requires specific protocol

00:09:22.966 --> 00:09:24.716
details and cryptographic

00:09:24.716 --> 00:09:26.226
algorithms to harden secure

00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:27.126
communications.

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:30.366
For now, MDM is exempted from

00:09:30.366 --> 00:09:32.396
ATS, but this exemption will be

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:34.016
ending in 2018.

00:09:34.246 --> 00:09:36.086
If your MDM server does not

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:38.626
currently meet ATS requirements

00:09:38.626 --> 00:09:40.006
in the future the MDM client

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:41.826
will refuse to communicate with

00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:41.896
it.

00:09:42.546 --> 00:09:44.006
But regardless of that, the time

00:09:44.006 --> 00:09:45.596
to update your MDM server is

00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:45.916
now.

00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:47.946
After all, these changes are a

00:09:47.946 --> 00:09:49.576
good idea for security, whether

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:51.766
or not the device requires them.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.916
MDM enrollment involves a SCEP

00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:59.566
server to generate the device

00:09:59.566 --> 00:09:59.966
identity.

00:10:00.586 --> 00:10:02.156
This involves negotiating the

00:10:02.156 --> 00:10:04.456
cryptographic algorithms used

00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:05.646
for encryption and hashing.

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:07.876
We've dropped support for the

00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:09.466
outdated DES algorithm.

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:12.996
And make sure you SCEP server

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.776
advertises its capabilities

00:10:14.776 --> 00:10:16.786
properly in the CA Caps field.

00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:18.716
A couple of MDM servers out

00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:21.086
there didn't and that forced the

00:10:21.126 --> 00:10:22.846
MDM client to fall back to the

00:10:22.846 --> 00:10:24.446
lowest quality algorithm triple

00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.216
DES even though the SCEP servers

00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:27.386
in question supported better

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:28.026
algorithms.

00:10:28.876 --> 00:10:30.976
And on that note, add support

00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:32.456
for the best algorithms which

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:33.876
are currently AES for bulk

00:10:33.876 --> 00:10:35.616
encryption and SHA-512 for

00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:35.966
hashing.

00:10:36.676 --> 00:10:41.396
On the macOS side, we've

00:10:41.396 --> 00:10:42.566
hardened the server certificate

00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:44.466
evaluation for MDM communication

00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:45.326
in High Sierra.

00:10:46.266 --> 00:10:47.866
This involves three new keys in

00:10:47.866 --> 00:10:49.236
the MDM enrollment payload.

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:51.796
The first two keys specify white

00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:53.476
lists of certificates to use

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.606
when evaluating server trust.

00:10:55.606 --> 00:10:57.816
One set for the server URL and

00:10:57.816 --> 00:10:59.226
the other for the checking URL.

00:11:00.556 --> 00:11:02.616
The third key specifies hard or

00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:04.516
soft revocation checking on

00:11:04.516 --> 00:11:05.966
those pinned certificates.

00:11:06.476 --> 00:11:07.996
Hard revocation checking means

00:11:07.996 --> 00:11:10.256
that the trust evaluation fails

00:11:10.546 --> 00:11:12.086
if the device cannot get a

00:11:12.086 --> 00:11:13.286
positive response from the

00:11:13.286 --> 00:11:15.176
revocation server for any

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:15.536
reason.

00:11:16.846 --> 00:11:18.256
Now these are generally good

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:19.596
security features for securing

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.846
communications, but if you're

00:11:21.896 --> 00:11:24.246
only administrating Macs this

00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:26.556
can be particularly useful it

00:11:26.676 --> 00:11:28.306
can save you the cost and effort

00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:29.536
of getting a certificate for a

00:11:29.536 --> 00:11:30.146
public CA.

00:11:31.446 --> 00:11:33.046
Just remember to be particularly

00:11:33.116 --> 00:11:34.506
careful when rolling out these

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:36.296
features, especially pinning the

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:37.706
server URL certificate.

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:40.416
A misconfiguration could cut off

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:41.626
your Macs from communicating

00:11:41.626 --> 00:11:43.246
with your MDM server which makes

00:11:43.246 --> 00:11:44.576
it very difficult to correct the

00:11:44.576 --> 00:11:45.476
misconfiguration.

00:11:46.176 --> 00:11:50.366
I'd like to share some best

00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:52.226
practices for administrators.

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:55.226
For those administering Shared

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:57.056
iPad, please enable diagnostic

00:11:57.056 --> 00:11:58.866
submission using the diagnostic

00:11:58.866 --> 00:11:59.766
submission command.

00:12:00.276 --> 00:12:01.666
This lets us collect the raw

00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:03.236
data that we need in order to

00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:04.626
help us improve the product for

00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:05.096
everyone.

00:12:05.676 --> 00:12:09.576
Also for Shared iPad there's an

00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:11.226
interaction between the user

00:12:11.226 --> 00:12:13.766
quota setting and the APFS file

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:14.206
system.

00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:16.296
A user quota controls two

00:12:16.296 --> 00:12:17.086
different things.

00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:18.816
It sets a maximum number of

00:12:18.816 --> 00:12:21.386
users that can have data stored

00:12:21.386 --> 00:12:23.826
on the device and it ensures

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.316
that individual users aren't

00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:26.876
consuming too much file system

00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:28.596
space which would crowd out

00:12:28.596 --> 00:12:29.386
other users.

00:12:30.306 --> 00:12:31.716
If you already have Shared iPad

00:12:31.716 --> 00:12:33.886
devices with the user quota that

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:36.306
second control of storage space

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:38.266
is effectively disabled by the

00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:40.256
upgrade that APFS introduced in

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:41.486
iOS 10.3.

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:43.176
There's a one-time

00:12:43.176 --> 00:12:45.176
administration task to restore

00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:46.226
the storage quote.

00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:50.246
Upgrade to the latest iOS and

00:12:50.246 --> 00:12:51.816
wipe all of the existing user

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:53.026
counts on the iPad.

00:12:53.226 --> 00:12:54.426
You can either erase the iPad

00:12:54.426 --> 00:12:56.566
and set it up again or use the

00:12:56.566 --> 00:12:57.656
delete user command.

00:12:58.446 --> 00:12:59.806
And don't forget to shut down

00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:01.306
the iPad after you're done so

00:13:01.306 --> 00:13:02.216
that it's ready to go when the

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:02.976
users first get it.

00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:08.276
If you're using startup profiles

00:13:08.306 --> 00:13:10.126
on macOS you've been putting the

00:13:10.126 --> 00:13:11.996
profiles in a special location

00:13:11.996 --> 00:13:13.526
in the file system this is now

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.326
deprecated.

00:13:14.896 --> 00:13:16.526
Instead, there's a new option to

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:18.326
the profiles command line tool

00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:19.816
that lets you specify startup

00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:21.406
profiles, the details are in the

00:13:21.406 --> 00:13:22.796
main page for the profiles

00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:22.976
command.

00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:28.286
And now some best practices for

00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:28.976
those of you that are

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.706
implementing MDM servers.

00:13:31.196 --> 00:13:32.376
I just mentioned how useful the

00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:34.176
diagnostic submission command

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.776
is, so please make sure that

00:13:35.776 --> 00:13:36.786
your server supports it.

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:42.786
In 2018, APNs tokens will likely

00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:44.666
increase in size, verify that

00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:46.496
your server can handle APNs

00:13:46.496 --> 00:13:48.656
tokens up to 100 bytes in size.

00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:50.596
Don't just hardcode the size of

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:51.736
APNs tokens that you've been

00:13:51.736 --> 00:13:52.946
receiving from devices.

00:13:57.046 --> 00:13:58.536
When the MDM server generates

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:00.356
its enrollment profile limit it

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.436
to just the MDM payload and

00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:04.226
payloads necessary to ensure

00:14:04.226 --> 00:14:05.656
that the enrollment succeeds,

00:14:05.806 --> 00:14:07.936
such as Wi-Fi payload or

00:14:07.936 --> 00:14:08.946
certificate payload.

00:14:09.446 --> 00:14:11.196
Don't use this profile to

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:12.736
configure other things like

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.286
restrictions or accounts,

00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:15.856
instead push those payloads

00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:17.346
after the enrollment completes.

00:14:17.976 --> 00:14:22.286
And last, I'd like to challenge

00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:24.346
MDM solution providers to make

00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:25.916
the life of an administrator

00:14:26.026 --> 00:14:26.456
easier.

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.036
Device management provides a

00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:29.866
large number of individual

00:14:29.866 --> 00:14:31.866
controls and we're adding more

00:14:31.866 --> 00:14:33.296
with each new release.

00:14:33.676 --> 00:14:34.916
This makes device management

00:14:35.056 --> 00:14:37.256
powerful, but complex.

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.496
Administrators may not know all

00:14:39.496 --> 00:14:40.566
of the details of how these

00:14:40.566 --> 00:14:42.566
controls interact and that

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:43.476
raises the risk of a

00:14:43.476 --> 00:14:44.386
misconfiguration.

00:14:45.046 --> 00:14:47.346
For instance, an administrator

00:14:47.346 --> 00:14:49.376
may restrict the App Store to

00:14:49.376 --> 00:14:51.596
prevent unauthorized apps, but

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:52.686
not realize that they should

00:14:52.776 --> 00:14:54.796
also restrict pairings so that

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:56.026
apps can't be installed with

00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:57.536
Configurator or iTunes.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.246
So, do what you can in both

00:15:00.296 --> 00:15:02.966
documentation and software to

00:15:02.966 --> 00:15:05.096
meet administrator's needs, not

00:15:05.096 --> 00:15:05.976
just allow them to set settings.

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:12.756
If you're troubleshooting device

00:15:12.756 --> 00:15:14.156
management problems I have some

00:15:14.156 --> 00:15:15.046
tips for that.

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.506
Your best source of information

00:15:16.506 --> 00:15:17.616
is the system logs.

00:15:17.976 --> 00:15:19.336
You can view them with the macOS

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.216
apps Console or Apple

00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:22.046
Configurator 2.

00:15:23.026 --> 00:15:25.266
On iOS, filter the logs by

00:15:25.366 --> 00:15:27.136
process name to hone in on the

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:28.596
most useful messages.

00:15:29.286 --> 00:15:31.376
Profiling is responsible for

00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:32.426
installation and removal of

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:33.956
profiles and restrictions and

00:15:33.956 --> 00:15:34.436
other things.

00:15:35.426 --> 00:15:37.386
MDM is responsible for

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:38.726
communicating with the MDM

00:15:38.726 --> 00:15:40.736
server and tracking management

00:15:40.736 --> 00:15:42.916
of apps, systems and accounts.

00:15:43.946 --> 00:15:45.016
If you have a device that's not

00:15:45.016 --> 00:15:46.106
communicating with the MDM

00:15:46.106 --> 00:15:50.336
server you want to examine mdmd.

00:15:50.336 --> 00:15:52.696
DMD relays management commands

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:53.996
to other parts of the operating

00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:54.456
system.

00:15:55.626 --> 00:15:57.556
And appstored installs and

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:00.346
removes apps and if those apps

00:16:00.346 --> 00:16:02.456
come from iTunes itunesstored is

00:16:02.456 --> 00:16:03.186
involved as well.

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:05.226
So, when you're looking through

00:16:05.226 --> 00:16:06.816
the logs your best bet is to

00:16:06.816 --> 00:16:08.646
look for log messages of error

00:16:08.646 --> 00:16:10.496
type first and if nothing jumps

00:16:10.496 --> 00:16:12.136
out at you look at the warning

00:16:12.136 --> 00:16:14.366
level as well.

00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:17.376
On macOS, don't filter the logs

00:16:17.446 --> 00:16:19.756
by process instead, filter the

00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:21.266
logs by setting the subsystem to

00:16:21.336 --> 00:16:24.416
com.apple.ManagedClient which

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:25.606
covers all appropriate

00:16:25.606 --> 00:16:26.306
processes.

00:16:26.806 --> 00:16:28.496
But for both operating systems

00:16:28.896 --> 00:16:30.466
you may want to install a debug

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:32.216
logging profile to get more

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:33.256
detailed information.

00:16:33.666 --> 00:16:34.966
Just remember the caveats

00:16:34.966 --> 00:16:36.296
involved when using debug

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:36.706
logging.

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:38.526
For instance, don't habitually

00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:40.346
push the logging profiles to all

00:16:40.346 --> 00:16:41.706
the devices in your population.

00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:43.866
If you have any troubleshooting

00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:45.806
questions make sure to come to

00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:46.646
the lab sessions.

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:48.786
And now I'm going to turn it

00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:50.996
over to my colleagues, Can Aran

00:16:50.996 --> 00:16:52.616
and Juan [inaudible] to demo

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:54.346
some of these.

00:16:55.746 --> 00:16:56.436
Can.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.500
[ Applause ]

00:17:05.276 --> 00:17:06.675
>> Hello, I'm Can Aran, iOS

00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:07.675
engineer in the device

00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:10.455
management team and I must say

00:17:10.455 --> 00:17:12.016
I'm very excited to be here.

00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:15.136
I will be using Configurator,

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:17.215
Apple Configurator 2 to enroll

00:17:17.215 --> 00:17:20.126
this device and let's get

00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:22.786
started with that.

00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:23.915
I'll choose the device,

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:27.195
right-click on it and hit

00:17:27.195 --> 00:17:28.205
Prepare.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.456
In the new version of

00:17:30.456 --> 00:17:32.216
Configurator, we have this

00:17:32.216 --> 00:17:34.246
option to add the device to

00:17:34.246 --> 00:17:36.216
Device Enrollment Program, so

00:17:36.216 --> 00:17:38.586
we'll check that and hit Next.

00:17:39.636 --> 00:17:41.596
Just a quick note, I had already

00:17:41.596 --> 00:17:44.366
logged in to my DP Organization

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:46.056
Configurator prompted me for

00:17:46.056 --> 00:17:48.586
that and saved my credentials.

00:17:49.716 --> 00:17:51.806
Here we can specify our MDM

00:17:51.806 --> 00:17:54.926
server, we can enter our

00:17:54.926 --> 00:17:59.926
organization information, and we

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.466
can skip these steps in Setup

00:18:01.466 --> 00:18:05.406
Assistant and we will need to

00:18:05.406 --> 00:18:08.316
provide a Wi-Fi profile for the

00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:09.926
device to be able to communicate

00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:10.536
with the server.

00:18:13.476 --> 00:18:16.096
And we may enter our credentials

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.966
for the MDM server, but we do

00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:19.076
not need to for now.

00:18:20.326 --> 00:18:22.926
So, once I hit Prepare here

00:18:22.926 --> 00:18:25.646
device will get added to DEP and

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.816
after that it will erase itself

00:18:28.136 --> 00:18:29.566
which will take some time to

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.106
land on Setup Assistant.

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:34.176
So, for the sake of our time

00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:38.146
we'll use another device to go

00:18:38.146 --> 00:18:39.276
through Setup Assistant.

00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:41.406
This device is already added to

00:18:41.406 --> 00:18:42.766
DEP beforehand.

00:18:45.076 --> 00:18:48.666
So, let's hit Prepare and switch

00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:49.966
to the other device.

00:19:00.236 --> 00:19:00.556
All right.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.506
So, we have a new pane for

00:19:02.506 --> 00:19:04.136
Device Enrollment now it's

00:19:04.136 --> 00:19:06.616
called Remote Management, can

00:19:06.616 --> 00:19:07.986
see the details about what

00:19:07.986 --> 00:19:10.336
Remote Management does here and

00:19:10.446 --> 00:19:13.266
also, we can remove the device

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:15.816
from DEP by just clicking on

00:19:15.816 --> 00:19:17.316
Leave Remote Management button.

00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:20.746
This button will appear in the

00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:23.396
first 30 days of enrollments as

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:24.686
my colleague Bob said.

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:26.846
Once we hit that it will remove

00:19:26.846 --> 00:19:30.786
the device from DEP.

00:19:37.156 --> 00:19:40.706
Also, this button is there

00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:42.586
because we would like to protect

00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:45.916
our users, we don't want our

00:19:45.916 --> 00:19:47.816
users' devices to get added to

00:19:47.816 --> 00:19:50.186
DEP without their consent or

00:19:50.186 --> 00:19:50.916
accidentally.

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:54.036
So, let's apply the

00:19:54.036 --> 00:19:57.866
configuration by hitting Next

00:19:57.866 --> 00:20:00.196
and let's enter our secret

00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:02.976
credentials for the MDM server.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.356
And let's read the terms and

00:20:14.356 --> 00:20:16.436
conditions as I know every one

00:20:16.436 --> 00:20:16.976
of you do.

00:20:23.046 --> 00:20:25.106
And that's it device has the

00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:26.556
configuration that has been

00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:29.126
specified by the MDM server and

00:20:29.126 --> 00:20:32.416
it's been added to DEP just as

00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:34.406
if it was purchased from a

00:20:34.406 --> 00:20:35.716
supported sales channel.

00:20:36.666 --> 00:20:39.056
So regardless of how the device

00:20:39.056 --> 00:20:42.606
is purchased it can be added to

00:20:43.216 --> 00:20:43.716
DEP now.

00:20:43.716 --> 00:20:44.806
Now that I have enrolled my

00:20:44.806 --> 00:20:47.306
device I would like to invite my

00:20:47.306 --> 00:20:49.056
colleague Juan [inaudible] to

00:20:49.056 --> 00:20:51.146
stage to show you how this

00:20:51.146 --> 00:20:52.906
connects to Apple School Manager

00:20:52.906 --> 00:20:53.186
world.

00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:53.876
Thank you.

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:58.500
[ Applause ]

00:21:03.046 --> 00:21:03.646
>> Thank you Can.

00:21:04.446 --> 00:21:05.866
Hi, my name is Juan [inaudible]

00:21:05.866 --> 00:21:08.206
and I'm the UI Manager for Apple

00:21:08.206 --> 00:21:08.706
School.

00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:10.936
And today I'm really proud to

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.206
show you the latest version that

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:14.926
came out of preview on May 17.

00:21:16.136 --> 00:21:17.046
But for those that are not

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:18.306
familiar with Apple School what

00:21:18.306 --> 00:21:18.906
is Apple School?

00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:21.046
Apple School is your one

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:24.016
destination for your institution

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.806
to manage your devices,

00:21:26.186 --> 00:21:29.206
accounts, and content.

00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:33.326
So, these are some of the new

00:21:33.326 --> 00:21:34.856
features that came out in the

00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:35.816
latest release.

00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:37.956
We have a new streamlined user

00:21:37.956 --> 00:21:41.566
interface, the ability to create

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:43.566
up to five administrators and

00:21:43.566 --> 00:21:44.726
support for PowerSchool.

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:46.976
But nothing better than a demo

00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:49.236
to show you our new streamlined

00:21:49.236 --> 00:21:50.356
user interface.

00:21:50.356 --> 00:21:52.986
Today I'm going to be an

00:21:52.986 --> 00:21:55.576
administrator at my organization

00:21:56.016 --> 00:21:59.706
and I'm going to start talking

00:21:59.706 --> 00:22:02.636
to you guys about managing

00:22:03.306 --> 00:22:03.786
devices.

00:22:05.466 --> 00:22:08.016
Can just enrolled two devices to

00:22:08.016 --> 00:22:10.336
the DEP program and you can see

00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:12.066
the two devices up here on

00:22:12.066 --> 00:22:13.296
devices added by Apple

00:22:13.296 --> 00:22:14.166
Configurator 2.

00:22:15.276 --> 00:22:18.026
And we just realized that I

00:22:18.026 --> 00:22:19.546
should have assigned one of

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.756
those devices to this MDM server

00:22:22.446 --> 00:22:24.356
in a different location.

00:22:24.946 --> 00:22:27.766
So, let's do that.

00:22:28.356 --> 00:22:31.486
I'm going to search for my

00:22:31.486 --> 00:22:36.916
device, here is the last iPad

00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:38.446
that he added to the DEP

00:22:38.476 --> 00:22:38.826
program.

00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:40.396
And I'm just going to switch it

00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:41.906
to Abraham Lincoln Elementary,

00:22:43.056 --> 00:22:45.316
click Done and now I'm ready to

00:22:45.476 --> 00:22:47.546
wipe that device and the next

00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:49.226
time it boots up it's ready to

00:22:49.226 --> 00:22:51.376
start to be managed by his new

00:22:51.376 --> 00:22:52.266
MDM server.

00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:56.106
Now let's talk about managing

00:22:56.106 --> 00:22:56.876
your accounts.

00:22:57.436 --> 00:23:00.566
So, imagine the following

00:23:00.566 --> 00:23:02.336
scenario, it's the beginning of

00:23:02.336 --> 00:23:05.086
the school year in at Abraham

00:23:05.086 --> 00:23:07.266
Lincoln Elementary and we have a

00:23:07.326 --> 00:23:09.576
new group of students, of

00:23:09.626 --> 00:23:10.346
first-graders.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.406
So, we need to create new

00:23:13.406 --> 00:23:15.036
credentials for these students.

00:23:16.736 --> 00:23:17.826
So, let's do that.

00:23:18.056 --> 00:23:21.066
I'm going to navigate to

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.526
locations, here's my elementary

00:23:23.526 --> 00:23:26.436
school, now I want to see the

00:23:26.436 --> 00:23:27.666
accounts related to this school.

00:23:28.656 --> 00:23:30.946
Notice that my filtering UI is

00:23:30.946 --> 00:23:31.576
now visible.

00:23:32.086 --> 00:23:34.846
Now I just need to add a couple

00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:40.026
filters, I want my students and

00:23:40.076 --> 00:23:40.976
my first-graders.

00:23:41.506 --> 00:23:45.476
As you can tell, I've been

00:23:45.476 --> 00:23:47.336
changing -- the search results

00:23:47.336 --> 00:23:49.146
have changed and there's this

00:23:49.146 --> 00:23:50.366
first row that allows me to

00:23:50.366 --> 00:23:52.206
select all the students in this

00:23:52.206 --> 00:23:52.526
filter.

00:23:53.026 --> 00:23:57.116
On your right, you can see

00:23:57.276 --> 00:23:58.916
several different bulk actions

00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:00.486
that I can execute as an

00:24:00.486 --> 00:24:01.036
administrator.

00:24:02.856 --> 00:24:05.086
Now let's create a sign-in sheet

00:24:05.296 --> 00:24:06.056
for these students.

00:24:06.496 --> 00:24:08.036
You might be wondering why a

00:24:08.036 --> 00:24:09.906
sign-in sheet, well it turns out

00:24:09.906 --> 00:24:11.256
that most first-graders don't

00:24:11.256 --> 00:24:12.646
have a phone number or an e-mail

00:24:12.646 --> 00:24:15.656
address so we need this

00:24:15.656 --> 00:24:17.516
alternative method to distribute

00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:18.066
the credentials.

00:24:19.096 --> 00:24:19.666
So, let's do that.

00:24:20.086 --> 00:24:22.376
All right, I select Create, a

00:24:22.376 --> 00:24:25.716
create a downloadable PDF and

00:24:27.156 --> 00:24:28.646
CSV and this starts a process

00:24:28.646 --> 00:24:29.606
that we call Activity.

00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:32.746
An Activity it's a way to track

00:24:33.436 --> 00:24:34.876
background processes or

00:24:34.876 --> 00:24:35.976
long-running jobs.

00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:42.166
Now I just jump to the Activity

00:24:42.246 --> 00:24:46.276
path and you can see here the

00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:47.856
creation of the sign-in sheet.

00:24:48.406 --> 00:24:50.336
As you can tell, I've been very

00:24:50.336 --> 00:24:51.866
busy today, it's the first day

00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:54.546
of the school so I had to delete

00:24:54.546 --> 00:24:55.996
some accounts, create sign-I

00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:57.476
sheets for other students,

00:24:58.036 --> 00:24:59.426
change the password policy of

00:24:59.426 --> 00:25:02.276
some accounts, add new roles,

00:25:03.506 --> 00:25:05.296
and also I had some problems

00:25:05.296 --> 00:25:06.676
with some of the operations.

00:25:07.186 --> 00:25:09.476
This also allows us to be able

00:25:09.476 --> 00:25:12.476
to be able to notice any

00:25:12.476 --> 00:25:13.796
problems that we have to our

00:25:13.796 --> 00:25:15.136
process of administrating.

00:25:16.956 --> 00:25:18.826
Creating our new sign-in sheets

00:25:18.826 --> 00:25:19.516
is almost over.

00:25:19.786 --> 00:25:23.646
So, I'm just going to wait for a

00:25:23.646 --> 00:25:23.976
second.

00:25:28.066 --> 00:25:29.506
Now I'm ready to download that

00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:29.946
sign-in sheet.

00:25:30.866 --> 00:25:32.786
So, I wanted it in an 8-up PDF

00:25:32.786 --> 00:25:33.936
format because I want to save

00:25:33.936 --> 00:25:34.466
some paper.

00:25:40.046 --> 00:25:41.496
I download it and here is the

00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:42.686
sign-in sheet for my new

00:25:42.686 --> 00:25:42.976
students.

00:25:51.046 --> 00:25:51.726
So that was easy.

00:25:51.726 --> 00:25:53.946
Now let's talk about managing

00:25:53.946 --> 00:25:55.366
your content.

00:25:56.956 --> 00:25:58.936
Currently, I can navigate to

00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:01.336
Apps and Books and here I'm

00:26:01.336 --> 00:26:03.186
presented to a link that will

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:04.546
take me to the Volume Purchase

00:26:04.546 --> 00:26:04.946
Program.

00:26:06.326 --> 00:26:07.516
In the Volume Purchase Program

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:09.316
website, you will be able to

00:26:09.316 --> 00:26:11.646
purchase applications and iBooks

00:26:11.646 --> 00:26:12.176
in bulk.

00:26:12.776 --> 00:26:15.296
I'm really happy to announce

00:26:15.336 --> 00:26:19.076
today that we are working on

00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:20.676
integrating the Volume Purchase

00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:23.716
Program into Apple School and

00:26:23.716 --> 00:26:26.006
it's coming before the end of

00:26:27.216 --> 00:26:27.436
the year.

00:26:27.536 --> 00:26:28.566
Now let's look what it looks

00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:28.826
like.

00:26:30.616 --> 00:26:33.776
Here's a screenshot that is

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:35.816
showing you the inventory of

00:26:35.816 --> 00:26:38.366
applications of all devices that

00:26:38.366 --> 00:26:40.596
you have purchased for the Apple

00:26:40.596 --> 00:26:41.276
School district.

00:26:41.876 --> 00:26:42.746
You see the ones that are

00:26:42.746 --> 00:26:44.346
available, all the ones that are

00:26:44.346 --> 00:26:44.896
in use.

00:26:45.676 --> 00:26:48.196
And then in this next screen you

00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:49.256
are seeing that I'm trying to

00:26:49.256 --> 00:26:51.486
purchase an iBook, 50 licenses

00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:53.096
of it and assigning them to

00:26:53.096 --> 00:26:53.956
Covington Charter School.

00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:00.816
Now let's have Todd talk to you

00:27:00.816 --> 00:27:02.636
more about the details of this

00:27:02.636 --> 00:27:03.976
new distribution model.

00:27:04.516 --> 00:27:09.546
[ Applause ]

00:27:10.046 --> 00:27:11.446
>> Thank you very much Juan.

00:27:11.446 --> 00:27:12.546
As some of you may have noticed,

00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:13.786
we've now included the

00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:14.936
enrollment section and moved

00:27:14.936 --> 00:27:16.136
into distribution now that we're

00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:17.276
talking about volume purchase.

00:27:17.776 --> 00:27:19.926
However, I wanted to reiterate

00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:21.456
that the new Leave Remote

00:27:21.456 --> 00:27:22.666
Management button at the bottom

00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:24.006
of the new Remote Management

00:27:24.006 --> 00:27:26.506
pane in Setup Assistant only

00:27:26.506 --> 00:27:27.916
appears during that 30-day

00:27:27.916 --> 00:27:29.596
provisional period after adding

00:27:29.596 --> 00:27:30.896
devices to the Device Enrollment

00:27:30.896 --> 00:27:32.186
Program using the new feature

00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:33.006
that Can demoed.

00:27:33.476 --> 00:27:34.816
Devices that have been added by

00:27:34.816 --> 00:27:36.226
purchasing directly from Apple

00:27:36.506 --> 00:27:37.966
or through a reseller which

00:27:37.966 --> 00:27:39.276
supports the Device Enrollment

00:27:39.276 --> 00:27:40.956
Program there's no change and

00:27:40.956 --> 00:27:41.956
that button will not appear.

00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:47.756
So, we have a short agenda for

00:27:47.756 --> 00:27:49.076
distribution, but it's a really

00:27:49.076 --> 00:27:50.926
big topic upfront Volume

00:27:50.926 --> 00:27:51.896
Purchase Program fully

00:27:51.896 --> 00:27:52.986
integrated into Apple School

00:27:52.986 --> 00:27:53.466
Manager.

00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:55.156
And I will go into a bit more

00:27:55.156 --> 00:27:56.946
detail and cover a few

00:27:56.946 --> 00:27:59.876
additional features and a brief

00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:01.786
update about changes to

00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:03.356
installing apps and managing

00:28:03.356 --> 00:28:04.526
them on tvOS.

00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:07.926
So, Juan has already shown you

00:28:07.926 --> 00:28:09.616
the beautiful new updated UI in

00:28:09.616 --> 00:28:10.916
Apple School Manager which went

00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:12.656
live last month, as well as a

00:28:12.656 --> 00:28:14.776
sneak peek into how Volume

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:16.056
Purchase Program will look once

00:28:16.186 --> 00:28:18.466
it's integrated into it.

00:28:18.716 --> 00:28:19.816
We are also making it much

00:28:19.816 --> 00:28:20.986
easier to manage multiple

00:28:20.986 --> 00:28:22.886
locations, tokens, and licenses

00:28:22.886 --> 00:28:24.056
within an organization,

00:28:24.866 --> 00:28:26.596
including supporting

00:28:26.596 --> 00:28:28.056
transferring licenses between

00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:30.306
locations so that your content

00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:31.486
managers no longer will need to

00:28:31.486 --> 00:28:32.436
share credentials.

00:28:32.536 --> 00:28:34.956
All of this will be available

00:28:34.956 --> 00:28:36.856
very soon as Juan mentioned, but

00:28:36.856 --> 00:28:38.236
there is a bit of work for MDM

00:28:38.236 --> 00:28:39.986
vendors to do to support license

00:28:39.986 --> 00:28:41.406
transfer in particular, which

00:28:41.406 --> 00:28:42.366
again I'll cover today.

00:28:44.406 --> 00:28:45.866
So, for a long time we've heard

00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:47.406
some customer feedback around

00:28:47.606 --> 00:28:48.796
the difficulty in managing

00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:50.546
multiple VPP accounts so we

00:28:50.546 --> 00:28:52.276
wanted to make it much easier

00:28:52.276 --> 00:28:53.406
for schools to organize their

00:28:53.406 --> 00:28:54.966
purchases and manage them in an

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.686
intuitive way that matches their

00:28:56.686 --> 00:28:57.826
organizational structure.

00:28:59.386 --> 00:29:01.636
So, with these updates purchases

00:29:01.716 --> 00:29:02.846
are now associated with a

00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:04.326
location rather than the

00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:05.936
personal inventory of individual

00:29:05.936 --> 00:29:06.886
content managers.

00:29:08.006 --> 00:29:09.526
Multiple content managers can

00:29:09.526 --> 00:29:11.356
purchase apps and books for a

00:29:11.356 --> 00:29:14.056
single location and all licenses

00:29:14.056 --> 00:29:15.086
for that location will be

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.416
managed with a single token.

00:29:17.696 --> 00:29:19.206
So, there's no longer a need for

00:29:19.206 --> 00:29:20.676
a token per content manager.

00:29:21.096 --> 00:29:24.086
Each content manager through

00:29:24.086 --> 00:29:25.476
that token can then manage all

00:29:25.476 --> 00:29:26.946
licenses that are associated

00:29:26.946 --> 00:29:28.786
with that location, meaning that

00:29:28.786 --> 00:29:30.746
if a content manager leaves any

00:29:30.746 --> 00:29:31.916
other content manager can

00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:33.256
continue to manage all of those

00:29:33.256 --> 00:29:33.896
licenses.

00:29:36.186 --> 00:29:37.426
Just illustrate this with a

00:29:37.426 --> 00:29:38.526
simple animation.

00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:39.676
Now I have two different content

00:29:39.676 --> 00:29:40.906
managers each of them buying

00:29:40.906 --> 00:29:42.736
some apps and buying some books.

00:29:43.546 --> 00:29:44.966
There's a token that either one

00:29:44.966 --> 00:29:46.516
of those managers can download

00:29:46.656 --> 00:29:48.476
from the Volume Purchase Program

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:50.526
and upload to their MDM server

00:29:50.526 --> 00:29:52.096
to allow it to manage those

00:29:52.096 --> 00:29:54.026
licenses and assign them to

00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:55.136
users and devices.

00:29:57.016 --> 00:29:58.526
Another bit of feedback we've

00:29:58.526 --> 00:30:00.696
gotten is the request to be able

00:30:00.696 --> 00:30:02.176
to transfer licenses that were

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:04.866
purchased in one area to a

00:30:04.866 --> 00:30:05.676
different area.

00:30:06.046 --> 00:30:07.376
And so, we have now added

00:30:07.376 --> 00:30:08.566
support for transferring

00:30:08.566 --> 00:30:10.216
licenses between locations which

00:30:10.216 --> 00:30:12.346
are now tracked with a single

00:30:12.346 --> 00:30:12.806
token.

00:30:13.996 --> 00:30:15.456
Apple School Manager of course

00:30:15.456 --> 00:30:17.426
will show the accurate number of

00:30:17.426 --> 00:30:18.796
available licenses at each

00:30:18.796 --> 00:30:20.456
location as these transfers take

00:30:20.456 --> 00:30:20.926
place.

00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:23.546
Any licenses which are currently

00:30:23.546 --> 00:30:24.946
available and not assigned can

00:30:24.946 --> 00:30:26.226
be transferred at any time.

00:30:26.946 --> 00:30:27.876
But if they're licenses that are

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:29.416
already assigned to a user or

00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:30.866
device those can't be

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:32.106
transferred because of course,

00:30:32.156 --> 00:30:33.406
those users and devices are

00:30:33.406 --> 00:30:34.786
associated with that location as

00:30:34.786 --> 00:30:36.056
well and it would disrupt your

00:30:36.056 --> 00:30:36.616
deployment.

00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:38.406
So, if you do want to actually

00:30:38.406 --> 00:30:39.886
transfer those licenses you can

00:30:39.886 --> 00:30:41.456
revoke them, the current

00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:42.706
assignment, making them

00:30:42.706 --> 00:30:43.706
available for transfer.

00:30:44.216 --> 00:30:47.456
And simple animation we've got

00:30:47.456 --> 00:30:49.056
two locations each represented

00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:51.836
with its token to manage their

00:30:51.836 --> 00:30:53.106
apps and books and we can

00:30:53.106 --> 00:30:54.976
transfer apps from one location

00:30:55.126 --> 00:30:55.656
to the other.

00:30:57.136 --> 00:30:59.656
And each location continues to

00:30:59.806 --> 00:31:02.076
be managing those licenses, so

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:04.226
if location one is at one MDM

00:31:04.226 --> 00:31:06.466
server, location two another MDM

00:31:06.466 --> 00:31:07.926
server they can continue to

00:31:07.926 --> 00:31:09.866
manage the appropriate app and

00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:10.746
book licenses.

00:31:12.546 --> 00:31:14.306
Another sneak peek, this is what

00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:15.286
it will look like once it's

00:31:15.286 --> 00:31:16.216
integrated in Apple School

00:31:16.216 --> 00:31:18.166
Manager showing you for each app

00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:19.526
that you've purchased the

00:31:19.526 --> 00:31:22.386
licenses for each location and

00:31:22.386 --> 00:31:23.576
making it very easy to then

00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:25.076
select the location and transfer

00:31:25.076 --> 00:31:26.196
some of those licenses to

00:31:26.196 --> 00:31:26.546
another.

00:31:29.126 --> 00:31:30.666
So, now I'd like to highlight

00:31:30.666 --> 00:31:32.126
what we need and our MDM

00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:33.316
partners to do to support

00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:34.776
license transfer and these new

00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:35.236
features.

00:31:35.236 --> 00:31:37.296
So, the first is now that a

00:31:37.296 --> 00:31:39.106
location and token have a

00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:41.126
one-to-one relationship as

00:31:41.126 --> 00:31:42.536
tokens expire or otherwise

00:31:42.536 --> 00:31:43.726
become invalid it's going to be

00:31:43.726 --> 00:31:45.016
important to make it easy for

00:31:45.016 --> 00:31:46.616
admins to identify which token

00:31:46.616 --> 00:31:48.546
needs renewal by making clear

00:31:48.546 --> 00:31:49.866
which location this token is

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:50.156
for.

00:31:50.686 --> 00:31:52.186
And our API calls that you're

00:31:52.186 --> 00:31:54.576
already using to get information

00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:56.076
about the Volume Purchase

00:31:56.076 --> 00:31:57.576
Program have now been enhanced

00:31:57.576 --> 00:31:58.826
to provide that information to

00:31:58.826 --> 00:32:00.606
you so that you can update your

00:32:00.606 --> 00:32:01.336
UI appropriately.

00:32:03.326 --> 00:32:04.646
Now that multiple content

00:32:04.646 --> 00:32:06.166
managers can download the same

00:32:06.206 --> 00:32:08.366
token for a location you need to

00:32:08.366 --> 00:32:10.336
also be prepared for a content

00:32:10.336 --> 00:32:12.146
manager to inadvertently upload

00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:13.716
a duplicate token and handle

00:32:13.716 --> 00:32:14.926
that appropriately so that you

00:32:14.926 --> 00:32:16.286
don't duplicate the license

00:32:17.916 --> 00:32:18.256
count.

00:32:18.256 --> 00:32:20.136
Similarly, now licenses can be

00:32:20.136 --> 00:32:22.426
transferred outside of your MDM

00:32:22.546 --> 00:32:24.016
server's knowledge in Apple

00:32:24.016 --> 00:32:24.726
School Manager.

00:32:24.936 --> 00:32:26.276
So, you need to be prepared to

00:32:26.276 --> 00:32:27.796
refresh your license counts when

00:32:27.796 --> 00:32:28.776
you update your UI.

00:32:31.936 --> 00:32:34.186
Finally, when is this all

00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:34.476
coming?

00:32:34.476 --> 00:32:35.726
We're working hard on preparing

00:32:35.726 --> 00:32:37.066
the documentation update, as

00:32:37.066 --> 00:32:38.386
well as testing support which

00:32:38.386 --> 00:32:40.206
will be available soon and

00:32:40.206 --> 00:32:41.656
releasing later this summer so

00:32:41.656 --> 00:32:43.346
that you can help us and our

00:32:43.346 --> 00:32:44.776
joint customers in schools be

00:32:44.776 --> 00:32:45.856
ready for back-to-school

00:32:45.856 --> 00:32:46.316
deployment.

00:32:49.266 --> 00:32:50.916
That concludes our section on

00:32:51.086 --> 00:32:52.746
Volume Purchase Program and now

00:32:52.746 --> 00:32:54.006
I'd like to do a couple of

00:32:54.006 --> 00:32:55.186
updates on tvOS.

00:32:55.636 --> 00:32:57.116
It's now possible to install

00:32:57.116 --> 00:32:59.556
enterprise apps on tvOS, as well

00:32:59.556 --> 00:33:01.246
as manage them using Managed App

00:33:01.246 --> 00:33:02.076
Configuration.

00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:03.396
A great feature that we've had

00:33:03.396 --> 00:33:05.266
in iOS for a number of years is

00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:08.036
now available in tvOS as well to

00:33:08.036 --> 00:33:09.346
configure your apps after you

00:33:09.606 --> 00:33:10.166
deploy them.

00:33:11.836 --> 00:33:13.286
And that brings us to the end of

00:33:13.286 --> 00:33:14.866
our distribution section, so I'd

00:33:14.866 --> 00:33:16.146
like to ask Pradhap to come up

00:33:16.146 --> 00:33:17.316
on stage and take you through

00:33:17.316 --> 00:33:18.186
the management section.

00:33:18.606 --> 00:33:18.966
Pradhap.

00:33:19.516 --> 00:33:22.546
[ Applause ]

00:33:23.046 --> 00:33:23.446
>> Thank you Todd.

00:33:24.426 --> 00:33:25.896
Hello everyone, good afternoon.

00:33:26.476 --> 00:33:28.086
I'm very excited to be here to

00:33:28.086 --> 00:33:29.216
walk you through all the great

00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:30.736
management features that we

00:33:30.736 --> 00:33:32.436
added since we met the last

00:33:32.436 --> 00:33:32.626
year.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:34.826
First, let's get started with

00:33:35.606 --> 00:33:35.726
iOS.

00:33:36.716 --> 00:33:38.806
Preparing a large number of iOS

00:33:38.806 --> 00:33:40.476
devices, especially with a lot

00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:42.316
of apps and books using a Wi-Fi

00:33:42.316 --> 00:33:43.866
network has always been a

00:33:43.866 --> 00:33:44.446
challenge.

00:33:44.946 --> 00:33:46.216
It makes a Wi-Fi network

00:33:46.216 --> 00:33:47.946
unusable and more often,

00:33:47.946 --> 00:33:49.376
administrators had to set up a

00:33:49.376 --> 00:33:51.146
dedicated Wi-Fi network just for

00:33:51.146 --> 00:33:52.196
preparing devices.

00:33:52.806 --> 00:33:54.756
To solve this, we added a new

00:33:54.756 --> 00:33:56.516
option to all the MDM commands

00:33:57.006 --> 00:33:58.196
using which the administrator

00:33:58.196 --> 00:33:59.976
can specify that the device has

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:01.196
to be connected to a wired

00:34:01.196 --> 00:34:03.186
network like Internet sharing or

00:34:03.256 --> 00:34:05.626
USB or an ethernet connection to

00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:06.526
perform a command.

00:34:07.326 --> 00:34:09.176
This combined with content

00:34:09.176 --> 00:34:10.755
cashing on macOS is going to

00:34:10.755 --> 00:34:12.146
significantly improve the setup

00:34:12.146 --> 00:34:13.856
experience for iOS devices.

00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:18.686
MDM already has the ability to

00:34:18.686 --> 00:34:21.286
install software updates on DEP

00:34:21.286 --> 00:34:23.065
devices without a passcode.

00:34:23.735 --> 00:34:24.876
We improved that and added

00:34:24.876 --> 00:34:26.585
support for passcode lock

00:34:26.585 --> 00:34:29.755
devices and supervised non-DEP

00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:32.356
devices as well.

00:34:32.545 --> 00:34:34.565
We realize that in most cases

00:34:34.795 --> 00:34:35.985
when a device with an app or

00:34:36.096 --> 00:34:37.666
[inaudible] is erased the data

00:34:37.666 --> 00:34:38.996
plan shouldn't be erased as

00:34:38.996 --> 00:34:40.606
well, so we added an option to

00:34:40.606 --> 00:34:42.335
the erase device command to

00:34:42.335 --> 00:34:43.786
specify the data plan

00:34:43.786 --> 00:34:44.436
preference.

00:34:45.525 --> 00:34:47.156
Before I move on I would like to

00:34:47.156 --> 00:34:48.856
point out that the features that

00:34:48.856 --> 00:34:50.196
are marked with the new badge

00:34:50.676 --> 00:34:51.985
are new in the upcoming iOS

00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:53.346
releases that we announced in

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:55.326
[inaudible] this week and all

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:56.666
the other features [inaudible]

00:34:56.755 --> 00:34:57.616
earlier this year.

00:34:58.256 --> 00:35:00.316
And also, if you see a new badge

00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:01.526
on the upper right corner of the

00:35:01.526 --> 00:35:03.336
slide everything on that slide

00:35:04.156 --> 00:35:05.176
is new.

00:35:05.416 --> 00:35:07.186
Next, let's talk about Lost and

00:35:07.186 --> 00:35:07.486
Found.

00:35:08.796 --> 00:35:10.536
All the users love our devices,

00:35:10.536 --> 00:35:11.846
but sometimes they go missing.

00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:15.736
MDM already supports putting a

00:35:15.736 --> 00:35:17.496
device in loss mode and also

00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:19.096
query the location of the device

00:35:19.096 --> 00:35:20.426
when the device is in lost mode.

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:23.786
We also added support to play a

00:35:23.786 --> 00:35:25.296
sound when the device is in lost

00:35:25.296 --> 00:35:25.536
mode.

00:35:26.796 --> 00:35:28.346
And we updated the device

00:35:28.346 --> 00:35:30.306
location query to include all

00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:32.126
the location attributes that you

00:35:32.126 --> 00:35:33.546
would expect from a location

00:35:33.546 --> 00:35:33.826
APA.

00:35:34.286 --> 00:35:37.726
Like devices apps go missing as

00:35:37.726 --> 00:35:39.246
well, so we added a new

00:35:39.246 --> 00:35:41.556
restriction to prevent users

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.716
from deleting system apps

00:35:43.716 --> 00:35:45.366
accidentally on their device.

00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:47.576
This is especially great for

00:35:47.576 --> 00:35:49.606
shard use devices where the App

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:50.706
Store may be disabled.

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:55.426
We continuously add new features

00:35:55.426 --> 00:35:57.176
to help enterprises keep their

00:35:57.176 --> 00:35:57.956
data safe.

00:35:58.786 --> 00:36:00.586
Starting with iOS 10.3

00:36:00.586 --> 00:36:02.426
administrators can restrict the

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.716
list of Wi-Fi networks that the

00:36:03.716 --> 00:36:05.746
device can join to just the

00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:06.676
Wi-Fi networks that are

00:36:06.676 --> 00:36:08.426
configured by MDM or our

00:36:08.426 --> 00:36:09.776
configuration profiles.

00:36:10.606 --> 00:36:13.236
Thank you.

00:36:15.066 --> 00:36:16.846
And starting with iOS 11 the

00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:18.536
Wi-Fi restriction exempts

00:36:18.566 --> 00:36:19.596
carrier profiles.

00:36:20.836 --> 00:36:22.186
We recommend that you push the

00:36:22.186 --> 00:36:24.606
Wi-Fi restriction together or

00:36:24.666 --> 00:36:25.876
after the Wi-Fi payload,

00:36:26.206 --> 00:36:27.606
otherwise you run the risk of

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.566
devices losing connectivity to

00:36:31.216 --> 00:36:32.236
MDM server.

00:36:32.386 --> 00:36:33.896
We also added a new restriction

00:36:33.896 --> 00:36:35.826
to disable users from creating

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.616
their own VPN configurations.

00:36:39.456 --> 00:36:41.176
MDM already supports

00:36:41.176 --> 00:36:42.866
configuring, signing and

00:36:42.866 --> 00:36:44.286
encryption identities for

00:36:44.286 --> 00:36:45.796
exchange and mail, but there was

00:36:45.796 --> 00:36:47.916
only one global switch to turn

00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:49.436
both signing and encryption on

00:36:49.436 --> 00:36:49.816
or off.

00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:52.156
We improved that and added a new

00:36:52.156 --> 00:36:53.536
key so that you can control

00:36:53.536 --> 00:36:54.516
signing and encryption

00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:55.296
independently.

00:36:55.836 --> 00:36:59.696
We added three new restrictions

00:36:59.696 --> 00:37:01.486
to Classroom to make the

00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:04.106
expedience of unmanaged classes

00:37:04.106 --> 00:37:06.356
on supervised devices on par

00:37:06.356 --> 00:37:07.596
with managed classes.

00:37:08.136 --> 00:37:10.416
The first new restrictions

00:37:10.716 --> 00:37:12.346
enables an instructor to observe

00:37:12.346 --> 00:37:14.936
a student's screen and perform

00:37:14.936 --> 00:37:17.336
an app or a device log without

00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:19.156
prompting the students just like

00:37:19.156 --> 00:37:20.146
managed classes.

00:37:20.916 --> 00:37:22.406
And the last one causes the

00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:24.026
students to automatically join

00:37:24.026 --> 00:37:25.886
classes without prompting them

00:37:25.886 --> 00:37:27.056
every time.

00:37:28.656 --> 00:37:30.836
With iOS 11 we made a lot of

00:37:30.836 --> 00:37:31.996
improvements to the AirPrint

00:37:31.996 --> 00:37:32.406
payload.

00:37:33.196 --> 00:37:34.246
The AirPrint payload now

00:37:34.246 --> 00:37:36.676
supports configuring custom port

00:37:37.586 --> 00:37:39.836
and also specify whether TLS is

00:37:39.836 --> 00:37:41.336
required on a per app and

00:37:41.336 --> 00:37:42.476
destination basis.

00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:44.656
In addition to the improvements

00:37:44.656 --> 00:37:46.396
to the payload we also added

00:37:46.586 --> 00:37:48.136
four new restrictions to

00:37:48.136 --> 00:37:49.496
configure global AirPrint

00:37:49.496 --> 00:37:50.146
options.

00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:51.886
The first restriction can be

00:37:51.886 --> 00:37:53.996
used to disable iBeacon

00:37:53.996 --> 00:37:55.876
discovery of AirPrint printers.

00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:58.026
And the second one can be used

00:37:58.026 --> 00:37:59.796
to disable storage of AirPrint

00:37:59.796 --> 00:38:01.076
credentials in Keychain.

00:38:01.616 --> 00:38:06.676
You can also require TLS for all

00:38:06.676 --> 00:38:07.736
AirPrint connections on a

00:38:07.736 --> 00:38:08.296
device.

00:38:08.646 --> 00:38:10.306
And finally, you can disable

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:11.896
AirPrint completely on a device

00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:15.026
if you have to do so.

00:38:15.266 --> 00:38:17.016
As you may have heard earlier

00:38:17.016 --> 00:38:19.686
this week, iOS 11 supports a new

00:38:19.686 --> 00:38:21.726
extension using which apps can

00:38:21.726 --> 00:38:24.316
provide a DNS proxy and we added

00:38:24.316 --> 00:38:25.726
a payload just to configure

00:38:25.726 --> 00:38:26.076
that.

00:38:26.976 --> 00:38:28.656
The new DNS proxy extension

00:38:28.656 --> 00:38:30.266
payload can be used to configure

00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:32.366
the bundle ID of the extension

00:38:32.366 --> 00:38:34.316
that should be used as DNS proxy

00:38:34.696 --> 00:38:36.716
and also provide any custom

00:38:36.716 --> 00:38:38.236
configuration that the extension

00:38:38.376 --> 00:38:39.266
might need.

00:38:40.096 --> 00:38:42.016
The cellular payload now

00:38:42.016 --> 00:38:43.496
supports configuring Internet

00:38:43.526 --> 00:38:44.976
protocol versions for cellular

00:38:44.976 --> 00:38:45.666
connections.

00:38:46.206 --> 00:38:51.186
Like iOS we also added a lot of

00:38:51.186 --> 00:38:52.906
new features to macOS to improve

00:38:52.906 --> 00:38:54.156
the setup experience.

00:38:54.826 --> 00:38:56.646
The new system migration payload

00:38:56.816 --> 00:38:58.506
can be used to configure custom

00:38:58.506 --> 00:39:00.346
migration paths for migration

00:39:00.346 --> 00:39:01.976
from Windows to Mac.

00:39:03.546 --> 00:39:05.056
We also added a new payload to

00:39:05.056 --> 00:39:06.726
configure smart card options on

00:39:06.726 --> 00:39:06.866
Mac.

00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:09.296
This payload can be used to

00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:10.886
restrict one smart card per

00:39:10.886 --> 00:39:12.666
user, required trusted

00:39:13.066 --> 00:39:14.906
connections for smart card and

00:39:14.906 --> 00:39:16.976
also disable smart card usage on

00:39:17.686 --> 00:39:17.786
Mac.

00:39:18.596 --> 00:39:21.196
We improved the 802.1X payload

00:39:21.686 --> 00:39:23.306
adding the ability to provide a

00:39:23.416 --> 00:39:25.566
default configuration for ports

00:39:25.906 --> 00:39:27.206
that doesn't have an explicit

00:39:27.236 --> 00:39:27.996
configuration.

00:39:29.956 --> 00:39:32.206
Starting with macOS High Sierra

00:39:32.516 --> 00:39:33.946
administrators now have the

00:39:33.946 --> 00:39:35.616
ability to delay the software

00:39:35.616 --> 00:39:37.586
updates on a Mac for up to a

00:39:37.586 --> 00:39:39.086
maximum of 90 days.

00:39:41.096 --> 00:39:43.046
This is great for testing your

00:39:43.046 --> 00:39:44.836
software on the latest updates

00:39:45.096 --> 00:39:46.776
before users get their hands on

00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:46.996
them.

00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:49.566
We also updated the software

00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:51.786
update query to include a date

00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:53.296
until which a specific update

00:39:53.296 --> 00:39:54.056
will be deferred.

00:39:54.496 --> 00:39:59.216
Former passwords on macOS are

00:39:59.216 --> 00:40:01.566
equivalent to activation lock on

00:40:01.646 --> 00:40:01.976
iOS.

00:40:03.066 --> 00:40:04.666
Starting with macOS High Sierra

00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:06.356
the former passwords can be

00:40:06.356 --> 00:40:08.226
completely managed using an MDM

00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:08.636
server.

00:40:09.846 --> 00:40:11.426
Using the new commands the

00:40:11.426 --> 00:40:13.036
administrator can set a former

00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:15.166
password, query the status of

00:40:15.166 --> 00:40:17.036
the password change, and also

00:40:17.036 --> 00:40:18.346
verify that the password on the

00:40:18.346 --> 00:40:19.836
device is correct once the

00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:21.406
password change is in effect.

00:40:22.026 --> 00:40:22.286
Thank you.

00:40:24.236 --> 00:40:26.036
I would like to note that a

00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:27.456
reboot is required for the

00:40:27.456 --> 00:40:28.936
password change to take effect.

00:40:30.116 --> 00:40:31.776
We also brought over the user

00:40:31.776 --> 00:40:33.896
management commands from iOS to

00:40:33.896 --> 00:40:34.666
macOS.

00:40:35.076 --> 00:40:37.286
macOS now supports querying the

00:40:37.286 --> 00:40:38.816
list of local user accounts on

00:40:38.816 --> 00:40:40.526
the Mac and deleting user

00:40:40.526 --> 00:40:41.046
accounts.

00:40:41.566 --> 00:40:43.786
macOS also supports unlocking a

00:40:43.786 --> 00:40:44.976
locked-up user account on Mac.

00:40:50.046 --> 00:40:51.586
Extensions are a great way to

00:40:51.586 --> 00:40:53.276
add a lot of useful features on

00:40:53.276 --> 00:40:54.996
Mac, but we also realize that

00:40:54.996 --> 00:40:56.426
there is a need to manage this

00:40:56.426 --> 00:40:58.106
in an enterprise environment.

00:40:59.276 --> 00:41:00.396
So, the new extensions

00:41:00.396 --> 00:41:02.126
management payload can be used

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:04.056
to configure whitelist and

00:41:04.056 --> 00:41:05.606
blacklist of extensions that are

00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:06.876
allowed to run on a Mac.

00:41:07.526 --> 00:41:08.806
The payload also has the

00:41:08.806 --> 00:41:10.136
flexibility to configure

00:41:10.266 --> 00:41:12.346
blacklist and whitelist on a per

00:41:12.346 --> 00:41:13.796
extension bind basis.

00:41:14.216 --> 00:41:15.686
It can go even further and

00:41:15.686 --> 00:41:17.216
disable specific extension

00:41:17.216 --> 00:41:19.436
points or disable all extensions

00:41:19.436 --> 00:41:20.716
on Mac if you have to do so.

00:41:21.966 --> 00:41:23.546
Once the extensions are set up

00:41:23.546 --> 00:41:26.076
as they need to be the new

00:41:26.146 --> 00:41:27.916
active extensions query can be

00:41:27.916 --> 00:41:29.166
used to query the list of

00:41:29.166 --> 00:41:31.336
extensions that are in use on a

00:41:31.336 --> 00:41:32.396
per user basis.

00:41:34.616 --> 00:41:36.976
macOS already supports escrowing

00:41:36.976 --> 00:41:38.756
encrypted personal recovery keys

00:41:38.756 --> 00:41:40.946
to a custom server and starting

00:41:40.946 --> 00:41:42.376
with macOS High Sierra we

00:41:42.376 --> 00:41:43.766
followed that into MDM.

00:41:44.326 --> 00:41:46.176
The new escrow payload can be

00:41:46.176 --> 00:41:47.826
used to configure the private

00:41:47.826 --> 00:41:49.336
key using which personal

00:41:49.336 --> 00:41:50.836
recovery should be encrypted.

00:41:51.636 --> 00:41:53.596
And we also updated the security

00:41:53.596 --> 00:41:55.676
information query to retrieve

00:41:55.676 --> 00:41:58.186
the personal recovery key using

00:41:58.186 --> 00:42:00.016
an MDM server.

00:42:00.156 --> 00:42:01.706
We also added a new restriction

00:42:01.706 --> 00:42:03.916
to disable iCloud desktop and

00:42:03.916 --> 00:42:04.496
documents.

00:42:07.476 --> 00:42:10.046
We aggressively added a lot of

00:42:10.206 --> 00:42:12.396
features to tvOS this last year.

00:42:13.086 --> 00:42:14.586
We set ourselves a goal to

00:42:14.586 --> 00:42:15.716
provide a great set of

00:42:15.716 --> 00:42:17.946
expedience for Apple TVs without

00:42:17.946 --> 00:42:19.146
ever touching your remote.

00:42:20.776 --> 00:42:22.986
It is now possible to erase an

00:42:22.986 --> 00:42:24.296
Apple TV using Apple

00:42:24.296 --> 00:42:26.796
Configurator or MDM and enroll

00:42:26.796 --> 00:42:30.156
the Apple TV using DEP and Auto

00:42:30.156 --> 00:42:31.776
Advance like Bob talked about

00:42:31.776 --> 00:42:35.066
earlier, specify the name of the

00:42:35.066 --> 00:42:37.906
Apple TV, prevent the users from

00:42:37.906 --> 00:42:39.446
changing the name on the TV,

00:42:40.406 --> 00:42:42.566
configure allowed content

00:42:42.566 --> 00:42:44.486
restrictions, such as media

00:42:44.486 --> 00:42:47.716
ratings, specify the list of

00:42:47.716 --> 00:42:48.956
apps that are available on the

00:42:48.956 --> 00:42:51.576
TV, and also configure how the

00:42:51.576 --> 00:42:52.926
apps are laid out on the Home

00:42:52.926 --> 00:42:54.746
screen including folders.

00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:56.036
Isn't that great?

00:42:58.736 --> 00:42:59.006
Thank you.

00:43:01.836 --> 00:43:03.436
Apple TVs are great for

00:43:03.436 --> 00:43:05.166
conference rooms and classrooms.

00:43:05.566 --> 00:43:07.346
So, we built a new management

00:43:07.346 --> 00:43:09.216
feature to put Apple TV into a

00:43:09.216 --> 00:43:11.166
mode that we call Conference

00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:11.996
Room Display mode.

00:43:12.646 --> 00:43:14.356
When in this mode Apple TV can

00:43:14.356 --> 00:43:15.646
be configured to display a

00:43:15.776 --> 00:43:17.736
custom message onscreen and the

00:43:17.736 --> 00:43:19.836
only thing the users can do is

00:43:20.156 --> 00:43:21.466
to [inaudible] the TV to share

00:43:21.466 --> 00:43:22.336
their displays.

00:43:22.856 --> 00:43:25.266
We also added a new AirPlay

00:43:25.266 --> 00:43:27.006
Security payload using which

00:43:27.006 --> 00:43:28.566
administrators can configure the

00:43:28.656 --> 00:43:30.156
type of the security requirement

00:43:30.156 --> 00:43:30.796
for AirPlay.

00:43:31.586 --> 00:43:32.566
This can be one of three

00:43:32.566 --> 00:43:34.936
options, one-time possible, a

00:43:34.936 --> 00:43:37.026
passcode every time or even a

00:43:37.026 --> 00:43:38.726
custom password which can be

00:43:38.726 --> 00:43:40.126
configured using the payload.

00:43:41.116 --> 00:43:42.936
We believe this combined with

00:43:43.376 --> 00:43:45.536
AirPlay payload on iOS and macOS

00:43:45.866 --> 00:43:47.086
gives the administrators the

00:43:47.086 --> 00:43:49.756
ability to configure AirPlay

00:43:49.756 --> 00:43:50.896
with the greatest security

00:43:50.896 --> 00:43:53.206
possible and ease-of-use.

00:43:53.676 --> 00:43:56.816
Apple TVs are also great for

00:43:56.816 --> 00:43:59.586
kiosks and dashboards, so we

00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:01.026
brought over the single app mode

00:44:01.026 --> 00:44:03.356
from iOS to tvOS and as you

00:44:03.356 --> 00:44:05.356
would expect, this payload can

00:44:05.356 --> 00:44:07.326
be used to log a TV to a single

00:44:07.326 --> 00:44:07.556
app.

00:44:08.146 --> 00:44:09.526
To go along with this, we also

00:44:09.526 --> 00:44:12.026
added two new restrictions, one

00:44:12.026 --> 00:44:14.496
to disable users from pairing

00:44:14.496 --> 00:44:15.906
the remote app on their iOS

00:44:15.906 --> 00:44:18.286
devices with a TV and the next

00:44:18.286 --> 00:44:22.426
one to disable AirPlay on a TV.

00:44:22.586 --> 00:44:24.046
Next, let's talk about some of

00:44:24.046 --> 00:44:25.026
the features that are shared

00:44:25.026 --> 00:44:26.526
across all the platforms.

00:44:28.486 --> 00:44:32.476
VPN IKEv2 and Wi-Fi payloads now

00:44:32.476 --> 00:44:34.136
support configuring minimum and

00:44:34.136 --> 00:44:35.766
maximum TLS versions.

00:44:36.626 --> 00:44:38.486
The install application list is

00:44:38.486 --> 00:44:39.756
now consistent on all three

00:44:39.756 --> 00:44:42.276
platforms and accurately reports

00:44:42.276 --> 00:44:43.246
whether an app is being

00:44:43.246 --> 00:44:44.496
installed or updated.

00:44:47.836 --> 00:44:50.706
We now support Restart on iOS,

00:44:50.706 --> 00:44:53.686
tvOS and macOS and Shut down on

00:44:53.736 --> 00:44:57.146
iOS and macOS.

00:44:57.266 --> 00:44:58.866
We already have a great support

00:44:58.866 --> 00:45:00.126
for test taking apps with

00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:01.226
automatic assessment

00:45:01.226 --> 00:45:02.046
configuration.

00:45:03.376 --> 00:45:04.426
I'm happy to announce the

00:45:04.426 --> 00:45:05.466
automatic assessment

00:45:05.466 --> 00:45:07.146
configuration now includes five

00:45:07.146 --> 00:45:09.306
new restrictions without you

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:10.846
having to make any changes.

00:45:11.296 --> 00:45:13.416
Activity continuation, universal

00:45:13.416 --> 00:45:16.656
clipboard, dictation and in the

00:45:16.656 --> 00:45:18.006
upcoming release smart

00:45:18.006 --> 00:45:19.436
punctuation, and classrooms

00:45:19.436 --> 00:45:20.316
screen observation.

00:45:23.076 --> 00:45:24.176
These are the set of

00:45:24.176 --> 00:45:26.436
restrictions that existed even

00:45:26.436 --> 00:45:27.996
before supervision was a thing.

00:45:28.296 --> 00:45:31.176
And Todd has been warning you

00:45:31.176 --> 00:45:32.986
for the past two years that

00:45:32.986 --> 00:45:33.826
these are going to become

00:45:33.826 --> 00:45:35.536
supervised only and I get to

00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:36.976
tell you when.

00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:40.096
Starting 2018 these restrictions

00:45:40.096 --> 00:45:41.426
will become supervised only.

00:45:42.056 --> 00:45:43.816
With that, please welcome my

00:45:43.816 --> 00:45:45.706
colleagues, Graham and John on

00:45:45.706 --> 00:45:47.306
stage to demo some of the

00:45:47.306 --> 00:45:48.346
features that I've been talking

00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:48.576
about.

00:45:48.736 --> 00:45:48.976
Thank you.

00:45:49.516 --> 00:45:52.586
[ Applause ]

00:45:53.086 --> 00:45:54.166
>> Thank you very much Pradhap.

00:45:54.166 --> 00:45:55.176
I'm really excited to be here

00:45:55.176 --> 00:45:56.226
today to show you guys the

00:45:56.226 --> 00:45:57.566
latest management features for

00:45:57.566 --> 00:45:58.306
Apple TV.

00:45:58.976 --> 00:46:01.576
In tvOS 10.2, we added a ton of

00:46:01.576 --> 00:46:02.856
great new features for managing

00:46:02.856 --> 00:46:05.776
Apple TVs and today with tvOS 11

00:46:05.946 --> 00:46:07.176
we're expanding on that feature

00:46:07.176 --> 00:46:07.586
set.

00:46:08.036 --> 00:46:09.256
While our Apple TV is currently

00:46:09.256 --> 00:46:11.216
booting so let's set the scene.

00:46:11.546 --> 00:46:12.736
It's summer vacation and you've

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:13.776
just received your order of

00:46:13.776 --> 00:46:15.356
Apple TVs and it's time to get

00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:16.626
them configured for the upcoming

00:46:16.626 --> 00:46:17.266
school year.

00:46:18.106 --> 00:46:19.486
I've already set up a default

00:46:19.486 --> 00:46:21.276
MDM server in Apple School

00:46:21.276 --> 00:46:22.816
Manager so my devices have

00:46:22.816 --> 00:46:24.306
already appeared in my MDM

00:46:24.306 --> 00:46:24.726
server.

00:46:25.666 --> 00:46:26.816
I've also gone ahead and

00:46:26.816 --> 00:46:27.686
configured the enrollment

00:46:27.686 --> 00:46:28.676
options that I'll want for

00:46:28.676 --> 00:46:30.576
today's demo, including the auto

00:46:30.576 --> 00:46:32.506
advance key and nonremovable

00:46:32.506 --> 00:46:33.066
MDM.

00:46:33.466 --> 00:46:35.126
I've also added the device to a

00:46:35.126 --> 00:46:36.506
group that contains some of the

00:46:36.506 --> 00:46:37.486
settings that we're going to use

00:46:37.486 --> 00:46:38.126
today as well.

00:46:38.596 --> 00:46:39.546
Those include a Home screen

00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:41.186
layout payload, we've hidden

00:46:41.186 --> 00:46:42.156
some of the default system

00:46:42.156 --> 00:46:44.286
applications and installed some

00:46:44.286 --> 00:46:45.106
enterprise apps.

00:46:45.566 --> 00:46:46.846
So, it looks like we're still

00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:48.456
booting up here so let's talk

00:46:48.456 --> 00:46:49.926
about what's going on behind the

00:46:49.926 --> 00:46:50.456
scenes.

00:46:51.216 --> 00:46:52.266
Once the device reaches the

00:46:52.266 --> 00:46:53.766
setup screen it will begin its

00:46:53.766 --> 00:46:55.056
activation process if it's

00:46:55.056 --> 00:46:55.986
connected to ethernet.

00:46:56.976 --> 00:46:58.226
The device will check in with

00:46:58.226 --> 00:46:59.456
the activation server and if

00:46:59.456 --> 00:47:00.396
it's enrolled in the Device

00:47:00.396 --> 00:47:01.796
Enrollment Program it will

00:47:01.796 --> 00:47:03.256
download the cloud configuration

00:47:03.256 --> 00:47:05.146
file and look for that auto

00:47:05.146 --> 00:47:05.846
advance key.

00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:07.996
If the auto advance key is found

00:47:08.316 --> 00:47:09.536
the device will begin its setup

00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:11.986
process and enroll in MDM.

00:47:12.446 --> 00:47:13.856
So, it looks like we've just got

00:47:13.856 --> 00:47:14.976
another couple of seconds here

00:47:14.976 --> 00:47:16.236
before this reaches the screen.

00:47:16.506 --> 00:47:17.406
So, I hope everyone's having a

00:47:17.406 --> 00:47:18.766
fantastic conference so far,

00:47:19.266 --> 00:47:19.916
woohoo.

00:47:20.936 --> 00:47:22.626
So, we can see that our Home

00:47:22.626 --> 00:47:23.536
screen layout payload has been

00:47:23.536 --> 00:47:25.296
applied so we've got some of our

00:47:25.296 --> 00:47:26.136
default apps they're in a

00:47:26.136 --> 00:47:27.696
folder, most of the default

00:47:27.696 --> 00:47:28.886
system applications have been

00:47:28.886 --> 00:47:31.076
hidden, and we've got some

00:47:31.076 --> 00:47:31.956
enterprise apps that have been

00:47:31.956 --> 00:47:32.366
installed.

00:47:32.366 --> 00:47:34.106
So, now that we're ready to go

00:47:34.426 --> 00:47:35.746
let's take a look at the new

00:47:35.746 --> 00:47:37.046
single app mode payload.

00:47:37.676 --> 00:47:38.726
We'll go ahead and launch one of

00:47:38.726 --> 00:47:39.656
our enterprise apps in the

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:40.496
single app mode.

00:47:40.896 --> 00:47:42.146
For today's demo, we've got a

00:47:42.246 --> 00:47:43.576
foreign currency exchange app

00:47:43.576 --> 00:47:44.796
that shows us the exchange rate

00:47:44.796 --> 00:47:46.766
for the US dollar in various

00:47:46.766 --> 00:47:47.926
currencies around the world.

00:47:48.896 --> 00:47:49.706
It looks like the Canadian

00:47:49.706 --> 00:47:50.936
dollar is doing pretty great

00:47:51.566 --> 00:47:52.046
today.

00:47:52.986 --> 00:47:53.616
Yeah, Canada.

00:47:53.696 --> 00:47:56.126
All right, but now let's say

00:47:56.126 --> 00:47:57.776
that we're managing Apple TVs in

00:47:57.776 --> 00:47:58.736
different countries around the

00:47:58.736 --> 00:48:00.266
world, they'll likely want to

00:48:00.266 --> 00:48:01.266
see that exchange rate in their

00:48:01.266 --> 00:48:02.096
local currency.

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:03.916
So, let's go ahead and install a

00:48:03.916 --> 00:48:05.626
managed app configuration and

00:48:05.626 --> 00:48:06.376
see what happens.

00:48:06.996 --> 00:48:08.866
Now you'll notice that we're in

00:48:08.866 --> 00:48:09.986
Canadian dollars for our base

00:48:09.986 --> 00:48:10.976
currency, pretty cool hey?

00:48:11.516 --> 00:48:15.586
[ Applause ]

00:48:16.086 --> 00:48:17.456
All right, next let's take a

00:48:17.456 --> 00:48:18.416
look at the conference room

00:48:18.416 --> 00:48:19.476
display mode payload.

00:48:20.046 --> 00:48:21.316
So, perhaps this Apple TV is

00:48:21.316 --> 00:48:22.626
being used in a conference room

00:48:23.136 --> 00:48:24.526
where we're doing presentations

00:48:24.526 --> 00:48:25.466
on a regular basis.

00:48:25.766 --> 00:48:27.096
We can now remotely place the

00:48:27.096 --> 00:48:28.206
Apple TV in conference room

00:48:28.206 --> 00:48:29.646
display mode and as you can see,

00:48:29.646 --> 00:48:30.866
we can add a custom message for

00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:31.316
our users.

00:48:31.586 --> 00:48:34.126
Hello WWDC 2017, wooo.

00:48:37.046 --> 00:48:38.376
You'll notice that the

00:48:38.376 --> 00:48:39.896
conference room display mode has

00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:41.486
integrated seamlessly with

00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:43.736
single app mode payload, meaning

00:48:43.736 --> 00:48:45.006
that we can [inaudible] a room

00:48:45.006 --> 00:48:46.466
at any given time with either

00:48:46.466 --> 00:48:46.956
payload.

00:48:47.906 --> 00:48:49.506
Finally, let's take a look at

00:48:49.506 --> 00:48:50.886
the AirPlay security payload

00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:52.446
that we added in tvOS 11.

00:48:53.206 --> 00:48:54.886
We've got an iPad here running

00:48:55.136 --> 00:48:56.936
iOS, so we're going to go ahead

00:48:56.936 --> 00:48:58.336
and start an AirPlay session

00:48:58.446 --> 00:48:59.376
with this Apple TV.

00:49:00.086 --> 00:49:01.026
You'll notice that we are

00:49:01.026 --> 00:49:02.206
prompted for the password that

00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:03.636
we defined in the AirPlay

00:49:03.636 --> 00:49:04.686
security payload.

00:49:05.076 --> 00:49:06.376
While this is fantastic from a

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:08.386
security perspective it's not as

00:49:08.386 --> 00:49:09.916
easy as we'd like for our users.

00:49:10.716 --> 00:49:12.576
So now we've got a second iPad

00:49:12.576 --> 00:49:13.566
here that's got the AirPlay

00:49:13.566 --> 00:49:15.516
security or the AirPlay payload

00:49:15.516 --> 00:49:17.256
installed on it so let's see how

00:49:17.256 --> 00:49:18.506
much easier we can make this for

00:49:18.506 --> 00:49:19.046
our users.

00:49:19.766 --> 00:49:21.166
So, now when we start our

00:49:21.166 --> 00:49:22.856
AirPlay session you'll notice

00:49:22.856 --> 00:49:24.396
that this is the only Apple TV

00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:26.196
that we can AirPlay to and we

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.056
weren't prompted for the

00:49:27.056 --> 00:49:27.606
password.

00:49:28.156 --> 00:49:29.196
This makes for a seamless

00:49:29.196 --> 00:49:30.556
experience for our users, it is

00:49:30.556 --> 00:49:31.976
also very secure for our

00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:32.706
institution.

00:49:33.146 --> 00:49:34.426
And with that, I'd like to thank

00:49:34.426 --> 00:49:35.396
you very much for your time

00:49:35.396 --> 00:49:36.676
today and I'll turn the stage

00:49:36.676 --> 00:49:37.486
back over to Todd.

00:49:37.786 --> 00:49:41.346
>> Thanks Todd.

00:49:44.066 --> 00:49:45.036
Thank you very much Graham and

00:49:45.036 --> 00:49:45.326
Todd.

00:49:47.956 --> 00:49:50.536
So, one reason we're so excited

00:49:50.536 --> 00:49:52.366
about all these new features is

00:49:52.536 --> 00:49:53.866
what some of you have already

00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:55.286
done with them and we want to

00:49:55.286 --> 00:49:56.646
just make it even easier for you

00:49:56.646 --> 00:49:58.746
to do those things better and we

00:49:58.746 --> 00:50:00.156
can't wait to see what you can

00:50:00.156 --> 00:50:00.906
come up with next.

00:50:01.236 --> 00:50:02.696
I want to highlight one example

00:50:02.696 --> 00:50:04.576
that UC San Diego did at their

00:50:04.576 --> 00:50:06.436
new Jacobs Medical Center where

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:08.176
they provide each patient when

00:50:08.176 --> 00:50:09.356
they enter the hospital with an

00:50:09.566 --> 00:50:11.986
iPad in their hospital room that

00:50:11.986 --> 00:50:12.966
they can use to monitor their

00:50:12.966 --> 00:50:14.876
care, as well as manage the

00:50:14.876 --> 00:50:16.036
entertainment options in the

00:50:16.036 --> 00:50:17.956
room on Apple TV.

00:50:19.176 --> 00:50:20.816
Now with that last feature that

00:50:20.816 --> 00:50:22.716
Graham just showed they can

00:50:22.716 --> 00:50:24.646
securely connect pairs of

00:50:24.826 --> 00:50:26.946
patient iPad and Apple TV so the

00:50:26.946 --> 00:50:28.256
patient can't inadvertently

00:50:28.256 --> 00:50:29.366
interfere with the patient in

00:50:29.366 --> 00:50:30.066
the next room.

00:50:30.656 --> 00:50:32.066
We're so excited about

00:50:32.066 --> 00:50:33.416
deployments like these that can

00:50:33.416 --> 00:50:35.066
really improve people's lives by

00:50:35.066 --> 00:50:36.456
giving them more control over

00:50:36.456 --> 00:50:37.716
their experience in a hospital

00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:39.106
and we can't wait to see what

00:50:39.106 --> 00:50:40.076
else you can do with them.

00:50:40.846 --> 00:50:42.046
So that concludes our management

00:50:42.046 --> 00:50:42.506
section.

00:50:43.216 --> 00:50:44.686
So, let's turn to a quick update

00:50:44.686 --> 00:50:45.986
on Apple's device management

00:50:45.986 --> 00:50:46.386
tools.

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:49.916
Of course, Apple Configurator

00:50:49.916 --> 00:50:51.336
and Profile Manager which we've

00:50:51.336 --> 00:50:53.086
updated this in seeds this week

00:50:53.306 --> 00:50:54.796
support all these new features.

00:50:55.406 --> 00:50:56.556
And I'm going to talk a bit in

00:50:56.556 --> 00:50:57.416
more detail about those

00:50:57.416 --> 00:50:58.956
classroom and content caching in

00:50:58.956 --> 00:50:59.386
a moment.

00:51:00.006 --> 00:51:01.336
But I also wanted to mention

00:51:01.336 --> 00:51:02.486
that we have created a new

00:51:02.486 --> 00:51:04.386
roster simulator as a complement

00:51:04.386 --> 00:51:06.446
to our existing DEP and VPP

00:51:06.446 --> 00:51:08.786
simulators that help MDM vendors

00:51:08.786 --> 00:51:10.686
test their implementation of our

00:51:10.686 --> 00:51:12.866
APIs for our deployment

00:51:12.866 --> 00:51:13.396
services.

00:51:13.866 --> 00:51:15.066
The roster simulator will allow

00:51:15.066 --> 00:51:16.436
you to do that for Apple School

00:51:16.436 --> 00:51:18.226
Manager's APIs for obtaining

00:51:18.726 --> 00:51:20.846
accounts and class information.

00:51:21.436 --> 00:51:22.886
So, we will be posting those

00:51:22.886 --> 00:51:25.026
very soon, we encourage you to

00:51:25.076 --> 00:51:26.466
download the roster simulator

00:51:26.466 --> 00:51:27.806
and the updated versions of the

00:51:27.806 --> 00:51:29.946
DEP and VPP simulators to make

00:51:29.946 --> 00:51:31.296
sure that your MDM solutions

00:51:31.586 --> 00:51:32.696
integrate really well with our

00:51:32.696 --> 00:51:33.716
deployment services.

00:51:35.126 --> 00:51:36.356
So, this spring we shipped

00:51:36.356 --> 00:51:39.176
Classroom 2 which had a really

00:51:39.276 --> 00:51:40.766
critical new feature to make the

00:51:40.766 --> 00:51:42.326
audience much wider and allowing

00:51:42.326 --> 00:51:43.396
teachers to create their own

00:51:43.396 --> 00:51:44.106
classes.

00:51:44.796 --> 00:51:46.126
We also now allow teachers and

00:51:46.126 --> 00:51:47.556
students to share documents and

00:51:47.556 --> 00:51:48.456
URLs with each other.

00:51:49.326 --> 00:51:51.336
And of particular importance

00:51:51.336 --> 00:51:52.546
when the teacher needs a bit of

00:51:52.546 --> 00:51:54.996
peace and quiet feature can now

00:51:54.996 --> 00:51:56.176
mute the student devices.

00:51:57.456 --> 00:51:59.396
Earlier this week we released or

00:51:59.396 --> 00:52:02.286
we seeded Classroom 2.1 which as

00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:03.546
Pradhap mentioned already, we've

00:52:03.546 --> 00:52:04.866
introduced a handful of new

00:52:04.866 --> 00:52:06.216
restrictions for supervised

00:52:06.216 --> 00:52:08.526
devices that allow schools which

00:52:08.626 --> 00:52:10.226
want to use teacher created

00:52:10.226 --> 00:52:11.726
classes on their supervised

00:52:11.726 --> 00:52:13.756
student iPads to achieve most of

00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:15.446
the behavior of managed classes.

00:52:16.676 --> 00:52:18.046
And we've also added a new

00:52:18.046 --> 00:52:19.386
student activity view that

00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:20.766
appears at the end of each class

00:52:20.766 --> 00:52:22.816
session and it looks like this.

00:52:23.456 --> 00:52:24.776
So, the teacher can get a quick

00:52:24.956 --> 00:52:26.176
overview of which apps her

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:28.866
students used and most often.

00:52:29.566 --> 00:52:31.276
Can easily see which app each

00:52:31.276 --> 00:52:32.246
student used and when.

00:52:33.716 --> 00:52:35.676
Can look at any documents or

00:52:35.676 --> 00:52:37.236
URLs the students shared during

00:52:37.236 --> 00:52:38.066
the class session.

00:52:39.506 --> 00:52:41.146
And also drill into each student

00:52:41.146 --> 00:52:42.406
to see which apps that student

00:52:42.406 --> 00:52:43.096
used and when.

00:52:43.896 --> 00:52:47.086
So that's Classroom 2.1, try it

00:52:47.086 --> 00:52:47.296
out.

00:52:47.766 --> 00:52:49.246
Next, content caching.

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:51.136
Now the caching server has been

00:52:51.136 --> 00:52:53.166
an important feature for schools

00:52:53.166 --> 00:52:54.816
and businesses to optimize their

00:52:54.816 --> 00:52:57.026
download bandwidth usage and

00:52:57.026 --> 00:52:58.246
it's been part of macOS server

00:52:58.246 --> 00:52:59.906
for years so why do I have a new

00:52:59.906 --> 00:53:00.626
badge up there?

00:53:01.046 --> 00:53:02.366
Well that's because it's now

00:53:02.366 --> 00:53:03.766
built right into macOS High

00:53:03.766 --> 00:53:05.706
Sierra making it much easier for

00:53:05.706 --> 00:53:07.556
it to be used even more commonly

00:53:07.556 --> 00:53:08.606
in schools and businesses.

00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:12.536
We also now have UI for the

00:53:12.536 --> 00:53:13.836
caching server and the new

00:53:13.836 --> 00:53:15.226
tether caching service that we

00:53:15.226 --> 00:53:16.786
soft launched earlier this

00:53:16.786 --> 00:53:19.456
spring in macOS 10.12.4 so that

00:53:19.456 --> 00:53:20.766
it would be available in time

00:53:20.766 --> 00:53:21.836
for summer's preparations for

00:53:21.836 --> 00:53:22.606
the next school year.

00:53:23.036 --> 00:53:24.336
But instead of talking about it

00:53:24.336 --> 00:53:25.626
more I would love to have Nolan

00:53:25.626 --> 00:53:26.786
Astron [phonetic] to come up and

00:53:26.826 --> 00:53:27.706
demo it to you.

00:53:27.826 --> 00:53:27.976
Nolan.

00:53:28.516 --> 00:53:33.026
[ Applause ]

00:53:33.526 --> 00:53:36.106
>> I'm Nolan Astron, I'm a

00:53:36.106 --> 00:53:38.806
software engineer at Apple and

00:53:38.806 --> 00:53:41.276
today I'm going to demo for you

00:53:41.536 --> 00:53:42.286
tethered caching.

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:45.076
Tethered caching has three main

00:53:45.076 --> 00:53:46.596
pieces to it.

00:53:46.706 --> 00:53:48.116
It provides a wired Internet

00:53:48.116 --> 00:53:49.336
connection to all the USB

00:53:49.336 --> 00:53:51.246
connected iOS devices, it

00:53:51.246 --> 00:53:52.976
instantiates the content caching

00:53:52.976 --> 00:53:54.476
service on the Mac, and it

00:53:54.476 --> 00:53:56.266
funnels all the network traffic

00:53:56.546 --> 00:53:57.736
of those tethered devices

00:53:57.926 --> 00:53:59.236
through the content caching

00:53:59.276 --> 00:54:00.466
service when downloading

00:54:00.466 --> 00:54:01.716
cachable Apple content.

00:54:03.036 --> 00:54:04.356
To enable this feature, you're

00:54:04.356 --> 00:54:06.156
going to want to pop into the

00:54:06.156 --> 00:54:07.706
sharing pane of System

00:54:07.706 --> 00:54:08.966
Preferences and you're going to

00:54:08.966 --> 00:54:10.556
want to have the Share Internet

00:54:10.556 --> 00:54:12.806
Connection checkbox checked and

00:54:12.806 --> 00:54:14.666
the Content Caching checkbox

00:54:14.666 --> 00:54:15.976
checked just like I do here.

00:54:16.516 --> 00:54:20.606
[ Applause ]

00:54:21.106 --> 00:54:22.066
Those iOS devices they can be

00:54:22.066 --> 00:54:25.016
plugged in at any time, but this

00:54:25.016 --> 00:54:26.476
feature really shines when those

00:54:26.646 --> 00:54:28.826
iOS devices are enrolled in MDM.

00:54:29.246 --> 00:54:30.916
When an MDM enrolled iOS device

00:54:30.916 --> 00:54:32.366
becomes tethered it

00:54:32.366 --> 00:54:33.946
automatically checks in with its

00:54:33.946 --> 00:54:35.826
MDM server and sees if it has

00:54:35.826 --> 00:54:37.036
any commands to process.

00:54:37.226 --> 00:54:39.876
If a particular command requires

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:41.666
the network it's going to use

00:54:41.666 --> 00:54:43.296
its USB interface instead of its

00:54:43.296 --> 00:54:45.996
Wi-Fi interface when leveraging

00:54:47.676 --> 00:54:48.486
the network.

00:54:48.636 --> 00:54:50.916
This feature is extremely useful

00:54:51.066 --> 00:54:52.536
when provisioning a large number

00:54:52.536 --> 00:54:54.686
of iOS devices with overlapping

00:54:54.686 --> 00:54:56.056
cachable Apple content.

00:54:56.796 --> 00:54:59.286
All right, so in front of me I

00:54:59.286 --> 00:55:01.526
have four iPads hooked up to a

00:55:01.526 --> 00:55:02.776
tethered caching station.

00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:04.546
Eventually I'm going to download

00:55:04.546 --> 00:55:06.536
the same app to each one of the

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:07.156
devices.

00:55:08.256 --> 00:55:09.836
But while I do the download I'm

00:55:10.036 --> 00:55:11.096
going to show you a little tool

00:55:11.096 --> 00:55:12.206
that I built that's going to

00:55:12.206 --> 00:55:14.546
monitor the network activity of

00:55:14.546 --> 00:55:16.236
the Mac's Wi-Fi interface and of

00:55:16.236 --> 00:55:18.106
the Mac's USB network

00:55:18.106 --> 00:55:18.746
interfaces.

00:55:18.746 --> 00:55:20.276
On the left-hand side, you'll

00:55:20.306 --> 00:55:22.246
see a meter for Wi-Fi and on the

00:55:22.246 --> 00:55:24.006
right-hand side, you will see a

00:55:24.006 --> 00:55:25.566
meter for USB network activity.

00:55:26.276 --> 00:55:27.626
So right now, I'm going to

00:55:27.626 --> 00:55:29.656
download the app to the first

00:55:29.656 --> 00:55:29.976
device.

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:38.756
You'll see that both the Wi-Fi

00:55:38.756 --> 00:55:40.766
and USB network activity are

00:55:40.766 --> 00:55:42.916
required to process that

00:55:42.916 --> 00:55:43.686
download command.

00:55:43.686 --> 00:55:45.346
The Mac needs to download the

00:55:45.346 --> 00:55:46.666
asset from the Internet and it

00:55:46.666 --> 00:55:48.116
needs to push it to the device

00:55:48.436 --> 00:55:49.116
over USB.

00:55:49.616 --> 00:55:51.036
All right, cool.

00:55:51.036 --> 00:55:52.826
Well now that the app is cached

00:55:52.826 --> 00:55:54.296
I'm going to download the same

00:55:54.296 --> 00:55:55.536
app to the remaining three

00:55:55.536 --> 00:55:55.976
devices.

00:56:04.056 --> 00:56:05.766
Awesome. You'll see that for all

00:56:05.766 --> 00:56:06.966
the remaining downloads of that

00:56:06.966 --> 00:56:08.846
same app there's no network

00:56:08.846 --> 00:56:10.496
activity on the Wi-Fi interface

00:56:10.496 --> 00:56:10.946
required.

00:56:10.946 --> 00:56:12.266
The Mac already has a cached

00:56:12.266 --> 00:56:14.006
copy of it and all it needs to

00:56:14.006 --> 00:56:15.806
do is push that cached version

00:56:16.216 --> 00:56:17.506
to the devices over USB.

00:56:17.506 --> 00:56:20.436
And just to be clear, it's not

00:56:20.436 --> 00:56:22.476
required that one iPad download

00:56:22.476 --> 00:56:23.866
the app before any other ones

00:56:23.866 --> 00:56:25.986
that was done strictly for demo

00:56:25.986 --> 00:56:26.616
purposes.

00:56:27.096 --> 00:56:28.266
So why are you going to like

00:56:28.266 --> 00:56:28.806
this feature?

00:56:28.906 --> 00:56:30.296
Well we think you're going to

00:56:30.296 --> 00:56:31.446
like the tethered part of

00:56:31.446 --> 00:56:32.756
tethered caching because it's

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:34.346
going to move the network

00:56:34.346 --> 00:56:35.566
bandwidth required for

00:56:35.566 --> 00:56:36.876
provisioning a large number of

00:56:36.876 --> 00:56:38.746
devices off your Wi-Fi network

00:56:39.186 --> 00:56:40.686
leaving it usable for the rest

00:56:40.686 --> 00:56:41.596
of the connected clients.

00:56:41.946 --> 00:56:42.826
And we think you're going to

00:56:42.826 --> 00:56:43.896
like the caching part of

00:56:43.896 --> 00:56:45.166
tethered caching as it will

00:56:45.166 --> 00:56:46.656
significantly reduce the amount

00:56:46.656 --> 00:56:47.896
of bandwidth necessary to

00:56:48.016 --> 00:56:49.856
provision your iOS devices.

00:56:50.326 --> 00:56:51.436
Thank you for watching and I'm

00:56:51.436 --> 00:56:52.766
going to hand the stage back to

00:56:52.766 --> 00:56:52.976
Todd.

00:56:53.516 --> 00:56:59.546

00:57:00.046 --> 00:57:00.936
>> Thank you very much Nolan.

00:57:00.936 --> 00:57:02.546
I do want to apologize that we

00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:04.266
forgot to install the Siri

00:57:04.266 --> 00:57:05.726
profanity filter restriction on

00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:08.006
this session, but we'll take

00:57:08.006 --> 00:57:10.626
care of that.

00:57:10.626 --> 00:57:12.836
So that brings us to the end of

00:57:12.836 --> 00:57:14.566
our tools update and I just want

00:57:14.566 --> 00:57:17.176
to quickly sum up as we wrap up

00:57:17.176 --> 00:57:18.676
our time together with a couple

00:57:18.676 --> 00:57:20.066
of notes for app developers.

00:57:20.686 --> 00:57:22.336
Now that we support managed app

00:57:22.336 --> 00:57:24.426
configuration for tvOS apps too,

00:57:24.776 --> 00:57:26.566
please make sure your apps are

00:57:26.566 --> 00:57:27.306
supported.

00:57:28.376 --> 00:57:29.516
For those of you who would like

00:57:29.516 --> 00:57:30.956
to sell a lot of copies of your

00:57:30.956 --> 00:57:33.686
apps into education, make sure

00:57:33.686 --> 00:57:34.856
that they're good customers for

00:57:34.856 --> 00:57:37.386
Shared iPad by storing all the

00:57:37.386 --> 00:57:39.446
data that you want to persist in

00:57:39.446 --> 00:57:40.996
the cloud, whether it's iCloud

00:57:40.996 --> 00:57:42.716
or your own third-party cloud

00:57:42.716 --> 00:57:44.456
solution and don't rely on

00:57:44.456 --> 00:57:46.056
backup or local data which won't

00:57:46.136 --> 00:57:47.756
survive logging into a different

00:57:47.756 --> 00:57:48.296
device.

00:57:48.856 --> 00:57:50.166
Once you've done this work you

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:51.586
can also take advantage of the

00:57:51.586 --> 00:57:53.496
option in iTunes Connect to mark

00:57:53.496 --> 00:57:55.086
your app as optimized for Shared

00:57:55.086 --> 00:57:56.676
iPad again, making it more

00:57:56.896 --> 00:57:58.616
interesting to education

00:57:58.616 --> 00:58:00.036
customers who might want to buy

00:58:00.096 --> 00:58:01.316
hundreds or thousands of copies

00:58:01.316 --> 00:58:02.146
of it.

00:58:02.966 --> 00:58:05.436
Finally, if your app has a

00:58:05.436 --> 00:58:06.876
strong dependency on network

00:58:06.876 --> 00:58:09.886
traffic and latency, take

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:11.286
advantage of some of the Cisco

00:58:11.286 --> 00:58:12.776
Fastlane options to optimize

00:58:12.776 --> 00:58:15.206
that traffic and there's a lab

00:58:15.206 --> 00:58:16.846
tomorrow that I will highlight

00:58:16.846 --> 00:58:17.826
in a moment where you can get

00:58:17.826 --> 00:58:18.396
help with that.

00:58:19.946 --> 00:58:21.726
For MDM vendors, of course we

00:58:21.726 --> 00:58:22.656
want you to support all these

00:58:22.656 --> 00:58:24.256
new features and we'll be in the

00:58:24.256 --> 00:58:26.016
lab after this to help you with

00:58:26.016 --> 00:58:26.656
any questions you have.

00:58:26.656 --> 00:58:28.266
I would also like to encourage

00:58:28.266 --> 00:58:29.626
you to adopt all the security

00:58:29.626 --> 00:58:30.726
enhancements that Bob talked

00:58:30.726 --> 00:58:31.816
about during the enrollment

00:58:31.816 --> 00:58:32.316
section.

00:58:33.996 --> 00:58:35.256
For administrators, take

00:58:35.256 --> 00:58:36.476
advantage of all these great new

00:58:36.476 --> 00:58:38.086
capabilities to build compelling

00:58:38.086 --> 00:58:40.486
new deployments that link iPads

00:58:40.486 --> 00:58:42.976
and Macs and Apple TV just like

00:58:42.976 --> 00:58:44.926
UCSD has and come up with some

00:58:44.926 --> 00:58:46.256
amazing things that no one else

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:46.816
has thought of.

00:58:48.556 --> 00:58:51.356
And finally, be ready, yes

00:58:51.356 --> 00:58:52.616
Pradhap stole my thunder, but

00:58:52.616 --> 00:58:54.296
next you need to be ready for

00:58:54.296 --> 00:58:55.426
those restrictions to be

00:58:55.426 --> 00:58:57.296
supervised only and honored only

00:58:57.296 --> 00:58:58.596
on supervised devices.

00:59:01.336 --> 00:59:02.246
So, we had a lot more

00:59:02.246 --> 00:59:04.036
information, documentation, help

00:59:04.066 --> 00:59:06.716
guides for the tools, all kinds

00:59:06.716 --> 00:59:07.866
of information at the session

00:59:07.866 --> 00:59:09.536
link, session 304.

00:59:11.456 --> 00:59:12.496
We have a couple of sessions

00:59:12.496 --> 00:59:13.976
still happening this week that

00:59:13.976 --> 00:59:14.996
you might be interested in.

00:59:16.016 --> 00:59:18.036
There's a What's New with Screen

00:59:18.036 --> 00:59:20.156
Recording tomorrow morning that

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:21.846
if you're building tools for

00:59:21.846 --> 00:59:24.256
remotely assisting customers

00:59:24.256 --> 00:59:25.056
that there's some very

00:59:25.056 --> 00:59:26.326
interesting technology in the

00:59:26.326 --> 00:59:27.576
new version of ReplayKit.

00:59:28.446 --> 00:59:29.776
And we talked a little bit about

00:59:29.776 --> 00:59:31.186
kiosk and assessment apps, but

00:59:31.186 --> 00:59:32.246
there's a whole session about

00:59:32.246 --> 00:59:33.336
that tomorrow afternoon if

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:34.246
you're interested in that, I

00:59:34.516 --> 00:59:35.666
encourage you to check that out.

00:59:36.296 --> 00:59:37.426
And with that, I will thank you

00:59:37.426 --> 00:59:38.866
very much for your attention and

00:59:38.866 --> 00:59:39.926
hope you enjoy the rest of the

00:59:39.926 --> 00:59:40.046
WWDC.

00:59:40.046 --> 00:59:40.946
Thank you very much.
