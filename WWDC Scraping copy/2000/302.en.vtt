WEBVTT

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.100
Please welcome Ian Riitchie.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:27.280
Well,
hello everybody and welcome to WWDC.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.600
I always look forward to
this conference every year.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.940
The whole QuickTime engineering team
always puts a lot of effort into

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.460
what we're going to be showing you.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.450
A lot of different ways
to use QuickTime and also

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.190
have a lot of fun with it.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.270
I'm encouraged that so many of you made
it safely across the street to come over

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.780
here and join us in the Civic Auditorium.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.710
This morning when you got up,
or most mornings when you get up,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.360
do you find yourself gravitating
over to the computer?

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.610
Turning on your browser,
perhaps much to the chagrin

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.730
of your wife or children,
and checking out your

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.940
customized news page.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.750
Mine happens to be an Excite page
that tells me what I'm interested in,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.200
mostly in technology, some of the sports,
the basketball playoffs, follow that.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.500
Absolutely no horoscope is on my page.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.490
And yet my sister goes out to a web page
and I think all her page is is astrology

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.500
and horoscope and kittens and these
type of things and Noose of the Weird.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.050
So basically what's going on in these
situations is unlike the early days where

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.500
I'd go out to a web page and it'd be the
same thing every day I'd go back to it.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.970
Even a few minutes
after that I'd go back,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.500
it's the same.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.550
Nowadays,
I can come back to some of these

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.830
Like Excite or Yahoo, Microsoft,
they have customized web pages that

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.600
change for me every time I come there.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.410
So I'm going to go back to these
sites more often because it's

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.490
a better experience for me.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.560
So, the way that you've set up your own
custom pages and your preferences

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.750
for your own experiences on the web,
we want to show you a little bit

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.260
today how to do the same thing with
QuickTime so that your multimedia

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.020
experience for yourself or for your
clients is much more beneficial.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.040
So I'm sure everyone here has
played movies from the web.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.080
Typical response is you'll go out
and click on one of the trailers

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.350
or click on a page and a request
is sent from your browser or from

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.700
QuickTime player out to the server.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.320
Hey, I want this movie.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.440
And then it plays and
everything's really good.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.910
And that's the end of that conversation.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.680
Sometimes you'll be using
CGI's and it'll go out,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.480
talk to that application,
it'll send data down.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.020
So we're going to go through
some of these techniques that,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.640
on the server side of things,
and somewhat inside of movies,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.330
that you can-- not necessarily tricks,
but techniques and the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.500
technology that's there today.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.200
So you can take advantage of it.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.900
So let's look at a typical URL.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.820
This is what you send up to
the server from your machine.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.480
and first part, let's break it down.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.920
When you're having a
conversation with someone else,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.900
you always want to make sure that
you're speaking the same language.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.170
So the HTTP is a protocol
that we're using.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.080
and we're going to the server at
apple.com so we know what machine

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.110
we're going to be talking to.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.030
And then we'd also like to know
what file we're requesting.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.800
So when this happens,
we get the file back and that's

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.000
the end of the conversation.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.650
Here's another very
common URL using a CGI.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.750
Common Gateway Interface, whatever, CGI.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.040
Okay,
it's an application that's out there

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.130
on the server that's going to take
your request and do something with it.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.590
So once again,
HTTP is a protocol that we're using.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.370
We're going at this time,
the search engine Google,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.370
or the search site,
and we're asking for their

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.850
Search.cgi application running
on that server to respond to the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.850
parameters that we pass into them.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.190
And so it'll take that.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.530
It's just an application.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.850
It's very simple.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.460
And it will run,
and then it sends us back something.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.760
Now, usually we don't know what
we're going to be getting back.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.490
So let's look at a typical
request for a web page.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.490
Okay?

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.040
We send out, we say,
"I would like mywebpage.html." We send

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.360
this information up to the server.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.400
This is what it gets.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.190
It says, "Okay.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.400
I now have this data.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.460
I'm going to send it to you.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.000
But first,
let me tell you what type of data it is.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.280
This is HTML in the format of text.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.320
And then you see after the return
the head and the meta name and

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.440
the rest of it following down.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.180
So we know how to respond
to this on the other side.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.990
Another request, we often get GIFs.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.170
And in this case,
it tells us the image is of type GIF.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.940
And so now on the client end,
we know how to respond

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.200
to that differently.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.900
So the idea here is that we request
for something from the server,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.410
and then it responds to us,
often in predictable ways and often not.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.700
Let's go through some of the requests
and responses that we can get.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.340
I'd like to bring Jim Batson out.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.440
He's our chief QuickTime architect,
long-time friend, and the guy leading the

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.570
QuickTime effort now.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.300
So now we're going to talk about things
that relate more closely with QuickTime.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.620
So let's skip the redirect for right now
and go down to some of the MIME types.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.270
Now the first two are common,
just binary versions of data that will

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.500
come down that you play inside QuickTime.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.940
There's video/quicktime,
which says it's a QuickTime movie,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.610
please play it.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.030
Image, xQuickTime,
is for image.QTI kind of files,

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.040
QuickTime image format files.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.360
And there are the other ones.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.190
We'll skip the binary ones
because those are typically hard

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.600
to generate from a CGI script.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.600
Okay.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.600
Instead we're going to talk about
things that are more natural to CGI's.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.540
And the first one is a redirect.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.590
Okay.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.600
Where you go to one place
and you jump somewhere else.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.590
And the other three are text types.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.530
There's HTML, plain text, and SMIL files.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.600
We're going to go over
those individually.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.280
So let's take a quick look at
what a redirect looks like.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:37.440
So what will happen is you do a request,
and in the head of the request you say,

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.540
"I want to go some player specific.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.520
I want this file from the net."
In this case it's from QuickTime.com.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:51.080
Let's imagine we're calling a CGI,
randomMovie.cgi, and we set it the

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.620
parameter genre is comedy.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.920
And then a redirect could
just come back and say,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:57.920
"Well,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.140
Instead of the URL you
originally thought,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.100
go to this one.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.000
In this case,
a movie with Laurie Anderson.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.440
So how does this happen
in an HTML request?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:17.280
First there's the request,
and in that is once again

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.280
here mywebpage.html.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.100
and what comes back is a 302 redirect
which is in the header of the response.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.700
And here we can see there's the location.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.840
And it doesn't have to
stay on the same webpage,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.900
excuse me, the website or server.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.110
It can go totally somewhere else.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.700
In this case,
xyz.com and different file name.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.900
Okay, so we're going to show an
example of redirect here.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.550
First, I'm going to go ahead
and get demo machine one.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.210
Great, thank you.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.040
Okay, I'm going to just open a URL.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.040
And I'm going to drag and drop here.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.730
And so let's look at that request.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.540
First of all, HTTP.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.470
Here's the server.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.410
and here's the CGI we're running,
which just happens to

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.050
be on this machine here.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.180
And here's the parameter to that.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.100
So it sends it and
redirects to this movie.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.800
We'll play it.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.100
Ian RiTchie: A leader has to be able to
take responsibility without

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.120
letting it turn his head.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.330
Now some fellas,
when given a little authority,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.700
they seem to change.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.210
Some in one way, some in another.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.250
Okay, so let's open that same URL again.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.560
It's time to get
redirected somewhere else.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.240
I know dear,
but I'm thinking of something else too.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.940
It'll take a little conspiracy.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.980
Conspiracy?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.540
A nice little conspiracy.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.390
Okay.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.540
Of course, we can just keep doing
that over and over again.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.930
We'll just get another movie.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.910
This contemporary home shows how
modern asbestos materials can be

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.840
adapted to any style or design.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.520
Notice how the asbestos cement side
walls help add dignity and charm.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.590
So back to slides please.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:18.360
So hopefully that was informative
as well as entertaining.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.350
Back to slides please.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:33.820
So let's talk a little bit about the text
data that comes back in the form of HTML.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.290
So HTML is the format that you
get data for a web browser.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.880
So how does that relate to QuickTime?

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.450
Well, QuickTime will play inside a
web browser through a web page

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.340
with href tags or embed tags.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.070
And embed tags are what you use
to actually embed a movie right

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:53.930
in the middle of your web page.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.450
So you see that all the time, right?

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.860
You go to movie trailers,
you play a movie, it'll come down.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.560
So the standard form of the
embed tag is embed source equals,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.940
and in this case, the name of the movie,
hip.move.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.490
Okay.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.830
So what can go wrong?

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:13.070
Well, QuickTime has to get the movie,
has to get the data in order for us

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.100
to actually see the movie and play
it and hopefully life is all good.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.870
But unfortunately,
that's not true in all cases.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.720
There are two reasons
you might not get that.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.140
One is that QuickTime is
not installed at all.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.330
And the second is that someone's
hijacked the MIME type.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.930
and the user's machine is not
properly configured and instead

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.320
of QuickTime getting the movie,
video/QuickTime then goes,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.500
jumps off to some other application
that can't even read that movie.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.500
So let's take a look at
solving that first problem.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.480
How do you check for
QuickTime on your pages?

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.900
First thing you can do is you
can just run some JavaScript,

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.500
okay?

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.500
You have to figure out
what OS am I running on?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.500
So your choice is Mac or Windows.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.860
If you're on the Mac,
then you need to check the browser, okay?

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.800
and then if you find out
you're running Netscape or IE5,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.290
then you can run some
JavaScript to check for the plugin.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.600
and then if you have plugins there,
you know you've got QuickTime installed.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.800
If it's not there,
QuickTime's not installed.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:23.810
Now in the case that it's not IE5
or some earlier version of IE,

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.040
you can just assume yes
on the Mac platform.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.760
Okay,
because the other choice is just say,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.240
"Well, I don't know what to do."

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.140
Now on Windows,
slightly different situation.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.900
On Netscape, you do the same thing.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.100
You can run some JavaScript to
check your plugins.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.290
It's kind of cool that
the same technology works,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.100
you know, technique works for both.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.380
But not for IE, okay?

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.080
So for IE on Windows,
what you have to do is

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.270
until QuickTime 4.1.1,

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.500
and others.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.000
You're kind of out of luck, okay,
because there was no way that you could

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
really see if QuickTime was installed.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.540
With 4.1.1, we've shipped an
OCX called QuickTime Check,

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.480
which you use to invoke,
actually instantiate it from

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.380
a VB script and call it,
and that will do the checking for you,

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.760
and it will return that, well,
QuickTime is installed or not.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.500
So this has answered the question,
is QuickTime around at all?

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.750
So the next thing you
have to do is worry about,

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.010
is it configured?

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.620
Okay,
and there really isn't a great solution

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.430
in terms of making sure the machine's
always configured for QuickTime,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.400
and so you can just use
source equals movie.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:45.940
And the problem is that there's no real
web etiquette for MIME-type management.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.470
What'll happen is that
whoever installed last wins.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.830
So, the solution we have is to kind of
work around the problem by using

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.740
a file type that you ask for,
which, at this point anyway,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.390
no one else has hijacked.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.140
So that type is the .QTS file,
the QTI file, excuse me.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.760
Okay,
so what's happening if you look at the

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.200
embed tag is that you say source equals,
you know, some file name dot QTI.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200
Now this file doesn't
actually have to be an image.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.190
It could just be zero length.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.160
It just has to exist on the server.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.100
And then QT source.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.140
In this situation then,
the plugin will get it.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:27.190
And then with the QT source
added to the embed tag,

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.030
QuickTime will play that movie.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.220
So now that you've been able to
actually make sure QuickTime's going

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.840
to be invoked with your embed tag,
there's some interesting

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.500
things you can do.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.480
There's a whole list of different kinds
of things you can add to your embed tags.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.880
But one of the cool ones is Qt Next.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.530
So the first example here is it
allows you to just chain movies.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.660
So you can easily put together a little
page that then will play movie one,

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.240
two, and three and stop.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.020
There's all sorts of things you can do.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.790
And the second example is where you say,
doing the same kind of thing,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.060
I'm going to start with an intro movie.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.500
And then I'm actually going to call CGI,
which will generate a random movie.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:14.920
And then the special interpretation of
GoTo1 will then go to reload Qt Next 1.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.800
So what will happen then is then
we'll just play the movie again.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.080
But this time,
since we're using a CGI that

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:25.070
we just showed before,
you get a long playing,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.090
infinitely long playing
movie inside the browser.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.100
Can we go back to, go to demo one please?

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.320
So first let's look at the HTML page.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.300
and here it is,
standard kind of HTML looking.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.300
Probably a little bit
light for everybody.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.300
And here it is.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.120
Here's the source.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.660
We're just using QTI to make sure that
QuickTime gets a chance to play the file.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.420
And here's the real movie.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.840
It's that same CGI we were using before.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.470
And one thing to note is that width and
height applies to source and QTSource.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.410
If you're in a situation
that QuickTime isn't there,

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.660
the source file will try to play
and in fact what will happen

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.990
is you'll get a broken icon.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.160
That's why it's really important
to make sure that QuickTime 4

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.320
is installed on that machine.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.430
and this will just reload Qt source.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.500
So go ahead and play that in the browser.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.760
This is the American dream
of freedom on wheels.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.940
An automotive age traveling
on time-saving super highways.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:49.690
Futurama's free-flowing
channels of concrete and steel.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.860
While metal coins are handy for
dealing in small amounts of money,

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.100
when transactions require larger amounts,
paper money is far more practical.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.160
A five dollar bill, for example,
is much easier to handle than, say,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.770
five dollars in dimes.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.990
and just imagine buying something
that costs $100 and paying

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.800
for it with 10,000 cents.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.850
Important information
for all to keep in mind.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.720
Back to slides please.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:30.770
So let's go back to some of the
other types that we talked about

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.190
that are really applicable to CGI's
because they're textual in nature.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.800
And the next one is

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.800
and other engineers are also involved
in the development of QuickTime.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.170
The content is very simple.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.750
You just need to create a text file
and it will be uploaded to QuickTime.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:18:02.800
The text can be styled, color and size,
and other interesting things.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.800
Ian is the master of all text movies.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.440
Remember a few years ago I met a bunch of
developers at a conference and they said,

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.710
"Oh, you work on QuickTime!

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.560
That's cool!" Oh, text, huh?

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.710
Well, someone has to.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.660
And I try to feel good about myself.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:32.620
Actually, there's an awful lot of text
in everything that we're doing

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.740
with the internet these days.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.260
So there's almost a resurgence
of text inside of QuickTime.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.920
And some of the stuff has
been laying dormant there that

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.600
you can take advantage of.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.040
Let's show first a simple
text file with simple text.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.450
And let's open up
QuickTime Player and import this file.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.680
And typically what you get is
the 12-point Helvetica text.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.030
You can go from one slide to the next.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:09.430
And typically we used it for closed
captioning or for subtitling your text.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:16.380
But you can go in and add
a lot more to the text.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.210
Up here it's a little bit complicated,
but you can create your simple

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.840
text file and export it with
the text descriptor settings and

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.050
all this will play out for you.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.260
And we also have a web page
up that will show you how to

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.360
use all the text descriptors.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.750
But the idea is I took that same
text that we had and we went in

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:39.470
here and we added different sizes,
like we can make this one, you know,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:52.910
We also include a lot of different
ways to customize your web server.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.390
We can make it all red.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:02.890
So then when we take this file and
import it into QuickTime again,

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:14.240
It just takes on the attributes of
whatever you put inside the text file.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.550
The great thing is your CGI's
can automatically generate text

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.660
real easy and in this format
and pass it down into QuickTime.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:28.530
And it can be embedded as data or
it can be tagged as of type move.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.650
And we'll just play it automatically
as though it's a movie.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:36.520
You'll see more on this later
being used in the WebObjects demo.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:36.690
Each one of these have URLs.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:48.500
[Transcript missing]

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.440
Okay,
now we're going to move on to SMIL files.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.410
The other type of file that will
come down for you that's really

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.370
useful in the context of CGI's
and server-side stuff is SMIL.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:11.190
SMIL allows you to create
presentations where you can

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.500
Compose the temporal data,
so you can play movie after movie

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.010
or image after image or layout audio
tracks in any order that you want.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.590
And also spatially for
image related things.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.900
So let's take a quick look at
the structure of a SMIL file.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.890
If you know anything about HTML,
this looks pretty familiar.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.490
SMIL is XML based and thus
has pretty related to HTML.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.790
So you see there's a head and a
body inside of a SMIL document.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.110
and typically in a head you'll
have a layout area which

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.500
describes the presentation area.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:50.460
If there's no visual aspect of it,
you don't need to have a layout area.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:56.710
But there's a root layout which
defines the complete enclosing area.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:03.500
and then you have to define regions
inside that root layout that you

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.010
have images or videos play into.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.400
And so what you can do is you
can have one root layout and

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.480
create a bunch of different
regions and then play into them.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:23.020
Now, inside the body portion is where you
say what media you're going to play.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.020
Okay?

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.020
And...

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.290
In this case, we have a couple of videos
that are playing in sequence.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.640
The default in the body section is
that this is sequential playback.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.190
So first, intro.move will play,
then main.move will play.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.680
So that's an implicit sequential block.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.420
If you want to make it explicit,
you just add the seek tags.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.600
and once you have this section of
Seq that becomes like its own block.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.740
That will become evident later.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.440
Now, if you want to do something
where you do things in parallel,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.300
use the pair tags.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.650
Here we have an image, the picture.jpg,
that's being displayed at the

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.000
same time we're playing audio.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.800
And instead of using image or audio,
you could put in a block of sequence,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.340
of a sequential section and just
play another sequence of stuff.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:20.830
So we're going to go to demo
and do a quick example of SMIL.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:55.000
[Transcript missing]

[Transcript missing]

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:35.980
So this is one way to set up the
slider inside of a SMILE document.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.940
Let's go back to the
full-blown thing here before,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.900
and we'll take a look at this.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.900
There's a lot of these extension
tags we'll talk about in a minute.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.900
Here's the layout information
in the head section.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.670
We're using a meta tag
here to give it a name.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:04.720
And we just have one region for an image,
and here's the image down here.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:10.010
We have a sequence of audio tracks,
and then in parallel we're

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.380
going to show an image.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.720
I want to do is save it, go back out,
drop it on QuickTime Player,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.860
and here we have basically an album
cover with the tracks in there,

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.170
and we can use the chapter
tracks to go between the tracks.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:44.260
So there's... go back to slides, please.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:48.590
Now, there's the basic layout of...

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:54.260
Ordering your media and putting it
on the screen and also just in time.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.440
QuickTime's added some
extensions to SMIL,

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:03.810
which we find really useful for
doing QuickTime presentations.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.500
And how that gets expressed in the
SMIL document is in the SMIL tag

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.590
at the top is you have this XMLNS,
which means XML namespace,

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.930
and you're saying, giving it a name.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.490
Here it's QT.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:24.470
And then you have this URL which
then specifies that extension

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:32.230
uniquely across different
presentations between any SMIL file.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.450
Now the QT is something
that you get to make up.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.500
I conventionally just always just use QT,
but you can make that foo.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.090
And then when you use that down below,
like for the autoplay,

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.670
instead of saying QT:autoplay,
it could be foo:autoplay.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.110
What are some of these extensions?

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.210
There are some attributes
that apply to the root,

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.030
which is to the whole presentation.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.560
There's autoplay,
which says when I open the movie,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.800
as soon as you can, start playing it.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.060
There's next,
which is just like QTnext that we

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.740
saw in the embed tags for HTML pages.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.520
There's timeslider,
which lets you control

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.800
whether to use the timeslider,
because sometimes,

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.800
depending on the kind of presentation
you put together with the SMILE file,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.800
you see in the time slider,
it's very confusing, it's very erratic,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.790
and so you just don't
even want to see that.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.790
The things that we've shown today,
they make sense,

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.800
you can see the timeslider,
but sometimes they don't.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.820
And there's chapter mode that says,
when you give me a timeslider,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.650
give me something which
is for the whole movie,

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:39.650
or only show me the slider for
when I'm inside this chapter.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.800
So I'll see when I'm at the
beginning and end of the chapter.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.800
When I go to the next chapter,
I'll see when I'm at the

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:43.800
beginning and end of the chapter.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.760
I'd go back to the beginning
of the time slider.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.980
There's also media
attributes that you can set,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.360
which you can have are
AttachTimeBase and Chapter.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.960
AttachTimeBase is used when you have
something like a sprite movie or a

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.890
wired action movie that you don't
want a time base attached to it,

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.400
okay, because then it'll
just confuse the movie.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.130
And there's also Chapter,
which allows you to define

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.490
what the chapter name is,
and that's how the popup, not the popup,

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:14.320
but the chapter names work in the
controller in the previous example.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.820
You can also do anchor tags so
that you can click on an area

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.240
and then you'll jump to a URL.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.400
And the other very useful one
is a target of QuickTime Player.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.930
That way, wherever this movie is played,
if it's in the browser or

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:35.160
your email app or whatever,
if you then click on

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.400
it and then you launch,
go to URL,

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.360
it'll open it in the QuickTime Player.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.400
Okay, we'll show this a
little bit more in SMIL.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:05.370
Here's an example which actually
defines three different regions.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.370
and puts in, so we have left half,
right top quarter, right bottom quarter,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.240
and then it's using href tags.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:19.590
And this is all shown in parallel.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.590
So,

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:33.900
[Transcript missing]

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:50.850
and David Dornan are also on the panel.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:50.850
Thank you.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.230
Here's a SMIL file that does
something you might not expect.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.020
But this is an example where it kind of

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.770
Paul S.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:18.990
The Small File is actually
just laying out two movies.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:27.400
This bottom portion of the
movie is a wired action movie.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.200
Look on the button and things change.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.720
Notice that every time I get to play,
a new movie comes up.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:39.400
So that's actually using that redirect
technique by going to the CGI and saying,

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.130
give me the next movie.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.060
And let's play-- You can
increase your profit.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.440
You can bring many potential
customers into your store.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.790
You can add dollars to your volume.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.400
The interesting thing with this guy
is that we've got these thumbs up,

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.160
thumbs down buttons.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:01.010
So you can say, "Oh, I like that movie."

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.940
will then send another
request of that same CGI,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.120
which will then tell us

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:16.450
How many other people like the movie?

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.400
Okay.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:26.970
And this is actually coming back in a
SMIL form with some embedded text which

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:27.750
gives us some formatting capabilities
and some colorization of the text.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.750
Okay.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.750
So we can go to the next one.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.850
Okay, so we'll go ahead and click here.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.440
And you can see that it's live by, well,
we're the only one that watched it.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.800
So let's pretend we liked it this time.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.380
So we just click here.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.510
And it loads it again.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.840
It just changed.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.440
OK.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.520
Back to slides.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.810
And I think it's time for Ian.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:06.700
Thank you, Jim.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.660
As you've noticed over
the last few years,

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.110
in particular in this session,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.910
QuickTime has taken a lot of
steps to take advantage of people

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.590
being connected to the web.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.980
Here at WWDC, the WebObjects team has,
I believe,

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.210
18 different sessions going on.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:49.590
And we are lucky to snag one of their
engineers to come show us how they've

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.810
have written some SMIL export
components and tied it in with

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.370
WebObjects and interact with QuickTime.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:01.600
And there'll be more of this shown
in tomorrow's interactivity session,

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.400
but we ask them to come
give us a glimpse here.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:08.190
So if you could welcome Ron Lu-Saang,
WebObjects engineer.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.760
Thanks, Ian.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.140
So I started off with WebObjects
and wanted to hook it up

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.280
to QuickTime using SMIL.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.490
So I wrote a simple little framework,
semi-simple,

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:28.800
that actually brings all the power
of WebObjects and all the power

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.490
of QuickTime together using SMIL.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:46.400
So putting them together,
we have what I call client-server movies.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:52.070
So what I want to show you is how I got
WebObjects talking to QuickTime without

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.100
necessarily using any SMIL,
but generating

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.520
QuickTime compatible content.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:02.700
Some of the QT text stuff
that was shown earlier.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:10.030
And the point of this was to actually
bring some interactivity to the

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.700
client just by making the movies
dynamic and talk to the server.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:20.250
Whereas the WebObjects and SMIL stuff
that I did was kind of geared towards

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.690
generating the movie dynamically
versus having dynamic movies.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.870
Two different things in my mind.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:35.260
So let me show you on demo one here.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.400
My idea of making movies dynamic.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.620
Let's see if I can get this up.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.310
So I've got Live Stage Pro here.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:54.300
demo version of Live Stage,
and got a movie track and a sprite track.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.440
If you can see here,
there's a little icon here.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.300
That's the actual sprite.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.570
The whole,
the sole purpose of the sprite is to

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.300
go out to the net and load a movie.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.380
The URL that it goes to, actually,
is the URL of a WebObjects

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.760
app that I've got.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:21.500
[Transcript missing]

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:28.160
And the cool part about
this is each time you click,

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.250
you'll end up getting a new movie.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:47.400
[Transcript missing]

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.230
If I can show you this.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.800
I have my app running here.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.760
What should happen is that the app

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:01.830
But isn't happening.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.570
Hello.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:05.930
Well, okay.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.360
What should happen is that each time
you click you bring up a new movie.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.460
It's similar to what was shown before,
but talking directly to WebObjects.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:18.890
Demo errors.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900
Oh well.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.740
Okay, back with the slides though.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.130
I can, so that's,
what should have happened

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.930
there was every time you click,
it goes out to the

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.300
WebObjects application.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:38.300
The specific URL that the sprite action,
the sprite invokes, or goes to,

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.170
is a trigger to WebObjects
to go into the database,

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.510
look for all of the movies
with a certain genre,

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.300
and then, oh, okay, back up a little.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.200
So I've got a small database here
where I put in some information

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:56.300
about some QuickTime movies that
I've got on a streaming server.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:03.300
So things like the title, the artist,
duration of the movie,

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.240
and URL on the streaming server to go to.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.190
Could I have the slides back up, please?

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:14.240
So what WebObjects will do,
that URL triggers some logic

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.180
to go through the database,
find all of the movies that

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:26.610
are pop rock music videos,
and deliver one of those

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:32.380
movies at random back to the
QuickTime engine in live stage.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.900
Let's see.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:39.540
So for dynamic movies,
my idea is that the user asks for the

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:46.010
resources and talks to the server,
versus dynamically making movies,

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:50.310
creating movies dynamically on the fly,
where the layout of the movie,

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.810
the resources of the movie
change depending on some state,

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.750
either user defined or something
in your business logic,

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:02.500
in the database, time of day, you know,
shades of the moon, all that stuff.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:10.290
So back on demo one, and demo,
actually demo four please.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.120
Thank you.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:19.280
So this is my WebObjects application.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:33.000
[Transcript missing]

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.100
So, how many of you are familiar
with WebObjects actually?

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:40.970
Oh, good.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.010
Very cool.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.940
Have you guys tried connecting
QuickTime and WebObjects before?

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.100
How many?

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.100
Ah, very cool.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:55.490
You're on the right track.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.490
Very good.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.490
So...

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:07.060
So what I've done in my framework,
I've got some code and some resources

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.390
that actually implements a lot
of the elements in the SMIL spec.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:15.780
A lot of the classes, the root layout,
regions,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.400
media elements of the media objects.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.300
And what this lets you do is
build a WebObjects application,

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:27.980
include this framework in your web app,
and you're able to layout SMIL documents

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.400
using our very cool WebObjects builder.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.900
So here's a video page I've got.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.180
It's already up.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.840
Now, the unfortunate thing is,
because WebObjects was kind of,

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:54.260
and WebObjects Builder is
kind of geared more towards,

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.790
originally geared towards
developing web pages,

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.790
the UI for XML isn't that great.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:03.870
But you can see here all of the
elements that go into my SMILE movie.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:10.580
What happens is a lot of these elements
are bound at runtime to things in your

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.690
business logic on the app server side.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.870
Here I can figure out the artist
and title from the database,

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.310
what the next song is, and then I can

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:30.480
You get a lot of this stuff
for free with WebObjects,

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:30.480
whereas you could do
it in CGI's normally.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:34.740
You get things like session
management for free using WebObjects.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:39.850
You get things like resource management,
connections to the databases for free,

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:45.750
being able to tie in a lot of really
advanced technologies into the cool

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.990
QuickTime technology that we've got.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.190
Let's see if I can have the slides.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200
Thank you.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.860
There we go.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.150
So that's the whole point of trying
to use WebObjects to generate

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.310
SMIL content for QuickTime,
using WebObjects as your

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.700
server side scripting solution.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:12.570
I'll actually have the framework
and a working example up on

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:18.700
enterprise.apple.com/wwdc2000
about Thursday.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.700
I've actually got another session,
a WebObjects specific session,

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.210
session 4.11, if anyone's interested,
for going further into detail

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:34.770
at how WebObjects is doing all
this stuff and larger examples of

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.560
using QuickTime with WebObjects.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.360
And plus, because WebObjects is
now on sale for 98% off,

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.700
there's no reason to not try it out.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.820
You should go out and you've all
got demo versions of WebObjects,

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.700
and once you pick up my framework,
you should be able to try this out.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.690
I think you'll be very happy with it.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.840
With that, I'll hand it over.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.860
Thank you.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:58.900
Thank you, John.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.880
Excellent.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.350
So when you think about it, 98% off.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.300
We're all going to rush
out and buy one right now.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:16.100
Just think of the gentleman
that bought it Friday.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:26.000
[Transcript missing]

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.840
sure they'll figure it out.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:35.020
So some of us here in the
QuickTime group have written our,

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.100
in fact Kevin Calhoun
wrote a CGI with HyperCard,

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.480
which is, so you, you know,
some things that you

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.120
can do today with very,
I wouldn't say basic tools,

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.760
it's actually pretty extensive.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.940
But a long time friend, I guess,
is how you think of HyperCard.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.720
And so you can see that tomorrow
in the interactivity session.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.320
We'll show slides
afterwards for the road map.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:03.540
A lot of excellent things that people
are doing with Smile and using QuickTime.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.540
So we look forward to that.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:10.370
And get it in the hands of you guys,
because we thought, you know, in the,

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.890
in the QuickTime group,
we sort of looked at it as, you know,

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:13.890
we thought, you know,

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.280
Not the rogue group, but sort of that
connotation within Apple,

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:21.300
that you go out and do your own thing
and you're thinking out of the box.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.170
And, you know, we thought we were a bunch
of crazy and somewhat,

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.300
sometimes clever individuals.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:32.120
And then we come across a gentleman
that's more crazy and more of a lunatic

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.200
than any of the rest of us on the team.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.250
This guy just takes
QuickTime to the next level.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.300
We go, "Man, you're just insane.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.970
I mean, it's great, brilliant,
wonderful." Definitely thinking

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.300
out of the box.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:48.070
And this individual is Matthew Peterson,
a neuroscientist from Berkeley.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:51.300
And we'd like to welcome him now to show
us some things he's been working on.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.300
It's pretty bright out here.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:03.100
I'm going to get a suntan
on the back of my neck.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.750
Apple.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:11.070
So I'm going to be talking
about QuickTime applications.

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.220
So I'm not going to be
comparing QuickTime to Reel

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.180
or Windows Media Player.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:21.260
It's more on the same par as Java and
what you can do with Shockwave.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:27.460
And mostly what I'm going to be
showing you is just a bunch of demos.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.190
So what is a QuickTime application?

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:40.420
Well, here, the quintessential desktop
accessory is a calculator.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:43.650
So this is all a QuickTime movie.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:45:09.600
[Transcript missing]

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:14.560
This top, today's topic is how to
interact with the server.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.440
How does QuickTime movies
interact with the server?

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.250
So this doesn't really
interact with the server.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.940
But I'm going to,
oh here's another little application.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.670
It's a little URL launcher.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.680
So let me launch up a web page.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:46.000
and So this is coming off of France.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.710
So maybe it's a little bit slow.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.550
Are you still there?

00:45:58.610 --> 00:45:59.100
Okay, good.

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.100
So this right here is a little clock.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.430
And how does this clock
interact with the server?

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.900
Well, I can set the alarm.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:15.000
And if I close the movie and I reopen it,

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.800
should remember my setting.

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:22.970
So it saved this into a little cookie.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:28.600
There's a lot of ways that you can
have a information in the movie saved.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:32.400
Either it can be saved on the server,
saved locally in a cookie file,

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:38.680
or it can, there's, you can actually,
there's ways to save things on

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.930
little text files on the local drive.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:46.150
And I'm going to be getting
a little bit more into that.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:51.750
One other way to pass
information to a movie is what

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.540
I'm going to show you in here.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.200
There's not very many ways
to communicate with a movie,

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.330
but one way is you can just have
the server send you a little movie.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.800
So in this one,
this little thing right here,

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.400
this is a movie that contains a
bunch of sounds for each number.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.530
And when I type in a number here,

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:18.880
Can we increase the volume for that?

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.100
Did you hear that?

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.900
I don't think the volume is working here,
so let me enter a number.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:29.940
and So this right here
is this text field.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.940
This is an HTML text field.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:35.350
And then when I type
in a number right here,

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:49.590
It requests a small movie to be sent
and that movie passes information

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:59.220
to this top movie which is a bigger
movie and contains all of the sounds

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.890
and also the logic to put the sounds
together to speak out this movie.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:08.810
This is something a little bit more--
so this is used in conjunction with

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:10.920
this next thing I'm going to show you.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:23.700
This right here is data coming
from my lab in UC Berkeley.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.700
It's being passed into the movie.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:30.450
In the other demo I just showed you,
the movie was being passed

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.700
into a little frame.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.900
You can make that invisible frame,
but I let you see a little

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.700
blip of the QuickTime loading.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.700
In this one, data is being passed
directly into the movie,

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.220
into a movie track.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:49.700
The server just keeps on passing
data into that movie track.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:55.820
That data gets sent off
to a local sprite track,

00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:00.700
which calculates the height of bars,
and it puts those bars up on this graph.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:04.700
In this way, I can monitor an experiment
from anywhere in the world.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.700
In fact, I can also turn off the
CO2 in my experiment,

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.680
and you can watch the change of that.

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:12.690
Instead of plotting temperature,
I can change plot pulse rate.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.700
I can change the humidity and the stroke.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.690
This is all a movie.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.590
This is just a QuickTime movie,
and it can run anywhere a

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.700
QuickTime movie can run.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:33.520
Next thing I'd like to show you is all
these things are little applications,

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:38.540
and a lot of you maybe
aren't interested in having

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.740
QuickTime work as an application.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.320
But you are interested in
having QuickTime show movies,

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.530
which is what it was
originally intended to do.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:48.850
And why would you want to
have all these application

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:51.060
features in just a normal movie?

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:57.470
Well, what I'm going to show you here is
something I developed with iFilm.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.660
This movie is an intelligent movie.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.400
You haven't purchased this movie yet,
so it knows that.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.500
As soon as you launch this movie,
it says,

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.500
"Do you want to watch the preview?"
which it allows you to watch.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.700
would you like to purchase the movie?

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:20.700
So let's purchase the movie.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.700
It goes off to a web page and I hope
this is a little bit quicker this time.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:23.700
Maybe not.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:27.690
So right, it's usually faster.

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:35.620
So right now it's launching a URL on my
site and it's going to give you a web,

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.700
a form to enter in your
credit card information.

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.230
Let me take out my wallet real quick.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.980
and you can purchase this movie.

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:47.370
And in fact, the other movie doesn't even
have to be open in order for

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:48.490
me to purchase the movie.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:59.500
Let me enter my name real quick.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.930
Purchased it.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.050
And now my movie has been purchased,
and now this machine will be

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.530
enabled to watch this movie.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:27.890
www.iitc.com/serviced-services

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:37.150
This is putting application into
just a... so it gives you a DVD-style

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.550
movie and it talks with the server,
says, "Is this computer enabled to

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:46.890
watch this movie?" And therefore,
we've implemented pay-per-view downloads

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:51.900
all within the QuickTime applications,
all within the QuickTime framework.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:55.930
We don't have to invent any
new media type or any new

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:58.900
methods like Microsoft is doing.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.790
All... QuickTime already has
the ability to do all that.

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:04.990
It's got all this wired sprites
and the ability to talk to servers,

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:09.330
and you can build custom,
novel applications that other

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.860
people haven't built before.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:18.900
Um, here is something where a movie
actually returns something to the user.

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.000
So that one,
the server was talking to the... to

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:25.370
the... the movie was talking to the
server to see if this computer is

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:27.900
allowed to watch a certain movie.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:33.830
And what I'm gonna show you right now
is the server is going to return a file

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:35.890
to the user based on what the user does.

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:39.530
So here,
this is a simple drawing program.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.500
Just make a little interesting drawing.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.300
How's that?

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.340
I'm not an artist.

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.390
There you go.

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:55.990
And then when I click on this PDF button,
it should load-- oh, save file.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.290
And it just saved the files from my disk.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:09.200
And that was the drawing
that I just... Oh.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.860
Launch Code Warrior.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.900
Sorry about that.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.980
And there's my drawing.

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:25.930
Now, a drawing is, yeah, sure,
there's a lot of things

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:28.200
that can make drawings,
and, well,

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.760
not that many that can write PDF files
unless you have a distiller on it,

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:33.640
but there are lots of
drawing applications.

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:36.230
Why would you want to have
QuickTime do your drawing?

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.790
Well, you don't have to do a drawing.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.340
You could design, like,
a T-shirt and use, the person says, "Oh,

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:45.430
I want my logo here,
and I want this here," or greeting cards.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.240
They want to have, like,
business cards made up, and they said,

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.920
"I want my logo here,
I want my name here," and they can

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.900
do all that within a QuickTime,
um, within a QuickTime movie, and say,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.190
"Click this, I want that," and they
can send you back a PDF,

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.980
say, "Is this what you want?" You say,
"Yes," and they produce

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.530
it and send it to you.

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:04.400
So there's a lot of e-commerce
applications for this.

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:07.820
Um, basically,
a movie can send something to the server,

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:12.030
and the server can send you back a file,
and that opens a lot of doors.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.830
But why would you want
QuickTime to do that?

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:18.830
Well,
QuickTime has a unique property that is,

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.680
I'm going to make a new word
that I coined last year,

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.560
is ploppable.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:24.660
It's the most ploppable
thing I've ever seen.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.690
You can take a movie,
you can stick it into a PDF file,

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:31.070
you can stick it into
a word processing file,

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:33.700
you can stick it into a web page,
you can stick it in all these places.

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:36.030
You can't stick a
Java application inside of a PDF,

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.700
or maybe you can,
but not at a standard Acrobat reader,

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.580
you can't stick Java in a PDF file.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:44.700
You definitely can't stick
Reel in Windows Media Player,

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:48.670
and you can't stick many applications.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:55.700
So here's an example of using my drawing
program in a real world situation.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.390
Let's see, where is that?

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:07.450
In this application I'm
using at UC Berkeley,

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:09.020
I'm a neuro...

00:55:09.300 --> 00:56:42.300
[Transcript missing]

00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:54.600
That's why you might want to use
QuickTime to do applications.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:57:02.360
Okay, where are we now?

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:05.080
Looks like I'm going fast.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.300
That's okay.

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:13.330
So, I'm gonna get, okay,
another place you can put a

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.970
QuickTime movie is in a PDF file.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:25.410
Here's a PDF file from my friend,
Joe Nowak, who will be entering the

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:27.440
demo in a little bit.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:31.640
And he said, "Okay,
I got your Lego robot ready."

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.860
Everyone knows what these
Lego Mindstorm robots are,

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.480
right?

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:38.420
Who has -- how many people
here have one of these?

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:39.280
Okay, cool.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.080
You'll like the demo coming up.

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:44.270
So he says, "I got it,
and when you're giving this talk,

00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:45.030
just page me.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:48.310
And to page me,
just click on this button." And here's

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:53.800
a little QuickTime type in a thing,
so... RoboTime.

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:58.510
And I just hit Enter, and it says, "Oop,
page set." And so this is a simple little

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:03.740
application that talks to the server,
and basically it's using a little, um,

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.580
email module that I have
that I use with QuickTime.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.740
So you can actually make a
whole QuickTime -- I mean,

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.580
email client in QuickTime if you want.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.150
But here, this is just a little pager.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:15.260
You don't have -- that
person can send you a,

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:18.850
um -- like, a technician can send you,
like, little technical specs

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.090
on something and say,
"If these aren't right,

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:23.580
just page me and tell me what -- or,
like,

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.400
just page me and tell me what your phone
number is," or something like this,

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.490
and put that into a PDF file,
put that into a word processing file,

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:30.780
or into the email client.

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:32.720
They don't have to give
you their pager number.

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:36.950
Um, and also,
I can have it so that it only works once.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.870
So you have one time to page me,
and that's it.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.880
And then never -- leave me alone.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.790
Um...

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:52.510
So you're saying, OK,
you can have a movie talk to a server,

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.800
and you can have a server
talk back to a movie.

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:59.500
Can't we have interactive
games in QuickTime?

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:03.640
Two people on different QuickTime movies
both talking to the servers,

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.100
servers talking and telling
you what each other are doing.

00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.100
And sure, you can do that.

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:12.280
So here is a, this is not a game,
but this is a little chat program that

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:16.090
I made completely done in QuickTime.

00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:20.090
See how many people are on this chat.

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:23.700
Nine people.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:25.050
Joe, see there's RCX Joe.

00:59:25.050 --> 00:59:28.220
He's sitting on there waiting
for me to come see what...

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:46.800
Bruce Brunser didn't have much to say.

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:49.010
So how is this useful?

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:57.290
Well, again, instead of putting a pdf,
putting a pager inside of a pdf document,

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:12.900
[Transcript missing]

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:26.120
So,
you can put a chat client in a PDF thing,

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.260
or you can put a chat
client within a movie,

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.440
within a streaming movie,
a live streaming movie.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:35.900
You can have, MTV could have this new
band replacing NSYNC,

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:39.120
and they're going to
have this new live video,

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.200
and you can talk to them while they're
performing the video or whatever.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.110
I guess they don't perform videos, but...

01:00:46.700 --> 01:01:43.600
[Transcript missing]

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:49.900
[Transcript missing]

01:01:52.600 --> 01:02:05.300
[Transcript missing]

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.600
I'm about to show you here.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:15.600
It's going to blow your minds if
you guys like LEGOs like I do.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.840
So what I've made right here is a, well,
I don't have the whole

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.640
interface here for you,
but what we've made is a

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:26.960
complete LEGO programming
interface all within QuickTime.

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:37.430
Many of you know that when LEGO decided
to come out with their fancy

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:41.930
Mindstorms, Robot, they said, "Oh,
we'll just make it PC only."

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:48.450
And they came out with a
Windows version of this LEGO thing,

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:52.340
and OnNOTCD didn't have any Mac version,
which made me mad since I was one

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:55.790
of the first people to get one and
I don't have a Windows machine.

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:59.600
I said,
"I can't program my LEGOs." So I built

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:03.600
a QuickTime LEGO programmer.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.910
And it has all the same functions.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.650
and it's a little buggy so
I didn't put the whole thing

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:15.920
but I have two pre-built movies.

01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:17.960
Very simple,
I didn't want anything to go wrong

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:21.700
so I just have to go forward,
on, turn the motor on,

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:22.960
wait for a little while and turn off.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.400
There's the first movie, let's try it.

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:26.800
Okay, let's see.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.400
Program 1.

01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:30.720
Here it goes, loading.

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:32.530
Run.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:36.900
Oh, there it goes.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.120
Okay.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:37.890
It took a couple seconds.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.020
Maybe... Oh, Bill Gates!

01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:45.170
Wait, what's he doing there?

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.170
Okay.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.310
He says now he's sad because now
Mac people can play with robots remotely.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:54.170
I have to tell you that this streaming
server is coming from Chicago.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.200
My friend Joe is in Chicago and
he helped me set this up.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.200
And this robot is also
in Chicago obviously.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.600
So let's run that program again.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:05.200
It was a little bit faster.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:11.160
So this shows that the program
downloaded and it should get executed.

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:13.200
So there's, who's that, Janet Reno?

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.200
And now let's go the
other reverse direction.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.230
Program 2,
it says turn the motors to reverse.

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.230
On, wait.

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:22.940
and TurnOff.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.200
Go back again to Bill Gates.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:25.200
OK.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:29.390
So, basically...

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:38.810
and So basically this is
what I had to show you.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:44.120
And I hope that opens your minds a
little bit about what QuickTime can

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:49.160
do and the possibilities and how you
might want to use QuickTime in ways

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.260
that you haven't thought of before.

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:54.140
And it can talk to a server.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.340
And it does it in a most awesome way.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.300
We didn't let you down, did we?

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.530
The guy's incredible.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:23.070
And on behalf of at least
four QuickTime engineers,

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:27.250
myself included,
we ran out and bought the

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:33.740
LEGO Mindstorms when it first came out,
and we also have the boxes

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.160
sitting around our offices going,
"Okay, now what?" So that's -- thank you,

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.160
Matthew.

01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:45.780
So, to recap,
a lot of what we discussed today

01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:51.110
you can find in Steve Gooley's
book QuickTime for the Web.

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:55.780
I'm usually not a salesman pushing this,
but this is like a great book.

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:59.570
I have a torn up copy in my office
that was before it went to press

01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:02.860
and all kind of pages all over.

01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:05.900
It's QuickTime for the Web,
and this is just out.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.900
And it comes with CD and
examples in the back.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.820
It's just wonderful.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:13.450
I highly recommend it.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:21.100
So, a few more QuickTime sessions
coming up later this afternoon

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:21.900
and tomorrow morning.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.290
There's actually another
one tomorrow afternoon.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.490
WebObjects, like I said, every day,
all day, in Hall J.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:51.300
[Transcript missing]

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.030
with the impressive title of
QuickTime Technology Manager.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.700
He will answer all your questions
and direct you in the right path.

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:05.340
And thank you for coming.
