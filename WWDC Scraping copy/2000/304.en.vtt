[Transcript missing]

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.360
My name is Kaz Ohta.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.660
Myself and a few more people will
talk about the interactive aspects

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.140
of QuickTime in this session.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.700
I was told that there is simultaneous
translation going into Japanese,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.230
which is my primary language.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.980
So I'm kind of curious how many of
you actually understand Japanese.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.980
Just raise your hand.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.700
Quite a few.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.800
Well, I guess I'm going to
try speaking Japanese.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.480
Ohayou gozaimasu.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.830
Nihongo de ikimashou ka?

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.300
Well, I don't think the translation
goes the other way around,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.810
so I'm going to speak in English.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.600
Anyway, I'd like to spend a few more
time talking about some of the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.700
Halberd overview of interactivity.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.440
So in this WWDC,
the interactivity has already

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.070
gotten a lot of exposure.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.360
How many of you went to
the keynote on Monday?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.340
Good.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.510
Where Steve Jobs showed a demo
of our new fully immersive

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.400
panorama projection engine.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.320
How about the QuickTime overview
session on Monday afternoon?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.000
Very good.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.070
Where Tim Schaaf talked about
interactivity and Jim Batson showed

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.840
a few very interesting demos.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.010
And I'm sure those of you who went to
the software technology and scripting

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.120
session yesterday were amazed with the
stuff Matthew Peterson put together,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.450
which actually pushed the interactivity
technology to the extreme.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.400
I'm sure nobody in the
QuickTime engineering team

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.660
had imagined that you could
do that much with QuickTime.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.280
So I think you already have a
pretty much good idea about what a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.320
QuickTime movie can do in order to
deliver interactive user experience.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.770
So what we're going to do in this
session is to pick a few specific

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.280
features and take a closer look,
and then talk about how you

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.440
can take advantage of it.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.620
So what we're going to talk about is the
kinds of user experience you can provide

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.080
through the interactivity features.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.630
And we also are going to talk about some
of the tools and techniques you can use.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.830
Some of these things are
already available to you,

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.640
so you can try them out today.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.720
And some are things we're
working on right now.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.050
Of course, we try hard so that these
new things become available

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.460
to you as soon as possible,
but don't try them at home yet.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.180
So for those of you who are
already familiar with some

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.600
of the details of QuickTime,
these are kinds of things

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.570
we call interactivity.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.300
And how those pieces fit together can be
shown conceptually as in this diagram.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.440
We have the foundation of
QuickTime Core at the very bottom.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.430
And we have a few services which provide
additional interactivity to your media.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.540
And we have a set of standard
interactive media like sprite,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.580
flash, VR object, and VR panorama.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.510
And on top of all of these,
we have the movie controller,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.290
which works as the interface to the user.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.690
By having the standard
movie controller here,

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.480
we can provide consistent user
experience across various kinds of media.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.210
And I think you learned some of
the techniques you can support

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.300
streaming movies better in
your playback application.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.540
And I think Kevin Kofun did an excellent
summary of some of the techniques and

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.400
tips and techniques in your application.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.750
And the important thing is that many
of the things which allows streaming,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.790
which supports streaming movies better,
these kind of things works for

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.000
interactivity movies better.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.760
So please remember that.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.900
So what is interactivity?

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.680
Here's how we define it.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:23.160
It is not driven by time,
but driven by events generated by user.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.880
A good example is a slideshow like this.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.870
It goes forward.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.140
and Backward based on your action
through the keyboard or mouse or

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.290
a remote control device like this.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.800
[Transcript missing]

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.910
The key element here is that
the media react in response

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.280
to your action in real time.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.510
A good example is a
QuickTime VR panorama,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.850
where you can change the view in
panorama based on your action.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.530
One more important thing I'd like
to talk about is the ability to

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.010
navigate through a media composition.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.190
One of the strengths of QuickTime is
to be able to combine various

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.250
kinds of media into a single
composition or single container.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.710
And in that case,
it is a natural consequence

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.100
that you would like to have
control over combined media.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.480
In that case,
the way those media are composed

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.640
is specific to a presentation.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.770
The presentation has to provide
a way to control these media.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.420
This is where the
interactivity comes into play.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.410
You can think of a presentation
which has a couple of video clips,

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.440
each of which has its own controller.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:08.460
Movie embedding is something
you can use in order to provide

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.500
this kind of user experience.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.620
We're going to talk about movie
embedding later in this session.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.820
Now,
I'd like to spend a few more minutes to

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.190
talk about the levels of interactivity.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.640
which will help us classifying
broad range of interactive user

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.200
experiences and help us set the right
focus across these user experiences.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:44.180
Examples of media which have least
level of interactivity are things like

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.990
traditional TV broadcasting and cinema.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.620
You basically sit back and
relax in front of your screen,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.960
and all you do is to push
one of a few control buttons.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.380
And I think you would want to have
a large cup of soda and popcorn.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.490
I guess you'd call it
a couchy potato style,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.040
is that right?

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.200
Well, I think that in this case you would
need potato chips instead of popcorns,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.140
but that doesn't really matter.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:28.690
Surfing the net would require a
little bit more interactivity.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.500
Nothing would happen if you were sitting
stationary in front of your computer.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.240
You locate the links on the
web page and then click them

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.500
in order to get things going.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.520
I think that requires a
little bit more calories,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.040
so I guess you want to have a couple
of pieces of pizza in addition.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:57.180
And things that require the
highest level of interactivity

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.620
and engagement are video games.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:06.570
I think it is likely that you are
leaning forward towards your screen and

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.620
tightly holding your control device.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:16.080
I don't think you have time to bite
something in the middle of the game.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.070
So this may be a kind
of starving experience.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.630
So where are the QuickTime focuses?

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:36.480
We think our focus is mid to
high level of interactivity.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.250
Our goal is to provide the
level of interactivity which

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:46.830
goes beyond the traditional web
browsing based on hypertext.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.640
We'd like to have that level
of interactivity with more

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.060
dynamic kinds of media.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.010
And we want your experience
not to be so starving.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.480
And the other thing is
the media composition.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.430
As I mentioned,
combining multiple kinds of media

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.640
into a single container is one
of the strengths of QuickTime.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.670
And we continue to focus on that.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.830
And you can add some sort of
interactive behavior to your media

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.230
object through wired actions.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:27.480
And I think this is another
big advantage of QuickTime.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.560
And of course,
the primary means of sharing your

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.810
media content is the Internet.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:44.640
So we continue to work on this area so
that you can provide more interactive

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.990
experience through the internet.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.760
So what exactly you'll
learn in this session?

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.580
We're going to talk about a
couple of the interactive features

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.880
you can have access to today.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.740
The first thing is some of the
tricks and techniques you can use

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.960
within QuickTime VR and Flash.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.500
And the other thing is
the movie embedding.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.740
In which you can do some interesting
things combining your media.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.080
And then we're going to talk
about a couple of new things

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.150
we are working on right now.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.660
The first one is the extension to
our Panorama projection engine,

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.650
for which Steve showed a
demo on Monday's keynote.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.630
And the other thing is the
extensions to Word Actions,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.040
which helps your movie to
communicate with the server.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.870
We're going to show some demos
using WebObjects on this topic.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.830
So I'd like to have Eric Blaenpied
to come up and talk about some of the

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.490
techniques you can use in VR and Flash.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.210
Eric?

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.760
Thank you, Kaz.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.200
Good morning.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.190
So I'm a content guy in
the QuickTime team working

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.740
on interactive stuff.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.470
And I wound up,
right today I'm going to be talking to

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.470
you about things that we can do already,
stuff that you can go home and work with.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:27.130
First off,
existing QuickTime VR panoramas

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.130
and object movies

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.600
Since we released QuickTime VR,
the main thing that we've stressed is

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.240
the ability to do these 360 degree views
from the inside and from the outside.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.490
Pretty much referring to them
as scenes or panoramas when

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.300
you're looking from the inside.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.230
And we've referred to them almost
as objects when you're looking

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.220
at a thing from the outside in.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.110
And lately we've been sort of trying
to point out that on the web with

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.280
all of the product work going on,
thinking of objects and products

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.300
is a really good approach.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.810
Of course, panoramas or scenes can be of
things that are products for sale,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.300
such as houses and all.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.760
But generally speaking,
the stuff that you're selling with

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.920
this sort of interactivity would be...

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.870
products you can hold, or, well,
cars you can't hold,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.690
but there's a lot of work
done with cars as well.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.760
The other major things that we
use in the interactive parts

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:28.240
of QuickTime are sprite movies,
which consist of mainly bitmap artwork,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:33.300
or sometimes vector artwork as well,
that winds up getting downloaded and

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.930
used and transformed and so forth,
as opposed to having

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.200
multiple frames in a movie.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:45.050
And flash tracks,
which involve Macromedia's

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.900
excellent graphics engine,
allowing us to

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.340
do vector-based artwork that's
quite sophisticated and composite

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.480
in interesting ways with
other QuickTime media types.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.080
And then finally,
we build wired movies using any

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.210
and all of these technologies,
adding actions to the

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.270
various different elements,
adding URL links and

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.370
other sorts of things,
adding deep interactivity in many ways,

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.710
the kind of stuff that a few
years ago we really had to use

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.390
dedicated authoring environments
and playback environments for.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.600
But now, with QuickTime's interactivity,
it can happen anywhere.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:31.550
A big deal about VR movies
on the web has been

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.950
People have complained about their size,
especially with the objects.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.500
And a big issue with a lot of it
is actually more of a perceived

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.700
speed than an actual speed.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.250
We've got various different
ways of adding preview tracks

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:52.290
and reordering the data in the
file so that it will come down.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.620
As it comes down, you get to see a really
meaningful representation of the

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.660
scene or the object right away.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.520
With the panoramas,
we've got preview tracks,

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.610
so you get a low resolution
view of the whole thing.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.480
And then the tiles come in,
alternating in front of your

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.720
main view so that very quickly
you get to see what's there.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.030
And hotspots are active
almost immediately as well.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.140
With objects,
people take advantage of it.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:23.200
With objects, we can reorder the views so
that as the object comes down,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.170
the first four views are the front, back,
left, and right, so that you can see all

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.350
the sides of the object,
pretty much immediately.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:35.390
And then as more data is downloaded,
the panning nearly becomes smoother.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.670
You see more and more
incremental views between them.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:45.200
So these are ways in which a
slightly larger size file can

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.120
wind up giving you a much higher
quality experience for the user.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.980
And the sort of thing that you can
only do with the photorealistic

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.280
renderings or photographic media
that we make up VR movies with,

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:04.720
as opposed to any kind of a 3D
sort of VR kind of approach.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.030
And then there's a lot of
interesting things going on

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.030
with adding value to VR movies.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.230
We can add links to the hotspots
that can be simple URL links,

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.990
or we can do more sophisticated things
with links and frames and so forth.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.890
People are adding sound
and maps to help navigate,

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.130
and just building them into
more complicated presentations,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.000
either using HTML and various
sorts of techniques like that,

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.210
or by using the QuickTime interactivity
that we've got to build movies

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.200
that are sophisticated and can
play right in the QuickTime player

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.880
or anywhere else that QuickTime plays.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.520
So, I guess I just talked about
the FastArt exporter a bit.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.330
The FastArt exporter is a
free component from Apple,

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.770
which is available in our
developer tools section.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:17:00.520
Drop it in your system folder and
use it with QuickTime Player Pro to

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.080
export your VR movie,
whether it's an object or a pano,

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:09.240
as long as it's a single node,
and get those sort of FastArt benefits

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.820
that I was mentioning.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.690
There are approaches to do it for
multi-node movies using... First off,

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.230
you can take a large multi-node movie
and run it through a third-party tool

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:28.990
such as Deliverator or Converter,
which are from VR Tools,

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:33.790
to provide the sort of same
preview tracks and so forth.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.070
In my mind,
that sort of defeats some of the

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.080
power of the internet and all,
because still the user's got to

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.100
download the entire movie to view it.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.700
And if it's a multi-node file and
they don't choose to visit every node,

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.600
they waste a lot of download time.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.830
So it's simple to link the
multi-node movies as single,

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.990
separate nodes using the
URL links within your page.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.600
And then the users only view
the nodes they will go to.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.700
They get the hotspots pretty much
immediately upon seeing a preview track.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.040
And you can have a pretty responsive
internet experience there.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:16.270
So let's go over to this demo machine
and look at a bit of this stuff.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:33.700
[Transcript missing]

00:18:43.600 --> 00:19:01.800
[Transcript missing]

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:14.150
Davo Photographic does, for instance,
he's put a VR object right in here,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.990
a rather unusual VR object
into his main VR page.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.770
You may recognize if you
spent time looking at

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:32.020
out at the various sites on the web,
his work, such as the...

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.600
and this PT Cruiser by Chrysler and all.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.260
He's done a somewhat
non-standard view here.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.210
Let's look at one that's
more of a normal rotation.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.070
This one isn't standard either.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.700
Okay, so he's done some interesting crane
work here to make it rotate around.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.460
But these are the sort of

00:19:53.110 --> 00:20:03.410
are all using the same technology,
but they're using a

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.650
different kind of media.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:08.650
The same kind of media
that's used in the past.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.930
That involves an object
as the starting point.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:21.450
And then he's got some
panoramic views in here as well.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.480
So we come around,
we can check out the engine, come around,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:33.180
zoom in on the interior,
and then all the way around it.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:53.200
[Transcript missing]

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:00.900
VR is obviously excellent
for architectural work.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.890
Here he's done it without the preview,
so we saw the

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:20.900
[Transcript missing]

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.780
extend the experience by really
building it into a more complete

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.400
interactive sort of thing.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.520
I'm going to a site done
by Dennis Glicksman,

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.520
a French VR author.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:47.490
are all very good at this.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:47.490
I'm going to give you a quick
overview of the features that

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.580
So this one, well we were on T1,
so it was hard, or T3 or whatever it is,

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.200
it was hard to tell,
but there was a preview

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.600
track there for a moment.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.510
The tiles loaded on over it so quickly.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.590
Let's pop to another view.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.770
And he's got a map over here with
JavaScript kind of stuff going on to

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.520
determine what node you're going to see.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:17.860
So this is a good example of using
the QuickTime VR with existing

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.510
HTML approaches to try and,
um,

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.290
to make for a much more
interactive experience,

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:30.270
which is giving a lot more information
to the user than just... than...

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:36.600
Then just the panorama
on its own as an example.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:43.670
From there, to sort of go up the path
a little bit into more

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:58.700
[Transcript missing]

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.940
and other engineers have been involved
in the development of QuickTime VR.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.520
There's some directional sound
here that they added probably

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.760
with the Squamish tools.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:16.540
Squamish Media makes a tool called
SoundSaver for adding directional

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.060
and ambient sounds to VR movies.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.160
And down here they have
another QuickTime movie.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.160
This whole rectangular region at the
bottom is another QuickTime movie,

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.260
which is interacting
with the panorama above,

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.630
which can be changed either
through... I think there's

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.160
some hotspot links in here.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:42.160
And the movie down below doesn't change,
but it continues to interact with it.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.260
The compass is there, the controls,
and the map,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.190
which we can click on to... I believe
we can click on the map to change modes.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.190
Maybe not.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.130
So this is, again,
we're not in a separate player,

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.330
but we've used multiple QuickTime movies
talking to each other with

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:04.700
intermovie communication to
really up the interactive experience

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:10.250
and make it less than just,
let's look at a movie there.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.740
Another good example of
that by a Swedish developer,

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:22.840
a lot of European stuff going on
that's pretty fascinating here,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:22.880
is...

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.860
are all part of the QuickTime team.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.640
They're all part of the QuickTime team.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.430
So,
we're going to be working with them to

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.900
develop a new version of QuickTime VR.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.900
So,
we're going to be working with them to

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:40.900
develop a new version of QuickTime VR.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:40.900
So,
we're going to be working with them to

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:40.900
develop a new version of QuickTime VR.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:51.360
The VR Movie is embedded into a sprite
track which has got the meters for

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.900
the sound and rollover information.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.890
In fact, and again a controller here.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.890
You click on info and get some
rollover information about,

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.890
I believe we got some

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.570
Right, we can click on these people and
get information about who they are.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.040
It doesn't zoom on them.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:15.980
The movie on the right, the compass,
is giving us feedback similar

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.630
to the one we just saw.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.030
So this is an even more complicated
example of intermovie communication.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:30.800
And then they've got
some other things like...

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:37.870
are all working on the
new QuickTime games.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:46.420
and Eric Blazow are all here.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:46.420
I'm going to take a look
at the other slides.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.890
all animated.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.720
I believe they're building their
stuff mainly with Live Stage Pro,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.260
which you guys are probably
hearing a certain amount about.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:57.260
So that's, um,

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:06.000
Let's take a quick view
of that sort of thing.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.300
Let's go a little further here.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:18.260
This one's from a German developer,
Tim and Hample.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.020
and he is building his interactive
experience with... This is

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.440
all one big QuickTime movie.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.320
It's launching in the browser,
but it could just as well

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.590
be playing in the player.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:38.250
And he's got a number of segments of
movies that jump from one to the next.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.950
They're loading different
tracks at different points here.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.800
Here we've got a VR movie that's masked.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.030
You'll notice the corners are rounded.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.680
He's got a track on top with
an alpha channel providing

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.500
for a non-rectangular frame.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.500
That's something I think is
really unique to what we can do,

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.500
is the ability to layer up the
tracks and do that sort of masking.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.900
Not only can we break out of
the 4:3 window that people seem

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.280
to think video has to be in,
but we can make it

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.500
non-rectangular as well.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.490
Composition would be
much more interesting.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.500
The sprites over here allow
for panning and so forth.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.500
Then we can navigate the different
parts of the hotel this way.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.830
I believe that we go outside here
and he's got linear movies of

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:29.970
beach activities and so forth,
which are also going to

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.710
play framed like that.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.480
This is clearly a high bandwidth demo.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.300
So the arrows don't do anything
because the frame has changed the same.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.500
But the idea is that you've got
an interactive environment here

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.890
that is really the sort of thing
that a couple years ago you'd be

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.750
building in director or something.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.890
Finally, a last one,
also by Tilman Hample of

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.400
Actum Film in Germany.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.180
This is a simple demo,
but it shows something that I like

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.390
to show about just combining
these different media types.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:11.510
We start out with a
walkthrough into the store.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.660
We get to the end and he uses an
action at the end of the movie to

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.600
tell it to load a different movie.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.070
It's a panorama of the
interior of the store.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.800
We've got an object in front
of us that has a hotspot we can

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.040
click on once it's loaded here.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:30.490
We click on that object and the object
movie is there composited into a frame

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:35.150
of the panorama so that you get the
object in place as opposed to being a

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.550
real jarring place where you got out of
it all and then there's a way to jump

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.100
back into the store and pan around there.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:47.990
Alright,
so maybe we'll go back to the slides now.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.200
So, a bit about Flash.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.130
A few of those movies
had some Flash elements,

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.600
but mainly that was bitmap work.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.070
Macromedia's done an excellent job
of developing a really first-class

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.700
graphics engine for doing vector artwork.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:12.690
This is great because of the
small download footprint.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:18.680
Also, so many of the creative artists out
there have a lot of work and skill

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.450
with vector artwork programs like
Illustrator and Freehand that they

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.690
can leverage into doing work in Flash.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.880
And it's even becoming a bigger deal
with Adobe releasing their Live Motion,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:37.120
which will allow people with familiarity
with the Adobe sort of tools to leverage

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.700
that into doing motion graphics.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.460
And the motion graphics people use
After Effects and all to leverage

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.610
that into doing Flash work as well.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.700
So I think Flash is just
going to keep going,

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:50.700
and we've announced
support of the Flash app.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.250
We've announced support
of the Flash 4 format,

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.680
and we're going to just
keep working with it.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.780
It also, we've...

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.760
have done a fair amount of work
to make the Flash movies composite

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.680
really nicely with QuickTime.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:10.490
All the transparency that you get in a
Flash movie is there in the Flash track

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.560
when you've imported it into QuickTime.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.680
And if you layer it with
other QuickTime media,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.950
you can set the transparency to alpha.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.540
You get all that selective
transparency and partial transparency

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.240
in your composition there,
and you can have things

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.590
play through it and all.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.010
Um, so, that,
there's a lot of work you can

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:32.100
do with the animation there.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.360
Um, and not only-- and again,
I think that's an exciting thing

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.800
about the Adobe Live Motion thing,
is that, um, the power of the,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.290
the work that Adobe's done
with After Effects and all

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.220
in developing animation tools
will be available now for,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.800
um, as an alternative approach
to the Flash authoring tools.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.780
So there's gonna be two good tools
now for doing animation with Flash.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:00.900
Um, also, it scales beautifully,
and you can build big interfaces with

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:05.300
QuickTime using Flash elements that
don't take any more time to download

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.800
than if they were scaled small.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.800
So you can quit having to think of
your thing as going in a small window.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.300
You can have a nice big
window with maybe the video.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.800
You've gotta worry about the bandwidth
'cause you're going for a modem speed.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.130
But that doesn't mean that your
presentation has to be small.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.300
Um, and then-- Flash has a fair
amount of scripting in it.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.430
Um, there's the various actions to
allow you to do various different

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.290
things with Flash elements.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.140
But, um,

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.730
And that stuff is carried
across in QuickTime.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.780
When you bring a Flash movie
into QuickTime with actions,

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.620
those get mapped to
QuickTime's own actions,

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.970
and you get the same interactivity there.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:48.510
And you can get into combining it with
other media types and adding further

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.310
interactivity to the Flash track as well.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.000
So, as you may have been hearing,
I'm big on combining the media types.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.500
I have a multimedia background
and doing the CD-ROM work and all.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.420
And I'm really excited to be
able to really make these things

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.570
as complex as possible and use
the elements that you need,

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.500
use the technologies you need for the
elements that they make sense for.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.930
So we've got the sprites that
I was talking about that are great

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:20.290
for having buttons and bitmap
kind of things or doing stuff that

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.440
is best done in bitmap artwork.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.570
We've got VR for doing,
QuickTime VR for doing the

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.500
scenes and the objects.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:38.500
And Flash, providing a good scalable
animation tool that's vector-based.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.500
And then all these other kinds
of QuickTime media as well.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.130
Like the streaming media,
whether it's fast start

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:51.120
streaming or the RTSP streaming,
whether it's coming off a

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:57.490
regular HTTP server or a
QuickTime streaming server.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.500
And then text and other things.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:05.520
All of these media can very
nicely go together in QuickTime.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.500
There's plenty of ways to control
these different elements once they

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.710
get put together with interactivity.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.880
It's very possible to use QuickTime now
to create very custom players which

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:25.030
will play with a very minimal amount
of the branding from QuickTime,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.740
which a lot of content
developers really want.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.000
They want to have their identity
be the thing that gets put forward.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.430
And pretty much once you finish
seeing the QuickTime queue load,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.340
you can take over the presentation
from there and have it be your thing,

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.490
the way you want it to be.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:45.830
And then use the QuickTime wiring
to make these into wired movies and

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.400
make them really do a whole lot.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.850
So let's look at a little bit of that.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:03.600
Let's see.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:11.590
So the Swedish company Berserk,
I showed earlier, has done something

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:11.590
which is perhaps not the

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:17.940
This is going to be seen as incredibly...
it's not like an MTV kind of demo.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:25.660
This is one where the city council of
a small town decided to use the web

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.200
to broadcast their council meetings.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.400
And they hired the company to
build an interface for this.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.160
So they're using MoviesOffice
streaming server,

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:41.200
which this is archived,
but it was done live.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:47.160
And the track on the left here with
the text tracks can allow you to

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:51.200
index around within the presentation.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.200
The agenda is shown here.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:59.200
There's information about the
different parties involved.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:04.200
They've got interactive control of the
movie in a straightforward way over here.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.200
And there's a setup for commentary here.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.370
The users,
upon clicking this bit of text here,

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:20.190
I guess it says click here,
to launch into a form for sending

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.930
an email to the presentation
as it's going on to discuss...

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.990
are all using QuickTime to
add their input.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
So this was a very interactive use
of QuickTime to get some work done.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:40.330
Then we'll look at a couple of things.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.870
So this is a couple of
flash tracks in a VR movie.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.860
We can pan around here
and view this stuff.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:56.490
We've got Flash composited
over the QuickTime movie.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.820
are all over the VR movie and
with animation going and all,

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.010
we've got interactive buttons over
here which are in the flash track

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:13.320
which send actions to the VR movie
to change to a different view.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.370
This is just sort of a...

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.300
A simple art example,
but you could get much more

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.390
sophisticated than this.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:19.400
I mean,

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.300
There's nothing going on here
but sending actions from the

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.100
VR movie to the flash track.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.100
That could easily be done where we
could do things based on pan angle

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.620
or hotspot clicks or whatever to make
stuff go on back in the flash track

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.890
to change what you're seeing there,
give information about the view.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:40.000
This consists of primarily three tracks.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:44.220
The background, which is Flash,
and the VR movies layered on top of that.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.860
And then there's another
Flash track on top,

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:53.870
which is set to alpha.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:53.890
If you want to just put
together a movie with

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.040
A QuickTime track on
top of a Flash track,

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.570
you can very easily do that
in the Flash 4 authoring tool,

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:04.280
importing a QuickTime movie
and working with it there,

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.200
and then using Flash's publish
settings to publish this QuickTime.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:11.150
And that will make a Flash track
and QuickTime tracks with whatever

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.200
QuickTime you had imported.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.160
If you want to get into this sort of
thing where you're layering it up,

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.200
then you need to assemble
it somewhere else.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.610
You can do that in Live Stage Pro,
which allows you to

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.200
bring in the VR tracks,
the Flash tracks, and so on,

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.520
layer them up, set their graphics modes,
and add things like the

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:33.150
actions on these buttons,
which change the node of

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.200
the VR movie at some point.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.390
This is a simple demo.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:49.760
So that's a simple sort of player...
I think we'll go from here back

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.260
to the slides and I'll talk about
another way that we can get more

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.900
sophisticated with our players.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:01.330
The thing that happened
there was we had to...

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:06.160
We had to have the media that was
being played in the player really be

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.200
an integral part of the presentation.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.310
We had to author it all together.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.000
And had to get the rates
all to match and so forth.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:20.460
In 4.1 we added movie tracks
through the movie media handler,

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.250
which allow you to make a new
kind of track in the movie which

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.000
uses for its media another movie.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
And these movies can be linked together
without their time bases being slaved.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.980
In other words,
we have separate clocks finally.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:38.930
And that was something that in the past
was always necessary to go to a separate

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:46.000
authoring and runtime environments
where you could have multiple movies.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
And then there was, the other thing about
this is reference media.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
It doesn't have to be
built into the movie.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.990
It can be referenced in a number of ways.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.270
So we'll have a demo of that.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.700
This movie was shown earlier in
one of the QuickTime sessions as an

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:15.100
example of putting something into
iShell to get a non-rectangular mask.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.960
But it was just dropped
in there as a movie.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.090
The movie itself has quite
a lot going on with it.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.880
We've got the movie region,
quite obviously,

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:36.230
has got a movie track in it,
which we can control.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.640
Fast Forward, Stop, Play, Step Forward.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.600
I just downloaded these movies
before the presentation,

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:48.130
threw them in the folder here,
and named them Content 1, Content 2.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:51.580
I can have up to eight movies
here with the names set up

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.770
with those sort of names,
and they get controlled

00:39:55.770 --> 00:40:01.200
sequentially by this sprite here,
which chooses what track you're getting.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.640
It's one movie track,
but it's a number of

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.200
different references.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.180
This control determines which
reference we're picking,

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.320
and we'll get the same one over and
over again for the rest of the clicks,

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.200
because I only put two movies in.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.690
We also made this player
something where you can change

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.200
the interface just for fun.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:28.170
So that's an example of the kind
of player that you can't build.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.200
I think it would be pretty
hard to build anywhere else.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.200
And you can deliver it in QuickTime.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.190
Obviously this one is non-rectangular.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.460
You would want to have them these
days in a more integral sort of

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.200
appearance to make it work better,
but that's how that can work.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.700
So if we go back to the slides now.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.550
The final thing I want to talk
about is something that a lot

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.340
of content developers have been
worried about for some time,

00:40:55.340 --> 00:41:00.070
which was the ability to reliably
detect whether QuickTime was installed

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:04.100
on a machine in the browser before
they gave the user the content.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.090
We've incrementally
added a number of pieces.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:13.290
With JavaScript,
people can do a fair amount of testing.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.090
I've always been able to
in some of the browsers,

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:19.960
in the Netscape browsers and so forth.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:42:55.400

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.300
Hi there, I'm Sean.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.010
I'm going to be talking
about two things today.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:10.150
First thing is embedded movies,
this new feature with QuickTime 4.1.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.750
There's a lot of things you
can do with embedded movies

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.290
that aren't maybe obvious.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.300
QuickTime has always supported
multiple spatial tracks.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.440
In a way, a lot of people ask,
"Don't you already do multiple movies

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:29.290
at once?" But the time bases there are
all synchronized to the same clock.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:31.300
That would be one major difference.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.300
Some of the advantages
of embedded movies.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:40.290
One thing is that it's sort
of like frames in a web page.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.300
I mean, frames,
you can download just part of a web page.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:48.800
So with a movie with embedded movies,
you can bring in just

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.300
part of a sub-movie,
basically.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:54.280
That also gives you, you know, redrawing.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.290
You're not redrawing the whole movie.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.270
So you can swap things in.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:02.520
You can have less redrawing happen.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:07.140
It also lets you factor out
sort of reusable components.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:13.340
Like you can create movie controllers
that have custom looks and reuse

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.690
them with any movie that you want to.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:20.750
I mentioned multiple clocks,
so you can have, say,

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.810
Eric just showed an example
with a movie being loaded and

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.420
controlled within the same movie.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.960
There's also some technical
implementation things that are going

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.570
on with the movie media handler that
make it nice to actually go between

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.310
two different movies in a row.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:45.500
So the movie track is what
is used to implement this.

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:49.260
The movie media handler is a
new media handler with POR1.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.640
Basically,
each sample defines properties.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:58.060
Since movies are complex, I mean,
they have spatial audio

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.260
and timing properties.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.510
There's properties in the movie
media handler that you can set

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.260
to deal with all these things.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.230
Another thing about the movie
media handler is that it has

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.260
a list of data references.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.950
So basically one sample in a movie
track can have a whole list of

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.710
movies and you can just tell it,
"Okay,

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:22.260
I want to use this movie at this time."
So that's how you can swap things in.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.260
And it's actually dynamic as well.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:29.330
So if we take a look at a...

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.020
Sample Movie here.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.140
This movie, the whole slide's one movie.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.360
It's got four tracks.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.600
The first track's a movie track.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.580
We've got three samples,
so that could reference

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.590
three different movies.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.600
And then we've got a background picture,
a sprite track, and a flash track.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:50.600
The yellow timeline shows
what's actually alive or active.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.750
So we see that you have multiple
movie samples in a way that's sort of

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:58.600
like a HyperCard page or something.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.420
At this time that is current,
you only have the background

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.420
picture and the first movie alive.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:08.530
If we go to the next time, well,
the first movie's gone,

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.590
but the second movie sample activates.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.540
And in addition, now we can have sprites.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.290
QuickTime VR Of course,
these things can be layered how

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:21.430
you want and arranged on the page
however you want in the movie.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.940
Of course, and then third time,
the sprites are gone and we have Flash.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:33.500
So if we kind of zoom in
on the movie layout here,

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:39.520
We see that, well,
the first movie sample actually

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.800
is referencing a movie that
has a video and audio track.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.930
Now notice there's two timelines now,
because these don't have

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.830
to be slaved together.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:51.490
You can actually have them independent.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:51.490
So that

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.520
SubMovie can have its own clock and
can be controlled via wired actions

00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.780
if you want to start and stop it,
change the rate, and so on.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:06.500
You can opt to actually slave the time
bases if that's what you want to do.

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:12.980
So a movie sample, as I mentioned,
has multiple data references.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.960
So here we have a movie sample
that's pre-authored to have three

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.970
different movies that it can
reference just by changing a property.

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:27.810
But it's also dynamic,
so we can add another movie.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:32.060
We'll be showing some demos
later of how this can be useful.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.030
But at runtime,
you can actually add or replace

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:39.280
any data reference in its list,
and then you can actually say, "Hey,

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.600
set the current movie to that."

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.910
Since all the movies are data reference,
they can be pointing in

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:52.780
sequence to the same media,
actually, if you want.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.670
It doesn't have to be
all loaded into memory.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:04.230
So the movie media has some settings
that you might want to check out if

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.240
you're building movies like this.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.930
Basically,
you can opt to slave properties the time,

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.830
the duration, meaning the sample's
already got a duration,

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:19.400
and the movie's got a duration,
so how do you... Do you scale?

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.130
It's like adding scaled
in QuickTime Player.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:28.430
Audio properties can be slaved,
like the volume or the balance.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:32.670
Graphics mode can be slaved,
so it just... it gets

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.750
set to the parent movie.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:40.900
And then there's some settings
for spatial dimensions as well.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:44.480
And I'll be showing you
some examples of that later.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:50.800
So actually, now,
so if we go over to the demo machine.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:12.770
So first of all,
I'm just going to show you-- here's a

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:15.810
simple movie that just has color patches.

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:21.510
And these are the sizes of the
movie tracks in this movie.

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:25.400
And then we're going to
take our mascot here.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.410
And we're going to basically see what
happens to him when we reference him as

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.900
a sub-movie using various scaling modes.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.350
So I can close those down.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:38.540
I'll leave that one up.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.430
So first of all, the scroll mode

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.480
is in some ways probably the most,
what you'd expect the most.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.540
It basically does not
scale the nested movie,

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:54.800
but does clip it.

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:59.960
So here we see that that's going on.

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.800
Second mode.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:09.400
The camera actually just stretches
the movie to fill the entire thing.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.270
So he's very full down here.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.280
He's not so full over here.

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:19.230
There's sample code out on the
website right now that you can

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:25.700
check out that lets you build
embedded movies and actually play

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.910
with all these different settings.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:36.300
So, meet, basically we see that it gets
stretched until it meets an edge.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:41.440
And slice is fairly similar,
except it will stretch until it fills

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.290
the whole region and gets cut off.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:51:01.300
[Transcript missing]

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:11.420
If we have a Flash movie
and a separate video movie,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:17.660
People for a long time have wanted to
have video on a TV and an animation,

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:22.600
and the problem was always, "Well,
we don't have a non-slave time basis."

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:29.280
Now that we do,
we can combine these two into one movie,

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.100
so both are being referenced.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.580
Notice that we have...

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:41.360
Control over the outer movie,
which is where the Flash movie is.

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:46.390
The Flash movie can actually
control the embedded movie.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:53.860
Of course, you can start and stop the
other movies clocked too.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.300
So we support,
in Flash we support all the

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.200
Flash reactions right now.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:06.690
But to do this type of thing,
you can also,

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:11.700
we support on Flash buttons all
of the QuickTime wired actions.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:17.110
So this is using wired actions
to actually tell the nested

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.580
movie to play and pause.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:28.580
Okay, now, one last demo here.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:40.330
So we've got--this is
actually a sprite movie,

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:46.600
and we can drag around the pieces,
smuggle the photo model.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:54.500
So I'm going to create Smubble here.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.380
You're probably wondering,
what does this have to

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.800
do with movie and movies,
since this is a sprite track and

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.540
actually down here a text track?

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:02.380
It's a good question.

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:09.550
So what I've added to Smubble is a
"take a picture of Smubble" button.

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:13.800
So what this is doing is actually,
in the wired movie,

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.770
it's asking each sprite for its position.

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:21.290
It's putting those positions,
it's passing them to, in this case,

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:24.170
a HyperCard CGI that's running over here.

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.570
And what we get back
is not a sprite movie,

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:27.320
actually.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:32.880
In fact, it's a movie with a lot
of sub-movies in it.

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.700
Each sub-movie is a picture.

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:39.640
This is actually,
and he's got a funny ear there,

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.160
so let's take another picture.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.730
Maybe a side view here.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.200
Step on his hat.

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.040
Yeah, there we go.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.720
So anyway.

00:53:56.870 --> 00:54:00.690
So this kind of thing is sort
of interesting because this file

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.300
that's coming back is a SMIL file,
so it's really small.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:09.150
All the media is actually on the server.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:14.900
So you could imagine doing this kind of
thing with iCards or something like that,

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:18.810
where it's very interactive
client experience with...

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:25.500
[Transcript missing]

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:33.680
So, we briefly take a,
I don't know if we briefly crash.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:51.900
[Transcript missing]

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.260
Movie in Movie,
how do you create these things?

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:58.100
You can actually use SMIL,
like I just mentioned,

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.960
and what was being returned
there from the server was,

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:03.880
in fact, a SMIL file.

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:14.910
You can author them in a program
like Live Stage Pro or build your own

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.910
application as sample code on the server.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:21.850
And I want to quickly talk about how the

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.960
and Cesar Jaramillo,
and we're going to talk about how

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:29.070
QuickTime can be used to enhance the
overall user experience of your product.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:52.780
So, we're going to talk about how
QuickTime can be used to enhance the

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:53.200
overall user experience of your product.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:56:02.840
We're going to talk about how
QuickTime can be used to enhance the

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:09.550
overall user experience of your product.

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:19.270
So there are definitely some advantages
of using Movie Media Handler.

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:25.320
basically covered most of
them and running low on time,

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.840
so I'm going to come back later
and talk about some new stuff.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:33.550
But Bryce Wolfson will be up here
to talk about some new stuff.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.490
Good morning.

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:45.000
I'm here to talk to you about
something you might have seen already.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.740
It showed up in our keynote,
panoramic projection extension.

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:57.090
So far, what we've had for use is
traditional cylindrical panoramas,

00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:58.710
as we introduced several years ago.

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:01.730
It provides a nice immersive
photographic experience,

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:04.500
but you don't get to look all
the way up and all the way down.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.030
It's hard to explain this,
so I actually want to go ahead and

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:11.490
go straight to demo machine one.

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.120
For those of you who might have not
made a 10:00 AM keynote on Monday but

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:20.970
managed to come to a 9:00 AM session,
I suppose there's some

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:20.970
chance you haven't seen this.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:34.990
So we have some movies that
were taken out in Las Vegas.

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:38.300
Well, I shouldn't tell you that.

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.060
But here's the Eiffel Tower, by the way.

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:40.900
It's Las Vegas.

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:44.330
That's the Phil Schiller surprise.

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:46.910
And I'd sure like to be
able to look up there,

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:50.500
but of course that seems
to be a problem here.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.330
Now we can.

00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:58.320
And we can even get up and see the
moon and get a little dizzy if we want.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:03.950
So that's really the fundamental
introduction to QUBES and what it means.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.110
It takes us where we haven't been before.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.500
Can we go back to slides, please?

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.310
So what is this?

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.020
It's a new rendering engine.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.290
Provides fully immersive views,
so we can look all the way up and down.

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.320
And in fact,
as I'll show you a little bit later,

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.180
we can do more than that.

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:30.180
And

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:34.970
Very importantly in some cases,
there aren't artificial bump

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:37.370
stops at the top and the bottom.

00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:39.610
And I'll show you that
a little bit later too.

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.140
It can be a little jarring when
you're in an immersive experience

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.860
to be looking up and maybe there
isn't anything interesting to see,

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.550
but you run into an
artificial limitation.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:52.400
We use a cubic texture map,
as I mentioned.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.500
I'll show you some of the details
of that in a little bit as well.

00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:59.540
And we want to sort of make a
point that this is an addition

00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:00.590
to cylindrical panoramas.

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:04.160
There are several reasons that
this isn't actually a replacement.

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:06.390
In many, many ways, it's just the same.

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.160
It's exactly what you're used
to as far as user experience

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:10.940
and several other factors.

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.330
But there are a few
things that are different.

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:17.540
So, just like cylindrical panoramas,
we've worked really hard to maintain

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:22.640
very similar playback speed and
quality for comparable content.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.900
Hotspots, just as you have seen them now.

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:32.160
Multinodes, you can do links between
nodes within the same movie.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.780
Use URLs in the browser,
trigger JavaScript, anything like that,

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:41.100
and wired hotspots as well,
which allow you to trigger many of

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:45.110
the interactive things that have
been shown elsewhere in the session.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.950
We have fast start previews,
which gives you a better

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.030
user experience on the net.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:54.200
About 10% of the file comes
down and you have some version

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.030
that you can interact with,
typically.

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.190
We provide tilt constraints,
which I'll also show you in a little bit.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.200
Sometimes you don't
have all of the content,

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.200
for various reasons,
usually relating to capture.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.200
And the file format is amazingly similar.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.470
As a result,
many tools interact with cubic

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.190
panoramas just the same way they
do with cylindrical panoramas.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.200
If they don't do anything that's really
specific to the cylindrical format,

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:21.170
it works out really well.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.200
It just works.

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:27.120
A couple of exceptions,
as I noted before,

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.280
starting with the second one.

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:30.990
First, actually,
you can look straight up and down.

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:33.130
That's sort of the underlying theme here.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.640
Also, there's real benefits
in the file format size,

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:42.160
especially in things such as
automotive industry and architecture,

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.090
and there's a few other examples as well.

01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:48.770
People have been working really
hard to use QuickTime VR to

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:51.230
do high field of view,
where you can look very

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.740
far up and very far down.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.920
But you run into some real
issues with file size.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.230
Cylinders don't like to go beyond
about 100 degrees before every little

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:03.910
bit more starts to cost you a lot.

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:07.120
You wind up with a lot of detail
up and a lot of detail down,

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:09.960
where it's not all that
interesting necessarily,

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.910
and it's just buying
you a few more degrees.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.710
So if I can go back to demo,
show you a few of these things.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:28.920
First, just to take a look at the format,
this is just a cylinder exterior view,

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.290
and we can take a look inside,
and this is the cylindrical experience

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:36.150
as many people have seen it already.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:41.390
Hotspots takes us right back outside.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.480
Similar effect with a cube.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.410
This is different content.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:54.100
This is what's fundamentally going on,
is there's six surfaces involved.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:54.100
And, uh...

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:58.100
When you hop inside and
get the all the way up,

01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.300
all the way down effect.

01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:01.720
And again, we have hotspots.

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:02.800
It's a multi-node movie.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.010
You can mix and match cylinders and cubes
in the same movie as it makes sense.

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:11.250
Fast Start.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.120
We have a 100 megabit network
up here between machines,

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:17.100
so trying to scale down for
bandwidth is a little interesting.

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:19.300
So I have a tool here called Deliverator.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.460
It's from VR Tools.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.450
Not specific to VR.

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:24.450
It's actually a

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.200
Very useful tool for
a variety of reasons.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.780
It knows how to

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:35.530
Understand how your file is
laid out and deal with that.

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.430
Set up for optimal fast start.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.640
Many of the interactive medias,
if not all of them at this point,

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:47.160
don't really deal with streaming
well because streaming is inherently

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:50.400
time-based and interactivity is not.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.170
So fast start remains
very important to us.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:57.680
Here I can say, pretend I'm on a dual
ISDN connection and show me what

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.400
this would look like coming down.

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:02.320
And this is the grid.

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:04.400
In this case it happens to
look very much like a holodeck.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.380
And you can watch the tiles coming in.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.090
This is what you would get if
you don't put a preview in,

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:12.400
if you happen to be looking at
this over a network connection.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.530
In this case we have some
interesting content up here,

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:18.400
which doesn't all come
in on the first tile.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.400
And if you have a fast start preview,
isn't all there immediately.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.400
There's an option,
which I'll mention in a minute,

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.400
to actually change where
the faces are located.

01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:32.920
For, uh,

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:37.800
are all here today to
help solve that problem.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.540
So in this case, I went ahead and put a
fast start preview on it.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.800
This one just is for good visual effect.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.800
You might not choose to do
this colorized edge detection.

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:52.500
Oh, I'm sorry, this one's low start,
low res, same thing.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:52.500
So you can actually

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:57.510
As the tiles come in, if we look here,
we'll be able to see a little

01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:01.990
bit of a delineation between
lower resolution information here

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.670
and higher resolution down here.

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:09.510
And this one shows the
effect much more prominently.

01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:14.250
This was the end edge
detection colorized.

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:17.180
So again,
this provides a neat visual effect

01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:20.860
until tiles actually start coming in,
but when they do,

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:22.890
it's a little bit jarring.

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:30.630
And there's one more thing
that we've worked on as well,

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:35.900
which is backwards compatibility
back to QuickTime 4.0.

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:39.840
So if you--not everybody
updates immediately,

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:46.690
that's just how it goes,
as much as we might like otherwise.

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:46.690
And so,

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.900
Rather than forcing people to
have to go get a new QuickTime,

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:55.300
you can actually open these
movies up in a cylindrical viewer,

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:58.350
and they behave like cylindrical movies.

01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:01.440
In some cases,
the content doesn't really show it.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:07.280
There aren't any real visual effects
in many cases that are very obvious.

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.700
Sometimes it's a little more obvious.

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:13.400
Here, the top of this building,
for example,

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.500
this is supposed to be round.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:19.670
But the effect is much better
than "Can't play this movie,

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:23.430
go get a new QuickTime." Of course,
you can make people do that

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:25.000
if that's what you want.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.980
Go back to the slides, please.

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:34.020
So texture map, six faces of cube,
they're ordinary 90 degree by

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:38.650
90 degree perspective views you
can get out of any renderer.

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:40.500
Many renders today
support cylinder output.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:47.450
This is even simpler because
they're just standard photographs.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.930
Smaller memory and file footprints.

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:53.320
The memory footprint being smaller
is nice too as well for high

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.370
field of view because cylinders,
when you get up high,

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.300
you're eating memory as well.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.900
And as I noted,
cylinders do still have their use.

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:05.910
Primarily, they're backwards compatible
much further back.

01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:08.700
They're proven.

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.040
And there's a lot more tool support for
things that do care about cylinders.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.550
And sometimes the ceiling isn't
interesting or a high field of view,

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:16.950
such as outdoor scenes.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.790
So this is just simple
side-by-side illustration.

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.140
An example, again,
outdoor scene maybe all the

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.560
way up isn't interesting.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.640
This is a file size comparison.

01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:29.260
And what we see happen here
is cubes stay constant.

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:33.060
They've got six faces for a
given quality of source image,

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.800
given horizon size.

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:37.750
This is 2K pixels around.

01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:42.840
And what happens is we get a crossover
at about 100 degrees field of view,

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:47.120
and by 135,
a cylinder is double the size.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.740
135 isn't actually all that high.

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.900
And 160, which some of the
automotive content uses,

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:56.690
we're up to almost five times the
file size of an equivalent cube.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:58.400
And that file size goes somewhere.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.950
You have detail,
but it's all the way up at the top

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.900
and all the way down at the bottom.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.820
And if you're zooming in on the
carpet on the bottom of a car,

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.170
that's not near as interesting, perhaps,
as the dash.

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:15.070
And what's going on here is this is a
cross-section of a cylinder on the left,

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.200
cube on the right.

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:19.490
You can see on the cylinder,
the first 125 degrees takes the same

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:24.770
number of pixels as the next 25,
or to look at it a different way,

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.570
you know, 25 at the horizon is...

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:30.470
uses far fewer pixels.

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:33.970
And I just want to have
one more demo here.

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:51.560
So here's a cubic panorama
taken in LA's Union Station.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.300
And it's really nice.

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:56.620
Good stuff to look at as we come around.

01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:57.690
Nice ceiling.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.740
But the floor here is pretty nice too,
which is interesting.

01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:07.530
But, oh my, there's a tripod here.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.850
And that's just a fundamental
inherent issue with doing photographic

01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:15.290
content is you have to be there.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.700
Trying to hide the photographer in
an immersive environment is hard.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.270
Not too bad when you
can take it in sections,

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:24.720
but there's some fixed
equipment that just stays there.

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:27.440
In this particular case,
because the floor is interesting,

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.000
some creative Photoshop work
takes care of the problem and

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.800
the floor gets reconstructed.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.790
Or perhaps take a picture just
straight down and use a little

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:38.670
bit of work to get that in.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.440
There are some capture techniques
that are on the horizon perhaps

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.660
that don't have these issues.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:48.090
Not really addressing capture
at this point because we're

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.620
just looking at how to deal with
some of these issues in runtime.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.790
Here's another one.

01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:57.790
This is a lobby where this was
taken with a Panascan camera.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.800
It doesn't quite get all the way down,
so we have a bit of a hole in the bottom.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.800
And this maybe isn't interesting.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.800
It's the stairs.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.740
You could Photoshop, put in some carpet,
whatever.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800
Some people put in a logo.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:14.590
Or perhaps there isn't that anything
real beneficial in coming down here.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:20.410
So we do have tilt limits just
like what you would expect with

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:23.740
a cylindrical panorama where
we can limit the tilt down.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.800
In fact, I cheated.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.800
The first cylinder I showed
you and followed by the cube,

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.800
that was actually a cube with
limits on top and bottom to

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:30.800
make it look like a cylinder.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:37.320
So in this case,
there are some other things we can

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:41.800
do as well because cubes do have
all the information all the way up.

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:45.800
And we can actually go a little
far and the world gets upside down.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.800
So...

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:58.140
Which helps get rid of the stop up here.

01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:58.140
And then...

01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:05.580
Last, just to look briefly at
the bump stops issue again.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.410
Here, you saw this movie a little
bit earlier with Eric.

01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:12.500
And this is one where maybe there
isn't anything interesting to see,

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.050
but you just run into an
arbitrary limit at the top,

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:18.090
and again, at the bottom.

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:20.050
Not really missing anything.

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.100
The floor,
maybe a little bit of the center console.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:26.720
So take a look here.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.500
This is large and high resolution,
so it takes a moment to load.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.190
This still has a bottom drop,
which maybe isn't such a big deal,

01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:40.800
but when you're looking up,
you don't run into a barrier at all.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.030
Again, nothing interesting,
and in this particular case...

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:52.330
There's not only no
boundary up at the top,

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.930
but also in a car, again,
it's just a center console,

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:57.240
but there's nothing to stop
you at the bottom either.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:01.310
Back to slides, please.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.650
So, just real quick,
we're running a little bit long here.

01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:13.080
Making cubic nodes, images,
talked about 90 degrees field of view,

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.690
the edge pixels are shared
through the centers.

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.700
The CD you got should have had
file format information on it,

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.700
which should cover much
of this information.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.940
Just like a cylinder, panosample,
but there's some backwards

01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:28.470
compatibility information in there,
so that the older versions

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:29.660
of VR can read it.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:35.290
There's a new field that you say, "Hey,
this is a cube." New view atoms,

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:41.210
which actually contain the data
describing where things are.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.700
and optionally where the
individual faces are,

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.300
which allows you to rearrange
things if that's interesting,

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:52.100
such as for where the primary
content was in that one panorama.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.840
Standard face ordering clockwise
is just like cylinders,

01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:00.700
which allows us to have that backwards
compatibility and can easily be changed,

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:03.630
for example,
to a diamond face orientation.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:09.560
So, in summary, I'm going to go ahead and
hand this back over to Sean,

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.470
and he'll talk to you a little bit more.

01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:19.900
Okay, finish the restart.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.900
We don't have to show that part.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.900
Let's go to the slides really quick.

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.630
Okay, I got 12 minutes and I'm
going to put it into three.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:28.900
Let's see if we can do that.

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.700
Yeah, okay,
right now we have wired variables

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.900
and all it can do is basically
hang off of a sprite track.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.900
So people have wanted more than that.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.900
We basically want to
do more in the future.

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.750
So we've been working on some stuff that
will allow us to have name variables,

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:50.900
attach it to any sprite or movie,
handle event parameters, have structures,

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.900
and even local variables.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:54.830
So how are we going to do this?

01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:57.850
We're going to actually introduce an API,
QTList.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.900
It's going to be a toolbox API and
it's going to be scriptable.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.180
So we're going to be able to
build these hierarchical lists

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.900
and import and export XML.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.510
So we're going to actually be
able to deal with XML on the

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:09.900
client side to some degree.

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.150
So these lists are going to
live on movies and tracks,

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:16.900
so they're always available
from wired scripting there.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:22.580
And also when you're in an event handler,
you're going to be able to

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:28.090
access the events such as
mouse.x or something like that.

01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:32.080
They're basically like XML nodes that
are going to be living in the movie.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.350
So here the movie's
calling movie_get_element,

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:37.640
and we're going to have some string.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:46.250
You can actually just say my_color.red
to go down the hierarchy of the XML.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.870
Again, mouse.x or h.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.300
Anyway, besides doing,
KT lists will be useful for other

01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.640
things besides just variables
and structures and so on.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.400
We're going to be able to use them to
exchange data from a client to a server.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.270
Right now when we say go to URL,
we can pass a little bit of

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:10.400
information up to like 5,
12 characters I guess.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.390
And what you get back is always a movie.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.360
So this is going to let you actually say,
hey, here's some information.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.400
I want information back.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.400
If you've read about
RPC or something like that,

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.400
it's basically passing XML and an
HTTP request and getting back XML.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.400
So we'll be able to support
that kind of thing as well.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.520
I'm just going to go to the demo now.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:51.100
So what we've done is set up
a WebObject server with media,

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:58.530
and in a database we have some movies,
some images, some audio.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.620
We've defined two basically API,
if you want to call it, routines.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.240
One is search media,
and you can pass the type and

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.800
even a substring to search,
and WebObjects will handle that.

01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:17.160
And what that is actually
returning is XML that the client

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.370
movie can take a look at and use.

01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:25.280
So we just launch Netscape here.

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:38.550
What I'm going to do is just
paste in a URL which is going

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:41.060
to be handled by WebObjects.

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:48.580
So if I view source on what came back,
I just did a search media

01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.800
for media type video.

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:52.270
So from the database it
actually has returned all this

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.790
information into the movie.

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:56.960
And the client movie can actually get
to all that through wired scripting.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.890
So we can actually find
out that here's a URL,

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:03.600
here's an ID,
a duration for each element, and a title.

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.890
Let's try...

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:15.600
The other API that we
defined was buildSmile.

01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:18.520
So what this is going to do--

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.330
is building a SMIL file,
and we have a simple

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:24.810
little encoding here.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.100
Here it's just a single element.

01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:31.520
So if I execute that,
WebObjects is returning a SMIL file,

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.710
and it's just a single
little video clip here.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.150
I just asked for media ID 3.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:45.200
So let's just do one slightly
more complex one where we

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:51.690
have audio in parallel.

01:16:56.630 --> 01:17:00.290
So here WebObjects is returning
a little slideshow with several

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:05.360
pictures and some audio,
and it's got timed information.

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.700
The only thing we passed was
originally the idea is you can say,

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.440
"Hey, what do you have?" Do a
search or something like that,

01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:13.940
and then construct a movie.

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.260
So it only had three images,
so it's already gone.

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:19.770
So what we did was we put together

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:29.430
The crazy client-side movie,
it's not quite finished,

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:33.500
but it's exercising some
of these new features.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:38.590
And the idea was,
it was going to be a media browser,

01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:42.740
so you can browse for movies, audio,
or images.

01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:51.730
And so if we browse for images, say with

01:17:55.990 --> 01:18:00.560
The letter F, and we find this flower.

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:04.960
So that actually got
returned through the list,

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.270
and what it returned was the URL.

01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:12.500
So then we did a set on,
we have four nested movies here,

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.690
and on the first nested movie,
we did add URL, and we got that out of

01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:17.860
the XML that was returned.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:27.890
And now we can actually see that movie.

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:27.890
If we want to search for
maybe a different one.

01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:35.480
You'll also notice we're
typing in text fields here.

01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:40.970
and which is something you'll
be able to do in the future,

01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:41.140
not now.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.910
And then basically I hooked
up a build it button which

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:54.670
is just building right now a
canned movie that should load in.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.640
It's taking a long time.

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:06.750
So I'll go back to slides.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:12.500
Oh, there it is.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:16.200
So basically, really briefly,
the Exchange List action that

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:25.790
we will have lets you do in
one HTTP request response loop,

01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.790
lets you ask for information.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.720
I actually send XML information
and return XML information back.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.630
So I think I should stop now.

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.400
Thanks.

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.100
Well, looks like this session
was a little bit busy,

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:50.190
but I just wanted to say
some of the closing remarks.

01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:57.010
That the Vis-a-vis interactive stuff is
tightly integrated in part of QuickTime,

01:19:57.010 --> 01:19:58.980
so you always have access to them.

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:03.200
So I strongly encourage you to
try some of these things out.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:08.200
And then we're going to have a
feedback session in this afternoon.

01:20:08.210 --> 01:20:13.320
So I strongly encourage you
to come to that session,

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:16.170
and then we'd like to hear
some of your feedback.

01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:20.200
Thanks again,
and enjoy the rest of the conference.
