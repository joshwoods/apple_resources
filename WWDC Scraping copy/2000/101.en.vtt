WEBVTT

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.430
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.840
We'd like to welcome you to session 101,
Open Source at Apple.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.950
Here to begin our session,
won't you please welcome the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.900
Director of Core OS Engineering,
Brett Halle.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.800
Good afternoon.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.700
Hope you've enjoyed the couple
of sessions so far today and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.800
getting engaged in Mac OS X.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.890
I want to spend some time this afternoon
and talk a little bit about what

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.800
we're doing with Open Source at Apple.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.780
In particular,
we'll spend a few minutes going over

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.210
some of our key Open Source projects:
Darwin,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.610
which you heard a lot about this morning,
but there's also sessions later today

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.700
going over some of the technical details.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.800
Streaming Server Technology for streaming
QuickTime content over the Internet,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.800
HeaderDoc because all that great
source actually needs to be documented,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.410
and OpenPlay/NetSprockets for
some of our work that we've

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.800
been doing in the games arena.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.800
And we'll talk a little bit about where
we're going with Open Source at Apple,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.120
and most importantly,
because the whole point of

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.340
Open Source is getting involved,
how you guys can participate.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.120
So first of all, as I just mentioned,
the whole point of Open Source is

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.240
that it's a community effort.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.070
And we take this pretty seriously,
as you'll see in the presentation today,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.940
in terms of how we've set up our
infrastructure and the progress

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.320
we've made over the last year,
in terms of how you can get involved

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.540
in Open Source and with Apple.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.970
Open Source really benefits
everybody in the community.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.880
Certainly,
we gain a lot because we're getting

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.000
a lot of really great technology
from the community at large.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.060
You gain a lot because you
can see what we're doing,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.500
how we're doing it, and as you'll see,
you can actually see what

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.260
we're doing in real time,
and can actually get involved in

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.000
helping us make the product better.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.640
And obviously,
the end result of that is the customer

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.770
ends up with something that's better,
really better than the sum of the parts.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.830
This is pretty new stuff though,
particularly for a company like

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.690
Apple to get involved in Open Source.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.200
And we're learning moment by moment and
working with you on trying to improve.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.490
So it's going to be kind
of exciting at times,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.150
certainly over the past year.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.200
We've learned an awful lot about how
to do this and how to get better at it.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.200
But there's a lot more to go from
there and we're really looking

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.900
forward to making this successful.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.780
You've all heard of Darwin.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.900
Steve talked about it extensively
in the keynote this morning.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.500
You heard it if you were at the
Mac OS X overview session this afternoon.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.500
It is the core for Mac OS X.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.950
And it's really important
to note that we're not doing

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.500
Open Source as a side project.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500
It's not this interesting little
experiment off to the side.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.830
But the core operating system
of Mac OS X is Open Source.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.460
It is one and the same.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.420
And I think one important way to help
understand that it is our goal and is

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.500
our intention from the source code that
exists in the Open Source community

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.590
that you can rebuild Darwin,
the Darwin Open Source kernel,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.500
and be able to replace the
Mac OS X core operating system kernel.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.490
And it is the same system.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.660
We have a little ways to
go to get there completely,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.590
but this is where we're
headed and this is what we

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.960
technically want to make happen.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:06:03.100
[Transcript missing]

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.030
Part of the role of the Darwin developer
is to partner with you in the

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.490
process of incorporating changes.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.540
We really want to involve not
only our engineering team,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.920
but the Darwin developers in the
process of being able to take the

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.080
changes that you make to the code
or suggestions that you have or bug

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.130
fixes that you have and incorporate
them back into our source tree.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.400
These folks will be coming
up on stage a little bit,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.300
but I'll have them wave their hand in
the air a moment and tell you a little

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.100
bit about some of the Darwin developers
we have currently signed up.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:47.600
Joe Gervais is the president
of Naked Mole Rat Software,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.600
kind of a novel company name.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.600
I'd be interested to find out
where you came up with that.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.720
and basically he's a small
game development house striving

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.100
to match the quarterly losses
of a large dot-com company.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.100
This is his description here,
so I figured I'd pass that on.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.210
Anyway, in his copious spare time,
Joe is the tech lead for OpenPlay and

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.100
the NetSprocket technology,
and he's got some great stuff

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.100
to share with us a little
later in the presentation.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.950
In the streaming server space,
Adrian Sun, who's a developer at Cobalt,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.100
and is actually an author of
Apple Share support for Netatalk.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.860
Those of you who have been
involved in the BSD community

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.090
and in the Linux community
should be familiar with Netatalk.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.650
It's an Open Source package
that lets Unix machines supply

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.100
Apple Talk print and file services.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:37.340
He's been involved quite a bit in
providing various bug fixes and porting

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.100
effort to the Darwin streaming server.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.100
Judy Tang has been driving
NT platform support.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.890
She's a senior software engineer
at I-Beam and has actually been

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:55.130
responsible for making sure that we
have Darwin streaming server on NT.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.490
In the Darwin OS community,
there's Scott Anguish.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500
and Scott Gawin.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.060
Scott is an editor for Stepwise
and is also an author of a number

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.280
of Cocoa Utility applications
and examples and stuff,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.780
things like the OpenUp utility.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.210
John Carmack, I think everybody
should be familiar with.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.010
I think there was all sorts of
blood splattered across the screen

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.040
this morning from his company.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.170
But he's been actually involved not only
in bringing great games to Mac OS X,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:35.720
but in working on getting X11 up
on top of the Darwin OS codebase.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.680
Luke Howard is actually -- is Luke here?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.990
and Luke Luke was an intern
at Apple a couple of years

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.520
ago and worked on NetInfo.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.080
He's going to school down in Australia.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.700
He's been involved quite heavily in
importing NetInfo to the Linux platform

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.560
and making a number of other
enhancements and bug fixes to NetInfo.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.560
Andrew Stone has been around
in the Next community forever.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.260
He wrote the first Next Step app
and Rhapsody application.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.200
As I understand it,
he throws really cool parties,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.320
so you want to make sure you get invited.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.540
He's working on Core Foundation.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.200
We've had a number of contributions
to the Open Source activity.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.520
I'm not going to go in detail over this,
but we just did a small sampling of

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.930
some of the stuff that has come in
just over the past really few weeks,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.440
a couple of weeks here.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.930
So, this is a little bit of an
example of what we're doing.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.010
We're working on a lot of new stuff.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.610
We're working on a lot of new things.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.210
We're working on a lot of new things.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.620
We're working on a lot of new things.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.060
We're working on a lot of new things.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.280
We're working on a

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.040
to give people a moment to look over
some of the stuff that's been done.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.900
I encourage you, actually,
to go to our website and get some

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.940
of the details around some of
the work that's been going on.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.800
So we have a number of things to show,
so I'll get off the stage here

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.290
and let the real engineers tell
you about what's happening.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.550
First will be Fred Sanchez,
who's going to talk a bit about what

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.800
we've been doing with some of the support
infrastructure for Darwin in open source,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.420
as well as talk about what we've
been doing with Darwin itself,

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.150
the OS code.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.070
Chris LaCroix will be coming up
and talking about streaming server

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.060
developments and activities.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.350
Joe Jarve will be talking about
OpenPlay and NetSprocket and

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.080
has some cool stuff to show.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.840
And Ron will be telling you a
bit about what HeaderDoc is and

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.070
how to get involved with that.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.930
And afterwards,
we're going to have a Q&A panel,

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.680
so if you have some questions
about what we're doing with open

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.740
source and how to get involved,
save your questions.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:52.030
So without further ado,
Fred Sanchez is a manager -- sorry,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.820
a manager.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:52.820
Not yet.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.820
An engineer within the Core OS team.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.810
He just thinks he likes to be
a manager in the Core OS team

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.850
and has been one responsible
for a lot of the great activity

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.810
that's been going on with Darwin.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.260
Howdy, so I'm going to talk
about two things mostly.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.000
We're going to talk a little bit
about the stuff that makes Darwin and

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.240
the other Open Source projects go,
and we're going to talk

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.270
about Darwin the OS itself.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.290
And then at the end we're going to
have a little bit of demo stuff.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.880
First let's talk about our source code.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.150
We maintain all of our
source code in CVS.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.520
That's actually all of
Mac OS X from kernel all the

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.600
way up through Carbon in Apple.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.630
And we have a repository that
contains nearly all of the

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.600
Darwin code which is available
outside of our corporate firewall.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.840
And you people as part of the
developer community can access

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.600
that source code at any time.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.450
That's actually two repositories.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.640
There's a read/write
one and a read-only one,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.600
but they have the same data on them.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.850
Internally at Apple,
we've got our internal developers

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.600
and they do the majority of their
development on that external repository.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.520
So as we make changes to the
third party stuff like Apache and

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.600
whatnot or into NetInfo,
that gets checked into that repository

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.600
and is available immediately
to our developer community.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.600
We also have actually a whole
fleet of internal CVS servers.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.540
But for CoreOS,
we've got one that we maintain some of

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.600
the code which is not open source there.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.400
And we also maintain a couple of
projects which are open source

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.580
but are pushed out as snapshots.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.600
The kernel is the best example of that.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.550
And the reason is that we've got
parts of the kernel that support

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.560
hardware that may not be announced yet.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.600
So the Power Books that
most people have around,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.660
you know, we had support in the kernel
there a while ahead of time in

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.600
order to get the testing done.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.890
But we don't want to pre-announce
what all the features of

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:49.600
the hardware might be.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.600
Since they're changing and, you know,
we like the surprise factor of all that.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.110
So the kernel gets developed internally
and then periodically we push out the

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.390
kernel contents to the public repository
where we filter out the few small

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.600
things that we want to keep private.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.710
That also includes things like drivers
which are licensed from third parties

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.520
such as the adaptex driver is kind of
the best example where we don't own

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.600
that code so we can't open source it.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.840
But the majority of the Darwin code
lives primarily in the external server.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.800
We also have the Darwin developers,
which Brett mentioned,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.100
and they all have access
to the same repository.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.560
So they either work with the
Apple teams in order to get their

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.140
code integrated and reviewed,
or they talk to us and then they commit

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.930
it themselves to the external repository.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.810
Note that Darwin developers,
that orange bubble actually

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.590
encompasses the purple bubble.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.550
That I as an Apple employee
and everyone who works in the

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.140
CoreOS group is a Darwin developer.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.040
And we're all sort of part of
the same one whole large team.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.780
As a member of the double LL community,
you can either coordinate with the

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.750
Darwin developers if you're making
changes that you'd like to see put

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.000
back into the original code base and
eventually into Mac OS X as well.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:15.070
Or you could go to our website and submit
directly into a submission web form where

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.500
you could give us the URL to your code.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.950
And we'll review that and stick
that into the source repository.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:31.700
We recently added a bug tracking feature
that should be going live tonight.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.190
You can submit bug reports through
a web form that we're working on.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.730
Internally at Apple,
we use a bug tracking

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.140
system called Radar.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.590
It's very pervasive to everything we do.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.000
We manage all of our source code
changes through this Radar tool.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.770
Whenever we're going to change something,
somebody follows a bug,

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.330
describes what we're changing,
how we changed it, why, what the risk is,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.040
and so on.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.640
And then before each release,
we review what things we want

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.370
to put in and roll those out.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.030
And so one thing we're going to
do is we're going to query that

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.880
data and take out the stuff that's
relevant to Darwin and push that

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.460
out on our website as a report.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.860
So everybody can go in and see what's
going on in the CoreOS group in

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.170
terms of what bugs we're working on,
what their state is,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.800
who's working on them,
what's been done so far,

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.520
why it's still in
whatever state it is now.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.840
And that's actually a very good tool,
especially if you're a third-party

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.020
developer and you've submitted
one of these bugs and you're like,

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.690
"I really wish that
we'd fixed blah." Well,

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.390
then you can actually see
what's going on there.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.960
Darwin developers, the registered folks,
are going to have a special web

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.540
access so that they can actually
edit and review these bugs and we

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.660
can assign bugs to them and so on.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.260
So that they can basically have
the same level of access to the

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.210
radar database that we have.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.640
Quick summary, our website,
apple.com/darwin or

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.070
www.publicsource.apple.com,
has all the information you need

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.790
about how to get started with Darwin,
where to download it,

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.860
what resources are available.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.520
The CVS repository is also documented
there and it's also available via

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.660
a web interface so that you don't
have to actually use the CVS tools

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.960
and check out all the source code.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.120
You can actually just browse what's
in there using a standard web browser.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.290
We've got a pile of mailing lists
and these are very important.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.100
If you want to be part
of the Darwin community,

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.540
you want to become one of
these Darwin developers,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.960
you want to contribute,
really you need to be active

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.900
on these mailing lists.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.080
Several of the Apple engineering staff
are already subscribed to these lists and

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.400
we listen to everything that goes there.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.100
We respond to as many of
the questions as we can.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.420
We've got people in
the file system group,

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.640
in the kernel group,
in all sorts of parts of the Core OS that

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.000
are paying attention and actually
respond to a lot of the questions

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.870
that come out on those mailing lists.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.470
Bug tracking is already mentioned
and you can get more information

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.020
about that on our website.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.490
And our Darwin developers are of course
one of the best resources we have.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.660
If you want to talk about getting
something into the system,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.460
come to me, come to Andy, come to Dave,
whatever,

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:16.100
and we'll help you figure out how to get
your changes integrated into the system.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.640
Darwin 1.0 shipped in April and
since then we've actually had

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.300
a great deal of response to it.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.200
We've had a lot of downloads
as Brett mentioned.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.600
We've also had a lot of people
start to submit bug fixes.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:34.470
Prior to 1.0 we had a system that was
not based on the latest development

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.740
stuff that we're working on.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.180
So a lot of people were somewhat
discouraged about working on

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.600
a kernel that we're going to
toss out most of the code to.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.790
So now that we've got the thing that's
going to show up in Mac OS X that's

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.760
going to ship in mass volume
come summer and then in January,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.910
that's the code that's out there now
and people are already working on it.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:59.150
1.1 of Darwin is what's in DP4.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.900
You've already got that.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.640
You can start working
on Darwin 1.1 today.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.800
We'll start a build of a standalone
Darwin system after the conference,

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.580
so in a week or two you should
expect to see a 1.1 download

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.330
available from the web.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.070
Kernel updates, as I said,
aren't immediate.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.800
So we have to synchronize the
kernel every so often into Darwin.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.700
We did a sync just last
week of the 1.1 source base.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.200
And we'll start doing
those more regularly.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.660
It took about a month to do that
first one and that's on the long end

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.700
of how often we want to do updates.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.700
We're shooting to do them
more on the order of a week.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.740
and hopefully even more often
if we can get away with it.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.480
I'd like to mention that
Darwin is a cross-platform OS.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:55.340
It was a... of course we're on a PowerPC,
that's what we base Mac OS X on.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.320
And OpenStep,
which is where we got a lot of our code,

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.160
ran on a whole bunch of platforms.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.240
It ran on 68k Next Hardware,
it ran on Intel, it ran on Spark,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.020
it ran on HPPA.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.530
The Intel code is all still in there.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.190
One of the things we'd like to see is
to see Intel brought up and deployed

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.600
and installable in an easy way so that
people can actually develop on that

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.940
and thereby grow our developer base.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.840
Additional platforms are
certainly a possibility.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.430
We'd probably like to see
two before we take on twelve.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.100
We've had queries about Alpha and
Intel's new stuff and whatnot.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:38.890
So that's certainly all available.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.060
Currently, when you install Darwin,
you need to wipe a disk.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.600
and many more.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.250
I think we're going to start all over.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.100
It's suboptimal.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.610
One thing we're shooting for is to
use this depackage tool which comes

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.640
from the Debian Linux community.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.350
That allows us to upgrade
individual components of the

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.440
operating system one by one.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.770
It's a clever thing because
when you update one tool,

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.030
it might know that you also need
a version of something else.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.970
If you update Emacs,
the system framework has to

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.990
match the same version that
Emacs was built against,

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.130
otherwise it doesn't run.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.600
When you update Emacs,
it will also update the system framework.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.990
These tools are still underway.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.180
They're partly built into Darwin now,
but we need to do a lot of cleanup

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.260
and get them working so that
eventually you'll be able to update

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:28.740
between 1.1 and 1.2 and so on without
having to reinstall the whole OS.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.280
In fact, it should be as simple as say,
"Go get me the latest version of

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.700
Emacs." It should go out on the net,
fetch it, download it, install it.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.480
"Oh, you need also this other stuff.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.200
Get that, download it,
install it as well."

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.180
System installation should be improved.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.010
improved greatly by
using tools like this.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.150
Stan Shebs, who's our GCC guy,
isn't in town today so

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.990
I'm covering for him.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.500
In DP3, GCC was version 2.7,
we had a version of

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.920
EGCS in there as well,
and the combination of

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.130
the two was the compiler.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:04.880
In DP4, we've got a later version, 2.95,
and in both cases we've got a whole

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.270
bunch of Apple hacks that are in there.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.880
Those are pretty extensive.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.050
There's a whole bunch of
Objective-C support that

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.400
dates back to the next days.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.160
There's the Mako runtime support.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.040
There's support for
PowerPC and Objective-C++,

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.100
and of course the new Velocity
Engine work that we're doing.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.980
Going forward,
one of our big goals is to get

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.300
all of that stuff synchronized
with the code that the FSF has.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.380
One problem that we have is when we
update GCC from one version to the next,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.300
it takes an enormous amount of work
to reintegrate all of the patches

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.300
that we've been doing every time.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.300
So it takes a long time for
us to update the compiler.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.300
It's a lot of work.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.300
And so we can't really do it every
time a new version of GCC comes out.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.310
So if we manage to get most
of the diffs back upstream,

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.300
then we don't have to do
all that work every time.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.900
And so we're working now with the
FSF to assign them copyright to the

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.330
parts and do all the right stuff
so that we don't have to keep doing

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.300
this work over and over again.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.300
Of course, we're working on improving the
object output so that it's faster,

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.300
as well as increasing the
performance of the compiler itself.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.930
We have a technology for
doing pre-compiled headers,

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.300
which is something that's being
talked about in the GNU community.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.850
And we actually have something
that's a little stronger than

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.300
what they've been discussing.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.370
So one thing is to work with
them and see if what we have is

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.300
appropriate for them to take.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:27.240
We'd like to synchronize a little
better with the GNU C++ ABI,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.300
just so that life is a lot easier.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.260
Objective C++ is sort
of a hot issue lately.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.290
We're probably going to retire that.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.060
The number of clients we
have for it is very small.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.300
Supportive for it is very
complicated and involved.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.300
And it's just getting older and
cruftier and harder to maintain.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.300
It's just not really working out.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.300
So that's probably going to go away.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:57.300
An interesting project is to consider
merging or somehow reconciling

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.300
the Objective C runtimes between
the GNU one and the next one.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.300
They forked a long time ago and they're
not really compatible at this point.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.430
So it would be nice if output
from one compiler worked with the

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.300
output from the other compiler.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.100
And of course,
we'd like to update to GCC3

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.100
as that becomes available.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.700
So with that, I'd like to invite Dave up
so we can do some demo stuff.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.780
The demos are cool.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:52.200
[Transcript missing]

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.740
It's a standard console,
not the best GUI you'll ever see.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.480
In fact, it's the worst.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:15.320
We get the standard host of Unix tools.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:15.320
And as you'll see,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.890
This is... That's rather
interesting there,

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:17.330
Dave.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400
Yeah.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.880
And that says i386, doesn't it?

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.400
Yeah, it does.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400
Huh.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400
That's weird.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.390
Maybe we should reboot.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.300
It must have been a bug.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.300
Yeah.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:42.300
That's a virtual PC on Darwin.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.300
Yeah.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:53.740
So as you can see,
we're running on Intel.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.680
So this is a pretty
recent milestone for us.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.400
We've got an Intel machine back here,
and you can come back and look after

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.010
the talk if you don't believe us.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.580
But we've got the whole
system stack running there.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.790
That's the kernel working.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.400
That's rooted on HFS, isn't it?

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:14.930
No, this is on UFS, actually.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.600
It's on UFS.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.300
Oh, well.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.860
We're close.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.700
But there you go.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.030
The whole thing on Intel,
and it's pretty sexy.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.040
But not an impressive demo,
so we're going to go to something else,

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.910
which is a little more interesting.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.940
I'm happy to say that last week I thought
X would be an interesting demo to see,

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.370
so I started with
CarMax port of X11 to AppKit,

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.900
and I ported it to I/O Kit,
which was pretty quick and pretty easy,

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.850
and we have the whole environment here.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.660
So it'd be nice to see some
other things running here.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.280
This version of X looks rather '80s-ish.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.400
It dates itself.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.060
But it works.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.100
We hope to make the changes available
so people can start playing with it.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.260
So this is pretty significant
because we're going,

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.930
we had an export that John did
which ran on using the Interceptor

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.100
API in Mac OS X server.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.250
And this is actually now talking
natively to the I/O Kit in Mac OS X.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:18.100
So this is running without any help from
the graphic system that's in Mac OS X.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.600
And one nice thing to do after
this of course would be to get it

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.100
to work with the graphic system
in Mac OS X so that you could

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.100
co-locate X apps with Mac OS X apps.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.380
And that will help people with
their porting work from Unix

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.100
to OS X and so on and so forth.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:38.180
Which is not to say that
Apple will support X11.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.640
But it will help people with porting.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.060
So that's cool.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.540
Thank you Dave.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:54.700
Thanks for you guys to think about.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.100
Hopefully.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.230
Now that Darwin 1.0 is out,
there's a lot of opportunities

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.600
for people to work on stuff.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.600
Device drivers is sort of a great
thing for people to work on,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.980
especially on the Intel platform
where we actually have very few

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.600
supported Intel configurations.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.900
We've got kind of like APC that works,
but there's a whole bunch of

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.590
hardware out there in the Intel space
that we don't have support for.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.480
And similarly,
back in the days to support

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.680
older Macintosh platforms,
we'll also need some additional

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.590
driver support and platform support.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:30.500
NetInfo is our directory service in
Mac OS X and it's part of Darwin.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.650
And one nice thing about that is that
it can be ported to other platforms,

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:36.390
which means that once you've got that,
then you can have a distributed

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.260
directory service that works in a
heterogeneous network so that you can

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.860
administer them from a central place
and everybody's got the same user

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.230
accounts and configuration information.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.400
We'd like support for
various file systems.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.520
There's work underway for Arla and Sara,
who's not here today.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.600
and many more.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600
We're also working on
supporting Mac OS X.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:01.550
X11 is something we'd like
to see more work done.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.150
This demo is cool,
but there's a lot more that can

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:10.920
be done to support more toolkits.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.630
Also OpenSSH,
which is a secure communications tool,

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:17.570
which is actually pretty
important to us because we use

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.770
it to access the CBS repository.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.960
That's a good one because it has
a free license and we like it.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.180
So there's a whole bunch
of things you can do.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.330
Of course,
this list is by no means exhaustive.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.810
If you're interested in getting involved,
please get on the mailing list,

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.580
please start talking to us and let
us know what you're thinking about.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.600
Sessions that you might
be interested in going to.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.780
There's a Darwin overview across
the hall after this session.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:49.350
There's an I/O Kit overview tomorrow,
and there's networking also tomorrow.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.350
Of course,
these are all components of Darwin,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.600
so they're all interesting.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.400
And the file systems talk is Wednesday,
which is Clark's talk.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:57.400
Don't miss that.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.700
Birds of a Feather session is Wednesday,
so we can all get together, hang out,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.700
and do some sort of free-form discussion
where it's not just me spewing up here.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.700
Kernel Talk Thursday,
Feedback Forum Friday,

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.820
and I'm doing a talk on
BSD support in Mac OS X,

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.700
which is sort of a general OS overview
for the Darwin side of things,

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.700
Friday at 3:30.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.930
So with that,
I'd like to hand off to Chris,

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.610
who's going to talk about
the Streaming Server.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:29.580
Thanks, Fred.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.540
So I'm going to talk real briefly
about what we've been doing with the

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.060
streaming server for the last year.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.440
So, starting with last year,
we came out with the initial release

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.000
of Darwin Streaming Server on Mac OS X.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.590
And that was pretty big news.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.490
It was the first open source,
totally open standard,

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.200
free streaming server on the planet.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.390
And a year later, it still is.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.970
With 1.02 we announced a re-added
support for Linux and FreeBSD.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:01.100
And soon followed that with a 2.0
release that added support for Solaris.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:04.970
And last month we
announced support for NT,

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:08.820
which should be ready
in just a few weeks.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:08.820
We're still kind of cleaning
that up a little bit.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:13.180
So another thing we did with the
2.0 release is we added a plugin

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.660
architecture to the server.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.850
And we realized early on that
developers were going to want

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.630
to be able to extend the server,
and we figured that if we just

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.070
left them with Open Source,
they would hack the server up and it

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.340
would be a miserable mess for everybody,
so we added a plugin architecture.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.460
And two of the goals of that
architecture were that it be easy to

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.540
use and that it be high performance.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.790
So with that in mind,
we decided to eat our own dog food,

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:37.660
and we re-implemented nearly all of
the functions in the server as plugins.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:44.060
So like the video on demand support,
the live streaming support, the logging,

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.010
the authentication,
all that stuff is done as plugins.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.190
So that's definitely the preferred way
to do any enhancements to the server.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.500
And if you want to check
out the documentation,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.500
it's part of the source code downloader.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.930
You can either download
or get into the CVS tree.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.600
Another thing that happened is the
server became extremely popular.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.920
Some of the biggest names in internet
content hosting picked up the server.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.610
Digital Island, for example,
has announced that they're going to

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.120
deploy the server on 6,000 SunBoxes.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.040
Akamai has been running Linux versions
of the server for over a year now.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.230
So Akamai, if you're not aware,
they host all of Apple's

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.760
QuickTime TV content.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.390
Interview, they do hosting for
CNN's streaming content,

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:28.260
and they've had the server
running on Linux boxes as well.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.710
And then iBeam just recently
has begun deployment across

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.760
their network on NT machines.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.760
So there's a pretty good reason for
why these guys are all deploying,

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.760
because there's a huge
amount of demand out there.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.780
So in the last year we've
had over 36 million downloads

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.760
of the QuickTime 4 client.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.400
And on top of that,
every month over 200 CD-ROM titles

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.760
ship that contain the QuickTime 4.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.760
So there are a lot of reasons
for supporting QuickTime.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.760
So, get back to the plugins.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.550
So with that size of installed base,
there's obviously a bunch of

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.760
money to be made out there.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.760
And the plugin API provides
that opportunity.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.760
It allows you to create value-add
products on top of the streaming server.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:19.750
Some examples might be a turnkey solution
for internet streaming on the radio.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:20.760
Radio streaming.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.760
Internet streaming for radio stations.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.650
Another one may be like a
full-featured ISP solution that

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:29.210
contains back-end database support,
account management, bandwidth,

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.760
and disk quotas, and things like that.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.760
Those are things that we're probably
not going to do in the near future.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.760
So there's a huge opportunity
to take care of those things,

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.760
or to develop those as your
own products and sell them.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.760
One thing I should mention is that,
so plugins are a little bit different.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.760
They don't fall under the APSL,
Apple's Public Source License.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.990
And what I mean by that is that
Apple Public Source License requires that

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.010
if you modify any Darwin source code,
that you need to post that back to Apple,

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.760
and then we'll eventually
post that back to the world.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.750
Plugins don't start out
as Darwin source code.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.380
They start out as your own source code,
and they just happen to

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.760
call an API that's in the
Darwin streaming server.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.750
So they remain proprietary.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.690
You can keep your competitive advantages,
and you can actually create

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:10.760
your own products that way.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.570
And we really want to promote people
starting with the Darwin streaming

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.760
server and creating your own products,
branding it as your own product,

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.760
and selling it as your own product,
and making a bunch of money,

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:18.760
and helping to propagate QuickTime.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.590
propagate quick time.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.680
So a couple of the things we've
got planned for the future.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.790
We're going to add a pluggable file
system layer to the module API.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.520
And by that,
what I mean is you'll be able

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.930
to write a module that will
effectively replace the file system

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.800
as far as the server is concerned.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.240
So an example of that may be that you
want to write something that treats some

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.200
high-speed database as the file system.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.000
You drop that into the server,
and all of a sudden,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.080
the server and all the modules that
make file calls will retrieve all

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.800
of their movies and information and
any other file out of that database.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.150
Maybe you've got a distributed
network file system you

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.360
want to get it to work with,
that kind of thing.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.350
So that's the first thing.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.480
The second thing is we plan
to do a web-based admin for

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.680
all of the Darwin platforms.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.340
Currently,
the only GUI that we have is on

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:17.530
Mac OS X server and it's an application
that runs in the yellow box of Mac.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:35.900
[Transcript missing]

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:42.970
The next step is to add functionality
or create your products under

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:42.970
the Darwin Streaming Server.

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:42.970
You should be able to drop that
stuff right in and it'll just

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:42.970
mix in as a part of the UI for

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.200
and other developers.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:35:13.170
Thank you for your time.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.200
Let us know.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.440
The best way to contact us is
through the Darwin Streaming

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.540
Server developer mailing list.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.280
You can go to lists.apple.com
and sign up on that.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.610
And for any other information
about the streaming server,

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.520
just go to www.apple.com/darwin.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.280
A couple of sessions before I go
that you might want to check

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.000
out are the QuickTime Streaming
Web Techniques session,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.670
which will be tomorrow
at 3:00 in the Civic.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.170
And at 4:30 in the Civic,
there will be a session on how to

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.770
write streaming server modules.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.820
In fact,
I think the engineer doing that session

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.700
is probably going to write a module right
up on stage just to show how easy it is.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.640
Also,
we'll have streaming server engineers

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.700
at the QuickTime Feedback Forum and
at the Darwin Birds and Feathers,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.700
so if you want to stop by and
say hi or ask us any questions

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.700
or provide your feedback,
we'd be happy to talk to you.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.890
And that's all I've got to say,
and I'd like to pass off to Joe.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:13.670
Thank you very much.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.800
Randy is setting up an interesting
demo for when we finish up here.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.710
For those of you that don't know,
OpenPlay and NetSprocket are the

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.830
Open Source networking items.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:45.200
[Transcript missing]

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.580
and we've been making some
good headway with it since.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.700
NetSprocket just became Open Source.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.890
You might be familiar with it out of
the GameSprockets package that Apple's

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.700
been supporting for quite some time.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:02.470
And we got that in December and
when I finish up here,

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:08.730
Randall will show us some pretty
exciting developments in what we've got.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:08.730
Do you have the screen?

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.340
OpenPlay right now is live, active,
ready to go on a CBS repository.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:19.690
You can download it, compile it,
Mac OS and Windows, it runs right now.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.000
At least one commercial title,
I believe LucasArts shipped a

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.840
title using it in December in
time for the Christmas market

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.700
and it's gone over quite well.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.700
So it's real, it works, it's effective.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.700
It is cross-platform.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.870
Right now the Linux and
OS X variants are still in the works,

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:42.700
but we've got pretty good
coverage at the moment.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.000
It's protocol agnostic.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.660
It uses a plug-in module design.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.820
which has the advantage of giving
your user the choice of which

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.110
protocol they'd like to use.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.290
If you're using a game market,
for example,

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:04.080
very few home users are that adept
at setting up a TCP/IP network,

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.790
but they can get
AppleTalk up and running.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.160
Using OpenPlay,
you don't have to worry about

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.420
how you're going to support
the lower level protocols.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.200
You let us worry about it
and let the user choose.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.900
So it cuts down your risk,
increases your time to market,

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.150
or reduces your time to market.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:41.100
[Transcript missing]

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:45.460
Which was really nice.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.280
I'll get to it in a bit when
NetSprocket was released.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.280
We'll be able to leverage
some good things.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.190
But basically you have the application,

00:38:53.400 --> 00:39:03.100
[Transcript missing]

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.590
With NetSprocket,
we had some really nice things

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:12.430
that we wanted to have in OpenPlay,
but we didn't have the

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.960
resources at the time to get,
and we were anxious to get it

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.450
released into the community.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.540
When we found out it
was possible to do so,

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.300
we jumped on it.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.360
It is multi-protocol,
TCP/IP and AppleTalk,

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.300
through OpenTransport.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.890
It does some of the
higher level functions,

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.300
packet management, player management.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:36.300
As APIs go,
it's quite simple to work with.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.300
The only disadvantage
was it was Mac only.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.360
There are larger markets out
there that if you could leverage,

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.300
you may as well.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.420
Between OpenGL and OpenPlay,
those two right there can cover

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.760
most needs of many applications.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:57.080
Why not expand your market essentially
for free or as close as you can get?

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.780
So what we've been doing,
Randy in particular has been busting

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.800
butt and he now has NetSprocket
sitting on top of OpenPlay.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.440
So we basically got the best
of all worlds at the moment.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.840
We have, if you want to use it,
the higher level functionality of

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.550
NetSprocket sitting on top of the
cross-platform nature of OpenPlay.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.740
I have a working demo
in about a minute here.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:29.760
The reason it's exciting
to have this out there is,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:29.760
again,

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.390
The cross-platform development
between NetSprocket,

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.870
OpenPlay, OpenGL, and other technologies,
there's really no reason not

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.140
to target multiple platforms.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:45.210
It's better for the Mac environment,
it's better for everybody.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:50.940
The developer community has
been very good at supporting us.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.600
More names than we can
mention at this point.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:57.100
If you want to sign up and join us,
we're ready to roll right now.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.040
We've got a lot of changes coming up.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.100
We've got a critical mass momentum.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:05.800
We'll be finishing up
Linux shortly and then Mac OS X.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.760
And from there, anything we want.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.390
So as it stands now,
you can either write with your

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:18.120
application straight into OpenPlay if
you don't choose to use the higher

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.760
level functions or use NetSprocket.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.240
The one problem OpenPlay has is its name.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.560
It's not necessarily just a gaming API.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.960
We've got people interested
in medical imaging that would

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.440
like to use it and plan to.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.700
Because really it's just sending
bytes using a single API,

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.140
again cross platform.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.920
Advantages for a lot of people.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:48.220
and with that, Randy Thompson,
agent of Freeverse Software,

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:51.740
would like to show off the
wares he's been working on.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.890
Things don't blow up,
but it shows things working and

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:58.540
I happen to think it's kind of fun.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.580
Button three.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.340
Play a game, Joe.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:09.380
I'll let you know when to hit
any menus or buttons or anything.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.650
Gonna play some cribbage.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:15.250
This is a game that I released
with Freeverse Software.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.120
Say thank you Ian, wherever you are.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:22.720
Oh, around the November time frame.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:29.720
Let's just go ahead and do the
NetSprocket OpenPlay demo host game.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.690
and there I am,
Randy T., waiting for other players.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.000
So now Joe, if you'll hit Demo Join Game.

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:43.200
And there's Joe.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.710
So why don't you just
click on the screen once.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.500
and we're shuffling the
cards and ready to go.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.150
You can also chat.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.970
Joe could too if he wanted to.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.640
and Joe Gervais.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.310
So without real,
let's just hit two cards at random there,

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:05.710
Joe.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.530
Uh, yeah.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:13.490
And now it's your turn,
just go ahead and hit a card.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:15.800
You can see that we're
really playing here,

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.500
Joe and I.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.740
I really wish we had time to play
an entire game here in this demo

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.380
because I think I could kick his butt.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:26.800
But it doesn't look like
that's going to be possible,

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.900
so I'm going to choose a restart game.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.900
and Joe LeFranco,
and we're back in a mode where

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.140
we can accept new players.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:39.140
Okay Joe, you're free to go now.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.460
Let me tell you a little
bit about what I did here.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:46.510
Classic Cribbage was released
last November and originally

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.100
it used NetSprocket 1.7.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:55.450
A few months ago I downloaded the
OpenPlay and the NetSprocket source and

00:43:55.450 --> 00:44:00.100
I started to work replacing the open
transport calls inside of NetSprocket.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.100
There were plenty of them.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.710
I pulled them out one by one
and replaced them with their

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.100
equivalent OpenPlay calls.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.580
In some cases there weren't
equivalents so I had to get a little

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:16.100
bit fancy and tricky and hopefully
I don't have too many bugs.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.690
But now we basically have a new
NetSprocket that sits on top of

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.360
OpenPlay as the diagram showed.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.690
Look, Mr.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.060
PC just joined.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.590
I guess he was there for a little while.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.290
Joe, why don't you ask me a question?

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:34.700
Ask me how these folks can be
sure that this cribbage isn't

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.940
just using NetSprocket 1.7.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:40.650
Randy, how can they be sure we didn't
can it just for the demo?

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.400
That's a pretty silly question.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:47.190
How you can be sure is Mr.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:53.750
PC here is actually an
OpenPlay application that's running under

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:57.400
Virtual PC on this laptop right here,
right now.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:02.900
So it's actually a Win32 application
running on Virtual PC that

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.400
just connected with this game.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.540
Unfortunately,
due to technical difficulties,

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:12.140
we couldn't get a video feed
on this old laptop here,

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.120
so you'll just have to trust me.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.280
If you don't want to trust me,
you're welcome to show up on

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.900
Wednesday at Birds of Feather and
you'll be able to see a lot of this.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.900
We'll have a lot more time, I understand,
to do things like that.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.900
So that's pretty much the demo.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:36.390
I think we have one more slide.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.390
Switch over to one.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:44.100
Thank you very much Randy.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.200
So as you can see it's real,
it's in the real world, it's running,

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.400
companies are using it.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.500
It's a good thing.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.400
If you can get to the birds of a feather,
I'd strongly encourage it.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.630
Obviously, we're no better than
our group of developers,

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.100
which is all of you.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.200
So the more people that can contribute,
the further we can get along.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:07.000
And again, it's not just games,
it's networking in general.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.840
And maybe use it to roll into
your own web company and start an

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.220
IPO before the market dries up.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.640
Please make it if you can.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.520
With that,
I'll pass it over to Ron Hayden who

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.630
will be doing the session on HedrDoc.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:36.640
So you saw earlier there are 80,000
hits on Darwin and 600 on HedrDoc.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.190
So one of my jobs,
aside from getting people to contribute,

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.600
is to get people using it.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.720
Frequently,
as important as the source code in any

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.600
Open Source project is the documentation.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.600
And we're very serious about
documentation in Darwin.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.320
So we're starting on a program of
making sure the documentation is

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.600
as close to the source as possible.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.600
And the first project for that is
HedrDoc for reference documentation.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.510
Now why would you want to use HedrDoc?

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.340
Well,
you can go to an Open Source project

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.600
not using a tool like HedrDoc
and get bad documentation.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.600
Or you can go to a Darwin project using
HedrDoc and get great documentation.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.220
What you get from it, with no extra work,
is, in this case we have one

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.600
of our I/O Kit classes.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:21.520
All of our I/O Kit reference
documentation is done using HedrDoc

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.590
and accessible in the source.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.600
We take the I/O Kit class,
we break it down into its introduction,

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.470
its public functions, its protection,
its data types, etc.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:37.600
Give excellent formatting of
parameters and everything else.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.580
For all the work that you have to
do is stick in some tags like this.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.580
So we support C and C++.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:47.670
We stay as close as we
can to Java doc style,

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:50.600
but we have to vary from it because
these are different languages

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.600
and this is a different tool.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:57.420
And you use that and you
get the output that you saw.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:49:00.800
[Transcript missing]

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.140
Also, we find one of the main requests
we have from internal developers

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.340
as well as external is they want
the API grouped and ordered.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.110
So if you have display functions,
you want all those display

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:13.930
functions together,
and you want the most

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.440
commonly used ones at the top,
etc.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.680
So we would love to get some
assistance in making that happen.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:24.300
Finally, and this is already started
thanks to Lewis Gerberg,

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.100
we would like to be outputting XML.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.500
Right now we go directly to HTML,
but it would be great to go to

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.640
XML because then you can choose
what format to go to from there,

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.700
you can go into a database,
we can do lots of cool stuff.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.810
So we have some work on that started,
but there's a lot to do for that and it

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.700
would be great to get some assistance.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.670
But the number one thing anyone can do
is just start using it on your project.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:48.220
We would just love to have everyone
using this on all of the Darwin projects

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:51.980
because that is really going to
make this thing take off and it

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.700
will be really good for everyone.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:03.550
and yes,
we have Birds of a Feather in room

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.280
E at the same time as everyone else.

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.020
So,
I think a couple of important messages

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.880
we want to leave you with here.

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:19.330
Apple is very committed to Open Source.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.300
We have a lot of technologies and
things we shared with you today.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.470
We have some external partners
who we've been working with.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:30.560
We'd like you to join with us in
working on our Open Source technologies.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.900
For these technologies,
the source is live in CVS,

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.590
so if you want to find
out what we're doing,

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:38.600
this is the best way to do it.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.560
Download the source code,
get in there and get involved.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.340
I'm going to stress again,
and you'll hear this a few

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.400
times through the week,
that Darwin,

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:50.550
our OS part of our Open Source project,
is exactly the same source code

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:52.600
as the Core OS for Mac OS X.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.740
If you are involved in Mac OS X,
which you all should be,

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.790
and want to know as much as
you can about what's going on,

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:04.600
get involved with Darwin, contribute,
help learn, get in the right drivers.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.820
There's a lot of cool
technology in there,

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.600
and that's the place to start.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.600
Also, help get involved with the
support infrastructure.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.600
We've got a lot of cool stuff
that we've released recently,

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.600
certainly the CVS stuff.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.130
There's bug reporting,
there's our mailing list,

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.600
all of these things,
our Darwin developers.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.600
These are all resources you should start
working with and start contributing to.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.050
This only works if you're involved.

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:29.390
It's the whole goal of Open Source.

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:33.300
It'd be great if we just, you know,
just made this,

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.460
posted it up on a wall somewhere,
but the real key is,

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.900
is that in order to make this really
powerful is to get you involved.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.900
So, you know, you've got a lot of great
ideas as you're working,

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.910
importing your projects, as you're,
you know, developing cool new technology,

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:49.050
you know,
this is a place to have an impact

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:51.090
on the future of Apple directly.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.370
So get involved.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:58.340
Also check out the to-do list we have
on the website and in the mailing list.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.400
One of the things that we're
trying to do in case you're not

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.230
really sure how to get started,
you want to get involved

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.000
in this Open Source stuff,
it sounds really cool,

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:09.090
but don't know what to get involved
with first or how to get your feet wet,

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.170
we've got some to-do lists
that give you some ideas.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.880
If you've got your own, that's great.

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:18.160
But if you're looking for ways
that you can help contribute and

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.620
help make the environment better,
come check out the website.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:23.560
and definitely join us at the Birds of
a Feather sessions on Wednesday.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.840
There's a great opportunity for a
lot of one-on-one communication.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.960
We'd love to hear from you and your
ideas and ways that we can improve this.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.340
As I said early on in the presentation,
you know, this is pretty new, you know,

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:38.800
a new approach for the community
at large and certainly for Apple.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:43.150
And we're learning and are very open
to any ideas that you might have.
