WEBVTT

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.870
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.860
My name is Rob Neville,
and I'm the engineering manager

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.410
for Network Service Location for
both Macintosh 9 and Macintosh 10.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.000
Today, we're going to be talking
a little bit about both.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.470
Primarily, we're going to be talking
about where we're going with

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.720
Network Service Location on 10,
but we'll also take questions

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.310
if you have them on Mac OS 9
as well in that implementation.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.960
As I said, my name is Rob Neville.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.800
We're going to be joined by
Kevin Arnold and Al Begley

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.390
for Q&A and for a demo,
which we'll have later.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.350
Network Services Location,
this is the third year at WWDC where

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.740
we've had a session on NSL.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.900
Basically,
NSL started as a way for my group,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.770
which at the time was responsible
for developing personal

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.310
web sharing on Mac OS 9,
to allow users to actually

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.000
find the web server.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.200
The initial feedback we got when
we put out personal web sharing was

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.470
that people couldn't find the server.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.380
And in addition,
what we found as a corporation

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.580
was that people were starting
to move away from traditional

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.600
Apple Talk services and wanted the same
type of services over TCP/IP networks.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.660
So our group came up with a solution,
and that solution turned into NSL.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.200
NSL has been shipping on Mac OS 9,
and it was shipping on Mac OS 8.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.560
It's also shipping as part of Mac OS X.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.360
It's on the CD.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.340
The SDK is in the developer's kit,
and you can make calls to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.770
it both from Carbon and from
the lower foundation levels.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.050
It's not called from the Finder,
though we will be demoing

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.680
it from the Finder today.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.190
And why we're having this
particular session as opposed to,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.600
you know, just what you heard
last year is that NSL,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.350
as we move forward into X,
is going to be the way

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.050
The Choser as such,
or the legacy Mac OS 9 implementations

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.660
of how you find services,
changes in Mac OS X.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.530
As services move onto,
and there are more services

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.300
available on TCP/IP,
how you locate those services

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.120
on a dynamic network,
such as DHCP,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.140
NSL plays a much more critical
role in how you're going

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.280
to locate those services.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.920
So NSL is the way that
you as service providers,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.520
as people writing services,
or people writing solutions which

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.300
contact servers and services on the net,
can use to find those services.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.470
In addition,
if there are those of you who are

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.600
from corporate infrastructures,
it will assist you, perhaps,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.560
in this presentation,
to think about how you want

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.970
to structure your network.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.250
Because today,
what we'll talk about is not only

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.210
Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X and NSL in
those particular environments,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.260
but what we've learned in the last two
years from using and developing NSL.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.530
Briefly, NSL is part of Mac OS 9.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.460
You don't really see the NSL user
interface that often in Mac OS 9,

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.850
but the primary part of Mac OS 9 where
NSL is called is the network browser.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.600
NSL is not the network browser.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.160
The network browser is an application
which makes low-level NSL calls

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.090
to get the raw data that it then
presents in a user interface.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.680
In addition, in Mac OS 9,
we have a user interface library which

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.800
puts up a UI which allows applications,
you all,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.060
to call for your specific service.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.650
An example of this,
if you wish to use it in Mac OS 9,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.300
is in AppleScript.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.590
And you can call,
choose URL from inside an AppleScript,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.120
and you'll see what
AppleScript does to access NSL.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.760
And you'll see a long list of a variety
of services that AppleScript knows about.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.490
And where we're going with
this is we wanted NSL to be

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.450
sort of like the standard file,
the same analogy as standard file,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.020
for finding your services on the network.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.330
And so an application can
call our user interface,

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.710
which was the feedback we
got after the first year,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.340
For a particular service,
remote administration,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.100
which is part of Apple Share IP 6.3,
is one of the services which

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.090
uses NSL to find its remote
administration servers on the network.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.300
We're also part of Mac OS X.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.140
And as Mac OS X matures over
the next months and years,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.540
we've structured some changes
into NSL that will facilitate a

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.840
lower-level functionality and a
lower-level system-wide calling of NSL.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.450
So what we've learned.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.030
Well, as I said, one of the first things
that we've learned is that

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.860
network browser is not NSL,
and that though the user

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.790
experience is very similar,

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.150
There are some significant differences.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.700
For example, and we'll show in the demo,
in network browser,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.570
you get all the services that

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:39.260
Network Browser Knows About.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.260
You get file, you get browsing services,
you get FTP,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.260
and you get a pretty long list.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.040
In our user interface,
the data type that you're looking for,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.100
actually the URL type
that you're looking for,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.370
is how we sort that data.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.620
You can choose to show
all the data all at once,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.050
or you can choose to segment it.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.180
And one of the things that we
found is that when we rolled

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.870
out Mac OS 9 internal to Apple,
and we had NSL and people started

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.800
using the network browser,
without a network infrastructure,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.270
what you have is pretty much a flat
list of every server on your network.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.840
If people put all of their services in
one particular what we call neighborhood,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.690
then what you have is all
the servers in one area.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.910
This is sort of like what it would
be if all of the addresses for the

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.300
Santa Clara Valley were El Camino.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.860
That was the only street name you had,
so that every particular business

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.450
would have an El Camino address.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.660
Well, that would perhaps make it very
difficult to find a particular service.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.060
But if you divide up the
network infrastructure,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.740
you separate out various neighborhoods,
much analogous to Apple Talk zones,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.900
what you can find is that users are able
to utilize your services and to navigate

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.700
to find your services much more easily.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.740
Another thing we found,
and we found this from customers,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.170
is that though we provide
in Mac OS 9 four plug-ins,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.500
four different ways for
finding URLs on the network,

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:19.800
Apple Talk, DNS, LDAP, and SLP,
your customers may not

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.890
need to use all of those.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.690
For example, your customers may have
an LDAP infrastructure,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.230
and it may be easier for them,
as we did at Apple,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.590
to set up a web front end for users to
register a service in an LDAP directory

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.400
associated with their name.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.880
So that then when I want
to look up somebody's web

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.800
server or their file server,
that person goes onto a web

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.940
page for your corporation,
loads that data into an LDAP directory,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.340
and then they can find it that way.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.520
They may not need AppleTalk.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.790
They may want to turn AppleTalk off.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.130
You can't be guaranteed that any of the
particular plug-ins will be available.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.130
The other thing that we found as we
made the transition from Mac OS 9

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.970
to Mac OS X is that you all didn't
write any plug-ins on Mac OS 9.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.740
It's been two years.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.890
Maybe you've been doing other things.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.240
Maybe you've had it right
there on the top of your list

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.410
to write a plug-in for NSL.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.300
We don't think so.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.640
For Mac OS X, we have a new technology
that's coming out,

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.220
and that's the Directory Services API.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.960
So as a team,
what we did was we looked at how

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.620
are people going to find services?

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.040
How is that data going to be
stored out there in the network?

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.980
Well, we have our legacy AppleTalk data,
so we needed an MVP plugin.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:44.290
People still wanted to be able to
find Apple Share servers out there,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.060
personal file sharing, things like that.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.210
We had SLP.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.170
And SLP is very,
very good currently for small

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.690
businesses and work groups.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.190
They want to just turn off Apple Talk.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.790
There was a hole there,
and that was the fact that there aren't a

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.050
lot of directory agent servers out there.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.500
As we talked about in an earlier
session on the Mac OS X server

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.660
software that's coming out in about
the same timeframe as Mac OS X,

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.640
we're going to be providing
an SLP directory agent,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:25.050
which will facilitate your customers
in setting up an SLP network.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.280
Then there was DNS,
and a lot of people aren't

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.240
using DNS as a data store,
but it's a more traditional mechanism

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.080
by which people resolve URLs.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.140
In addition, as part of Mac OS X,
with the Bind 8.2 server

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.780
that we'll be providing,
the ability to do

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.670
registration to that server

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.090
comes to fruition.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.060
So with the traditional bind for servers,
you didn't have the capability

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.060
of doing registrations.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.160
It was a static list.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.360
And we were finding that not a
lot of people were adopting that.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.860
With 8.2,
you can have registration take place.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.900
Whether or not the users of the bind
8.2 are going to allow that is going to

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.900
be up to the system's administrators.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.440
So those are the three traditionals.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.470
And on a Mac OS X, we had LDAP.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.100
We had an LDAP library
that was part of Mac OS 9.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.590
We wrote an LDAP plug-in to utilize
that sort of a proof of concept.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.600
But in Mac OS X,
we have the Directory Services API.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.600
So now if the data is not
stored in an LDAP directory,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.730
it's stored in an Oracle database,
or it's stored in a

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.930
Novell network server,
or it's stored in a Windows 2000

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.600
machine using Active Directory,
we don't care.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.270
And we don't have to write a
plug-in for each individual type of

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.540
directory store that's out there.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.350
Using Directory Services plug-in,
when you write a plug-in

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.600
for Directory Services,
you're giving functionality

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.600
to NSL right off the bat.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:06.810
So what we'll be providing in Mac OS X,
an NBP plug-in, an SLP plug-in,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.840
We have a DNS plugin and a
Directory Services API plugin.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.530
We have also taken the
APIs that allow you to write

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.360
plugins and made them private.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.880
So there will not be in the
SDK anything in Mac OS X which will

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.050
facilitate you writing a plug-in.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.800
If you have a particular need for a
plug-in to be written that can't be

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.260
handled in those four categories,
you need to let us know.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.880
Because as of right now,
we don't see the need for

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.660
writing any more plug-ins to
this particular interface.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.810
So, what you're hopefully going to
take out of this is why you should

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.820
use NSL in your applications,
why you should use NSL on your

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.060
servers and register with NSL.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:03.280
Because NSL is going to be the way in
Mac OS X for your services and your

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.080
servers to be found on the network.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.200
If you don't register,
services that come along

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.010
that take advantage of you,
that may want to connect

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.640
to your services,
won't be able to find

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.630
them on a TCP/IP network.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.410
People are making the transition
from Apple Talk to TCP/IP.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.060
Macintosh users are
making that transition.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.740
In Mac OS 9,
when they took personal file sharing,

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.700
they allowed you to do that over TCP/IP.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:38.610
They register with NSL so that
you can find this TCP/IP server

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:38.610
without having to know the address.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.500
Now,
if that address happens to be something

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:45.900
that's changeable every time you boot
your machine on a network such as DHCP,

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.160
Then NSL becomes even more useful.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.840
As we move away from static IP addresses,
if I have a server or a service that

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:01.220
doesn't have a static IP address,
the URL for that address may change

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.870
every time I boot that server.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.510
If I have distributed applications
on desktops and I want to be able to

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.640
find those distributed applications
and the IP address is dynamic,

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.200
I'm going to need NSL to
be able to find those.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.500
NSL, however, is just a mechanism
for finding the address

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.100
It's not LDAP.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.500
It's not SLP.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.400
It's not Directory Services.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:37.830
If you have specific data
stored in those forms,

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:37.830
if you want to write an LDAP application,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.400
You want to be able to
find a remote LDAP server.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.390
Currently in Mac OS 9,
in Internet Config,

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.830
you put your LDAP server.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.410
If I want to go out and find other
LDAP servers that are out there,

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:54.680
and I have an LDAP-specific application,
I can find those servers using NSL,

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.710
but then I want to move and
talk to the LDAP library to be

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.290
able to do LDAP kinds of things.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.660
The same thing with SLP.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.350
SLP, for example,
at some point in the future,

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:12.500
the trend is to put SLP into
the firmware of printers.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.360
That would allow print architecture
to talk SLP directly to the

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.200
printers out there on the network.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.090
Well, NSL will give you the address
of that particular printer,

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.500
but it won't give you any
more information than that.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.870
This is a way to find the
services on the network.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.690
In the same way that NBP and the
AppleTalk stack is just one layer.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.380
It's just the way to locate
those services on the network.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.600
NSL takes that to a level
where it's AppleTalk,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.010
it's TCP/IP, you don't care.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.860
You don't care where the data is stored.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.330
You just want the address of the
service that you're connecting to.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.980
But to do that, you as servers, writers,
and you as service and application

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.590
providers need to use NSL to find
those services on the network.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.620
The desktop in Mac OS X,
and we'll be demoing

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.800
this in a little bit,
has a menu item that

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.670
is Connect to Server.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.330
That interface may or may not change
between now and the final release.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.500
I was up here last year.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.330
We had a connect-to mechanism,
and that changed over the period of time.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:25.660
That may change, but ostensibly,
what's happening in the Macintosh,

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.310
in the Mac OS X specifically,
is those services that allow

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:35.410
you to navigate through a
network and define your services

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:35.410
are going to be calling NSL.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:41.100
And as those things get down lower and
lower and more invisible to the user,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.000
The ability to find those services
is going to be through calling NSL.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:53.070
Once the service, the finder for example,
locates a file system,

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.020
it will have to know what to do.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.130
So where we are today.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.540
We've got an SDK that's out there.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.350
There are a few applications
outside of Apple that call NSL.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:17.710
But we've got an SDK and NSL and Mac OS 9
and going forward is fully supported.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:24.870
Some of the functionality in Mac OS 9,
specifically the SLP plugin,

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.030
and some of the new user interface,
is 9-specific.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.890
So that if you have Macintosh
users who are using 8.0,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.340
they also get NSL,
but they may not be able to see

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.390
all of the SLP services out there.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.890
This is because the spec has
transitioned and changed over time.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:53.400
In addition, we put in a user interface
that the users can call.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.400
We added support into

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.310
AppleScript.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.440
Going forward in Mac OS 9,
there'll be support

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.890
using Macintosh Manager.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.540
To be able to locate client
machines on the network,

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:07.880
those client machines will
be registering using NSL.

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:13.910
So that if you're gearing a solution,

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.730
Be aware that we're supporting
back to Mac OS 9 only.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.090
Don't think you're going to get all the
functionality all the way back to 8,

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.300
even though we shipped with 8.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.100
That's an important distinction to make.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.690
We have file sharing over TCP/IP,
and in a future release,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.940
what we'll be having
is USB printer sharing.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.480
We'll be using NSL to find
those computers that are

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.480
sharing their USB printers.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.960
Part of Mac OS X.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.090
When we made the transition to Mac OS X,
we had a CarbonLib inside of Mac OS X.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.300
We made the transition over to Mac OS X.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.600
The system people came
to us and they said,

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.160
"This is a neat way to find
services on the network.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:02.070
We may want to drop this
down to the core of the OS."

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:07.590
So having all of this API up here
in Carbon may preclude us from

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.480
being able to do some of the lowest
level services and finding some

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.750
of those services on the network.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.320
So what we decided to do in meeting
with those teams is the user interface,

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:27.180
the standard file analogy for getting a
URL using the UI we provide is in Carbon.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.160
The manager is in the
core foundation libraries.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:39.040
So if you need access to the data that
we use to put up in our user interface,

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.690
then you need to call the manager itself.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.980
If all you need is the data that we
put up in the debugged interface,

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.030
and trust me,
we went through a long period of

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.620
debugging with the user interface so
that we're stripping out duplicates and

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.930
doing a lot of things inside the UI.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.890
If you call our UI,
you don't have to debug

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.630
that user interface.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.260
Hopefully,
it'll be as bug-free as we can make it.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.740
You may, however,
still need access to the raw data.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.900
We understand that.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.680
You may want to put up something totally
different as far as a user interface.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.880
That data is available to you,
but you're going to have to link

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.780
to the core foundation instead.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:28.600
And as I said, we're providing MBP, DNS,
SLP, and a directory services plugin.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.360
And if you need anything more,
let us know.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:40.140
So as I said, NSL doesn't provide the
network infrastructure.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:45.080
NSL probably, as it did at Apple,
will show a lack of a

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.710
network infrastructure,
especially on TCP/IP.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.980
In a lot of companies,
the TCP/IP network is relatively flat.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.720
And when you get a lot of
services out there that are

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:07.090
registering in yourcompany.com,
because that's their domain name for SLP,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.390
suddenly you're going to get back
to the situation that AppleTalk was

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.960
in back in the mid-'80s,
where you've got one --

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.400
ostensibly one big zone.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.150
And that may make it difficult.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.350
You as application and service developers
can't do anything really about that.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.880
Other than perhaps evangelize
to your customers that setting

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.340
up a logical division of
their network would be useful.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.280
You also can tell your customers that
they don't all need all the plug-ins.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.180
Particular customers that we've
talked to have made a transition

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.010
off of AppleTalk onto LDAP.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.200
People are waiting with bated breath to
be able to implement our SLP directory

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.540
agent and use SLP as a mechanism for
finding their services on the network.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.750
We're going to be providing
an SLP directory agent

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.180
in the Mac OS X server.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:08.710
The functionality for registering and
creating a distributed SLP network

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:13.620
and networking infrastructure will
be available with a very nice user

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.170
interface in the Mac OS X server.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.010
And as I said before,
we're providing all the

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.700
plugins we think you'll need.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.420
This is the only way you're
going to be able to find

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.900
your services on the network,
other than hard coding in addresses,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.090
or having your servers do multicasting.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.240
To all your clients.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.200
One of the other things that we found
is that traditionally what happened

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:44.230
was networking folks thought that
AppleTalk was a very chatty network.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.820
And when you start putting
hundreds of machines,

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:52.320
TCP/IP machines,
on the network doing multicasting, wow,

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.410
suddenly TCP/IP is a very noisy protocol.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.100
So here's an example of
the NSL architecture.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.400
This isn't a typical
architecture slide you'll see.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.240
What we want you to
get away from this is,

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.900
in Mac OS 9,
you're just linking to one library.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.010
In Mac OS X, you may need to link to two.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.950
And why would you link to two?

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.100
You'd link to two if
you're doing a front end,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.540
point-to-point kind of solution.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.800
If you just want to get the URL,
all you need to do is link to CarbonLib

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.860
and use the standard get URL call.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.000
That will return you a URL.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.590
If you wish to register
a server or a service,

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:47.310
chances are you're going to be linking
into the Core Foundation already.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.100
At some point,
but to register and deregister,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.800
you're going to not link
to Carbon for NSL services,

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.880
but you're going to link to the
core foundation for the NSL manager

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.660
to do a register and a deregister.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:12.220
In addition, though it wasn't shown here,
if you want to get access

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.220
to the data that we use,

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.150
When we put up our user interface,
that data all comes

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.700
through the NSL Manager.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.960
So if you want that data yourself,
link to the NSL Manager and

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.460
don't call our UI.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.800
So, here's some of the services that
are going to be using Mac OS,

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.770
using NSL on Mac OS X.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.040
Mac OS X Server Administration.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.080
This is similar to the Apple Share 6.3.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.940
Server Administration.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.610
If you want to be able to
find an Apple share server,

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:56.300
or remotely administer a mail
server running on top of Mac OS X,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.390
you're going to be using
NSL to find that service.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.580
Mac OS X server is going
to be used to set up and

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.430
configure SLP kinds of networks.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:17.520
List Services Apache and personal
file sharing on Mac OS X will

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.550
also be registering with NSL and
Apple Script will as well.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:32.070
So we understand here that we're
the last session of the day,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.540
and following this session,
there's a beer bust and there are...

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.640
Buses to take you over to Cupertino,
where you can meet face-to-face

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.010
with more of the engineers
and share the camaraderie that

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.030
only comes with imbibing and...

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.740
The goodwill of others.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.100
So we'd like to get into the demo,
and to assist me in the demo,

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.500
I have Kevin Arnold,
who's the SLP and NSL engineer.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.490
Hi.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.990
So what we're going to show
you today is a post-DP4 finder

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:09.610
that's calling into NSL,
and to show you what the

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:14.200
UI looks like in NSL today,
if you were to call it,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.200
that UI is probably going
to change before we ship.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.590
Right now,
it's an aquified version of our

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.000
Platinum interface that we did on 9,
but we're going to do more things

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.330
to make it even more aqua-savvy.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.320
So basically,
go to this connect to server that

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.520
you may have seen grayed out.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.880
Bring it up.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.530
So we,
basically we see a list of network,

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.750
or neighborhoods,
and we still have Apple Talk neighborhood

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:50.370
that will show either a list of
zones or your Apple Talk servers.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.740
And then we also have other
neighborhoods that show up.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.900
Now,
you might notice that there's some kind

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.700
of weird neighborhood names that show up.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:04.980
And this is part of what Rob was
talking about with SLP and the kind of

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:11.700
chaos that can happen in your network
if it's not really structured right.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.420
And that's something that we're working
on in 10 in conjunction with the server

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.700
to make it more administrator-specific,
a way to set this up and then

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.690
it'll all look nice and clean.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.800
So if we go into a neighborhood
that we're interested in looking at,

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.470
you can see that up here we have
a pop-up button that shows what

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.800
kind of services that the calling
application is interested in seeing.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.800
And the finder wants to know about
web servers or Apple share servers,

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:45.450
so we can switch between those
and see which ones are there.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:27:53.300
[Transcript missing]

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.640
Basically, once you hit connect,
the UI basically returns

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.140
to the application.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.550
We return that URL, and NSL is all done.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:12.430
And at that point, it's up to the calling
application to handle that URL.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:18.240
And in this case,
what the finder does is goes to mount.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.700
My volume, or my network,
and I can go ahead and

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.100
select what volume I want,
and it'll show up right

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.800
there on the desktop.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.550
So, that's basically it.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.200
Thank you.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:41.930
So the demo you saw is real similar
to what we've got in Mac OS 9.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.840
If you call AppleScript for Mac OS 9,
you'll see that list is fairly long,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.940
as Kevin was alluding to.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.370
What shows up there and the
names that you wish to put there,

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.040
AFP servers may not make
any sense to anybody,

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.600
file servers might.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.590
So you pass in the string that you want
to have displayed in the pop-up menu.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.390
So we've got a feedback forum tomorrow.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:10.440
We're sort of piggybacking off the server
services feedback forum rather than

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.500
having a separate NSL feedback forum.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.240
That's tomorrow at 9:00.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:18.940
Mac OS X Directory Services was
held this afternoon at 2:00.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:24.370
Hopefully those of you interested
in that will have gone to that.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:32.090
So, what I want you to take away from
here is that the chooser is no more.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:39.680
If you start Mac OS X and you start,
I believe, Classic real fast,

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:43.400
you can see it briefly
under the Apple menu,

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:48.500
and you can go double-click on it,
no guarantees,

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:54.020
the way to find your services under
Mac OS X going forward on both

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:59.330
Apple Talk and TCP/IP networks
is going to be with NSL.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.560
And NSL will give you the address of
the service that you're looking for.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.110
You need to know what to do with that.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.970
You need to know whether or
not it's a telephone number,

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.700
a street address, a file server,
web server.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:13.470
We don't know.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.950
We'll just tell you where it is.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.460
And that we're providing the plugins
that we think you will all need.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:28.800
And if you need more,
you need to let us know.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.720
So with that, I'd like to take questions.
