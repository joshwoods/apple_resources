[Transcript missing]

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.700
We do certainly get
asked the question a lot,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.920
what is Apple doing building servers?

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.790
And we absolutely passionately believe
that you can't deliver a great user

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.180
experience on the desktop if you don't
have a great server backing it up.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.450
There are areas where Apple can
truly understand how to optimize

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.990
to meet the needs of Mac users in
areas where competitive servers will

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.890
just never have that same degree of
attention to detail or polish or focus.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.500
And we really believe
the mission at Apple,

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.520
hopefully you've heard time
and time again this week,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.240
is to build the best
possible personal computer.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.960
And in the 21st century and
certainly in the Mac OS X era,

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.050
that requires having an
incredibly strong server platform.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.360
So where are we going?

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.040
Well, Apple Share IP for many, many,
many years has been an

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.200
unbelievably great product for us.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.460
It's been the number one server in the
education market pretty much forever.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.510
It focuses on incredible ease of use with
great general purpose services from file,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.540
print, web, mail services now with the
current Apple Share IP product.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.550
With Mac OS X, we're going to have an
incredibly powerful platform.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.600
As you saw, hopefully,
in the hardware keynote Tuesday morning,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.420
Mac OS X,
from an infrastructure perspective,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.100
is capable of some
incredibly great things.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.690
We're going to have an
incredibly great file system,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.500
very modern network environment,
and as was hinted in the keynote,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.590
an enablement of
symmetric multiprocessing.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.760
All of these capabilities,
when you add it to the wealth of

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.080
services that Apple Share provides,
leads us with an incredibly

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.000
strong platform that is powerful,
robust, scalable,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.700
and is easy to administer and manage.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.970
Also add on top of that the
innovative new capabilities

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.080
that Mac OS X server provides.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.330
Netbooting,
the easiest way to get a network,

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.140
say a classroom in a lab,
set up with almost zero administration.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.680
QuickTime streaming.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.080
QuickTime is transforming how
people communicate over the web.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.880
You need a powerful engine,
and we've delivered QuickTime streaming

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.720
with the Mac OS X server product.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.910
And then you take all of that
with the context of open source.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.410
The fact that the Darwin layer,
we ship the source code to the very

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.000
foundation of the operating system,
and it allows and enables certain

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.650
opportunities to enhance the system,
for you to take it in directions

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.520
that maybe we haven't had
the chance to prioritize.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.540
And it makes for a much more open
and easy to work environment for

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.520
certainly the developer community.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.250
You add all of that together,
and you have what we believe,

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.850
and we're very excited about it,
is just an incredible,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.310
the best ever server that
Apple has ever produced.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.780
So let me just spend a couple
minutes talking about some of the

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.900
history and some of the lineage
behind our current servers.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.650
And I'll focus on maybe
just two key areas,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.900
one in K12 and then one
very close to Apple.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.900
When Mac OS X Server was
introduced last March,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.900
there's a number of very
powerful capabilities,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.660
but one that was incredibly exciting,
very bleeding edge in terms of

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.640
a new technology introduction,
was NetBoot.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:20.780
And we consciously picked a number
of test sites that we would be able

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.900
to evaluate and test the technology.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.900
One of those was a K12 school district,
Hacienda de la Puente.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:36.290
And the benefits of being able to
take a server and configure it with a

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.000
version of the Mac OS operating system
that had the right set of extensions,

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.900
the right set of preferences,
the right applications,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.350
and literally just walk in with an iMac,
connect up a network connection,

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.800
hold down the N key,
and that iMac would boot across

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.900
the network off of that server.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.090
It's a very interesting technology.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.400
and others have been involved in this.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.390
Thank you.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.720
I think it's important to note that
the average service time for a school

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.130
district is about two and a half days.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.500
It really has transformed the way that
school district can deliver content.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.990
Students are free to roam from
machine to machine to machine.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.670
Their work environment is always there.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.460
From an administration perspective,
they are able to keep their network

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.100
up-to-date with minimal investment.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.360
It's been a highlight in terms of how
the future of technology can really

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.400
change the way that people teach
and learn using computers as a tool.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.020
We've seen just incredible
interest around the world

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.400
in the NetBoot technology.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.680
It's actually expanded well
beyond the K-12 market,

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.650
even though that was our
initial primary focus.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:13.040
Another really amazing capability
with Mac OS X Server in terms of its

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.160
robustness and the WebObjects application
server solution for which there are 18

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.400
tracks here at the conference this week,
is just some of the incredible things you

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.500
can do in terms of delivering web-based
services in concert with all the other

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.440
technologies that the server provides.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.980
A couple interesting little
anecdotes about the power of

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.420
Mac OS X Server in that environment.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.450
The Apple Store is one of the
leading e-commerce sites in the web,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.940
a pan market,
not just the computer technology market.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.840
It is incredibly reliable.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.230
We basically, on an annualized rate,
realize about a billion dollars worth of

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.420
revenue that is sold through that store,
and that is running

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.780
completely on Mac OS X Server.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:01.460
It's an incredible service.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.130
It's an amazing thing to put
the trust of that much revenue

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.560
in the hands of technology,
but we believe incredibly

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.460
strongly that you have to,
these words have been used before,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.310
eat your own dog food.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.700
We use Mac OS X Server for the store.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.460
We use it to deploy a number
of the iTools solutions.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.030
We're using it for internal networks.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.460
And it's been an absolutely
amazing technology,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.610
and we're investing very,
very heavily in it.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.960
So let's walk through
the basic architecture.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.460
Hopefully this is now in order.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.670
This is an old, boring slide,
the definitive architecture

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.220
roadmap of Mac OS X.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.740
Where we have the Darwin layer,
it's the operating system plumbing,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.450
strong graphics architecture,
a variety of application

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.220
programming models,
and obviously the user interface.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.800
Well, how does the server fit into this?

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.420
How do we map the key technologies
and the architectures and the layers

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.220
that a server platform would provide?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.830
Well, take that whole Mac OS X picture
that you saw previously,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.460
and that's the
Mac OS X layer at the bottom.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.770
bottom of our server services roadmap.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:10.180
The important message is that our
server offerings start with the

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.290
desktop product and then we add to it.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.060
We have a number of services
that I'll talk to in a moment,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:24.050
but there's two key bands below
and above our individual services,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.170
and that's a common directory
architecture and a common

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.280
administration model.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.890
From the services perspective,
File and Print remains the primary

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:39.700
services that a workgroup network
expects to be great and work well,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.700
especially in a Mac-oriented environment.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.130
A wealth and portfolio
of Internet services from

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.700
Web through Mail and others.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.650
Comprehensive network services
and network solutions.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.700
Desktop Management Services.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.670
Desktop management allows a K-12
school administrator to create all of

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.700
the policies in order to effectively
run a lab of student-driven machines.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.700
Are they allowed to access CD-ROMs?

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.700
What preferences should be
managed on their behalf?

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.700
Which preferences are they
allowed to manage themselves?

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.070
And as I mentioned,
a comprehensive administration

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.550
architecture so that we have the
ease of use and the simplicity

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.700
of managing a diverse system.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.590
out of server services.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.060
So that's a very high level
perspective on our approach,

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.210
our architecture.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.180
I'd like to invite on stage Greg Burns.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.340
He will talk about the server
solutions and the internet,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.490
and it's all yours.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.800
Thanks, Ken.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:45.800
Hi.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.340
I'm going to talk to you a bit about what
we're doing with additional services on

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.800
top of the Mac OS X operating system.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.730
But before we get into that,
I want to say one more

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.630
thing about Mac OS X,
the operating system itself.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.630
And you've all seen this diagram now,
I think, several times.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.560
It has Darwin down at the bottom.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.510
And hopefully many of you have heard
that Darwin is based in part on FreeBSD.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.780
And FreeBSD is not a newcomer
to the operating system world,

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.980
and there's a lot of experience built
into FreeBSD running as a server.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.130
Has anybody here ever heard of Yahoo?

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:22.860
Everybody?

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.040
You should all be raising your hands.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.470
How about Hotmail?

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.580
Probably heard of that as well,
Microsoft's Hotmail.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.460
Both of these are networks
that run on FreeBSD.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.960
So FreeBSD has a good pedigree
as a server operating system,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.220
and as part of the core of Mac OS X,
it provides a good foundation

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.640
for providing a server.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.620
And as Ken said,
we're not a big iron company,

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.740
but for our customers,
there is a strong foundation

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.950
there for building services.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.980
So in Mac OS X Server,
we are providing some

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.630
additional capabilities on top
of the core operating system.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.400
The first one is the
Directory Services and the

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.150
Directory Architecture.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:04.290
And the goal here is that we want to
have a common directory that underlies

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.230
all of the services and applications
using the network in Mac OS X.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.020
And we do this in two parts:
through an API that any

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.050
application can use,
and this allows any service,

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.690
any application, whether it be on the
client or the server,

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.200
to access network resources.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.000
And because we recognize,
even though we provide a

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.530
directory with Mac OS X,
we recognize there are other

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.500
directories in the world,
and perhaps you want to access NDS or

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.600
Kerberos or some other directory.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.150
So this API provides for the
ability to access other directories.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.320
And in addition to accessing
information in directories,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.920
you also want to be able to figure
out whether or not somebody is

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.620
authorized to use resources.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.660
John Smith may be in a directory,
but you also want to know if the

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.490
client is in fact John Smith and
give him authorization to

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.820
access certain resources.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.950
So the directory APIs include
a central authentication

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.740
authority to provide for that.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:59.000
And together with the network information
and the central authentication authority,

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.580
you can manage users
centrally in your network.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.790
And so how does it fit together?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.100
Well, the key piece here is that
green band in the middle,

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.100
the Directory Access API.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.260
This exists both on the
Mac OS X desktop and on the server side.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.850
And our software,
as well as your solutions,

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.880
can sit on top of this.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.360
This is a public API.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.000
We have extensive documentation for it.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.210
And it's very easy to use,
very easy to get access to any

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.500
directory service through this.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.740
And underneath there,
you'll see that there

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.500
are several plug-ins.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.500
There's an open plug-in architecture.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.660
And we use that ourselves.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.500
This is key.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.500
We use it ourselves
for accessing NetInfo.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.050
So we're eating our own dog food here.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.430
And all of the accesses to NetInfo,
our directory service,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.480
are done through this
plug-in architecture.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.500
We also provide LDAP, as well.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.680
But in addition, if you have a directory,
you can plug in there, as well.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.140
The API, as I said,
it exists on the desktop

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.170
as well as the server.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.000
It's utilized by all of our services.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.730
In our current Mac OS 9 product,
Apple Share IP,

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:06.170
we have Directory Services in there,
but they weren't universally

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.360
utilized by all of our services,
and that's something we

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.560
wanted to fix for Mac OS X.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.810
So now in Mac OS X,
all of the services are integrated

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:15.810
with the core Directory architecture.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.030
And as you saw, it is extensible.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.930
It's a runtime plugin architecture,
so you can develop new directory plugins

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:26.000
that allow applications to access new
directories without having to touch the

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.440
code or recompile those applications.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.470
And we ourselves will be delivering
NetInfo and LDAP support as part

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.660
of the core directory services
in the desktop and on the server.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.820
On the server side,
in addition to the APIs for

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.400
accessing the directory,
we're also providing the NetInfo

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.610
Directory Service itself.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.200
This is Apple's distributed
replicated directory service,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.680
and this provides the ability to
manage users and resources on the

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.880
network for a Mac OS X Server.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.040
We recognize, again,
that there will be clients

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.830
that don't use NetInfo that
want to access this directory,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.760
and so we will be providing LDAP server
support as well to provide the same

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.900
data in response to LDAP queries.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.720
In addition,
we know that if we're using an

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.900
external directory such as LDAP,
for instance,

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.940
if you want services in Mac OS X to
be able to take advantage of this,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.040
we have a standard schema that you
can enter into the LDAP directory

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.180
to allow accounts in Mac OS X to
log in and to utilize services

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.500
through this LDAP directory.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.200
And so that is all well
defined in the API.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.620
So where's the opportunities
for you in all this?

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.210
Well, first and foremost,
if you have a directory,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.830
if you're a systems developer,
or perhaps you're

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.320
working at a university,
you have a proprietary directory,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.190
in particular to your site,
we want your directory

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.780
to work with Mac OS X.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.900
So develop a plug-in for your directory.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.140
And secondly,
if you're developing an application,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.470
whether it be a productivity
application like email,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.720
calendars, et cetera,
or a vertical application,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.570
if you're doing directory access,
you'll want to use the Directory API.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.140
And finally, of course,
managing directories

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.060
is a complex activity,
and so there is opportunity here

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.730
as well to provide management
utilities for directory services.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.820
There is an additional session tomorrow
that you'll want to be aware of if you're

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.800
interested in learning more about the
Directory APIs and developing to them,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.800
and that's going to be in this
room tomorrow at the same time.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.420
And so if you're interested in this,
please come back tomorrow and hear

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.720
more about the Directory API and
how to develop plug-ins and how to

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.790
use the API for your applications.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.090
Okay, so the directory, of course,
sits on both the client and the server.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.890
Now we're going to talk specifically
about some stuff that is part of the

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.470
server and will be in the server version
of the Mac OS X operating system.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.040
And I'll tell you a little
bit about where we're going

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.790
from a technology standpoint.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:56.120
File Services, as Ken mentioned,
is a core staple of a server offering.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.000
And so with File Services,
we want to provide basic,

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.000
high-performance,
reliable services for any client.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.290
And in addition,
because Sherlock is a core

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.540
part of Apple's technology,
we want to make sure that the

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.780
indexing support for Sherlock is
built into the File Services as well.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.260
So again, how does this fit together?

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.660
Well, if you look at this at the top,
you see a variety of file services that

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.320
we want to support in Mac OS X Server.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.850
And the key here is that
these are all shared.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.330
A key goal of Mac OS X Server is to
bring all these services together

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.400
and to make the configuration and
the privilege management integrated,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.040
sitting on top of the Mac OS X operating
system and the Mac OS X file

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.250
system and file system privileges.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.100
And of course,
all of these services use the

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.790
Directory Service for user
access and authentication.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.700
So as far as the services themselves,
of course we have AFP.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.710
And with AFP we've introduced
some changes to the protocol.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.640
So we have a new version, 3.0,
that adds some more features

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.560
for support of Mac OS X,
the Mac OS X desktop.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.250
In addition, we have SMB support.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.160
That's something that is new to the
upcoming version of Mac OS X Server.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.020
Our SMB support is based on Samba.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.460
I'm sure a lot of you
are familiar with that.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.220
It is the best third-party implementation
of Windows File Support around.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.950
It's open source and
it's been well tested.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.420
And so that's something that
we are going to be providing

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.370
in Mac OS X Server as well.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.000
Mac OS X Server is UNIX,
so underneath the hood in Darwin,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.260
there is UNIX down there,
and so there is NFS in there as well.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.500
So that is additional service that
will be provided for UNIX clients.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.310
And of course, FTP,
if you have web browsers you want

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.500
to download across the internet,
FTP of course needs to be there as well.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.570
And one of the shortcomings of the
current version of Mac OS X Server that's

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.790
shipping today is that there are
some limitations in the servers on

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.500
what file systems you can export.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.430
So we wanted to remove that.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.220
So services like AFP and SMB in
the future will be able to work

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.500
with the various file services
that come inside of Mac OS X.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.110
So whether it's HFS or UFS,
etc., you'll be able to manage

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:06.500
both of those and export both of
those through the various services.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.400
And of course, as we saw in the picture,
all of it is unified.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.750
A key part of our overall server offering
is to make it very simple to use and

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.500
unified in terms of the management.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.120
The performance is something that
we've been working hard at to

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.500
make sure that it is very fast.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.420
And you've probably seen
some of the demos around SMP,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.500
and you know we are working hard
to make sure that in the future

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.500
when SMP is available that we'll
be able to take advantage of that.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.530
And of course,
we leverage the reliability of

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.260
the Mac OS X kernel as well.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.840
And in addition,
we've put some work into making

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.840
sure that there are watchdog
services and other capabilities

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.710
to keep the server up and running.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.690
In terms of developer opportunities here,
the first thing you should be

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.440
aware of is that if you're an
AFP developer on any platform,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.510
you should support AFP 3.0 to
provide full support for Mac OS X.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.770
Secondly,
if you're doing a directory plugin

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.140
that requires more than just a username
and password for authentication,

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.180
then you'll want to know about
custom user access methods that

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.040
are part of the Apple Share client.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.380
And this allows you to do
complex authentication dialogues.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.280
Most cases you won't need this,
but if you're doing

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.020
something really fancy,
it's something you should be aware of.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.410
And finally,
there are some extension APIs and

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.130
the capability to extend some
of these services that you

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.220
might be interested in as well.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.370
Print services is the other
staple of a server offering.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.890
And the key thing to be aware of
about printing on Mac OS X is that

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.500
there's a whole new print architecture.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.390
And so if you're involved in any
way in printing or print services,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.440
this is something that you're
going to want to learn a lot about.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.880
And there's a couple sessions
about that coming up,

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.040
and I'll point you to those in a minute.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.060
But another thing as far as
printing in Mac OS X Server is that

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.130
we've layered all of our services
on this print architecture.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.090
So in the past, in Mac OS 9,
we had a completely

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.760
separate print service,
completely separate print

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.070
architecture that couldn't leverage
anything on the server side that

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.380
had been done on the client side.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.360
And of course, that was a shortcoming,
and we fixed this.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.670
So now as a developer,
if you have a driver for a

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.830
particular type of printer,
it will work on both the

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.010
server and the desktop.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.650
So that's something that is good news,
and you should be aware of that.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.930
In addition,
the printers that we support right now,

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.630
the printing protocols
support PostScript.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.480
But if you want to do converters,
for instance,

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.110
that would take you to a raster printer
on the back end for the desktop.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.750
That will also work on the server.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.680
So printing.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:36.170
So we support clients, both Macintosh,
Windows, and Unix.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.080
Again,
the Windows support comes from Samba,

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.280
so we get very robust support there.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.420
And the support for the queues,
of course, right now is any

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.930
Mac OS X PostScript printer.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.600
But again, as a developer,
you have the opportunity to put in

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.380
PostScript to raster converters and
have those work on the server as well.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.350
And of course, because it's a server,
you can manage the queues and manage

00:24:54.350 --> 00:25:00.010
the print jobs over the network as part
of our integrated management utilities.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.700
As far as print opportunities
for you as a developer,

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.150
first and foremost,
if you have a solution for

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.440
publishing that runs on Unix,
you should port it to Mac OS X.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:15.320
So if you're doing print services,
publishing workflow, reps, what have you,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.500
there is an opportunity here.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.540
It's very easy to port
these services to X,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.060
and you should get started.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.890
And I know some people already
have products running here,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.890
but if you don't,
it's time to get started.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.820
And the other thing here,
which I mentioned,

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.440
is that drivers for the client
side will also work for the server.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.060
So it makes it very easy to support
additional types of printers on the

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.260
server side as well as the desktop.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.820
And of course,
there is also the opportunity to

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.610
add additional management tools
to our server products as well.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.830
Okay, so that covers File and Print.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.630
Now another key area of our service
offering is Internet Services.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.810
And Internet Services, of course,
any core piece of any server

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.350
is web and email services.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.530
But we also have two
technology areas that are very

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.290
important to us here at Apple,
and that's QuickTime and WebObjects.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.140
And you've probably heard a lot about
those at the conference here so far.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.060
On the web side,
of course we want to have a web

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.200
service that provides web site hosting,
whether it be very simple,

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.450
something you want to get
up and running in minutes,

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.710
to very sophisticated
sites with virtual hosts.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.940
A service that has a full-featured
web server with high performance.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:27.080
And of course we need it to be
integrated with our management solution,

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.160
and we need it to be able to support
application development services like

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.130
WebObjects or like server-side scripting.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.120
And the way we do this, of course,
is with standard Apache.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.800
Those of you who are familiar with
the current Mac OS X Server know

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.810
that it includes standard Apache.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.660
It is the standard Apache module.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.710
In fact,
if you took the open source Apache and

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.360
recompiled it and substituted it in,
it would work just fine.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.160
So this is fully standard
Apache with the dynamic module API.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.590
And to that,
we've added server-side scripting.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.980
It's available through
standard Apache modules.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.120
Apache is well used
throughout the internet.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.640
There's almost 9 million
sites using Apache now.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.250
It's about 60% of the internet.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.150
But even though it's well used,
it's not the highest

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.340
performing server out there.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.870
And so we've put a lot of work
into increasing the performance.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.510
And so that's an area where we're
going to continue to work on to have

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.660
a really high performance product.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.880
And in addition,
some additional things that are coming in

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.190
the product that we're looking into are,
of course, increasing the capabilities

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:31.390
as far as SSL and e-commerce,
and also Sherlock indexing for the sites.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.740
As a developer, of course,
because it is standard Apache,

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.060
it's very easy for you to come
in and develop Apache modules

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.840
to enhance the server,
to add new capabilities,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.690
or to bring modules onto
the Mac OS X platform.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.520
And of course,
the opportunity for management

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.600
tools exists as well.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.080
That's something that's very
important in website management.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.670
The other area that we're looking
at as far as core web services,

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.330
obviously, is email services.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.480
They're very widely
used and very important.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:03.770
And of course, as part of Mac OS X,
it needs to include an integrated

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.020
and very easy to use email server.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.880
And of course, it needs to scale as well
and be high performance.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.820
And because we have a lot of customers
that run on sites that have intermittent

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.920
connections to the internet,
we need to be able to support

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.200
message delivery remotely as well
through intermittent connections.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.100
And the way we do this, of course,
is that we will be providing an

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:30.140
integrated mail server that includes
SMTP for message delivery and routing,

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.340
as well as POP and IMAP mailbox services.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.350
Now, this server will work completely
by itself independently,

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.440
but because there are a lot of
folks that want to do more advanced

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.760
scripting of mail delivery and routing,
we have the option to work

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.940
with SendMail for delivery.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.890
Or for that matter,
any other mail delivery

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.400
agent can be configured to
do the mail routing as well.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.300
And of course,
like any mail server these days,

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.580
it includes anti-spam and the
message delivery capabilities

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.150
that we talked about.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.850
Another part of our mail server is that
it's integrated with the directory.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.420
So whether you're using our own
directory or whether you're using LDAP,

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.390
you can code into the directory
where the user's mailbox is

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.310
located and what machine it's on.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:15.800
And routing can be set up for complex
mail installations in that manner.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.440
And finally,
we have something that exists today in

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:23.020
Apple Share IP which we'll carry forward,
and that's our IMAP administration port,

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.520
which for people wanting to do
additional management utilities

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.430
makes it very easy to go in
through IMAP with an administrator

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.100
account and have full access.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:34.270
So the entire mail store,
all the accounts and all the messages for

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:37.090
management reporting and what have you.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.500
So in terms of developer opportunities,
well, there's two sides here.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.760
One is if you have an application,
for instance, a server-side application,

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.300
say web-based email as an example,
make sure it runs on 10.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.860
The other is if you have
a client application,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.900
make sure it runs well in markets
that are important to Mac customers.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:59.760
A good example here is the K-12
market where the mail users don't

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.700
have ownership of a particular
machine and need to move from machine

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.600
to machine to access their mail.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.980
On the management side, of course,
there are a variety of management

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.040
tools that can be built,
including account

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.100
management through IMAP,
management of routing through SendMail,

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:18.190
as well as log management
or mail tracking.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.660
So let's move on to two of the services
that are core to us here at Apple.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.640
First one is QuickTime and
QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.530
Now, QuickTime Streaming Server,
hopefully most of you have heard of this,

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:35.430
but in case you haven't,
it delivers live media or on-demand

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.490
media through QuickTime movies
across the internet to hundreds

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.600
or thousands of customers.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.600
So you can take an application
that's broadcasting live media,

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.770
say a radio show or a video, live video,
and basically have the

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.180
QuickTime Streaming Server deliver
that to hundreds of customers,

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.500
thousands of customers.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.100
Or you can take a QuickTime movie and
hint it and put it up on the server,

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.840
and that movie can be accessed
on-demand and streamed to customers.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.250
It's completely standards-based.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:05.500
It runs on the RTSP and
RTP IETF protocols,

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.630
so it is the only fully standards-based
streaming solution out there.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.150
And in addition to being a server,
you can also relay other broadcasts.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.610
So basically you can set up--
. a relay of a live broadcast,

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.910
or you can set up multiple relays to
scale up a very large configuration for

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:25.540
thousands and thousands of customers.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.160
Each server itself is highly scalable,
so whether you want to support a 56k

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:34.660
modem or a 288 modem or go to broadband,
DSL, or cable, or even to Internet at

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.420
megabits per second,
the server is capable of handling that.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.560
And at modem speeds it can
handle thousands of connections.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.760
And the other thing it's capable
of doing that's important is

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.560
usually over the Internet most
connections are done unicast.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.560
You take a connection from the server
and you send data to the client,

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.560
and that's a single connection,
a single pipe.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.480
So if you have thousands of clients,
you have thousands of connections.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.520
But the server itself is also
capable of handling multicast.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.560
So if you're in an area of the
Internet that can handle multicast,

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.560
or if you're on an intranet
where it's configured,

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.510
you have the ability to reach a lot more
clients with less network bandwidth.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.100
The server itself also
has web administration,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.700
something that we've been working on.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.300
And of course,
if you haven't heard of it,

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.100
hopefully you'll want to check it
out because it's fully open source.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.610
Some of our competitors will charge
about $50,000 for a product like this,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:25.870
but for us it's free.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.700
And so you can go out and get the server,
you can get the source today,

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:30.300
check it out.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.050
It runs on multiple platforms
in addition to Mac OS X Server.

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:38.570
And so this is what we think is the
most expandable streaming server around.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.820
Not only is it open source,
you have full access to the

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.700
source to do whatever you want,
but it also has a module API,

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.870
similar to Apache.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.070
So different developers can come
up and add new functions to the

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.940
server without having to learn
the whole source base or without

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.070
having to get in each other's way.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.000
And this is important for you
as a developer as an opportunity

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.100
because it allows you to develop
new features to the server.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.090
The streaming market
is expanding rapidly.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.720
It's a very rapidly growing market.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.400
And there's a real opportunity to
get in here and add new features.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.530
But it allows you to add those new
features not only as open source,

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:15.100
but also as modules which can be
shipped independently of the server.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.300
And you can sell those modules as
binaries and sell them for money.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.970
So there's an opportunity to go
both ways here and certainly a

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.700
good developer opportunity in
building modules for the server.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.330
And of course,
as with the rest of the service,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.370
there's additional options
for management tools.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.210
Certainly in the streaming area,
that's an area where a lot

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.600
of management is needed.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.200
People want to know who's watched
what for how long and when.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.840
So there's a lot of opportunity for
management tools there to help out

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.960
with QuickTime Streaming Server.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.320
Our WebObjects services you may
have heard a lot about if you've

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.190
been going to some of the sessions,
so I'm not going to cover

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.060
too much here today.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.500
But just so you know,
WebObjects is our application server

00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:01.290
that provides database content for web
services at the back end of a web server.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.880
It runs on a variety of platforms,
including NTE and Solaris,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.430
as well as Mac OS X Server.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.580
And in addition to providing
the application server itself,

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.530
there's a lot of tools that
allow you to develop the

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:13.370
services as well as manage them.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.750
And there's also objects that are there
as well that have been pre-written

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.310
to help you get going quickly.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.280
And, you know, here's a good picture that
shows you sort of an example

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.710
of how it all fits together.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.420
If you look in the upper
right-hand corner there,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.230
you'll see the web browser
basically going through the

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:30.850
web server into WebObjects,
which brokers access to data,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.970
whether the data is in a
database or other data source.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.350
Or you can use the Java clients
that Avi demoed on Monday to

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.620
go into WebObjects directly
to access the same data.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.420
So, you know,
the point here is that there's

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:43.420
tremendous opportunity.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.750
And WebObjects and pretty much
any web application you want

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:50.260
to build on the server side,
you can do it with WebObjects.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.380
You know, there's 18 sessions going on.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.370
We have one every time, every day.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.340
So if you have heard about
WebObjects and you're interested,

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.350
hopefully you've been to
some of those sessions.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.960
And if you haven't,
you should definitely check them

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.600
out between now and Friday because
there is a lot of opportunity

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.460
here for you as developers.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.540
Lastly, I want to talk just briefly
about Network Services.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:17.430
Network Services are another piece of the
offering that we have in Mac OS X Server,

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.050
and that includes some of the lower layer
networking capabilities that you use to

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.570
set up a network and servers themselves.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.490
And these are things like DNS,
which are used for setting

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.510
up domain name servers,
and of course there, as this is Unix,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.700
we're leveraging Bind.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.020
And we also have DHCP for
address assignment,

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.700
as well as SLP,
which does dynamic name lookup.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.700
It's very similar to
AppleTalk's dynamic name lookup,

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.580
but it's a protocol that was designed
specifically for TCP by a standards body.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.340
And all of these are available,
or will be available,

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.570
through Mac OS X Server,
and of course we have them integrated

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.700
with the server offering themselves.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.790
So that gives you kind of an overview
of where we're going with some of the

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.700
Internet and the file and print services.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.700
And so now I want to bring up Bob Murphy.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.100
He's going to talk a bit more about
our desktop management and the

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.700
capabilities and technology there.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.600
Okay, thank you, Greg.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.400
As you mentioned, my name is Bob Murphy.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.680
I manage an engineering group here at
Apple that's responsible for Macintosh

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.700
Manager and Network Assistant,
two components of the server program,

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.300
as well as multiple users,
which is a component of Mac OS 9.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.260
Today we won't be talking
about multiple users,

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:38.170
but instead focusing on those
pieces of the server product.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.900
are in the right direction here.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.300
As Greg mentioned, we'll talk about
Desktop Management Services today.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:49.400
I'll also touch briefly on the
administration piece before turning

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:49.400
it back over to Ken for him to close.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.870
So I'd like to thank you for this
opportunity to get a chance to

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:57.440
tell you about the things that
my team and I work on at Apple.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:00.780
And these are some of the key
pieces that we're involved with:

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:04.150
Macintosh Manager, Network Assistant,
and NetBoot.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.460
Just to kind of get an idea,
how many of you are familiar or

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.760
have worked with Macintosh Manager?

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.110
Can I see a show of hands?

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.480
So that makes me feel good.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.140
How about Network Assistant?

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.640
Oh great,
so we've got a lot of experience.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.980
And NetBoot, is anybody working with
a NetBoot installation?

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.150
Great.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.400
I'm feeling really good about this.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.970
Well, hopefully,
hopefully it's not all as bad as you,

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:40.020
you know, say it to be.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.020
But...

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.040
For those of you who aren't
familiar with Macintosh Manager,

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.700
just a brief overview.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.320
Macintosh Manager is a product
that has a server component

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.730
as well as a client component.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:55.400
It really provides what we like to think
of as two key pieces of functionality.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.830
We talk about the virtual desktop,
the ability to move

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.540
preferences and bookmarks.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.420
Ken mentioned them some in the success
story where we have the ability to

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.740
move things around to take advantage
of people going to different machines.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.680
It also provides a piece of
what we call resource policy,

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.030
which restricts access
to certain resources as

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.770
defined by the administrator.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.710
For example, whether or not people
can go to the chooser,

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.800
what applications they can launch.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.690
So basically,
kind of configure the experience that

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.800
the user has on their desktop machines.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.530
Network Assistant does
not require a server,

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.590
but it is bundled as part of
the product because it is a

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.800
very useful administrative tool.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.450
What Network Assistant does is
there's an administrative workstation

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.080
as well as a client component.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.500
And again,
we can break Network Assistant down

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.800
into two key pieces.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.870
One we like to think of as interaction.

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.850
It gives you the ability to
communicate with the user either

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.680
through text chatting or through
sharing screens or through controlling

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.800
screens to large numbers of users.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.950
The second piece we like to
consider is an administrative

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.330
maintenance component of the product,
which allows the user to

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.800
configure workstations similar
to their own or to their own.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:02.800
So, this is a very useful tool.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.100
The third component, NetBoot,
is a tool to help make

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.800
administrators' life easier,
basically around the

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:09.800
management of the client OS.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.690
What we do is we provide a
server-based OS image that

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.790
then remote clients can boot.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.800
So we have administration and management
of the OS in one central location.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.800
So, we have a server-based OS image
that then remote clients can boot.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.800
So, we have administration and management
of the OS in one central location.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.820
What I'd like to talk about are some
of the goals that we have for Macintosh

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.540
Manager in the future releases.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:39.530
And I think primarily to our
efforts is simplification.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.350
What we found is there's a great
increase in the number of desktop

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.590
machines without a corresponding
increase in administrators to

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.000
manage and take care of those.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.030
So anything that we can do,
any work that we can do to simplify

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.560
that experience and make it easier
for administrators to work with,

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.210
we want to try to accomplish.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.800
Macintosh Manager has been very closed.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.260
We had our own proprietary database.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.680
We didn't give access
to the login screen.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.410
We need to work to make it more open
and more available for developers

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:08.750
to interact with the products.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:15.020
We need to start moving
in that direction,

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:15.020
and that's a goal of ours.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.900
Does that take care of all the hisses?

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.900
. Gosh, these are tough.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.800
Simplify the user experience.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.900
Just as for administrators we'd
want to try to simplify it,

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.540
we also need to simplify it
for the users because when

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.900
we simplify it for the users,
we win all around.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.570
Prepare for Mac OS X.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.760
Key initiative for all of us.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.900
Our server components are Mac OS X.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.730
They work on Mac OS X today.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.900
What we need to do is start moving
our client components to Mac OS X.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.550
So we have some ability
to provide Macintosh

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:48.900
Manager functionality there also.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.900
Compatibility.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.730
Compatibility is also a big issue for us.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.900
We are very large in education.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.890
Education keeps a large
amount of legacy hardware.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:02.800
Therefore, we have to provide support
fairly far back in the client OS.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.700
Greg talked about Directory Services.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.980
Well,
we're going to take advantage of that.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.580
In the past,
we had our own set of users and groups.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.240
We had our own passwords.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.680
All the administrators had to manage.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:22.420
We're now going to take advantage
of Directory Services so

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.020
there's a single user,
user and group setting,

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:24.020
and password administrator
in one central location.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:35.320
The other piece that we've been asked
for consistently is a way to plug into

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.170
our log-in screen and for authentication.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.200
Very popular in that
arena has been Kerberos.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.780
So by taking advantage of the directory,
we're going to be able to take

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.000
advantage of Kerberos plugins
as they're written to provide an

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.190
alternative method of authentication.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.640
I think I've got more
claps than hisses now.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.220
Okay.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:00.110
Well, maybe not.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.610
Mac OS X User Home Directory.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:09.330
As I talked about preparing for Mac OS X,
one of the things that we want to do is

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:14.200
share the same storage space so that when
a user is working on their 8 or 9 machine

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.200
and they move to a Mac OS X machine,
they still have access to their files.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.560
They're stored in the
same home directory,

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.200
which we see as part of moving
our transition to Mac OS X.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.350
In addition,
we're also going to store application

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.200
preferences in that home directory.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.200
So Carbon applications that are still
using the old preference management

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.980
methods of storing preferences in
the preferences folder will get their

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.200
preferences on Mac OS X machines.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.670
So we're starting to move to
that direction in terms of the

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.200
virtual desktop experience.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.200
The resource policy is
not happening right away.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.200
As I mentioned earlier,
our server process is on Mac OS X.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.200
We're now moving our admin
application to Carbon,

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:52.200
which will make it available on Mac OS X.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:59.200
And the support will still continue
to support back to client 761.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.940
Just a quick overview.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.000
Basically,
you see in the center is the server.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.040
The Directory Services are below us.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.290
Mac Manager will still
have a server process,

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.530
as well as we'll work with
the AFP server process.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.420
The Directory Database, Users and Groups,
that'll be stored in

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.540
one central location.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.590
We will still plan on storing
some information in our databases.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.590
We weren't able to do a full
transition over in the near term.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:31.520
We do want to work on that longer term,
so we no longer have this proprietary

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.600
set of information to Mac Manager.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.600
So we'll be moving in that direction.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.820
So let's get off Mac Manager for a while.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.700
Hopefully Network Assistant isn't
as controversial.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.540
Just a few key things
about Network Assistant.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.940
I think it could really
all be summed up as,

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.080
in the first point,
is support for the future,

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:57.950
and that means moving to Mac OS X.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.120
Again, the simplicity,
make it easy to use as it is today,

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.660
and continue to advance on
that to make it easy to use,

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:06.480
and again, support compatibility.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.730
The key detail,
or the key thing that we're

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.180
working on for the next release
is to provide a full featured

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.240
client for our Mac OS X machines.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.780
So that's really the gist of what
we're working on at this point.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.810
We will have a
Mac OS X admin application,

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.320
but we're also gonna,
even as we move to X,

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.920
we understand there's still lots
of 8 and 9 machines out there,

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.220
so we want to provide the administrator
the ability to manage the machines,

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:33.980
no matter whether they're 8, 9,
or 10 machines.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.300
So that's kind of where
we're headed there.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:40.860
We don't support 761 right now.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:44.580
Yeah, it would.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:44.930
It's hard though.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.940
It's really hard for that piece.

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.610
So that kind of covers
those three components,

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.440
or those two components.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.740
Now let's move on to NetBoot.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.060
I think NetBoot is really exciting.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.930
It's a really cool technology.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.530
I'm really excited about what's
going to happen going forward.

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:06.800
But basically what it does,
it kind of ties to that theme

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.240
that I think that Ken mentioned,
and Greg also, is to simplify.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.200
Is to make it easier for
administrators to take care of things,

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.930
because you've got all
these client machines,

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.380
and you're not getting any more
administrators to take care of them.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:23.460
So what we do is we provide a single
location on a server to manage the OS.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.100
This makes it protected
from user modification.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.000
They may be able to modify it during
the course of their operations,

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.030
but with a simple reboot,
they're back to where they started.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.400
So you have a protected OS.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.420
Desktop OS has become trivial.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.360
And actually, in addition to that,
some installation of

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.570
software becomes trivial.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.520
You install it in one place,
you restart your clients,

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.580
you're installed.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.920
So I think this is a real
big win for administrators.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.020
It is our goal to work with standard,
unmodified Mac OSs.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.310
Any Mac OS that is released should
automatically support netbooting and be

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.040
installable and usable in your network.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.920
And we understand that
performance is important also,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.400
that it must be comparable to local disk.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.530
So the users don't know that
they're working on a netboot

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:10.620
machine versus a local boot machine.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.230
Some of the details,
some of the details that the

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.330
NetBoot team is working on,
they want to make it work

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:20.900
in more robust networks.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:25.820
It's going to interact
with standard DHCP servers.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:36.900
[Transcript missing]

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.050
This is exciting,
especially in the situations where

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:45.480
you have different languages.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.800
A machine may be used in
a multilingual setting.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:51.050
You want to provide the ability
to boot in French or German or

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.330
Spanish or Japanese or any
language that you would like.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.130
In addition,
you could provide a modified OS.

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.760
It doesn't need to be
language difference.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.760
It could be other things installed that
you want to make available to the user.

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.560
Okay,
and it's going to be highly scalable.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.940
We're moving to make it more scalable.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.340
The clients will auto sense which
server has the least activity and then

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.770
it will go NetBoot from that machine.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.940
I guess the key implication we can
think of for developers around Netboot

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.990
is you don't have a persistent OS.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.900
As soon as it's rebooted, it's gone.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.630
If Mac Manager is involved,
you can still manage preferences

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.450
and some of the system settings,
but you have to assume that

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.290
there is a non-persistent Mac OS.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.140
Simple diagram.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.410
Again, you see now with the
addition of multiple servers,

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:41.150
multiple Netboot servers,
you can see in the bottom

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:43.150
you have different subnets,
Net1, Net2.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:47.060
The clients will interact and go
ahead and just boot right off whatever

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.180
server has the most availability.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:51.400
So we think that that's a real win.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.800
We think that's a real opportunity.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.740
So I just wanna touch
briefly on administration,

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.940
the final block in our diagram
before I turn it over to Ken.

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:06.810
From an administration perspective, oops.

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:12.190
The goals,
I think the goals here again are similar.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:16.100
It's simplicity, to make it easy to use,
to make it easy for the administrator

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.200
to get in and do the work that
they need to do and get out.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.200
So simplicity.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.920
One of the goals for that is
to move to one application,

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.190
to not have to go look around for
a whole bunch of applications.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.200
We want to try to move
that to one central place.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:28.100
Remote or local.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.520
We understand that everybody's mobile,
right?

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.200
So we need to be able to provide
administration anywhere on the internet.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.110
That's critical also.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.200
And then the final point,
very easy to use,

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.920
just echoes that theme once again.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:43.990
Some of the details:
it will be a client server architecture,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.370
the administrative application,
and what this provides is

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.300
the second bullet there,
the admin server will update

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.190
the clients as needed.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.490
For example,
if the server that you're trying to

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:57.100
maintain has a component that you don't
have the administrative piece for,

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.170
it'll automatically provide that for
you so you can go maintain that feature.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:05.200
First bullet: it'll be Carbon also,
so Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X as well as Aqua.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.200
It'll be Aqua interfaced.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:11.490
We'll support SL and SLP for
locating servers as well as being

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:14.200
able to administer multiple servers.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.360
And then the final piece,
what we're trying to focus on

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.000
is being able to do some limited
set of web administration.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.370
So with that,
I think I've completed the section,

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:28.500
and I'd like to turn it
back over to Ken to close.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:30.170
Thank you.

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:35.500
So to amplify a couple of points
that Bob made in particular,

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.520
how many people in the audience
produce client-side applications

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.190
that fit into the server environment?

00:49:42.800 --> 00:51:38.200
[Transcript missing]

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.860
You've heard that there's a variety
of opportunities for developers

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:48.500
in this server environment with
the Mac OS X Server product.

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.780
Certainly there's a wealth of plug-ins.

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.240
Directory Service is central.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:58.000
It's essential to the integration,
the interoperability of this technology.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.730
And we're going to focus on a small set.

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.500
There's ample opportunity for a variety.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.980
A couple are mentioned here.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.790
The whole notion of management and
control of the server environment.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:17.000
People need to be able to understand
how the technology is being used.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.610
From a scalability perspective,
maybe you start with a

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.000
small number of servers.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Are you able to actually analyze
how the technology is being used

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.420
so you can most efficiently plan
your next year investments in,

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:33.000
do you focus on more bandwidth?

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Or do you need more scalability?

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
There's a lot of scalability
for the file server.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.990
So there's huge opportunities
for producing administration,

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.590
console utilities, log analysis,
how the server has been used

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.000
from a historical perspective.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.910
A variety of services for guaranteeing
always-on availability of the

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
server from an auto-restart and
remote management perspective.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:01.700
Backup and restore is always an
interesting and important opportunity.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.000
The needs of backup scale from very,
very large to very small.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
So there's a lot of scalability
for the file server.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
So there's huge opportunities
for producing administration,

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
console utilities, log analysis,
how the server has been used

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
from a historical perspective.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
A variety of services for guaranteeing
always-on availability of the

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
server from an auto-restart and
remote management perspective.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Backup and restore is always an
interesting and important opportunity.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
The needs of backup scale from very,
very large to very small.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.000
There's a lot of scalability
for the file server.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.760
you know, very,
very large enterprise grade

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:11.010
environments where large customers have
investments in a backup technology,

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:15.150
all the way down to a much smaller,
you know, single user,

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:20.180
single administrator, you know,
tape driver, peripheral model.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.940
So there's a wealth of
opportunities in there as well.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:27.640
On the web and application space,
certainly Apache is just an

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.260
incredible web server technology.

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:35.150
The number of plug-ins that
turn Apache into an unbelievably

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:40.530
powerful platform is open for
anybody to entertain and exercise

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.350
with the Mac OS X server product.

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:47.340
And we can't say WebObjects
loudly enough more often.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.700
This is some of the greatest
application server technology

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.760
that the world has ever seen,
and it creates some incredible

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.690
opportunities for adding value-add
application services on top of

00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.660
this very powerful platform.

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:03.720
In terms of additions and
add-ons to the server,

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:07.130
from a hardware perspective,
obviously RAID solutions enables a

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:11.800
greater degree of scalability and
performance for the disk subsystem.

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:16.270
Large storage arrays, et cetera,
power management are all examples

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:20.210
of how the server product can
be enhanced beyond the confines

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.970
of our desktop hardware design.

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:28.300
And in the creative professional markets,
certainly there's incredible

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.560
opportunities for very sophisticated,
higher-end print management

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.580
and workflow solutions.

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:39.010
The print industry is obviously
being transformed by the greater

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:42.500
flexibilities and efficiencies
that the Internet has enabled,

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:47.930
and the publishing workflow is one that
is ripe for incredible opportunities

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:49.840
for adding value to the server product.
