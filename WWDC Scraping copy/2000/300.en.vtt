WEBVTT

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.480
So I'd like to bring up a good friend,
long-time associate, Jim Batson,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.600
QuickTime team, one of the founding
members of QuickTime team.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.300
He's going to help me
with some of the demos.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.210
You know him well.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:34.920
So, QuickTime has had one of the
best reputations in the industry

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.400
when it comes to the quality
of the software we produce.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.360
And I am really proud of this.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.400
This is something we've worked really,
really hard on over the years.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.690
And a big part of the way that
we accomplished that is through a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.310
very aggressive seeding program.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.370
Now, somewhere along the way
in the last few months,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.560
in the frenzy of all this
stuff we've been doing,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.300
we seem to drop the ball.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.510
And a couple of releases,
a QuickTime got out the

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.230
door without any seeding.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
And you guys, you're very passionate.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
You let us know really clearly and
frankly how you feel about that.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.400
So we decided to make a
movie to commemorate this,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.750
learning these old hard
lessons all over again,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.010
and we'd like to show that to you now.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.440
I'm done programming for today.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.000
I think I'll relax
with some QuickTime TV.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I've got kickboxing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.280
I've got some...ah!

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.000
Let's do it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.620
QuickTime!

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.620
Green is hip!

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.620
Kick!

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.080
Hey Jim!

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.390
What is it this time?

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.600
I just updated a QuickTime 4.1.1
and it broke my website!

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.880
Yeah, right.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.880
Yeah,
well what are you going to do about it?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.400
Whatever.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.770
This one has a little star.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.100
This one has a little car.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.860
Say, what a lot of seeds there are.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.540
Yes, some are red and some are blue.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.060
Some are old and some are new.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.670
One of the great things about being
on the QuickTime team is there

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.600
are some really creative people.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.480
We've got some good editors.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.270
It's a lot of fun.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.310
It's really a ride.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:05.300
So, may we not forget this hard
lesson for another nine years.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.150
Can we go back to slides, please?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.000
So, you're probably interested in how
you can get involved in seeding.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.260
We have decided to make some
changes in the way we're doing our

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.440
seeding to make it easier to reach
more of you more efficiently,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.000
more effectively.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.990
And effective immediately,
we're moving the whole seeding program

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.460
for QuickTime over to be in line with
the regular Apple seeding that is done

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.790
elsewhere in the company these days.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.150
The easiest thing for you to do is
to go up to the developer website,

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.000
and you can get the details,
you can sign up,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
it's not going to cost you anything.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.600
And we've also got these mailing lists,
you can find them at list.apple.com,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.000
there's about a half a dozen of them.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.560
And you can find out what's going on,
how your other peer developers

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.970
are doing with the various seeds.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.790
And it should be a good forum to
make a great product going forward.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.490
The guy who's going to keep us honest
in all this is a guy named Jeff Lowe.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.560
He's the QuickTime technology
manager here at Apple.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.700
And so if you have any
questions or issues or concerns,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.750
feel free to send him an email,
and he'll get right back to you.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.150
So, this show seems to be about Mac OS X.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.740
You've seen a lot of QuickTime in
the keynote session this morning.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.840
Unfortunately, you're probably not going
to see a lot of QuickTime,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.100
a lot of Mac OS X in this session.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.480
The basic message I want to bring to you
today is that QuickTime and Mac OS X is

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.580
really like QuickTime everywhere else.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.760
We've got the same APIs,
the same features, the same bugs,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.240
it's all the same stuff.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.600
It's all there in DP4.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.710
You've got the disks.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.640
You know,
I encourage you to go and play with

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.640
it and let us know what you think.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.130
We're going to be working on
it throughout the rest of the

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.820
summer as we wrap this up,
and hopefully come fall we'll

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.740
have a great piece of software
there that you can base your

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.220
applications on Mac OS X on.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.100
So we've got only one
session focused on Mac OS X,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.460
and I will confess that that session
isn't entirely about Mac OS X.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.590
But the reality is there's just
not that much that you need to know

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.500
about Mac OS X for QuickTime on X.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.290
So, okay,
let's talk about some of the details

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.140
in the QuickTime technology area,
a little bit about what we've been

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.200
doing over the last year since
we got a chance to get together.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.080
One of the key areas that we
are focused on with QuickTime is

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.160
an area of content creation.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.200
Of course, Apple Computer is completely
focused on content creation.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.510
These are our customers.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.420
These are our core customers,
creative people working in education,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.730
consumers,
design and publishing professionals

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.100
who create content for a living.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.510
We are doing innovative
work in a number of areas,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.270
and the first one I want to
talk about is Sound Manager.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.200
Ah, see, I lied.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.130
I'm going to talk a little
bit more about Mac OS X.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.300
The sound manager on Mac OS X is
getting a major facelift,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.980
and we're adding some key
capabilities that developers in

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.430
the professional audio tool space
have been asking for for years,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.880
and I'm really pleased to see
that we're moving ahead with this.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.180
The goal here was to provide some
industrial strength foundation for

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.800
your professional audio applications.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.000
And that starts at the hardware level.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.100
We are going to build,
provide a whole new hardware

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.460
abstraction layer that's going to
provide low latency I/O for your cards.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.520
Hardware-based synchronization
for much better timing.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.100
True multi-channel in and outs,
so you can have, you know,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.830
eight parallel channels running
without having to bypass all the

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.240
operating system to be able to do that.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.900
And we're going to also increase
the resolution of all the pipes.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.460
We'll be talking about
higher sampling rates,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.000
deeper bit resolutions,
as well as floating

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.330
point processing pipes.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.080
And we'll also be adding a
plug-in architecture for effects.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.130
This is pretty good stuff.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.670
In the MIDI area,
we'll also be providing for the

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:18.300
first time some standardized
low-level I/O managers for MIDI.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.300
We've never had this
standard on Mac OS 9.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.440
As you know,
most people end up relying on

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.300
things like OMS or free MIDI.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.300
And on Mac OS X, we're going to provide
this basic infrastructure,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.070
and it'll provide the
I/O and the timing services.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.660
We're also making a significant
upgrade to the QuickTime music

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.300
synthesizer to go along with these
new MIDI and sound capabilities.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.630
We're going to introduce a whole
new music synthesizer that plays

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.240
MIDI files that's compatible with
the latest in MIDI standards,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.300
DLS2.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.090
And we'll have some new sequencing
APIs to make it easier and more

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.300
powerful than ever to add sequence
music to your applications.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.260
And I hope you'll be happy.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.300
I think this stuff is in DP4.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.300
Some of this stuff is in DP4 now,
and we'll be seeding the remainder

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.300
of it as the summer plays along.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.300
So, I hope this stuff plays out,
and I invite you to get involved.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.300
We've got three sessions at the show that
you should come and take a look at if

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.300
you're interested in these technologies.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.290
And check it out.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.040
So, ProVideo.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.700
These days ProVideo is basically
about these three things.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.700
We're talking about
really high data rates,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.460
we're talking about being able to
handle multiple streams at once so

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.140
you can create complex compositions,
and because these people,

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.700
professionals are
concerned about their time,

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.700
we're concerned about being able
to provide real-time capabilities.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.500
Apple has been working in partnership
with Matrox and Pinnacle to introduce two

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.650
new very interesting hardware/software
combinations that you might have

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.700
seen if you went to the NAB show.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.980
Since many of you probably weren't there,
I want to tell you a little

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.590
bit about what we're doing.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.800
The first company that I want
to talk about is Pinnacle.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.190
They're introducing some
new hardware that's going to

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.700
provide unbelievable prices.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.700
The capability to be able
to do HD format video.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.610
That's uncompressed,
high definition format video.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:21.670
This is data rates about 120,
130 megabytes per second on a Macintosh

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.450
running with QuickTime and Final Cut.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.370
This is an amazing development.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.700
The monitor costs more than the
total cost of the rest of the system.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.290
It's a really wonderful development.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.440
We're also working with
Matrox on a very low cost,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.240
very powerful system to enable
you to do real-time effects,

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.790
dual-stream processing of DV streams,
and standard definition

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.320
uncompressed video.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.580
And I'd like to have Jim help
me show you a demonstration

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.400
of what we're doing there.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.690
All this stuff is built on top of
the QuickTime effects architecture

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.400
that's been in the system
for the last couple of years.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.470
And so if you want to take
advantage of these capabilities

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.110
when the hardware starts shipping,
all you've got to do is support

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.400
QuickTime and you'll be able to do this.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.340
Final Cut's calling the standard APIs,
and that's all it takes.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.400
Can we have a demo for it, please?

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.000
Okay, so we're just running
a copy of Final Cut.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.700
We've got this Matrox card in the system.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:30.790
We've got a series of cut,
edit video clips.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.540
Now as you know,
Final Cut's got a very powerful

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.260
capability for adding effects
and controlling effects

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.100
rendering inside of the clips.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.100
I'm going to ask Jim to
add some dissolves.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.420
Normally when you do this,
you've got to now wait for a while

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.100
while Final Cut renders this.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.320
But with the new hardware and
QuickTime's effects architecture,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:01.970
you just roll back to the top and play.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.220
So that's a pretty good effect.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.410
It's kind of the bread and
butter effect for editors.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.880
Do you have anything a little wackier?

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.090
Two video tracks,
one called Lake Scene and the

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.700
other one just Water Ripple.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.780
Water Ripple is just straight
on top of the Lake Scene,

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.200
so you can't see the lake.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.040
But when we put this effect
on top of the Water Ripple,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.000
what's going to happen is the
Water Ripple frame is going to zoom in,

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.530
spin around, and fly around a bit.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.660
And once again,
it's all green at the top,

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.740
and this is all real time.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.650
So there's two DV streams in and one out.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.280
and of course,
just scrubbing right through.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.900
And you can even see the
transparency through that.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.900
Pretty cool.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.760
Pretty cool.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.900
Thank you.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:07.410
Now, can we go back to the slides,
please?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.850
So that was an example of using
QuickTime's creation environment,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.700
effects architecture, to do professional
quality video creation.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.640
Now, as you know,
Apple's been working real hard

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.700
over the last year to make
consumer video creation a reality,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.170
and we've been working with a
lot of developers in other areas

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.400
to drive that forward as well.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.670
QuickTime authoring being just
another part of QuickTime,

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.630
it's not just a Macintosh feature,
it's something that we support on all

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.700
the platforms where we take QuickTime.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.780
And this architecture was
designed in a scalable way,

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.700
so it's not just something
that's going to be required

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.590
or just used by professionals.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.140
Sony's created a very innovative product
that's based on QuickTime that they

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.670
ship on all their VIO products now,
and we'd like to show you that.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.170
Leveraging many of the same
features that were used in the

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.970
Matrox demo just a minute ago.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.700
Can we go back to the demo machine?

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.950
Go to the laptop?

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.840
This is an application
called Movie Shaker.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.960
So the first thing we need
to do is drop some media in,

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.840
so we just reduce the screen size.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.090
Okay, here's a folder with just
some QuickTime movies.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:29.980
and it just drops right in and this
becomes content that we can use.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.390
And so we'll just pick one of these guys.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.460
Let's pick the road one because
he's pretty easy to see pretty well.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.580
And you have the play button.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.380
See, playing wrong.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.350
Scrub around.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.980
Normal QuickTime controller stuff,
movies.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.370
And take a look at some effects.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.400
And you have a preview mode
here that you can look at.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.760
Bubbles.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.700
It's all pretty cool,
because it's all Swift files.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.200
These are all flash animations.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.200
And then-- Obviously, in this context,
in the consumer context,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.120
the goal is not so much workflow and
process and speed and stuff like that.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.700
It's more about fun and creativity.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.700
And we just play through,
and there's the result.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.200
Just right away.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.820
And we can also do some text.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.170
The canonical text that you always had.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.800
And you can get a couple previews.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:31.490
There's Fade Right,
you can just fade it all up, Shrinking,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.490
Random Spin.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.490
So, just drop the fade right into
one of these effect bins here,

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.640
and they all get applied
at the same time.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.850
So now we've got the
bubbles and the text,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.960
and it's pretty straightforward.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:56.210
Then we move on to the shaker,
which is a lot of people, you know,

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.450
they just want to use their content.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.170
They don't want to spend
a lot of time editing,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.240
so it's really nice to just have
an automatic way of creating

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.400
some interesting edits and sound
effects and stuff like that.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.100
So we've got a lot of
different modes here.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.420
We can kind of go to romantic
mode all the way up to,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.860
I think they call this tarot mode,
so let's try that one out.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.420
And so we'll just shake it,
and of course it takes a little time,

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.850
but not too long.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.020
So right now what's going on is the
application is basically creating a wacky

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:31.960
edit of all the clips in your import bin.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:38.070
So now we can just click down
here so we can look at the result.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:59.500
[Transcript missing]

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:21.900
[Transcript missing]

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:31.000
So let's go back to slides, please.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.140
So now I'd like to spend a little
bit of time talking about some of the

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.500
interactive features in QuickTime.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.500
The first thing we need to do is talk a
little bit about what is interactivity.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:44.020
The basic concept here is we've
got a really powerful engine for

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.500
creating kind of linear media assets,
video, audio, whatever.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.880
We've also built into QuickTime some very
powerful features to be able to allow

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:58.940
you to customize both the appearance
and the behavior of your media.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.640
Other people are doing things with skins,
which is really not the same thing.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.370
That's about taking an application and
changing the way the application looks,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.630
but it really isn't
responsive to the media,

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.500
and it's not able to modify the
overall behavior of the application.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.410
We think this is really important.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.340
We think that the thing ought
to be to skin the media,

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.490
not the players.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.500
So we've built some pretty cool
technologies to allow you to do that,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.500
and there are a number of
ways you can access this.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.500
The first one is through
the movie controller.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.580
If you're programming
with QuickTime today,

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.620
you know that the movie controller is
responsible for all the interaction

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.290
that takes place in the movie.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.040
And there's a lot of interesting
things you can do with that,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.490
although most of that stuff's probably
not obvious if you're not a programmer.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.510
We've also built this very
powerful infrastructure inside of

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.470
QuickTime that we call Wired Movies.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.870
It's basically the capability
to execute code inside the

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.280
context of the movie playback.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.500
And this is code which
is sort of like Java.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500
It's portable.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.420
It's not tied to a specific
machine architecture.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.590
And it has the capability to communicate
with other parts of QuickTime,

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.940
to be able to send events,
and be able to modify behavior based

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.500
upon user input and other events or
conditions that arise in the movie.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.700
We've also built an incredibly
comprehensive set of interfaces

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.500
to QuickTime from Java.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.500
So if you're a Java programmer and
you like to work in that environment,

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.460
you can do pretty much everything
you can do with QuickTime,

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.500
the C APIs, plus some other things.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.500
And then, of course,
QuickTime is a very powerful software.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.500
It's a very powerful software.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.500
It's got a very strong
layered architecture.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.340
And you can always extend QuickTime via
new kinds of media handlers,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.060
new kinds of components,
or you can override and extend

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.400
those yourself on the existing ones.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:44.490
The first kind of interactive media that
Apple ever shipped was QuickTime VR.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.500
And you saw some interesting
demos of that this morning.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.490
We're doing a lot of
work in this area now.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.500
And I think it's pretty amazing.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.920
One of the things that didn't come out
this morning that I found to be a very

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.660
interesting story about QuickTime VR is
that in the auto industry,

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.590
it turns out that most of the car
manufacturers have standardized

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.490
on QuickTime VR as the format for
displaying their new car models.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.480
And what we've heard from the
photographers who go to these companies

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.490
and who are doing this work for them
is that the quality of the stitching,

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.500
the quality of the rendering,
the ability to provide clips

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.320
at very high quality sizes,
as well as smaller and

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.500
easier to download sizes,
makes it very attractive.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.750
And it turns out the dynamic there
is very similar to the dynamic that

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.500
we see with the movie trailers.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.500
They really care a lot about the quality.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.740
And QuickTime VR seems to
be the one technology that's

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.500
providing that for them.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:46.210
We've got Audi, Acura, BMW, Dodge, Ford,
Mercury.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.500
and it goes on and on.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.870
There are several others and
a whole bunch more to come.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.350
It's quite interesting and I think
what we're going to see is we're

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.370
going to see this direction moving
over to other related industries.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:03.190
Airplanes, boats, that kind of stuff.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.190
It should be interesting
to watch it evolve.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.800
So now what we're going to do is
we're just going to go through

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.800
some demos of various ways that
you can work with interactivity,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.040
ways that you can wrap your media with
interactivity and custom appearance

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.440
in order that the experience is sort
of what the content producer wants,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.950
what the director wants,
not what the application

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.300
provider is trying to deliver.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.210
Go ahead, let's switch to demo two,
please.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.300
What are we starting with here?

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.100
Okay, so the first thing that we're
going to start with is the

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:38.980
Lord of the Rings trilogy
trailer that you may have seen.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.680
Now what you can see here is we've
got the movie playing in the middle,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.590
we've got some interactive
buttons around the outside,

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.630
and this has basically taken the
media and provided kind of a whole

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:56.600
application environment around it
that was designed by the movie makers.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:02.330
And you get the same high-quality
QuickTime video playback,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.270
but you've also got this
great environment based...

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.400
It's a great environment
that provides interactivity

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.030
and a customized appearance.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.900
This particular clip was created
with Live Stage Pro from Totally Hip,

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.760
probably one of the more popular
tools out there for creating

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.760
this kind of interactive media.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.290
Why don't we move on to the next one.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:28.210
So that's an approach that requires
a little bit of programming,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.460
sort of this drag and drop of media
elements and a little bit of programming.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.480
Here's an approach which takes
kind of a lot of programming,

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:37.430
but gives a very,
very interesting customized

00:23:38.600 --> 00:24:03.600
[Transcript missing]

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.100
Just the basic stuff.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.040
It's a QuickTime movie.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.700
It's completely a QuickTime movie.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.700
Authored with Java.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.700
That's a big interface.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.900
The interface is totally nice.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.410
Okay, so let's move on to the next one.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.490
Okay, this last one comes from a
company called TribeWorks.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.380
Their product is called iShell.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.390
This is a customized

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.860
iShell's taken QuickTime and they've
extended the interactive capabilities by

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.080
adding a little bit of their own runtime.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.320
And what you can do with that
is you can pretty much create

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.600
any kind of interface you want.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.400
You're not restricted
to rectangular windows.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.560
You can adjust all the elements,
and there's no programming

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.500
required for this.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.880
So you can go out and create whatever
kind of media presentation you want,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.200
and you can access all the
interactivity functions,

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.900
and you can make it
look any way you want.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.880
This particular one, I guess,
has got several channels

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.000
of movie trailers.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:09.750
You can access by turning the knobs,
control the transport controls,

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.800
of course.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.590
Very powerful stuff.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.300
If you're interested in this,
you can actually go up to their

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.500
website and download their tools.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.900
They're basically free for download.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.890
You can evaluate them.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.500
They have a very novel
kind of business model.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.660
TribeWorks.com.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.400
So that's all we're going to talk
about in the interactivity area.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.310
We've got a whole bunch more information
for you at the show this week.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.030
Can we go back to the slides, please?

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.390
We've got a session covering
QuickTime for Java that

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.100
follows this session today.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.160
And then on Wednesday,
we've got a whole session

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.500
devoted to interactivity.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:49.940
What you'll see there are some of these
examples decomposed in a lot more detail,

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.840
and we'll talk about some of
the other things we're doing to

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.490
increase the quality and the degree
of interactivity in QuickTime.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.190
So now I want to talk about
QuickTime and servers.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.680
This is an area that's been
relatively new to the QuickTime team.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.000
We've been working with server-based
technologies basically since we

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.090
started doing the live streaming stuff.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.100
Now the first question is,
why do we care?

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.050
What are servers good for?

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.480
When we thought about this,
we came up with, say,

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.810
a half a dozen basic things that servers
do really well that are very hard

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.100
to do from the client all by itself.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.110
Access control.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.370
If you've got valuable assets
sitting on a server somewhere,

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.730
you don't want to just hand them
over to the client and let them

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.040
be distributed anywhere without
any control around the internet.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.000
Servers are great at
providing access control.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.100
They're also great for copy protection.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.260
That means you can take your clips
and potentially encrypt them,

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.070
encode them.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.140
You have a tight coupling between the
server and the client so that only this

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.100
customized client can access the media.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.990
Servers, of course,
are great at counting.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.770
If you've got a lot of
people hitting the server,

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.210
accessing various kinds of media,
the servers tend to do a much

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.740
better job than a client of finding
out what's going on with all the

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.090
various clients in the world.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.410
Servers also have some powerful
capabilities for looking

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:17.020
at the environment around
them and producing dynamic,

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.930
just-in-time media compositions.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.910
And then, of course,
servers have always been kind of a

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.100
hub for community kinds of activities.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:30.100
Whether that's, you know,
email servers or things like that.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.030
And then, servers are big databases.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.060
These are really important concepts
when you start to think about what

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.940
do servers mean for QuickTime.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.340
Now,
the way the servers end up interacting

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.880
with QuickTime is really simple.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:51.670
The whole mechanism ends up basically
being embedded in the communication that

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.100
goes between the client and the server.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.070
In simple transactions relating to URLs.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.740
The client requests the URL,
the server interprets the

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.100
URL and responds accordingly.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.100
So depending on what you
decide to put in the URL,

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.030
you can drive all kinds of
different sorts of behavior.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.090
This is old hat for the server guys.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.320
But it's an incredibly simple
concept that has incredibly

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.010
powerful ramifications.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:22.090
So with QuickTime today,
there's basically two

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.890
ways you can approach...

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.690
Customizing the behavior of
QuickTime through the server.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.830
One of them is one we've
recently introduced.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.060
That's QuickTime streaming
server plug-ins.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:37.800
There's a very rich set of
plug-in capabilities for servers,

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.740
for the QuickTime streaming server that
will allow you to access accounting

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.560
and logging kinds of functionalities,
being able to pre-process streams,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.570
being able to control access
to the back-end data access

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.960
portion of the server.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.940
It's incredibly powerful.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.380
There's a whole session about
this that you should go to and

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.690
check out if you're interested.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.000
And then of course
there's CGI programming,

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:02.110
which is sort of the die-hard
of server-side programming,

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.680
client-server interactions.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.640
And this is basically custom applications
that masquerade as web servers.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.780
And WebObjects is a
great example of that.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:15.770
And I guess now that Apple's
handing that out for dirt cheap,

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.780
you should get a copy and
see what you can do with it.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.230
It's really, really powerful.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:25.410
The servers basically interact with
the client by passing back media.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.180
We process movies, of course.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.420
We can also receive any media
that QuickTime knows how to open,

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.690
so it doesn't have to be a .mov file.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.700
It doesn't have to be a
QuickTime movie per se.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.190
It can be anything that we can open.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.950
And we also support SMILE,
which is this text-based dynamic language

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.260
for describing media compositions.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.840
Let's show you a real simple demo here.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.140
Let's go to demo two.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.950
This is a stock plot demo.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.060
So this is a movie.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.580
This is just a movie.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:02.660
This was created with Live Stage Pro,
and it's got a text field

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.420
that you can type into.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.100
Yeah, this is the bad news.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:13.060
They never like it when we
don't introduce hardware.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:36.000

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:51.400
[Transcript missing]

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.300
So let's talk about things that
get more powerful than that.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.490
Can we go back to the slides, please?

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.390
So, we need to talk a little
bit more about Smile.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:06.380
Smile is one of the fundamental
technologies that you can use to control

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:12.870
the media composition to be able to
generate just-in-time kinds of content.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.970
Smile is an HTML format,
HTML-like text format for

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.890
describing media compositions.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.050
It covers spatial relationships,
temporal relationships,

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.900
and it has the ability
to refer to other URLs.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.900
And it provides capabilities to
be able to link to those URLs.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.840
It's really, really very simple.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.820
Do we have an example of that?

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.900
Yeah.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.340
Yeah, okay, why don't we switch back
to the demo machine,

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:37.890
demo two?

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:37.900
Demo two.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.900
So, I'll show you a real simple one.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.900
Right.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.710
So, here's a Smile file,
and we're going to drop it

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.900
onto Code Warrior first.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.770
So, we're going to look at
what the text looks like.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:46.890
Okay.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.900
So, you know HTML,
this stuff looks pretty familiar.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.900
It's XML-based.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.270
So, you kind of have,
here's the tag to define the whole thing,

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:54.900
right?

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.670
You've got a head area and a body.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:03.900
The head area,
the head tag defines layout,

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.880
contains layout, which then defines the
areas of the presentation.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.180
So, right now we've got the root layout,
which is the whole presentation,

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.780
554 by 420.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.310
And inside that we've got a slide area,
which is kind of offset into the

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:22.830
middle and takes up the same size
of these source images down here.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.900
And the body,
we just have a sequence of images.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.760
One after the other,
each lasting one and a half seconds

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.900
that play in the slide area.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.700
Okay.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:31.900
So,
just going to go out to the finder here,

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:36.170
and then we're going to just drop,
just double click that file.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:42.770
And now we have a movie,
and we can just step through the images.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:47.300
Okay, so you just have a
sequential set of images.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:54.300
The red is the color of the
layout of the root over here.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.930
We'll change that to something else,
to silver.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.780
and there it's changed.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.320
And then this is just a
sequential set of images.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:14.800
[Transcript missing]

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.090
So we can do this quickly.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:21.240
So now the sequential section is
now becomes its own kind of unit.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.510
And now the parallel.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:38.500
[Transcript missing]

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:50.900
and so as you can see,
it's a lot like the early HTML days

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:52.490
in terms of playing around.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.340
All you have to do is
go to the text editor.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.730
It's really easy.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.740
Just type some stuff in.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.360
You can use QuickTime to open it up,
check it out.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.500
We're going to go into more in depth
on this tomorrow at the server-side

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.560
scripting session over across the street.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.310
So to help you out, find your way there,
we've put together the smile document.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.440
Just take a quick peek at this.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.890
You can look.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.850
The header is very small,
just a very simple layout,

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:24.540
and then we just sequence a bunch of
media to create our new presentation.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.000
So just go ahead and open
that and play that for you.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.500
And it also includes embedded text.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:32.500
Audio, please.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.500
So, you've got to find your way to the
stairs and get out the front door.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.480
Okay.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.470
Remember, Steve said to go and try it,
okay?

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.470
He said, "Great.

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:44.990
Go see the QuickTime show."

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:54.380
Well, it was a nice day the other day,
okay, so... The battery was sunny.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.140
But you gotta be careful
about crossing the street.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.660
You don't want to get run over.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.540
So hit the button.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.260
-Aboard!

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:11.340
Not much further to go, so hang in there.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.900
and don't forget to leave plenty early
so you don't get too tired for the show.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:29.430
So, okay,
so the smile stuff is really important

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.000
when you want to talk about servers
because it's a text-based format,

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.070
and as you all know,
servers deal with text a lot better

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:36.870
than they deal with graphics.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:41.770
This is a very powerful way to describe
the media in a dynamic fashion.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.830
This is the kind of
mechanism that you get,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.900
that you're using when you
talk about inserting ads.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.320
You basically have a smile
document which references the

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:56.500
content that is not the ad,
and then on the fly they can send

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:01.080
a CGI script to the ad server,
and the ad server uses cookies and

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.550
whatever other kind of information
it has its access to to be able

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.900
to provide back a media reference,
which might be a movie,

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.030
it might be an animated GIF,
it might be something else

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.770
that QuickTime can then render
in line with the other media.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.900
Pretty neat.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.900
So let's talk a little
bit about the content.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.900
Let's show the demo of the
QuickTime streaming server plugin.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:27.300
So this is a version,
this is a server-side interaction that's,

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.190
So we've got a list,
scrolling list here of, um,

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.190
scrolling list of songs.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.190
You can click on it, it'll play the song.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.480
So what you see here
is just a text track.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.510
It has a bunch of K-tracks in there,
which will then reference the...

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:31.440
The Movies.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:31.900
And so what's happening on the
QTSS is that every time you get

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:31.900
a hit on one of these movies,
it bumps a hit count.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:31.900
Okay?

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:31.900
And then there's a special URL, popular,
you just have to click that,

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:31.900
and that will let you just play
the top three hits that everyone

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:31.900
happens to be listening to.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:37.590
So the idea here is that on the server,
you can just save information,

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.720
but even from the streaming server where
the data really is just lying there.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.890
So that's cool.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.840
So, and you'll learn a lot more about
that if you go to the streaming

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:48.890
server session later in the week.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.140
So the last demo we want to show
you is one that's called QT Chat.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.340
Some of you may be familiar with
a guy named Matthew Peterson.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:01.060
He's a researcher up at Berkeley,
and he has created some

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:07.100
outrageous applications using
Live Stage Pro and CGI scripts.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.360
This is a complete chat program
built in a QuickTime movie.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.490
This whole thing is a QuickTime movie.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.620
In theory, it's online.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:29.890
So what's happening here is that he's
using wired movie actions to be able to

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.310
send messages to control the interface,
and then

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:41.520
Some of the interactions end up
involving constructing these URLs which

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.600
encode all the information that's
relevant to the chat back to the server.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:52.400
And then he's built a little server
program that manages the membership

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.100
and manages distributing of the
media back out to the clients.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:04.870
So the client refreshes itself every
so often and picks up the text.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.750
Pretty wild.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.420
When you start to see stuff
like this happening in the

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.320
context of a QuickTime movie,
you start to realize how powerful

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.200
these simple concepts become
when you pull them all together.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.600
Yeah, okay.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:26.520
So let's go back to the slides.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.750
So we've got three sessions that will
cover the technologies we reviewed today.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.130
We've got the server technologies,
one-- He's back.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.850
He just came back.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:47.890
Web Streaming Session and a Streaming
Server Session all on Tuesday,

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.960
all in the Civic Center.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:54.630
So, before I wrap up,
I forgot to mention one other thing.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.640
The folks at Apple in the technical
publications group have been

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.600
working really hard to support
QuickTime over the last couple of years.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.600
And they've just finished up a new
book that you might be interested in.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.600
It's called QuickTime for the Web.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.600
I think it's probably available
over at the Developer Depot.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.360
And I suggest you go check it out.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.610
They've been working real hard
and they've got a lot of new stuff

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.260
coming out to support QuickTime.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.600
So, to wrap up,
the ecosystem is really vibrant.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.600
There's a lot going on here.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.910
We went from nothing in this
space to an incredible amount

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.600
of activity in just one year.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.530
I can't wait to see where we're
going to be in another year.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.600
QuickTime remains the premier platform
for content creation and delivery.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.510
And we've got a new
release coming this summer.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.600
You saw some of the cool
features in the keynote.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.590
And when we start the seating program,
you'll see a whole bunch more.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.570
Thank you very much for coming.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.860
Thank you.
