00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.760
Just carbonizing your app,
although that will get you on 10,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.330
isn't really going to necessarily
deliver the full user experience that

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.750
users are going to come to expect when
they start using the OS in general.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.850
They're going to be looking for
things like sheets and different

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.830
behaviors that Aqua presents.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.460
So this session helps you understand
what that design philosophy

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.900
was behind Aqua so that as you
start to bring your app to 10,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.420
you can start to design your interface
and your user experience around that.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.690
So to talk about the design of Aqua,
I'd like to introduce It's Don Lindsey,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.400
the head of the human
interface team here at Apple.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.910
Thanks John.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.160
Okay, Aqua Overview.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.390
I'm going to talk about Aqua today.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.630
I'm not going to talk about architecture,
I'm not going to talk

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.110
about frameworks or APIs.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.200
In fact, I promise I won't show any
more slides like this at all.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.070
This is the only one.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.660
What I do want to talk
about is what is Aqua?

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.800
Steve, when he introduced it,
said it is the user

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.210
interface of Mac OS X.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.700
and I want to expand on that
a little bit because I think

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.740
there are some misconceptions.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.640
I also want to talk about
what is new in Aqua.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.100
What have we introduced?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.860
Many of you today probably already
have applications shipping on Mac OS 9.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.920
I want to point out those things
which are a little bit new in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.410
Aqua that you should be aware of.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.000
I also want to talk about what
we've changed since Macworld.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.100
We introduced this thing
almost six months ago now,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.830
and we haven't just been sitting back.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.250
We've been pretty busy.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.570
Steve mentioned we've been listening
to the feedback we got from you having

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.040
played with Developer Preview 3,
and we're making some changes.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.820
We're making improvements.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.530
And finally, at the very end,
I'm going to bring John back on stage,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.350
who's going to list for you
all of the sessions that are

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.370
related to adopting Aqua.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.440
So let's get started.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.180
What is Aqua?

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.600
Well, judging by the email I get
and what I read online,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.180
I'm beginning to think that
Aqua is a kaleidoscope scheme.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.060
Or it's a SoundJam skin,
or it's one of those things.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.390
Aqua is the user interface for Mac OS X.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.720
Okay, what does that mean?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.560
What do we say when we
say it's a user interface?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.680
Well, obviously, it is an appearance,
yes.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.140
But it's also a set of behaviors.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.190
It's how things respond
when you select them.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.560
It's also a set of features that we
provide that are available to you,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.940
things like our Save panel,
our Print panel,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.040
that you can use and adopt to
deliver Aqua in your applications.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060
It's also a collection of
applications that we ship,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.940
like the Finder and various
utilities that we ship.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.710
Collectively, this describes the user
experience of Mac OS X.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.500
So again,
user experience is not just appearance,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.050
but it is behaviors,
and it is a set of features

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.760
that you can adopt.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.840
Now what you may find surprising
is that from my standpoint,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.390
you're also contributing to Aqua.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.880
If you carbonize your app and you
deliver it on Mac OS X and you do

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.940
a really poor job of adopting Aqua,
then you're weakening the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.800
user experience of Mac OS X.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.720
People are going to run it and
they're going to be confused.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.120
For years and years,
we have been touting consistency as

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.300
one of the most important aspects
of the Macintosh user experience.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.170
So it's important for me,
it's important for Apple,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.560
that you understand what we're
trying to achieve with Aqua.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.740
So that's what I want to talk about.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.160
When we started Aqua,
almost two years ago,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.790
we started thinking about this new
user experience we wanted to deliver.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.490
We've stated a number of goals,
things we wanted Aqua to achieve.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.410
The very first of which was that
Aqua had to deliver the best

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.000
user experience of any commercial
operating system on the market,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.260
unsurpassed.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.580
Somewhat of a lofty goal,
but we're up to the task.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.740
It had to be fun.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.420
We wanted to bring back
joy of use to computers.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.630
Things have gotten so complex that
we had to find ways to address this.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.790
We had to find ways to make it simpler.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.940
Mac OS has a very long tradition
of setting the standard for

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.320
ease of use in our industry.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.400
and with Aqua,
we wanted to build on that.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.740
We didn't want to just throw
that away and start again.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.080
We know what the
strengths of Mac OS 9 are.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.800
We had full intentions
of using them in Aqua,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.850
but we also saw opportunities
to improve upon that.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:20.500
[Transcript missing]

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.700
Finally,
we wanted Aqua to be recognizable.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.400
We wanted it to have a strong identity.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.400
Apple is about leadership
and product design.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.040
And we've been hugely successful with
our hardware in the last two years.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.650
And now with Aqua,
we want to do the same with our software.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.780
So what is new?

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.600
You have a Mac OS 9 app.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.220
You're carbonizing it.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
Things that you should be aware of.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.080
So first of all, appearance.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.720
Appearance is new in Aqua.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.220
And there is only one appearance in Aqua.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.880
This is it.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.750
This is the very first slide that
was publicly shown at Macworld.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.290
Revealing the user interface
or the appearance of Aqua.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.150
Today I actually considered giving
slides of each and every control

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.460
and talking about them all,
but then I said, I don't have to do that.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.470
I could just show this.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.120
This really captures all of what
the appearance is trying to achieve.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.890
This button speaks to what the
design language of Aqua is.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:34.090
It is light, it is clear, it is fresh,
it is clean, it is crisp, it is subtle.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.490
Where platinum relies on black
lines and gray lines to define

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.500
frames of windows and the shapes of
buttons and the volume of a button,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.670
Aqua uses much more subtle visual cues.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.080
We're using shadow, we're using light,
we're using color, we're using color.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.500
We're using very subtle tonal gradations.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.250
We can do this because we've got quartz.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.430
We've got this great graphics
engine underneath that allows us to

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.300
draw these to the screen very fast.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.930
So rather than linger on each and every
control and walk you through all those,

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.670
I thought I'd rather look at more
interesting parts of the appearance.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.200
Other areas which are related to
appearance but are not directly

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.140
related to how a control looks.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.160
And one of those is translucency.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.470
Now,
we played around a lot with translucency.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.440
We tried translucent windows and
we tried all sorts of controls

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.810
that were fading in and fading out.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.570
And what we discovered in all
of that exploration was that

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.640
translucency is a novelty.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.980
That you could very quickly tire of this.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:47.190
So our conclusion was that translucency
only added value if it had meaning.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.140
This is very important because
this comes up again in something

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.800
else I'm going to talk to.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.100
We chose to use translucency
on those controls which are

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.830
of more transient nature.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.400
So for example, I can see here a menu.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.530
Um, menus come and go.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.000
They only exist for a very short time.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.440
You make a selection and it disappears.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.590
Translucency is nice because it
reinforces that a menu is very light.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.110
Likewise,
we use translucency in our sheets.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.590
Sheets, again,
typically only exist for a short time.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.070
They're usually not presented
for long periods of time.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.380
Saving a document, printing a document,
or an alert, for example.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.960
Sheets come and go.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.360
Therefore, translucency was perfect.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.280
Translucency was perfect for
sheets as well because sheets are

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.830
tied to their parent document.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.910
Of course, they obscure some of the
content that's underneath.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.420
So using translucency allowed you to
reveal just enough that was underneath

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.460
to remind you what that document was.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.030
Like translucency,
we had the opportunity to

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.400
use a lot of color in Aqua.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.540
And we tried a lot of colors.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.700
We played around with color for
the better part of the last year,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.990
trying to find what kinds of colors,
what palette to use,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.040
what would be our theme of our color.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:07.370
But like translucency,
we came to the conclusion that color

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.080
was useful only again if it had

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.430
And in this example,
in this dialogue where you

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.540
see an assortment of controls,
color says, I am the selected control.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.750
I am the one you've chosen.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.440
In the tab, for example,
that is the selected tab.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.820
Radio buttons, check boxes,
and even the pop-up says that I am

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.530
the current choice that you have.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.980
That's the meaning of color and how
we've chosen to color our controls.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.600
In the windows,
we actually have used three colors.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.520
We have three controls in our title bar.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.030
We've carried forward from Mac OS 9.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.990
We have the close box.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.300
We have the minimize control.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.620
And we have the zoom control.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.780
And they have very
different functionality.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.270
So we decided, first,
we knew we wanted to group them.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.100
Secondly,
we had to distinguish them somehow.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.950
So we chose to go with three colors.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.310
It's somewhat of a playful decision,
but I think it's quite effective.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.280
One interesting aspect of the appearance,
it's related to appearance,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.390
but it's not specifically
how something is rendered,

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.750
but rather our approach to how
we've chosen to organize the screen.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.220
These three examples,
actually including the doc,

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:23.380
four examples, show how we've decided to
take a more center justified,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.440
actually that's not even correct,
I would say center biased

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.800
approach to organizing the screen.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.640
The sheet is in the middle of the window.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.760
The controls in the dialogue
have a more central alignment,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.320
central biased alignment to them.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.420
The tabs are in the middle of the window.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.070
Even in the QuickTime player,
the play control, the most important

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.200
control on that window,
smack in the middle.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.750
Other controls are organized around that.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.660
The dock is centered.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.570
It remains centered,
regardless of how many

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.670
things you add or remove.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.040
It always stays center
aligned on the screen.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.680
Even the Apple logo you
see in the menu bar,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.720
even that center of the screen.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.330
This is an important
change because platinum was

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.110
typically more left justified.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.980
We've changed it a little bit.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.670
This is primarily an aesthetic decision.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.410
It's about achieving
balance and symmetry.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.770
We think it makes for
a much cleaner design.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.400
So beyond appearance,
we've added a few new behaviors.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.520
We've changed some behaviors.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.800
Mac OS, when it was first introduced,
and what it popularized in

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.280
graphical user interfaces,
were two key tenets.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.250
One, direct manipulation.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.240
When you grab something on
the screen and moved it,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.350
you were moving that object.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.950
You were operating on that object.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.660
And yet for 15 years we've been dragging
gray rectangles around the screen.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.320
Aqua changes that.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.380
We have live dragging.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.570
We have live resizing.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.350
Live scrolling.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.070
Everything is live.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.760
We've taken direct manipulation
all the way to its conclusion.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.550
The other thing that was about
Mac OS that was respected was the

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.840
fact that it provided feedback.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.610
It told the user at any time,
"This is what you are doing.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.080
This is the status of the task
that you're trying to accomplish."

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:23.450
In Aqua, again in part thanks to Quartz,
we have the ability to do more

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.400
interesting animations and transitions.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.250
We're able to say,
you saw this morning in the keynote,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.300
a minimized window,
how it animates into the dock.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.440
We're able to achieve that.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.640
We're able to illustrate to you
where this window is going to.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.120
It's really quite successful.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.040
So in addition to behaviors,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.000
We looked at introducing
a few new features,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.900
user interface features.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.980
Now these are things that are available
in our frameworks in Carbon and

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.100
Cocoa that you can take advantage of.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.760
And we've designed them to solve specific
problems that we recognize exist today,

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.070
not just in Mac OS 9,
but in all operating systems.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:10.170
When Mac OS was originally built,
designed and built, you could only open

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.170
one document at a time.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.800
You can only run one
application at a time.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.990
Things have changed a
little bit since then.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.400
It's not uncommon today to have for
an intermediate or an expert user to

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.300
have five to ten applications running.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.690
Fifteen to twenty windows
open on the screen.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.730
This is chaos.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.460
So we've looked for ways to
help people focus on what

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.620
they're trying to accomplish.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.190
We look for opportunities to
introduce new features to reduce

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.730
the modality in the system.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.090
Areas or at times during a
task where you are blocked,

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.120
we try to reduce that.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.200
I'll explain a little bit more of
that when we get to that feature.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.700
And finally,
we look for ways to help people

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.840
manage all this clutter on the screen,
all these windows.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.140
So let's look at a few of these features.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.430
window layering.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.990
Now, if you're familiar with Mac OS,
you know that if I have, say,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.200
five windows open in a word processor,

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.290
and I just want to one
of those to work on.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.440
If I select it,
all five windows come to the front.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.230
It's not what I wanted.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.230
I just wanted that one.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.170
It's not,
it reinforces the fact that we are,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.820
we remain in Mac OS 9 very
conscious of applications and the

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.180
layering between applications.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.500
So with Aqua, we wanted to change that.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.660
We wanted to move more towards
focusing on the content,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.190
on the document the person's working on.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.980
So we've changed the way windows layer.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:52.180
We now allow full interleaving
of windows between applications.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.480
So when I've got five word processing
documents open and I just want to

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.680
work on one and I at the same time
perhaps have ten illustrations open

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:07.630
and say my task is to copy one of the
illustrations into my word processor,

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.510
I don't need to bring all
five illustrations forward.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.000
I just bring the one I want.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.900
And I put it into the word
processing document I want.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.220
We think this is a much
more natural way to work.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.750
and it really facilitates moving
content between individual documents

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.950
without having to be conscious about
applications coming forward and receding.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:47.090
Sheets.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.090
Sheets show, Steve showed sheets.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.090
That's a tough word.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.090
He showed that in the
keynote this morning.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.090
This is a really important concept.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.090
Not just a nifty way to
show a window opening.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.090
It's really important.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.090
And it's important because

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.320
It takes modality in the
system to the document.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.690
Today in Mac OS 9,
if I want to save a document

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.170
in my word processor,
I'm presented with what's called

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.500
an application modal dialog.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.220
There's nothing else I can do in that
application while that dialog is open.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.080
I can switch to another application,
but maybe that's not what I want.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.230
Maybe I want to switch to another
document to check something.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.500
So now we've taken modality
to the document level.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:23.950
Each document-- I can open a save sheet
on five separate documents if I choose.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.770
Now the interesting thing about
sheets to reinforce this document

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.250
modality is that sheets are attached
to the document that they were

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.380
generated from or that they apply to.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.400
So as I move the document around,
the sheet follows it.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.920
That's an example of how a behavior
reinforces this relationship

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.900
between these two windows.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.200
And we've seen some examples today.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.870
Steve showed a save sheet.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.640
Maybe he should have showed print.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.270
That would have been easier.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.700
Drawers are interesting.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.600
We did not see drawers in
the keynote this morning,

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.100
although Steve did show drawers
in his keynote at Macworld.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.600
He showed it in the
context of our mail client.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:15.040
Now drawers are a way for us to provide
access to less frequently used controls.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.140
This is part of managing the clutter.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.980
This is a way for you to decide perhaps
there is a set of controls or a set

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.480
of functionality that doesn't need
to be in the user's face all the time

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.360
that maybe I want to put into a drawer.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.800
They're easy to get at, easy to open.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.300
You can leave them open if you so choose.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.400
And we'll show that mail
example today in a demo.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.240
I think you'll find
that pretty interesting.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:49.580
and then use with changed
menus a little bit uh...

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.880
Two menus were lacking on Mac OS as it
matured and we reached a point where

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.800
we were running multiple applications
and had multiple documents open.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:04.110
It was obvious that we had no menu that
was generic to the application itself.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.420
Previously,
and as is the case in Mac OS 9 today,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:14.170
we have a Quit in the File menu,
and we have Preferences string elsewhere.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.380
So we've created an application menu.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:21.220
This menu is intended to provide commands
that apply to the application as a whole.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.300
Don't apply to a specific document
or the content in that document.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.300
And we've made it the
first menu on the menu bar.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.300
So we've created a nice hierarchy.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.300
We have the very first menu,
which is your application menu.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.270
The next one applies to the document,
opening and closing and printing.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.300
And then every menu after
that is about content.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.300
That creates a very nice hierarchy.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.300
It's very easy to understand.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.200
Now in DP3,
we used to put the application

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.210
icon in the menu bar.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.260
And now in DP4, we put the application
name in the menu bar.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.300
We're going to make
this a user preference.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.180
We'll let people choose.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.880
What do you want?

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.860
Now,
one of the things that's interesting is,

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.940
of course, we can have applications
with very long names.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:08.210
So what we're asking of you
is to provide a short name.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.490
We looked at the top 100 applications
that ship on Mac OS today,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.600
and of those we found virtually
all had common short names.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:22.040
Microsoft Internet Explorer is
often referred to as Explore.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.000
Mavis Beacon teaches typing.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I don't know.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:37.840
Mavis.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:37.840
So we're asking you to provide a
short name for your application.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:37.840
And that short name is described
in the application package

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:37.840
and it is used in this menu.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.400
Now we also introduced a window
menu to help you manage windows.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.460
Now as I said, of course,
we've changed how layering works.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.000
Layering is providing interleaving
windows between applications.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.950
A window menu is to help you when you
are in an application get access to

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.270
other windows that might be obscured.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.920
Now another new feature which
we demonstrated at Macworld,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.580
which we think is a
very important concept,

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.260
is the notion of single window mode.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.500
Single window mode was designed to
help people focus on their task.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.540
It was designed to allow you to
work on a single window and have

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.430
the feature minimize all the
other windows out of your view to

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.490
help you deal with that clutter.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:38.750
Now we recognize that this
is a very important concept.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.450
We really believe strongly that
there is a solution in this domain

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:49.230
to help people manage their clutter.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:50.390
We also are not altogether stupid.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.390
We recognize that

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.160
It's a great feature,
but it needs a little bit more work.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.140
We've got to refine how this
works a little bit more.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.260
So we're going to keep working
on single window mode because

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.140
we think it's important.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.120
So all I ask you is to keep watching.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.150
We're going to make some changes.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.710
So what I'd like to do is
invite Bas Sorting on stage.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.250
Bas is a member of the
user interface group.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.810
There we go.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:37.690
Thank you.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.750
Is my audio working?

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.940
Yes.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:38.940
Bas is going to take us
on a little tour of Aqua.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:38.940
Now, I'll take the risk that we may
repeat much of what you might have

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:38.940
seen in the keynote this morning,
but I think what we'll do when we go

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:38.940
through this is point out some of the
details that may not have been obvious.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:38.940
Bas?

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.470
Here we have another Aqua panel
showing some of the controls.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:48.030
As you can see,
we have used blue to highlight,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.100
to accent the widgets.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.100
So if you select the checkbox,
it turns blue.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.080
The pop-up menus, nice windows.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.160
Here again, blue to accent the...
For the throbbing button,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.690
we used to show activity and focus.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.340
So you know what you're going to
hit when you press the return key.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.380
Let me go on and show a window.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.970
Well, as Don said before,
we try to avoid using black lines and

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.120
borders around windows and controls.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:32.170
So it keeps it really clean and
much fresher and there's more focus

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.290
on the contents of the window.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:41.410
The title bar controls show
the glyphs when you roll over.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.460
Dragon Windows Surround is live,
which is really nice.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.260
And they also know about the
boundaries of the screen.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.300
So if you would move
them up to the menu bar,

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.690
they would stop there,
which is a nice little feature.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.530
Let me bring up a second window.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.040
So you can see the shadows
a little bit better.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.910
And you can also see the
difference between active

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.100
windows and inactive windows.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.460
If the window gets active,
it gets more shadowed,

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.400
so it gets lifted up from its background,
so to distinguish better between

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.090
active and inactive windows.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.800
Also, you notice that the
title bars go inactive,

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.890
go translucent,
and the controls lose their color.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.010
to bring up another window.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.150
This is an example of how the
interleaved windows can work.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.070
So now if I would click
on this image here,

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.200
I only bring that window to the front
and not the other window as well.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:48.200
So I still have this window
in between the two others.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:55.100
This allows me to, for example,
drag something in this window.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.520
And let me try and add some text here.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:08.000
[Transcript missing]

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:15.760
So from here you can
select your fonts and I,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:15.760
let me pick something here.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:25.240
Okay, one more feature was the menu
showing the transparency,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.260
which is really nice because
they're transient and this makes

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.380
them feel much more lightweight.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.340
The same thing happens also in Sheets.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.510
Again, the transparency so you can
see the image underneath,

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:42.120
so you still see the content from
the window that it applies to.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.180
Let me see.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:50.970
If the window is too small,
You would get the little genie effect.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:59.940
Again, and if the window is too close
to the edge of the screen,

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:07.210
it will move the window and move
it back as soon as you're done.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.100
So let's close this.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.280
One next thing I want to show is drawers.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:28.600
So like in Mail, there's the drawer,
which is really handy.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.290
Because you can-- oh, sorry, cancel.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:39.190
This, by the way, shows the animation of
the progress bars in Aqua.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.200
And let me show it again.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.200
Because even though the
messages might stall for a bit,

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.030
the throughput, you still get feedback
that it's still alive,

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.580
it's still doing something.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:55.040
And the progress bars in Mac OS 9,
they would get stuck and it would look

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.440
like the system is frozen or something.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.060
So this provides much better feedback.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.420
One more thing I wanted to show about the
drawer is if you drag messages around,

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.530
you can,
depending on the direction that you drag,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.630
you can choose where the drawer is going,
to the left or the right.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:16.230
And even when this is closed,
I can still start dragging a message and

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.010
pop open and I can drop it in a mailbox.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:28.090
and the drawer with hide automatically
again and again here this some more

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:33.680
live tracking going on a lot of life
stuff it's all direct manipulation

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.700
Notice by the way in the scroll
bars the animated texture

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.800
makes it look more fluid.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.900
Don, this is it for now.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.840
Don will continue.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:48.840
I'll be back later.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.900
Open up a couple more documents again.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.110
I just want to point something out.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.160
So here is a good example
of the interleaved windows.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.590
A couple other features we've
introduced is the ability to

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.480
operate on inactive windows.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.330
For example, we can close a window that's
in the very back without having

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.880
to first bring it forward.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.580
Also new in DB4, this is something that
didn't exist in DB3.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:24.390
This is a Cocoa app that's
exhibiting a Mac OS 9 behavior,

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.640
the ability to move inactive windows.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.140
I have a slide on this
a little bit later,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.980
but we're actually looking at
bringing a lot more consistency

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.860
between Cocoa and Carbon.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.990
I'll be back.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.840
So that was just a quick tour.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.030
Give you an idea of some of
the things that are in Carbon.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.240
What I want you to look for is when
you see these screens-- and you've been

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.260
looking at Aqua all day long in a lot of
these third party demos and our demos.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.390
And I want you to--

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.310
I want you to decide if
you think that this is,

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.580
if you feel anything that we
have tried to convey with it.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.100
Do you feel that this is in fact
lighter and more fresh than platinum?

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.810
Because this was an
important goal for us.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:18.250
I'd be interested in knowing if you
think we've achieved that or not.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.160
Okay, since Macworld,
it's been five months,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.600
we've done a few things,
things that are in DP4.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.200
First of all, as I just mentioned,
we have more consistent behaviors.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.420
Cocoa and Carbon have
very different heritage.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.540
We've changed the behaviors
to try and make them more

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.200
consistent between the two.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.870
I don't believe that as a user
you should be able to distinguish

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.200
between Cocoa and Carbon.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.500
And that's something
we're trying to achieve.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.990
That's been mentioned a few times today,
but we changed the size of controls.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.840
When we first unveiled Aqua,
we had very large controls.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.200
And that was intended to compensate
for much higher resolution

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.760
screens that we're seeing today.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.600
You've probably noticed
that if you take your iMac,

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.200
set it at the very highest resolution,
those tiny little 32 by 32 icons are

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.310
getting a little difficult to hit.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.770
So our original intent for
Aqua was to make things a little

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.110
bit bigger to compensate for that.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.770
We also realize that that added
more effort to carbonization effort.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.290
So we made a good business decision
and that is we've taken controls

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.300
back down in size and the fonts,
system font sizes,

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.020
to make them more consistent
with Platinum in an effort

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.900
to facilitate carbonization.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.430
It should be easy.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.210
We've enhanced the finder.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.600
Steve mentioned this morning
we've made it more Mac-like.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.200
In the next demo we're going to show you,
I want to point out exactly

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.370
how we've done that.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.810
We've refined the dock.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:47.900
The dock is a very important
feature in Mac OS X and in Aqua.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.370
And we want to get this right.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.720
It is the center of all
of what you are doing,

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.090
all of the tasks you're performing.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:59.700
It's your apps, it's your documents,
your windows, folders.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.410
It is your work.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.660
So we want to get this right.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.460
It has to work for you.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.700
So we made changes.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.690
And finally in DP4 we revealed our new
direction that we're going with icons.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.480
We have a new style.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.890
I'm going to walk you through that,
explain it.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.560
So let's have a look.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.010
Let's start with the Platinum controls.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.060
Here we have, here's a typical Platinum
dialogue you'd see today.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.100
Now when you run it, you aquify it.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.100
Same size controls.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:35.610
Much, much easier.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.360
One of the complaints we got in DP3,
well, and from Macworld really,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:47.570
was this whole notion of how we've
changed the finder really upset people.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:56.300
and I read websites, I get email,
I've heard the complaints.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.960
Steve makes a point of
forwarding them to me.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:06.960
And all those complaints
didn't fall on deaf ears.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.640
So we tried to understand
what it is about the finder

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.920
that is important in Mac OS 9,
in all versions of Mac OS.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.550
What characteristics of that
finder do people want to preserve?

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:31.100
[Transcript missing]

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.800
We also preserved a few of those things,
a few characteristics that

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.160
we believe are important.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.150
We'll look at those in a demo.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.760
So again, we preserve the view for
each and every folder.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.670
This is a key characteristic
of the Finder in Mac OS 9.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.020
The layout, the view type, icon size,
the order of the columns,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.980
the columns that are visible,
all of those are saved,

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.370
just like they are in Mac OS 9.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.060
As you're navigating
down your file system,

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.110
each folder that you encounter,
if you had set it to a specific view,

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.920
it will be preserved and it
will be presented that way.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.260
We've added a few more view options.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.760
We're going to show you some of those.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.260
I think they're kind of fun.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:11.490
We believe that column view
for navigation is really an

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.070
exceptionally good way to
quickly navigate the hierarchy.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.860
And we've combined that with
the ability to present a

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.220
folder in its preserved view.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.290
So what we really believe we have
achieved is leveraging the strength of

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:28.330
column view as a navigation mechanism,
fast navigation mechanism,

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.690
and icon and list view as a
presentation method of showing

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.440
the contents of the folder.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.650
And we'll show you how
we've combined those two.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:42.520
Finally, we've allowed preferences to
have removable media show up on

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:43.830
the desktop when you insert it.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.310
I put my CD in, my zip disk, boom,
shows up on the desktop.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.300
We're also going to allow
you to put it in the dock,

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.420
too.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.760
In part because the dock is on top.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.790
The desktop gets buried.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.240
I think that'll be a popular preference.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.080
The Dock.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.210
As I mentioned,
the Dock is a very important

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.790
feature in Mac OS X.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.580
It's about organizing your work.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.500
It's about your favorite things,
getting access to things.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.880
And when we designed the doc originally,
and we demonstrated it in Macworld,

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:23.480
that doc had no structure to it.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.940
It was completely unstructured.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.800
The user could choose to
organize it any way they wanted.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.610
We believe that people wanted that.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:33.710
And the feedback we got was, you know,
we'd appreciate it if you actually

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.960
gave us a little bit of structure,
or you enforced a

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.470
little bit of structure.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.210
In fact, we want to know what
are apps and what isn't.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.920
So we designed the doc to do this.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:48.240
We designed the doc to separate
out apps from everything else.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.620
We think this actually works quite well.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.140
We've also changed the
presentation of the doc.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.760
As you saw in some of the demos earlier,
the doc is translucent.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.290
You can actually put
things behind it now.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.790
It's actually a very nice effect.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:09.420
Now what's important about the dock and
what we're trying to solve by designing

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:15.300
the dock is that in Mac OS today,
you have the Apple menu,

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.950
What you can put applications
or documents in or folders in.

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:22.380
But it's impossible to configure.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:24.440
Try it.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:24.770
Have you tried it?

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:25.880
I'm sure you've tried
explaining to someone how to

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.000
add something to the Apple menu.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.750
So we wanted to provide a mechanism
to replace the Apple menu,

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.400
but much easier configuration.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.500
Adding and removing things is a breeze,
and it is with the dock.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.320
Secondly, in Mac OS 9,
we have the launcher.

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.950
which provides very similar
functionality to the Apple menu,

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:47.590
just a different presentation.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.200
And of course we have the Process Menu or
the Application Menu which allows you

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.700
to switch between running applications.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:58.030
Well, there's a lot of overlap
between these three features.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.390
and with the dock we're trying
to consolidate they're all

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.800
related this is an app by launch
it it's running i can selected

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.720
I don't need to go to three different
places or in this case say the

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.320
Apple menu and the application switcher.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.930
I don't need to go to two different
places to see the status of an

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.740
application or to launch it.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.150
So as I said,
what's key about the dock is it's

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.320
very easily user configurable.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.590
We envision you adding
and removing things quite

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.240
frequently because it's so easy.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.290
It'll always be a collection
of your favorite things,

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.280
things you want access to quickly.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.640
It also is representation
of your current things,

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.010
things that you're
currently working with.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.270
You're running apps and minimize windows.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.620
So for this reason, the dock isn't,
in essence, your work.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.790
It is your things you're
trying to accomplish.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.310
This is our new icon style.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:56.860
600 by 600 pixels.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.330
One bit.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.590
So when this was designed,
of course there were a lot of limitations

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.310
on the graphics capabilities back then.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.360
If you've ever looked at a 32 by
32 icon on a nine inch screen,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.900
it was quite nicely proportioned
relative to the other items.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:18.330
As I said earlier,
that's a little bit different

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.500
today when you're working
on an Apple Cinema display.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.630
For the handful of you who actually
have the privilege of doing that.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.790
So first of all, we wanted to make things
a little bit bigger.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.270
We had the opportunity to
think about how elements could

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.060
should scale in Aqua and
how they could be larger.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.990
So we decided to break out of the
boundary of small 32 by 32 icons,

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.370
go a little bit larger.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.020
But rather than take a
small incremental step,

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:45.020
we

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.600
We decided to take a big one.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.700
In part because the doc uses
it when it's magnifying items.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.170
But what's more interesting
about this icon is because of

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.880
the limitations at the time,
it was, in essence, iconic.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.600
It couldn't communicate very much.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.040
The hand,
now I can make out that there's a hand

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.290
here and I think it's holding what
looks to be maybe a pen or a pencil.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.980
I believe this was the icon
for MacWrite originally.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.670
And it just is trying to
capture what this tool does,

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.590
but it doesn't really communicate what
you might accomplish by using this tool.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:27.990
It doesn't have any
emotional qualities to it.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:35.600
So what we wanted to achieve with
Aqua was with our icon style.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.560
Because we had the opportunity to
put such tremendous detail into

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.750
our icons because they were larger,
is we wanted to move towards

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.040
a more emotive style.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:51.740
We wanted an application icon to say,
I'm not just a word processor,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.820
but here's the things I can do.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.430
I can create letters for you.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.060
We can create letters.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:02.010
In this case, this example is our preview
application for looking at images.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:09.100
And it kind of suggests the kind
of reward or emotional reward you

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.800
might get by using this application
to look at your photographs

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.160
or other people's photographs.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.200
But we think this is a subtle
while very important shift in how

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.050
we're approaching our icon designs.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:27.870
The other thing we did is we've actually
designed what we're calling genres.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.170
Now we've always had icon families
and families describe either icons

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.340
Icons belonging to an application,
for example, the application icon and

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:38.630
its corresponding document.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.760
or an extension or a control panel.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.580
We've always described those as families.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.770
Now in the case of multiple applications,
we can of course have different

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.040
kinds of applications.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.890
We can have applications which
the user may use to author

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:56.770
something or produce something,
perhaps a letter or a website.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:00.760
But we also have utilities,
applications in which are

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.690
of a more technical nature,
applications that perhaps are best left

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.250
to somebody who knows what they're doing.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.650
So we've described what
we're calling genres.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.370
And I'll show you two examples,
two different collections

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.000
of each of those.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.060
As I mentioned, the large size.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.030
Rather than taking a small
increment going 48 by 48,

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.630
64 by 64,
we just went all the way up to 128.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.900
I don't think we'll have to
revisit this size for a while.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.480
I think if you do an icon now,
the larger size,

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.500
I think we're safe for a while.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.530
Now what we've also done,
we haven't changed the format by which we

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.580
preserve or save our icons in our apps.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.040
We're still using the ICNS format
introduced in Mac OS 9.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.160
So we can support what we're
calling hints at smaller sizes.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:46.730
Now while you can take 128 by 128 icons,
scale it down quite nicely,

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:51.460
and it preserves its image quite well,
right down to as small as 48 by 48.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.350
Once you get down to about 32 by 32,
or especially down to 16 by 16,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.550
those scaled icons start
to lose their meaning.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.340
There's too much information.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.560
So hints allow you to design
simpler icons at those sizes.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.040
And as you scale them down,
the system will swap in these

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:11.080
hints and therefore present a
simpler icon at the smaller sizes.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.800
That's an important concept.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.690
It also allows you to
preserve your existing icons.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.200
If you decide you're taking your
existing icons forward into Aqua,

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.520
you can save your 16 by 16, 32 by 32s,
you can use those today and

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.140
just create a larger one,
larger 128.

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.040
There you may want to put more detail in.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.760
So here's an example of
our user application genre.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:36.140
These are all applications which
you use to author something,

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.870
or in the case of preview,
just to view something.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:45.240
These are intended to not
just say I'm an application,

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.600
which I think they all share an element
in common to say I am an application.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.220
In fact, if you stretch it far enough,
I think you can still see there's

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.640
a diamond element in there,
which harkens back to the very

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.010
original application icon.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.750
That's intentional.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.840
But they're intended to
capture a mood or capture,

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.250
capture, I say capture an emotion.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.180
I'm using that term a lot,
but it's important.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.860
This is our utility genre.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.600
These applications are
much more technical,

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.440
much more serious.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.770
We've taken a different
color scheme to these.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.600
I'm not showing you these to give
you specific instructions to do this,

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.590
but rather to get you to think
about what is your application.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.020
Do you provide a utility?

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.190
Do you provide a game?

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:35.000
Perhaps games are even more
extravagant than these.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.200
Maybe games are very
colorful and playful.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.760
You can have the opportunity with
your icon to communicate what

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.790
your application is all about.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.600
So again,
I'd like to call Buss back up on stage.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.220
And let's go through,
and we're going to have a look

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.510
at the finder and the doc.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:08.770
Let's pull up a finder window.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.710
First of all,
what's nice about the new finder is

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:16.380
the fact that you can navigate the
file system and stay within one window.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.350
I'll show you.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:23.730
If I click on my hard drive,
I can go to my local accounts, users,

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.300
and my home directory.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.180
I'll stay on one window,
so I don't have this mess of

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:32.560
all these windows coming up,
which is really nice.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:38.160
One thing that improves this
is the toolbar on the top here.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.090
You have channels,
so you can jump directly from, say,

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:46.130
for example, the main directory to the
documents folder without having

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.320
to go through the whole route.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.560
The pop-up here shows where
you are in the file system.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.250
You can use the back button to
go back to where you came from.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:12.200
[Transcript missing]

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:17.280
One nice feature that's
been in the column view is,

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.680
well, first of all,
you see the whole path in the system.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:32.880
And you can get nice previews
from your icons right away.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:32.880
And let me get some applications here.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:40.510
So you get to see the full
128 beautiful rich graphics,

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.140
which is really nice.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.040
One more thing you can do in here
as well is you can see little

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.700
previews of the QuickTime movies.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:55.020
Just in line, which is really great.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:08.290
I don't answer questions right now,
sorry.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:13.820
I would like to show
one feature we added,

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.240
which is if you double click on
a folder from the column view,

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.040
it switches back to its saved view.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.220
So I can switch back
really easily like this.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.500
Let's go to this one.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.080
I double click.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.780
I get this persistent view.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.010
Suppose I would want to
change the size of my icon.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.550
So I go to the View Options panel.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.530
And from here, I can set the size of the
items for this window.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:49.520
I can also choose if I want
to add a background picture.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.690
So for example, I can add a background

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.680
Let me add something
to my home directory.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.990
I want to have icon view and
I would like to have a nice

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.000
picture here in the background.

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.000
Let me see.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
This one.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.020
So now I can customize per
folder what it looks like and

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.900
I can put in any image I want.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.850
While we're changing images anyway,
we can also change the

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:25.690
picture of the desktop.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:25.690
Let

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.010
So you can pick any background you want.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.680
Let me see.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.440
The next thing I'd like
to show is the doc.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.800
Actually, Buzz,
let me just-- I want to go

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.860
through a couple of things here.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.900
I want to make sure people really
understand what we've changed.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:51.770
Go to your documents folder
and drag a file to the desktop.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:11.200
[Transcript missing]

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.900
I have to do the image already,
that's why.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.580
In DP3 when you drag
something to the desktop,

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:21.380
it made an alias.

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.300
That's not what people wanted.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:28.570
So you can use the desktop if you choose.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:28.570
You can put all your stuff.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.560
Another thing I want just to go
through again is this notion of using

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.390
the column view to quickly navigate.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:40.700
Go right to the top of the
hierarchy in this case,

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.210
right up to the computer,
and just navigate down here very quickly

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:47.010
down to the document which you want.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:47:07.140
and then just double click on it.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.140
Boom.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.140
Here you saw an example of
using column view to very

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.140
quickly navigate the hierarchy.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.140
You got to where you wanted to be,
but you wanted to see it in the way

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.140
that it was intended to be presented,
the way you had left it.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.140
You double click.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.140
Boom.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.860
The back button even puts you
back into column view if you want

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:11.720
to again continue navigating.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.060
We think this is a solution
that really strengthens-- takes

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.850
advantage of the strengths of column
view and of icon and list view.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:27.620
Perhaps another thing you can do
before you go on the dock is just

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.430
spawn a whole bunch of Windows.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.250
Now, holding the Option key down,
you get just your container Windows.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:39.100
So,
that's just the Mac OS way of doing it.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.130
So, you still have that available.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.890
and they will remember their size.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.680
And the main finder window
always stays the way you set it.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.800
That's important.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:58.800
Those windows that were open,
just like Mac OS Finder windows do today.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.090
They keep the size and the
position on the screen.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:15.780
Okay, so let's-- Sorry to interrupt,
but-- No, it's okay.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:15.780
Go back to the doc.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:15.780
Let's move on to the doc.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.120
So here's the dock.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.930
First of all,
I think what's really nice is that you

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:27.220
can see it's a transparent background,
which makes it feel more lightweight.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.450
Nice icons in there.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.340
It's really great.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.460
So you can see it's transparent
if I move windows behind it.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.130
Let's open up one like this.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.410
It's really pretty.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:46.540
The main power of the dock is
you can very easily add your

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.040
applications and documents to it.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.840
So if I would just drag this in here,
just insert it right away.

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:56.020
And again,
on the left side is applications and on

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.860
the right side is all your documents,
folders, and miniaturized windows.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:04.220
In case you want to get rid
of things from your dock,

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.370
you just drag them out and

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:12.290
Let me try and add some more stuff here.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:32.560
So if I have a multiple selection,
it just adds the multiple items in there.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:32.560
And sometimes you see
things moving around,

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:32.560
and that's when you add
the same thing again.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:32.560
See, it moves it to the right place.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:32.560
The male viewer icon moves over
because it was already in the dock.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:32.590
So let's add some more documents in here.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:40.430
You notice the dock gets really small
so I can go to my preferences to set

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:43.800
the size of the dock to anything else.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:49.800
And I can turn on magnification
in order to magnify the images.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.670
And I can reorder the way I want it.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.040
and I can turn on auto-hide.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.320
So now,
if I move to the bottom of the screen,

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.900
I get the dark and the fisheye effect,
the magnification.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.540
Let's miniaturize a window.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:29.250
Again, you see the genie effect which
is really smooth and nice.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.980
I can do it in slow motion again
so you can see what's happening.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.870
If you watch the dock,
it's gradually making room

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.420
for the window to fit in.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.740
So it's all very smooth and very precise.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.120
So let's try it again from here.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:57.600
Also, when the window is too
low below the dock,

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:05.200
it would move it up and
put it back in like this.

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:31.870
This was the dog.

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.870
Actually, Buzz,
while you've got those two images there,

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.870
I do want to demonstrate something.

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.870
I talked about single window mode
and I talked about how we were

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.870
trying to make things easier to work.

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.870
So if you could just maybe
open those two photographs up.

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.870
This is the way single window
mode is implemented today.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:38.190
As you see,
when he turned on that control,

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:39.970
it minimized the background window.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:42.240
And as he chooses other
minimized windows in the dock,

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.990
it swaps them out.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.060
There's a lot of power in this.

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.840
And as I said,
we know it's not quite right,

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:55.140
but we really believe this
concept has a lot of value

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.830
in terms of managing clutter.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:01.940
So that just gives you an idea of
really the essence of the idea.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.020
And as I said,
we're going to keep working on that.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.600
[Transcript missing]

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:12.900
All right.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.330
That was it.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.180
Do that again.

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:14.700
Thank you.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.200
One more time?

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:15.700
OK.

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.200
One more time.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:21.160
. OK.

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.500
Enjoy Mac OS X and Aqua.

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.000
Bye bye.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.490
Great.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.960
Thank you.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.500
Okay?

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:36.000
So I've talked to you about
the appearance of Aqua.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.860
I've talked to you about
some of the new behaviors.

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:39.640
I've talked to you about
some of the new features.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.670
Of course, I'm not going into tremendous
amount of detail on each of these,

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:45.360
but I'm just trying to give you a sense
of those things you should be aware

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.830
of when you're carbonizing your app.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:52.770
So to sum it all up, what Aqua is,
is more than appearance.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.580
It is a set of behaviors
and a set of features.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:03.210
It continues the tradition of Mac OS 9 in
terms of our advantage and ease of use.

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.720
It's ready today with
your DP4 CD installed,

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.010
which you've now had a few hours to do.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:12.520
It is ready for you
today to start to adopt,

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.270
and you really ought to.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:19.150
Because it's only by installing
it that it's going to get better.

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:23.090
As Steve mentioned,
we listened to the feedback from DP3 and

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.360
we continue to want you to give it to us.

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.630
So by installing it and working with it,
you can tell us where

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:30.900
it's not working for you.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:31.540
We're running it.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.310
At Apple today,
we have a few hundred people

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:34.580
running Developer PV4.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:38.010
We're living on it,
as Bertram pointed out in his session.

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:40.700
So we recognize where
its shortcomings are.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.610
We try to fix those.

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.740
Now here's a question.

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:46.580
Is it finished?

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.760
Are we complete with Aqua?

00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:50.020
As I just said, no.

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.600
We're going to continue
to make it better.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:52.820
From your standpoint, yes.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.830
Start adopting it.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.750
From our standpoint,
we've got a little bit

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:57.750
more polishing to do.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.010
We're not quite happy with the
way everything is working yet.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.310
We're going to continue to
tweak things a little bit.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.620
The last bullet on there
is the most important one,

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:10.400
that is user interface guidelines.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.970
Obviously,
we've made changes from Mac OS 8 and 9,

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:15.630
and therefore those human
interface guidelines don't quite

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.180
cover all of what is new in Aqua.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.780
So we want to update these
guidelines and make them available

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.090
to you as soon as we can.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.040
That's when I want to talk to
you about some of the things

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.400
we have made available to you.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.240
So when we shipped DP3,
we had a document on that

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:38.400
disk that described how to
layout your dialogues for Aqua.

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.660
Now of course,
because we made the change to

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:44.400
platinum size controls in DP4,
we had to rev that document.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.400
So we did.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.400
That's on the disk.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:51.190
And it's got some new information on it
with respect to menu layout on it too.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.330
Available this week.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:54.200
I don't have a URL.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.260
I will get it for you.

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.200
But available this week on our website.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:01.930
We're putting a very preliminary
version of our UI guidelines for Aqua.

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:07.090
This document just covers sheets,
window layering,

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.860
and a discussion of the icon style.

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:12.780
Things we think that are most
important for you to start adopting.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.860
And as we describe guidelines for
all the other features in Aqua,

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:18.400
we're going to make them
available as quickly as we can.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.700
We're not going to wait to rev
a new book every ten years.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.620
We're going to get them out fast.

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.960
So this week what we have
running is what we call the H.I.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.500
Lab.

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:32.680
We have sessions every hour.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.620
It's in room K.

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:37.400
Now unfortunately it's booked solid.

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:40.230
I think there's something in
the order of 17 or 19 sessions

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:41.370
this week they filled up.

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:44.840
What we're asking you to do is put
your name on a sheet and we'll do

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:46.980
our best we can to accommodate you.

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.440
This is a one hour private session
that allows you to come in,

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.540
show us your application,
and myself and members of the

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.380
team will give you feedback.

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:56.380
What we think is worth it.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.030
and what we think is not working.

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:03.340
And finally Friday,
what historically has always been

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:07.770
one of the most fun sessions,
perhaps to if you're asking questions

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.780
but not if you're sitting on the panel,
and that is the feedback forum.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.710
So 2 o'clock Friday, room A1.

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.100
We have the Aqua Feedback
Forum this year.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.920
It's in a big room,
so we can accommodate more people.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:24.110
What I'd like to do at this point
is call John Galenzi back on stage.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.080
John is going to walk through all
the related sessions this week

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:30.660
that you should attend if you
are interested in adopting Aqua.

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.590
John?

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.600
That's what I have,
so thank you very much.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.840
Enjoy your week.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.940
Okay, so we,
I had said in the opening that this

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.690
was all about the design of Aqua and
that later on this week we'd be

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.760
talking about specific implementation
issues and sessions and stuff.

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:00.110
So let me just run through the
roadmap and point you to some of

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:04.170
those sessions that are specifically
focused on particular components

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.630
of Aqua and how to implement them,
etc.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.150
So the first one,
which is real key and really

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:16.080
mirrors this session closely,
is 142 High-Level Toolbox.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.720
Another session that's really
important if you're interested

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.060
in prototyping your application,
seeing what Aqua looks like for

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.270
a new dialog design or whatever
is using Interface Builder.

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:26.910
This is a session for Data Browser.

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:28.140
Data Browser is a component.

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:32.160
It's a high-level control
that allows you basically to,

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:36.760
in a single control,
to present finder-like behavior,

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:41.440
lists that have disclosure
buttons and hierarchical displays.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.570
It's a really great new set of
APIs for doing that kind of thing.

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.830
And if you leverage Data Browser,
you're going to get a lot of the

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:52.200
functionality that users are going
to expect from the finder within

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.800
your own application for lists,
et cetera.

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.800
Another session, 147,
Icon Services and Aqua,

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.930
really talks about designing icons,
new icon APIs,

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:07.810
issues to think about relative
to icons within your application

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.340
and new icon designs.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:15.330
Navigation Services, number 149,
is all about the open and save dialogs,

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:19.710
how to take advantage of those
and do sheets in terms of open

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:21.970
and save within your apps.

00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:23.330
Apple Help.

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:26.680
We didn't really specifically
touch on that in this session,

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.400
but the help for Mac OS X is HTML based.

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:35.110
And the session on Thursday, 145,
Apple Help talks about both from

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.670
a developer's point of view,
how do you implement the

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:40.840
Apple Help APIs within your application,
but also from a content

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.880
developer's point of view,
how do you author HTML help?

00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:47.020
And what are some of the tricks
of the trade in that respect?

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:55.390
Session 144 isn't specifically tied to
Aqua in terms of visual aspects of Aqua,

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:59.640
but it ties into application
packaging and document typing,

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.660
which is a new behavior
under 10 in a sense.

00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.480
It's new.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.050
You need to understand that as
you do your applications on 10,

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:09.500
and there's some tie-ins to Aqua there.

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.780
And then the Aqua Feedback Forum.

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.310
And Don mentioned that.

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:17.600
What's really key about the Aqua Feedback
Forum is you as a developer,

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.500
you're adopting Aqua within your apps,
those issues.

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.730
And if you have issues about, well,
I'm not sure how this is going to work,

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:24.710
and what about this?

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:26.210
Have you guys thought about this?

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.350
That's the kind of
feedback we're looking for.

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.070
So it's really developer
adoption issues relative to Aqua.

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:33.160
So we look forward to you input there.

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:38.000
Specifically,
who to contact at Apple to get

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.480
more information about Aqua?

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.140
I'm going to start at the bottom,
first of all, with the email address,

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.500
MacHI at Apple.com.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.090
That's an email address
that's monitored by myself,

00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:49.620
by the human interface team,
the Aqua design team,

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.200
and a couple other people.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.330
And really,
if you've got developer adoption issues,

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:57.540
or you've got some feedback
you'd like to give us on DB4,

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:01.130
as requested by Don,
please send it to that email address.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.080
There's another general discussion list,
which is Apple HI,

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.600
Developer Adoption Issues.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:05.600
And if you've got any questions,
please send it to us at db4.com.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.280
And we have other developers
at public.lists.apple.com.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.430
So that's just a general discussion
forum for you to talk about Aqua issues

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:18.920
and get other developers giving you
some insight into issues around Aqua.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.260
And then sort of,
I'm going through the list backwards.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.770
The last one, but first on this list,
is myself.

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:29.410
My role here at Apple is
User Experience Technology Manager,

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:33.060
which means I'm really a broker
of information between Apple and

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.880
yourselves as developers,
but also because I'm a developer.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.120
So I'm really a broker of
information between you and Apple.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.220
So as you work through DB4,
and as you work to bring your

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.840
applications to 10 and do the
right thing with Aqua and deliver

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.270
a really awesome user experience,
you may run into issues with

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.130
the APIs that exist or whatever.

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.620
And I'm really a good point of
contact to come into Apple and say,

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.960
hey, what about this?

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.060
This is our issue.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:56.420
This is our situation.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:59.180
Can you bring this to the
HI team or to the high-level

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.390
toolbox team or what have you?

01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:03.860
And so really use me as that resource.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.880
And the other thing I can do
is work with you to understand

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:05.880
the issues that you're having.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:09.910
So I can help you understand Aqua and
help review your applications from

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:13.370
a user experience point of view
and help you determine whether

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:17.030
you're doing things the right way,
using the right metaphors.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:18.970
Are you internally consistent?

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:23.060
All these sorts of HI-related things,
I'm also a resource for that.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.620
So that's pretty much it for Session 140,
Aqua Overview.

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.370
Thank you for your attention,
and we look forward to

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:30.920
awesome apps on Mac OS X.
