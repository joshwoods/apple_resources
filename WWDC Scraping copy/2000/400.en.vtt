WEBVTT

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.300
So the three things I wanted
to cover with you today.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.970
The first of all is WebObjects and Apple,
where WebObjects fits

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.760
into the Apple family.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.320
Secondly, where WebObjects is today,
or I should say yesterday,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.910
and where we're going today
and tomorrow moving forward.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.940
So as Steve mentioned
at Macworld in New York,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.880
Apple has always been known for being
the world's best personal computers,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.720
for having a really great
killer desktop platform.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.020
But in today's age of the internet,
we really want to be

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.920
thinking outside of the box.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.760
And so why a lot of what we do,
particularly with Mac OS X,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.140
is focused around the desktop,
there's a lot of things we do that

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.040
are focused on the internet platform,
things like the QuickTime,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.540
like streaming, like HTML web design,
and so forth, Mac OS X Server and other

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.060
products in that family.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.580
And what we've done is
really taken WebObjects and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.500
made it our internet engine.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.410
We think WebObjects is the best
tool for developing and deploying

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.240
applications on the internet.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.960
It's a powerful engine to
interactively deliver internet content,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.340
whether it's HTML, PDF, movies, Java,
anything you vend over the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.260
internet can be supercharged by
having Web Objects underneath it.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.000
Another way of looking at that,
it's a smart way to bring your

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.060
applications to the internet.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.780
How many of you have done any
sort of client server development?

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.880
Okay, for a handful of you,
a lot of you probably have,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.210
how many of you currently
have applications that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.990
never talk to anything else?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Everybody has to talk to something,
whether it's a local data store,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
whether it's other applications,
whether it's web servers,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030
whether it's to get updates,
whether it's to get new content,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.000
whether it's to send customer
registration information back and forth.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.110
WebObjects is now an incredibly
powerful way to build this

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.000
relationship with your customer to your
application to you over the internet.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.520
internet.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.460
And this is also what Apple has
done with WebObjects ourselves.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.770
It is our internet engine.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.300
It is the system that powers
our internet strategy,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.670
whether it's the Apple Store, Apple.com,
iTools, iCards,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.220
the Developer Connection website.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.900
All these things are
powered using WebObjects.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.600
And we've known it's a great tool.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.820
The top 3,000 customers in the largest
websites in the world know that this is

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.250
a great and powerful and awesome tool.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.690
But we want to make sure that you
all can take advantage of it as well.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.020
For those of you who aren't very familiar
with WebObjects and the technology,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.900
let me just give you a real
quick summary of how it works.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.960
A traditional web server
just takes static HTML pages

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.900
and bends them to a client.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.910
But often you have other data
sources you want to use to bring

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.900
to your customers rather than them
to hardwire everything into HTML.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.890
Mainframes, databases, ERP systems,
directory services, etc.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.170
What WebObjects does is
take all the information,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.900
feeds it into an application server
that manages and massages the object,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.990
and uses that to dynamically
generate HTML pages,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.900
or equivalently Java,
which can then be vended to any client.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.870
Because it's a fully scalable,
what's called a three-tier system,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.000
you can easily add new application
servers into the mix and dynamically

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.900
create a very highly scalable,
robust,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.090
fault-tolerant web application service.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.340
WebObjects has been the
industry-leading application server.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.040
It allows scalable deployment
on a number of platforms,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.340
has a very powerful,
rich set of graphical development tools,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.700
which not only allow code-free
development like you saw this morning,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.990
but also very powerful in-depth
customization because of a

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.310
very rich public API building
on top of extremely powerful,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.730
well-tested objects.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.730
And these allow you to connect to
basically any kind of structured data,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.390
whether it's a database,
directory service,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.200
materials management system, et cetera.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.730
And the benefits of this are threefold.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.510
First of all, you get incredible
productivity with WebObjects,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.500
up to ten times faster than traditional
alternative development tools.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.450
We have a fully integrated
suite of development tools,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.700
so we're planning on supercharging
even more going forward.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.640
We've really learned a lot
of lessons in the last,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.400
you know, this code base is built
on the old Next Step,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.700
Open Step, DBKit technology.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.450
It's been around since the early '90s,
longer than any other tool in this class.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.900
And our team has really
learned a lot of lessons,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.480
as we've done various
generations of this project,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.760
to make sure we have a very powerful
object-oriented architecture,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.500
something that's very
difficult to build properly,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.360
but we've got more experience than
probably anybody else in the world.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.480
Secondly, it has very powerful
integration services.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.720
You can store your data pretty much
anywhere and access it in a single

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.110
application on a single client,
talking to a multitude of different data

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.500
services of all sorts of different types.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.500
And it's a very high-performance solution
used to run things like the Apple Store,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.470
multi-threaded,
multiple instances on a single system.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.150
Also, it can be transferred from
a Mac OS X service system

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.450
all the way up to high-end,
multi-CPU, Solaris and HP boxes.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.000
So, just to give you a quick summary
of where we are with the currently

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
shipping versions of WebObjects,
we really feel like we've

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.340
had the best technology,
the coolest solutions,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.100
and a totally awesome business.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.100
The technology that we released
this March was WebObjects 4.5,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.280
which we believe is smarter, easier,
and even more interoperable than

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.030
previous generations of WebObjects.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.230
The system's a lot smarter in its ability
to analyze and report performance issues,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.100
to manage reconnects and
failures to your database.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.640
It's easier than ever to
develop solutions using the

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.180
new direct-to-Java client,
as well as a redesigned

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.100
WebObjects builder for creating
dynamic HTML components,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.800
and even more interoperable
by including great support for

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.350
parsing and integrating XML data,
as well as connecting with

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.090
directory services such as LDAP.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.100
WebObjects has continued a
huge streak of winning awards,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.220
most recently a CODI from
the Software and

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.100
Information Industry Association for
Best Application Development Tool,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.100
Best Application Software,
and a great application server

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.100
from Java's Developer Journal.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.100
This is the 1999
Java Developer's Journal.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.100
Our developers haven't been quite as
aggressive this year with the voting.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.500
Feel free to join in if you agree
with me that this is a very cool

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.100
tool that deserves to be recognized.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.370
And then we also won the
Software Product of the Year from

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.400
Network Computing for being
very well connected and also

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.100
being a great application server.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.100
So we've got a huge list of awards.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.860
They're all on the website.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.080
It gets almost tedious
to recite them all.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.100
But a lot of people have learned
that this is a great tool.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.100
And one of the reasons it's so
great is because it's a great tool

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.100
for the development of software.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.890
And one of the reasons it's
so great is because we really

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.100
believe in industry standards.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.100
We've deployed a host
of different systems.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.970
We support a multitude
of different languages.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.180
We integrate with a whole slew of
different development technologies,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.870
whether it's scripting languages
or C++ or data formats such as XML.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.860
And we have data adapters
to most SQL databases,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.820
LDAP, CORBA, DCOM,
with a variety of third

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.100
parties that provide a wealth
of connectivity solutions.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.100
And the customers today read
like a top 100 list of the web.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.910
You've heard all the names: BBC,
Consumers Digest, Disney, AAA, Logistics,

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.100
US Web, Adobe, the US Postal Service.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.450
These are all just very highly
demanding companies that really

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.100
need a very powerful solution
with very rapid time to market.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.090
And they found WebObjects the
perfect solution for their needs.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.840
In order to reach--and we have
a couple of quotes here from

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.100
people who've really leveraged
the dynamic HTML creation process,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.100
integration with CORBA and
Java-compatible architectures.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.910
architectures,
and the list goes on and on and on.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.820
We have a number of incredibly
talented partners that really make

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.680
the WebObjects technology come alive
and map to your business solutions,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:37.540
whether that's for HTML design tools,
databases, reporting tools,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.230
integration with PDF and
other technologies.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.190
We have hundreds of developers who
have been working very closely with

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.090
us for years to rebuild robust,
flexible solutions,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.740
customized to different vertical markets.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.740
This has really paid off.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.720
We have been first to market in
the web application server space.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.900
We essentially created it several years
ago with the first version of WebObjects.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.900
The last time they've run the numbers,
we were number one in market share.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.900
We have a phenomenal gross
margin and double-digit growth.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.520
We've just been really
pleased with the business,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.900
and it's really due to an awesome team.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.820
WebObjects has had a dedicated
sales force focused exclusively

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.820
around these types of high-end
enterprise class solutions.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.450
We have a whole army of trained
consultants who are extremely

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.890
knowledgeable and passionate
about these solutions.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.890
A very sophisticated training program,
which you'll see on your demo CD,

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.370
some of the fruits of that,
as well as a worldwide network of

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.980
resellers and a very talented and
focused engineering group that,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.900
as we say, has been doing object-oriented
development for hundreds of man years.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.240
But to just give you a taste of where
we are just today with WebObjects,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.540
I've asked Andreas Venkar from the
rapid deployment team of WebObjects

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.400
to give a walk-through of the
demo that you saw this morning.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.390
Was everyone here at the keynote today?

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.400
Yeah.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.370
You like it?

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.770
Okay.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.030
I'll try and go through it
a little bit more slowly,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.400
so you can get a better idea of what
it was that we did during the keynote.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.400
Why don't you start with the
direct HTML connection there.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.190
This is a traditional WebObjects
application that WebObjects

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.230
3.5 or WebObjects 4.0 developer
would be comfortable with.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.550
WebObjects 4.0,
we introduced a new technology

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.060
called direct to web,
which basically allows you to

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.590
very quickly step through a
database and just say these are

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.390
the various fields I care about.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.360
Give me a user interface
that's built on that.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.670
You get a very nice, simple, clean,
elegant looking HTML based user

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.400
interface with a different pop-up.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.380
You can pop up buttons and search fields.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.400
You can search on a field, do a query,
pull back a detail, etc.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.400
It's very nice and simple and very
quick and easy to get up and running,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.400
but it's a very limited interface.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.790
It looks like you're running
on something that's a notch or

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.810
two above a TN3270 terminal,
but doesn't really have the

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.400
look and feel of a modern,
rich operating system.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.580
It doesn't really leverage all the
power you have sitting with a G3

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.400
or G4 processor on your desktop.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.390
We looked at this and we said, "Well,
this is kind of nice." But this is WWDC.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.400
This is Steve Jobs we're talking about.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.400
We can't have him showing this.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400
We need something really sexier.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.400
So they said, "Well, okay,
give me a few minutes.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.030
Let me see what I can
throw together." And so,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.400
"Okay, Andreas, you have a few minutes.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.800
Let's see what you can throw together."
So this is the new project builder

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.400
that's available as part of DP4.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.400
We've custom hacked it
to support WebObjects.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.400
The version you have on DP4 today
does not yet support WebObjects.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.400
It will very soon.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.400
But we just pick an assistant there,
in this case the direct to Java client,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.390
which is a new technology.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.390
It was introduced in
WebObjects 4.5 in March.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.400
We just give it a name.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.360
So it's a database model.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.630
And this is really the hardest
job if you're managing a database

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.400
application is understanding your model.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.350
What are your relationships?

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.400
What are the important schema?

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.280
But once you create that model
using the knowledge of the database,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.560
WebObjects makes it really easy
to take that information and turn

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.400
it into a dynamic application.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.320
It uses very sophisticated heuristics
to determine what are the primary

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.390
tables in that database which
need to be rendered differently.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.400
And you just go ahead and build it.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.070
And basically it creates a very
simple shell server application

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.340
which then talks to a very
simple shell client application.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.400
So you saw the code.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.400
There's basically three or four lines
of code and mostly they just say,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.560
"Hi, I'm running now." All the work is
taken care of by the frameworks that

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.400
are already built into WebObjects.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400
So you can start here and just
build this application very quickly.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.340
And then you launch a
generic Java client.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.340
This is something they can download
from the web or you can have one

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.400
client pre-installed on a machine.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.380
So what you basically have to do is add
a URL telling which server it talks to.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.280
It connects to the server.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.220
The server knows, "Okay,
this client I can tell this

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.400
information to." It generates
the XML describing the data.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.400
That client dynamically renders
that into a user interface,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.400
adjusts the sizes and widths of things
so they fit reasonably on a page.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400
And as you see, they're all alphabetized.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400
This isn't a hand-tuned thing.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.400
This is just how it comes out straight
from the directory Java client.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:57.400
Very powerful technology leveraging
the power of Java and Aqua on Mac OS X.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.350
You can do a search.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.400
You can bring up a detail view.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.400
And we also do a little bit of work
to integrate a QuickTime movie view

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.270
into the directory Java application.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.400
It's something that you can do using the
QuickTime for Java clients available.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.480
And... There are things I can do.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.850
So you see here Queen Amadella
meditating in deep thought about

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.280
the destruction of her world.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.700
And that's the web--and there it is,
in five minutes,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.080
a complete direct-to-web job application.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.080
Thank you, Andreas.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.100
And like they say,
you don't have to take my word for it.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.670
You can go home with the WebObjects
4.5 technology that we've given to

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.280
you in the developer's backpack,
run on Mac OS X server or Windows NT,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.760
and be able to immediately get up and
running with WebObjects and build an

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.860
application just like that yourself.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.010
I don't think that the Java in
Mac OS X is quite up to

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.080
snuff with what we have here,
but you probably even get a basic

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.710
Java application running today on
top of Mac OS X DP4 and get a little

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.150
feel for what that looks like.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.440
So this is really, really cool, awesome,
and powerful technology,

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.560
but we wanted to go so much
further than we have in the past.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.120
And so we really set
ourselves three goals.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.040
And the biggest area is really trying
to make this a lower barrier to entry.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.870
A lot of people who really love
WebObjects see it as incredibly cool,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.520
but you work in the
$1,000 application space,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.210
or you do a one-person small
consulting shop for small businesses

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.580
that can't afford a $50,000 server.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.070
How can you take advantage of this power
to deliver really cool applications

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.620
or websites for your customers?

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.610
So we're focusing on making
the technology more accessible,

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.220
expanding the array of
solutions available,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.320
and creating a whole new
business model for driving this

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.410
really into the mainstream.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.910
So to start talking
about the new technology,

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.460
I've asked Tony Trujillo-Villan,
the director of WebObjects Engineering,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:53.820
to share a few words about the
upcoming version of WebObjects.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.810
Want me to run this?

00:13:59.010 --> 00:13:59.990
Thanks, Ernie.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.440
So as you heard earlier in the keynote,
Steve mentioned we have a new

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.620
release coming out later this year,
and we are calling it WebObjects

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.850
5 for Java for a good reason.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.900
We're going to be translating our
frameworks into 100% pure Java.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.010
We believe this will help you guys
and make the product more usable by

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.900
Java developers at a first glance.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.890
You can deploy it anywhere.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.040
And I'd like to announce
that we're now going to be

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.480
qualifying the product on Linux.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.800
We're also going to be including
a JDBC for Universal Database

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:50.160
Connectivity and some inoperability
standards for the internet.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.240
Sorry.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.470
We'll be talking more about
Enterprise Java Beans and

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.330
XML later on in the week,
so please make sure you

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.370
join us at those sessions.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.940
So as you heard and as you saw
earlier today that we're going

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.790
to be optimizing for Mac OS X,
Ernie mentioned that the CD that you

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.950
have in your backpacks doesn't work on X,
but the product that

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.900
we're working on now,
when released, it will work on X.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.700
And you'll see the Aqua user
interface in that release.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.960
We'll also be using the new project
builder that you saw in the demo.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.540
And we have a couple more exciting
opportunities in the future.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:30.750
We'll be working with AppleScript and
network info directory services.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.680
So with that, I'd like to invite Francois
Joop to give a demo.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.450
Hi, everyone.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.360
Hi everyone,
my name is Francois Jouaux and I'm

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:58.690
going to present you this WebObjects for
Java version that we call WebObjects 5.0.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.970
Okay, so, well,
guess what OS we are running here.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.170
Any guess?

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.930
No, not NT.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.300
We have a Linux box here.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.390
We have a Mac OS X server box here,
which is actually being displayed.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:19.860
And we are going to take one example
out of the box from WebObjects

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.790
5.0 and run it on both machines.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.480
So, run.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.300
Here, my charming assistant, run.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.060
Upload.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.520
We'll try the create plot example.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.620
So, as you see,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.280
We can run WebObjects
Java out of Project Builder.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.900
So WebObjects Java is
compatible with WebObjects 4.5.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.760
It lives side by side with it,
and the same Project Builder is used.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:17:00.090
So Ron will compile the application,
which is a 4.5 example that

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:01.940
we have translated to Java.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.220
"The application is running now on my
QuestN server and I'm going to access

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.230
it through the browser which is here."

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:18.300
Okay, so this is actually an interesting
example because it has a small

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.830
graphic engine underneath that
enables it to draw some graphs.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.140
For example, here we have a pie chart.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.170
I can type whatever I want.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:39.600
[Transcript missing]

00:17:44.400 --> 00:18:09.500
[Transcript missing]

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.530
So, as you know, Java,
you build once and you run anywhere.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.680
Well, it is true as well for
WebObjects or Java,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.740
and this is the reason
why we're moving there.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:31.020
So Ron is our Linux guru,
and he knows pretty well

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.600
the tar command too.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:44.080
Okay, so could you please switch
to machine number two?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.050
So you see this is Linux running X.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:54.390
And we are doing the FTP.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:26.700
[Transcript missing]

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:37.220
Okay, so the package has been
tarred up and moved.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.210
Okay, here in red, demo.tar.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.520
Both of these OS have Unix as a base,
so the same command can

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.330
be used to enter it.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.310
So here's something very interesting.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.400
We do not support yet Linux in
our pre-alpha release,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:09.380
so we have to fake our licensing so
that the Java VM believes it's Solaris

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.520
so that our licensing key can work.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.880
So now the licensing check
passed and the app is ready.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.970
We can show you.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.240
Okay,
so the app is running now on Linux and

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.800
it's actually the exact same application.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.770
There is not much more I can say,
except I can go back

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.020
to the statistics page.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.600
Oops, we have an exception.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.520
That's okay, actually.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.800
I wanted to show you the exception.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.480
So you see here we have the
backtrace of the exception is

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.980
actually rendered in the browser.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.870
And if we switch back to
the machine number three,

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:11.980
please.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.200
[Transcript missing]

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:43.000
[Transcript missing]

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.580
Ron is a quality engineer with us,
so it's a challenge for him

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.980
to introduce a bug in an app.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.450
He's used to finding them.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.180
I'm good at introducing bugs.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.610
So he's now typing

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.040
A very ugly bug, actually.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.950
A null pointer exception,
and he will run the application again.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:07.880
So I'm going to click on the right link.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.990
Hopefully you'll see another
case of this exception.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.820
Okay, so the same app come up,
but if run did well,

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.610
when I click on Update Graph,
I'm going to get an exception.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.100
Well, here it is.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:34.320
Now, you see that you get a backtrace
with the first line being in your

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.600
code and a clickable link here.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.660
If I click on the link,
watch what happens here.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.550
You get straight to the
line in Project Builder

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.780
where the exception occurs.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.010
So, not only is bad in moving to Java,
and that's a great example of a

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.790
better development environment.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:57.880
Thank you.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.720
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.660
Can you bring the Linux-- actually,
put back the-- with the Mac OS X on that

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.320
screen and the Linux on that screen?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.860
Can you do that?

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.150
Or bring the Linux on the other screen?

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.580
Number two?

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.850
Mac OS X's idea of Unix,
the rest of the world's idea of Unix.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.300
Gotta love it.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.490
Thanks,
you can go back to the slides now.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.550
So we have this incredibly
powerful technology,

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.110
which is really getting
out in the mainstream.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.080
But it's still incredibly sophisticated.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.490
And one of the things that people
have often accused Apple of is

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.880
creating simplistic toy machines,
things that look cute or look pretty,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.380
but are underpowered,
don't really scale to really

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.420
great complicated solutions.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.640
And with Mac OS X and WebObjects,
I think we're really bringing a whole

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.600
different world to answer that problem.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.920
As you can see, we do have all the power
of Unix underneath.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.920
We have a heck of a lot
more than that on top,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.980
which is really accessible for the
ordinary user to accept and enjoy as

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.680
if it was just a traditional Macintosh.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.080
Just as you see with WebObjects,
you have incredibly powerful

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.120
and simple to use tools that a
relatively unsophisticated developer

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.120
can get up to speed on very quickly.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.980
But there's still a lot of depth in all
the Unix and all the interaction of the

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.840
sophisticated tools going on in the back.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.640
So one of the things we needed
to do is figure out how do we

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.200
make sure that our customers,
our partners,

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.180
can really tap all the power that exists
within the WebObjects and Mac OS X.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.660
And because of that,
we introduced a whole new

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.720
initiative called Apple iServices.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.460
And I'm pleased to
announce Scott Anderson,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.670
the new director of Apple iServices,
here to tell you more about it.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.550
Please welcome Scott.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.000
Thanks Ernie.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.390
I can't tell you how excited I am to
see four or five hundred people in one

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.670
room here to talk about WebObjects.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.400
This is truly a great day for our
product and I'm incredibly proud

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.180
of what the company's been able
to do and the decisions we've been

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.290
able to make around the technology.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.230
Just to put this in context,
I've been with Apple for three years.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.800
Been prior to Apple with
Next for almost seven years.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.900
So this to me is a culmination
of a lot of events.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.210
And to come out of the gates with a
pricing strategy that's as aggressive

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.040
as it is and a business strategy
for my organization that I think

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.950
is compelling is really exciting.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.160
So before I start,
I didn't see the show of

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.440
hands earlier in the session.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.100
How many people are currently
using WebObjects in the audience?

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.900
Great.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:49.690
And how many people here are familiar
with Apple Enterprise Software?

00:25:50.200 --> 00:26:53.000
[Transcript missing]

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.370
becomes Apple iServices.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:57.740
Okay?

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.810
Apple iServices,
if we go back in history,

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.040
what did AES do?

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.940
AES sold WebObjects and delivered
services to the business

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.790
and enterprise marketplace.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.700
Today, effective May 15th,
Apple iServices is dedicated

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.490
to delivering custom solutions
through our consulting,

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.710
integration, training,
and support services.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:28:42.000
[Transcript missing]

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.650
I want to talk a little
bit about our partners.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.190
Today we really have three types of
partners within the old construct of AES.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:53.300
We have the Enterprise Alliance Program,
we have Solution Providers,

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.300
and we have Systems Integrators.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.280
The EAP program,
which many of you may be members of,

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.590
is really a developer program
focused around WebObjects,

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.300
providing support services and
training as well as product.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.970
That program will be transitioned
over into Apple's worldwide developer

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.960
relations programs and we'll be
communicating with our EAP members

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.260
over the next 30 to 45 days as to
what that transition looks like.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.750
We've also got a suite
of solution providers,

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:23.100
folks who take WebObjects and
build vertical market solutions

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.300
around the technology and take
that technology to market.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.480
And we have Systems Integrators,
folks who are in the business

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.300
of delivering custom solutions,
who build domain expertise in the product

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.220
and go out and help solve problems.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.670
And I'm hoping, frankly,
that amongst this group of developers

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:42.870
in the audience today and participants
in the conference in general,

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:47.230
there will be a tremendous increase in
Apple developers who embrace the product

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.280
and build solutions using WebObjects.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:54.230
So I'm hoping you'll all be part
of the program moving forward.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.940
I think there's tremendous opportunity.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.950
We're looking at the possibility
of extending our business model

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:05.100
to include components and reusable
frameworks as part of our services play.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.480
We're also looking at programs to
encourage vertical market applications.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.280
We have app vendors today who
deliver solutions into everything

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.450
from litigation support to logistics
to e-commerce applications.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:21.480
And by decreasing the barrier
of entry and eliminating the

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.400
price point on deployment,
I'm really hoping that there will

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.240
be a tremendous amount of increased
participation in the program.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.610
And lastly, I really hope that with our
support as Apple iServices,

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.600
product marketing,
as well as worldwide developer relations,

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.500
we can collectively work with the
app vendors to create solutions that

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:38.500
are more accessible to the community.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.820
We can collectively work with the
Apple developer community and build

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.280
a real strong sense of community,
attract a larger suite of

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.980
developers to the platform,
and have a bunch of solutions

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.520
out there that address specific
market needs that we haven't

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.500
been able to touch in the past.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.460
So at a very high level,
that's a little bit about AIS.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.500
We'll be here later on to answer any
questions you might happen to have.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.500
Ernie?

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.530
Ernie White Thank you very much, Scott.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.870
One of the great things about having
Apple iServices on board is that

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.940
often there's this Beltway effect.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.890
When you're in a small community
and you hear things a certain way,

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.900
it's easy to get locked
into a certain mindset.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.440
The Apple iServices people are out
in the field facing all the same

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.710
challenges you do as developers,
trying to figure out

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.900
what's going on from Apple,
what the directions are,

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.900
what the support they
have available there.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.380
And they're an incredibly valuable
resource for us to understand

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.830
what are the issues that you as
developers in the field face.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.970
So we're looking forward to this
new focus to be able to partner more

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.900
closely with them to really appreciate
and understand developer concerns

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.900
and make sure we have the right
solutions in place for you to succeed

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.890
in meeting the needs of your customers.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.900
So that's kind of the whole new world
that we're trying to open up with.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.150
And then my job in product marketing
is trying to take that great

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.100
technology and bring it out to these
people in the field so they can

00:31:59.100 --> 00:31:59.900
build really compelling solutions.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.900
So there's a number of things
we're doing to make that happen.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.280
This is the standard piece
that people who have gone to

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.840
marketing school learn about.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.900
So this is the packaging, pricing,
promotion, etc.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.890
Let me just kind of walk through
that real quickly for you.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.930
Historically,
there were two different products

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.860
you would buy for WebObjects.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.910
One was a developer product.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:20.910
Oops, that seems to have...

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.540
"Developer product, a deployment product,
and we're basically taking those two

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.530
and putting them into a single box,
which is both developer and deployment.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.560
Now previously the
developer tools cost $14.99,

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.600
deployments started at $7,500
and went up to $50,000.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:42.570
We have taken the $50,000
product and the $14.99 product,

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:46.810
put them into a single product,
costing $699."

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.110
And this isn't like the $4.99 or the
$99 product that you sometimes get

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.180
from other developers when they do
a low-end version of their product,

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.540
which doesn't have database access
or doesn't allow you to load,

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.610
balance, or share.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.050
This is the full $50,000 product
in this little pretty box.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.900
We had to work pretty hard
to squeeze it in there,

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:12.910
but it did fit.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.070
And this is affecting not
just future going products,

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:20.570
but today's products,
WebObjects 4.0.1 and WebObjects 4.5,

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:21.740
and it's effective immediately.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.200
Go to the Apple store after this session.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.940
It should be up there.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.780
You can download and buy it today.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.510
We're very excited to be able to
really make this available to a

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.740
whole bunch of different customers
who never would have seen it before.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:37.270
We're also really expanding the
channel used to access this technology.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.720
It's no longer just a niche
thing for an enterprise business.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.180
If you want to build a
WebObjects application,

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.970
there's a couple of options.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.860
One, it'll be available to all
Apple resellers who want to carry it.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.060
They'll probably most likely
be high-end resellers,

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.860
your Fri's, your value-added resellers,
your specialty integrators,

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.600
Apple solution experts.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:57.960
But anyone who works in there,
who wants to carry it, can carry it,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.120
as well as having it available
worldwide on the Apple Store.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.140
We're also working to make it very
easy to bundle with your applications.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.780
If you have a high-end
web publishing solution,

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.480
you can either tell your people to
buy it through their normal channels,

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:13.620
or we'll make it available for you to
deploy along with your application.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.230
So you can get a serial number and the
right to copy the software to install on

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.770
your CDs and make it available to your
customers without having to go through

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.670
the hassle of an additional channel,
an additional installation.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.600
We're still finalizing the application.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.600
We're not going to go
into the details of that,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.800
but our goal is to make it really
easy and really transparent

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.850
to you and your customers.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.700
So if you want to build a really
powerful application that just happens to

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:36.740
include a $50,000 web server underneath,
you can charge them $50,000 and

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:37.980
pocket the profit for yourself.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:37:48.800

00:37:49.400 --> 00:39:06.100
[Transcript missing]

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.800
For more information,
there's a huge wad of

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.840
information available to you.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.930
There is the new WebObjects website,
which has been redesigned to

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.740
reflect the new announcements today.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.690
We have a WebObjects lab
available downstairs,

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.340
available every day over the lunch hour.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.200
Go down there,
play with WebObjects 4 or 5,

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:26.800
try and build a
direct-to-Java application.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.410
Get some feel for what this is and try to
think about how this might benefit your

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.980
customers or your development technology.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.550
You all have a WebObjects 4 or 5
evaluation CD with some wonderful

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:40.670
movies and demos included to help you
get a taste for what WebObjects can do,

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.600
as well as some of the training
and other resources available.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.290
We're also announcing the
WebObjects Community BoF.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.160
We have a huge,
vast wealth of partners who have been

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.010
working with the platform for years,
who know a lot.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.870
Some of them offer consulting services.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.420
Some of them offer training services.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:58.390
Some of them have some very
cool specialty applications,

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.260
which might inspire you
in what you're doing.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.880
They're all going to be there,
having their PowerBooks and iBooks.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.300
Hopefully, they'll show you some of
the cool things going on.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.440
We'll just get together and hang out
for an hour and a half Wednesday.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.340
We arranged to get the Civic Auditorium,
because we didn't have enough room

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:12.660
for the rest of you anywhere else.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.980
Across the street, that huge building,
maybe we'll pack that out as well,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.940
as we're doing here.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.030
Be sure to come by and bring a friend.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.080
And if you have technical questions
during the course of this week,

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:29.190
there's a woefeedback@group.apple.com
address where you can ask

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.780
questions about WWDC sessions.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.800
This is not a general
tech support question,

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.410
but if there's something that was
covered in a session that wasn't

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.390
clear or you don't know where to go
next to find out more information,

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:43.400
feel free to send email to that
technical woefeedback email address.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.440
And the second line is supposed
to be WebObjects@group.apple.com,

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.990
which is the marketing
address for my team,

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.200
which is currently just me,
but I'm working on hiring some

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.710
more people to help me take up
the load because we've got some

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.840
really great things planned,
and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
