WEBVTT

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.580
>> Hello and thank you for coming to WWDC.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.079
First off I want to say wow, this is a lot of people.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.349
I didn't expect this much.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.300
So, thank you for coming to this session.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.780
This is a session on learning to
become an effective System Admin.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.760
I'll be discussing about the concept of
shifting between the Admin to the SysAdmin.

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:38.759
How do you as an individual do your job better?

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:44.369
So, things I'm going to be covering are an
introduction, describe who I am, why I'm here,

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:52.609
why I'm talking to you guys I'm going to discuss how do
you scale the SysAdmin and how to go beyond the GUI.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.049
We'll wrap all this up with a whole bunch
of Q and A. If you'll do me a favor,

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.869
if you have any questions save them to the end.

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.259
I believe there are some microphones that
are around the isles and around the back.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:06.759
At the end feel free to stand up in front of the
microphones to answer any of those questions you may have.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.160
Before I go much further I want to do
one thing and set some expectations here.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.069
This was a session that I came up with and I
think is very valuable here for Apple Computer.

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.139
I want to start out by saying a lot
of the content that's going to be

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.640
in this session is targeted towards 10.4 even
though this is WWDC and we have a lot about Leopard.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.890
This session will empower you today when you
walk out of this session so you can do more.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.219
The other expectation I'd like to set for everybody
here is this is going to be content for individuals

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.049
that are either junior Admins, senior Admins
have been working with Microsoft Windows,

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.379
or people that have been working with even Mac OS 9 and
are still trying to cross that bridge into Mac OS X.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:02:00.289
Can I have hands real quick, how many people
are still running Mac OS 9 in the audience?

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.410
How many people are Microsoft Windows
that are new to the Macintosh platform?

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.960
How many are not new to the Macintosh platform
but still have a handful of computers?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.090
Okay. Even if you are a senior Admin, if I can ask, if
you please stay, one of the important things that I try

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.879
to communicate in this session that I'm going to go over is the
discussion that even if some of this content might be review

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.490
for you that is really important
for the resources are your peers.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.510
I'll get back to this at the end of my session.

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:35.229
So, even if you find that some of this stuff might be a
little junior for you, please stay there's stills stuff

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.739
that I think will be valuable for you guys.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.980
So without further ado, who am I?

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.659
My name is Fred Licht.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.310
I'm a system engineer at Apple computer.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.159
I maintain upwards of 170 servers for Apple's IT department.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:58.099
I've been everything from your Mac support guy to the
Mac Admin to the Mac SysAdmin throughout my entire career.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:04.739
I've been and Admin for 13 years and I've been
a SysAdmin for about half that amount of time.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.640
One of the things I want to discuss is what's the
difference between the Mac Admin and the Mac SysAdmin?

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:16.709
There's been a lot of terminology and people have
connotations of what that means in the real world.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.020
A Mac Admin is someone that maintains maybe
a whole bunch of individual workstations,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.310
who may have a handful of Mac OS X servers.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.699
But, they're not integrated.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.989
And they want to automate things,
empower things, do things better.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:40.110
So, as a Mac SysAdmin you then become empowered
to be able to automate steps to, excuse me,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.790
to be able to automate the steps to be able
to integrate all the different systems,

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:46.829
and more importantly be able to do more with less.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.520
So, one of the things I'll discuss in this
presentation is how to make some of that transition.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.380
Before I go much further, I don't know if any of
you've necessarily been around in the days of 10.3

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.509
but there was a little teaser movie
in the technical training department.

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.479
There was a guy that said.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.060
Hi my name's Fred and I'm an Apples
certified technical coordinator.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.879
If you guys saw that little teaser, officially speaking
I'm an Apple certified technical system administrator.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.430
So, some of you may happen to know this picture off hand.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.310
So, I've been a private consultant.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.129
I've worked at Apple as SysAdmin.

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:20.680
I've worked as an Admin.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.410
So, I'm here today to show you things that I've learned

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.400
and encountered throughout my experience
evolving into a Macintosh SysAdmin.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:36.109
So, before we go too much further, two of the terms
that I'd like to bring out here, one is the consumer.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.930
Everyone is sort of aware of what the consumer is.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.060
That's the target audience the
Macintosh generally is made for.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.610
Another one that I'd like to come up with is a
new term that I'd like to put out into the public.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.170
It's called the Office-umer.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.100
We are all aware that whenever you support someone
at the home if their computer's not working

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.040
and it's down for four hours the worse case
is that their computers down for four hours.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.439
In an office environment that's not the same thing.

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:04.569
In an office environment of the computer is down for an
hour that's an individual that's not doing their job.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.959
So, the way you support an Office-umer is very
different than how you support your consumer.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:14.349
So, I will be referencing this term
further along the lines in my presentation.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.030
Before I get into discussing the theory of how you can be
a more effective SysAdmin, there's some one liners that I'd

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:28.469
like to discuss with you guys that I think will be very
valuable in your role as being an Admin or a SysAdmin.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:36.310
And the first one is solve social problems
socially and solve technical problems technically.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.100
What do I mean by that?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:45.150
Well, if you are having a problem with your web server
provider and their systems are constantly going offline.

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:49.919
Is it worthwhile for you to build servers,
bring them in, house, support them yourself,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.620
become liable, and take care of those systems?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.480
Maybe. But, maybe the real answer
is to address the real problem.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.569
The real problem being that the ISP is not doing their job.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.279
Solve your problem, social problems socially.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.989
Don't solve them with technology.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.629
You'll find that as much as you put them in place
it is a little bit of a false sense of confidence.

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:16.079
It doesn't mean stop doing that, just
remember solve the social problem socially.

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:18.829
Another one that's really important, we're all IT people.

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:24.039
And we all understand that if a server had to be rebuilt
that could take a day, two days recover from back up.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.950
It can take a lot of time.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:31.229
There's a lot of people outside of the IT departments
that don't understand how long it takes to be able to set

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.430
up a Mac OS X server or rebuild a mail system.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.819
So the important thing to apply whenever you consider
anything with your IT job is that metrics equal proof.

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:46.110
Make sure that your tools, your systems, whatever
you've implemented include a way of gauging them.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.220
How good or poorly they are working whether or not it's

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.020
to communicate outside your IT department
or with others within your department.

00:06:54.069 --> 00:07:01.719
So, scaling, as a SysAdmin, there's a whole bunch
of different areas that you can be more effective.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.180
I can sit here for hours and just discuss
how to be more effective in many ways.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.949
So, I'm going to scale this down and I'm going to, excuse me,

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.129
just discuss how to be a more effective
Admin in terms of scaling.

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:16.069
Now, I'm going to take that and further reduce that down.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:21.310
And not say scaling as an IT department, we always
know if you need more stuff done hire more staff.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:28.259
I'm going to be discussing here how do I scale you the
individual SysAdmins that are here in the audience.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:30.670
How do I make you be able to scale?

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.080
And that's what I'm going to be discussing here.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:38.120
So, there we go.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:45.250
In terms of scale I had a client that was
over on the East Coast, Graphics House.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:51.199
They had over 40 different gra@phics
users and 20 Office-umers.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.329
There was ten servers that they had.

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:56.259
Most were Macintosh they had a few Linux.

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.670
They were all independent servers.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.140
There was no integration between all of them.

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:05.750
There was one guy that supported all of these computers.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.639
I was brought in as a consultant to try to help him
out so that he could take care of all these systems.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:18.160
He would spend more than 80 hours a week just
trying to maintain all of these computers.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.380
To put something in scale here, I don't
know if this is a formal statistic

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:22.959
but this is a number that I have come up with.

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:26.639
You notice how it says 40 graphics users.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.649
For anyone that's had any experience you
always know that a graphics user seems to take

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:35.269
about three times the amount of
support of a normal Office-umer.

00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:39.129
I know how many times try to recover
that 500 gig drive that other computer.

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:45.600
So, putting this perspective then really in
perspective, he didn't have 60 people in his office.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:53.310
He had 140 users in his office that he was trying to
take care of himself as if they were individual users.

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:59.729
This is what I mean by how do you shift from
being a Mac Admin to being a Mac SysAdmin.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.100
How to move this paradigm from just becoming,
I'm going to support one computer, or excuse me,

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.399
a bunch of individual computers into
supporting an entire office of computers.

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.120
So, perfect segue.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.279
We're discussing here workstations and an office.

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:24.459
If in the Mac OS 9 days we had a whole bunch of individual
computers, there was no way to administrate them very easily

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.710
to be able to maintain them, support them, things like that.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.910
Well, we're not Mac OS 9 anymore.

00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:32.919
We're in, now moving into 10.5.

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:36.620
So it's time to consider a new
shift in how you support things.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.610
Scale, don't support a whole bunch of individual systems.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.620
Use tools and infrastructure that'll allow you to do more.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.169
I'll get into this here in a moment.

00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:50.779
One of the biggest things whenever you deal with
your job, and I probably am preaching to choir

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:55.559
when I say this, is you spend so much time doing support.

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:59.739
Computers are good at repetitive tasks, automation.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:08.060
So if you can find ways of automating your support,
you've found yourself more time to get more things done.

00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:12.299
So, saving time is one method of
being able to be more effective.

00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:17.479
I'm going to walk through an example here
that I imagine all of you have been in.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.269
How many of you have been sitting in your office, probably
working on some project, and you have some manager

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:31.829
that walks in and says, I have a new hire starting
tomorrow morning can you please set up the computer for me?

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.650
That's what I figured.

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:36.429
So, we've all been in that situation.

00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:41.699
You might be able to find a computer in the cobwebs
of some back closet, try to put the software on it.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.140
And of course they need to have that
user ready and working by the afternoon.

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:51.970
So, I'm going to discuss through the steps of how do
you automate the tasks of setting up a new hire.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.810
And this is going to be an application of
how do you scale yourself as an Admin.

00:10:55.809 --> 00:11:01.149
So, one person can do this not just
for one new hire but for a whole bunch.

00:11:01.149 --> 00:11:04.370
So first is purchasing hardware.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.240
Sorry, I can't automate that.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.720
They haven't designed that just yet.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.420
But, if you want I think I probably have a few sales
engineers that either in the audience or just outside,

00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:15.529
I can be happy to give you their business cards.

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:19.750
They would love if you want to go buy a
computer from them every three months or so.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.509
So, skipping on the past purchasing hardware for automation.

00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:26.909
We're going to go into purchasing software.

00:11:26.909 --> 00:11:30.319
How do you purchase software in
a way that would be automated?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.780
You can buy it from a provider.

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:34.329
How do you automate this process?

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.629
Well, there's two ways to do so.

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:39.689
The first one is with site license software.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.480
Rather than having to manage and maintain
a whole bunch of individual serial numbers,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.680
get a site licensed serial number from the manufacturer.

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:53.959
This means you can set up one installer that
you can apply to all the different systems.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.100
Additionally you'll find out that if you have software
licenses this will save you on costs of money.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.320
You don't need media for every single workstation.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.080
You just need the license for it.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.750
So, if you have this automated, if you need
more software you can purchase site licenses

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.909
over the Internet and have it ready by the next day.

00:12:10.909 --> 00:12:16.769
After that we have the setup, the actual
time it takes to set up a given workstation.

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:18.289
How do we automate this?

00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:21.509
Apple has a whole bunch of tools.

00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:23.919
Some include Package Maker.

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:27.620
We have Apple Remote Desktop to
deploy software to other systems.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:33.929
Disc images, NetInstall, NetBoot if any
of you have played with Mac OS X server.

00:12:33.929 --> 00:12:40.359
Imagine if anyone has begun to do any kind of imaging
they may have heard of a tool called NetRestore made

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.190
by a gentleman called Mike Bombich.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.710
And that's Bombick not Bombbitch.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.530
( Applause )

00:12:47.529 --> 00:12:51.370
When I was in the Apple training group I even
used that to help set up the classrooms, very,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.750
very useful tool to be able to do the imaging.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.490
These are examples of tools that you
can script, you can perform the set up.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.769
And the automation can be in place to speed up
the time it takes to set up these computers.

00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:07.689
Another thing to consider is an
integrated system that companies,

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.990
third party companies, are starting to establish and build.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.090
The concept and the term is called managed deployment.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.940
There's no former definition to this.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:23.170
It's generally the concept of controlled and
integrated deployment of all the systems.

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:29.079
Some, for example, are LandRev, FileWave,
Radmind, LANDDesk, and a few others.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:37.440
These are third party tools that have done a lot of work,
again, to solve the problem of doing software deployment.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.870
So, we have the users, we have the
computer, we've set up the computer.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.370
But, it's not we're not done.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.610
We have to actually help the user
in terms of using the computer.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:47.830
How do we help them do that?

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.280
And the way we can do that is with
documentation or self-paced training.

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:55.799
Everyone hates documentation, documentation, documentation.

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:57.049
But it's not that difficult.

00:13:57.049 --> 00:14:03.629
And I'm happy to say I get to change my speech slightly
here to say we have a very, very impressive Wiki server.

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:06.659
It's very good for being able to have documentation.

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:11.230
By the time you have a document
it's always considered stale.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:18.090
Now you can have a living document on a Wiki for your entire
staff to be able to access, search and find the information.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:24.759
Another concept, which I don't know if everyone
has necessarily heard, it's called screencasting.

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:28.659
I know all of you have heard about
podcasting, video podcasting.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.589
Well, this is screencasting.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.680
This would be a voiceover of a screen shot of your computer.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:41.399
And thanks to the new tool, I believe it is
forgive me Jason it's Podcast Producer, thank you.

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:48.549
You can then take this content and wrap it together
and create instruction for your users on how to set

00:14:48.549 --> 00:14:54.889
up your email, how to take care of getting
the VPN so you can get into the office.

00:14:54.889 --> 00:15:00.809
The more that you can empower of your staff and the
individuals within your company the less interrupt you get,

00:15:00.809 --> 00:15:07.609
the more you are able to do your job and be
available for exceptions as opposed to the norm.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:18.970
Skipped one here, the last one, jumped
ahead here, sorry guys, is blog.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:25.290
One of the really important things whenever you communicate
to staff is how do you give them timely information.

00:15:25.289 --> 00:15:28.500
Quick raise of hands, how many people have sent out an email

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:33.399
that the server's going to be down
and the user never read the email?

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.740
Using something like a blog or something like this as a
communication, we know users aren't going to check the email

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.820
because we know that they're going to filter that out.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.690
That's a communication on an individual level.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.310
If it's not important to them they won't read it.

00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:51.449
If you set up a blog or a system that has timely information
and timely news, just like people checking into CNN

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:56.720
or other websites, they then can get timely information
to help them get their, be able to do their job

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.940
or find out about events that are
going on within the company.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.290
After we take care of supporting the user there's going on.

00:16:03.289 --> 00:16:04.809
So, we have their new hire.

00:16:04.809 --> 00:16:05.979
They've set up their computer.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.420
They've used it for a day.

00:16:07.419 --> 00:16:14.379
But, now they're having some difficulty with getting the VPN
to work again because they forgot where the settings were,

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:21.850
how to re download those settings, or, hmm
trying to think of a really good example here.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:31.480
How many people with their computers have, forgive
me I'm forgetting here my example off hand.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.289
So, I'm going to precede a little bit further here.

00:16:33.289 --> 00:16:37.589
whenever they try to ask for help, how to empower
the individuals to solve their own problems whether

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:42.129
or not the system might be crashing, how to
recover from back up if your office has a policy

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:45.480
on going over the system to recover your files.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.690
The way that you can automate this is create
some tools that allow you to communicate better.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.940
First is a ticketing system for you IT so that
way you can not only have all of them come in.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.460
You have collaboration between your other members.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.930
More importantly, as I was saying
earlier about metrics equal proof,

00:17:02.929 --> 00:17:07.829
that if you have a ticketing system you then
have a way of scoring and telling how many calls

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.799
that you get a day or tickets or issues, how many times.

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:13.419
Oh here's another one of my favorite scenarios.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:20.650
How many of you have that one guy that no matter how often
you help them they keep asking the same question again

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.900
and again?

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.040
And you always want to tell your boss this guy
asked me all the same stuff all the time.

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:30.009
He's the one that's using all my money
trying to support everyone in the office.

00:17:30.009 --> 00:17:35.150
Having something like a ticketing system gives
you that metric to communicate to those MBA type,

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.820
that they can then understand, oh you're
spending all your time in this area.

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:43.939
Oh jumped ahead again, sorry.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.680
Create a knowledge base, something
that's a new, an interesting concept.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.340
If you have a knowledge base people can access
this information when you're not available.

00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:53.679
People can be at home.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.039
Things are not working correctly.

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:58.230
If you empower them with some documentation
or some help on how

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:03.720
to troubleshoot their own problem they can then solve
some of their own problems when you're not even around.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.210
Lastly, for the situations where it's during
the day when they need to ask for some help,

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:17.079
Apple remote desktop by controlling their computer remotely,
excuse me, you can then assist them even if they're

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:21.220
in a different building or outside of
the office assuming network permitting.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:29.100
Automating this you can then speed up the time that it takes
to be able to do the support for all these individuals.

00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:34.980
So, I discussed the workstation of how do
you scale the workstations, the office.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.539
But that's not always the case.

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:37.490
Well what about the servers?

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.660
People have labs of just data centers of servers.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.400
The same idea of scale can apply to this as well.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.120
I'm not going to get into too many examples here.

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:49.789
But, to give you some basic ideas, if you have
a whole bunch of servers that have accounts

00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:53.299
in all these systems create a central directory system.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.809
Put all the accounts in one place.

00:18:54.809 --> 00:19:01.230
If you have staff that either comes or goes out of the
company it's very easy to remove or promote access just

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.490
within one place as opposed to many systems.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.099
Servers have logs.

00:19:07.099 --> 00:19:11.779
The dreaded logs, none of us like combing through
but we know it's a requirement of our job.

00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:17.930
It's finding out what's wrong with the system, how to
solve it, maybe even a clue as to what we need to fix.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:26.470
If you create a central Syslog server you can connect all
the systems into one place and be able to search one log

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.100
as opposed to all of your different systems.

00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:35.549
Another thing to consider is if we
have systems or security monitoring.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:41.779
It always takes forever to be able to
take the time to read the logs to check

00:19:41.779 --> 00:19:44.109
to see if someone has compromised your system.

00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:48.779
There are third party tools that will do
this monitoring and notifications for you.

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:50.349
Some I'd like to mention real quick.

00:19:50.349 --> 00:19:53.419
You have InterMapper as a notification system.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.210
They've recently just added a logging facility.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.370
A new one to the market, that, I don't know if many

00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:05.139
of you have necessarily heard yet
it is Lithium, lithiumcorp.com.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.220
Sounds like a few people have heard of it before.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.680
It allows for not only notifications, they now
even have a Cocoa front end to be able to view

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.360
and monitor all your systems from a dashboard.

00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:24.459
So, create tools that will scale, that will
minimize the amount of time it takes to do a test.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.100
Automating these things is what's
valuable and what's important.

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:30.679
So, why do we want to scale?

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.620
The goal is to reduce our support cost, reducing costs.

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:37.139
Everyone's happy especially those MBA types.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.410
Do that mental shift between being an Admin to a SysAdmin.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:45.350
Don't walk around with a fire wire drive trying
to fix 500 computers or install software.

00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:51.740
Set it up in a central location so that
you can manage many systems at one time.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.609
Leverage tools that scale, I know I've mentioned this
many times, but it's really important to consider.

00:20:56.609 --> 00:21:01.559
Great, if you can find a tool that can solve the
one problem on hand but if it requires you going

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:06.509
to that person's computer to fix
it you've already wasted time.

00:21:06.509 --> 00:21:10.640
So scale, how do we take this further?

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.960
I'm going to use one of the examples
as how to use the command line.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.279
So, I'm just going to say here going beyond the GUI.

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:21.200
How many people here said that
they were Microsoft Windows Admins?

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.059
How many of you guys use the command
line in Microsoft windows?

00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:34.929
Actually pretty good number of them, cool, the one
thing to remember is that as much as the GUI has power

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.529
that the command line tends to have more power.

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:38.730
It can be cryptic.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.259
It can seem a little intimidating
because where are the instructions.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:43.259
Where do we go?

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:44.509
How do we deal with all of that?

00:21:44.509 --> 00:21:49.329
So, I'm going to walk us through here of why
it's not that bad to use the command line

00:21:49.329 --> 00:21:54.579
and how it can scale even though we're
only going to do commands on a single system.

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:58.500
So, how do we scale the command line?

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.619
Automation, we're going to get into,
I'm going to go across some thing

00:22:01.619 --> 00:22:06.799
of how you can script all the different command
line commands, that it's not very difficult.

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:11.440
I would like to take a moment and give credit
to a class that happened earlier this morning

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.000
in regards to scripting for the SysAdmin.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.670
I want to say it was a wonderful class, yeah, I was.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.840
( Applause )

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:21.269
I was very impressed with some of the
content that they were going over there.

00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:24.269
If you haven't had an opportunity or you
weren't there to go over the session.

00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:27.119
I believe all the content will be on.

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:29.209
( Talking in background )

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.269
Thank you AFP548.com.
H

00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:36.819
Where you can then find out more information
about the details if you missed that session.

00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:41.700
Some of the other values of the scaling with the
command line is that you can do parallel work.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.400
Where everyone thinks that you use a command
on a single computer, if you use scripts

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:52.240
and tie them all together you can then do multiple, or
excuse me, one command on many systems at the same time.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.700
Remember I was talking about how to save time.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:01.940
If you can do 50 computers at Pone time you now have
improved how quickly and effective you are at being at

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:08.370
your role. Something that many people don't realize at
first, if they tend to work in the world of the GUI,

00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:12.919
is the command line has much lower
amount of resources to be able to use.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:18.950
If you're in a high, high heavy loaded environment,
if you have a web server that gets a lot of traffic,

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:24.730
if you log in with the command, excuse me, with
the GUI you'll find that it takes a while,

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:30.529
the memory, the CPU to be able to log in with the finder
to launch applications, it might take a very long time.

00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:36.160
If you log in with a command line you'll find you have
all of the same amount of power as you do with the GUI

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.880
but it won't impact your system nearly as much. Great
also for if you're trying to dial-up over a dial-up modem.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.180
Try to fix those servers.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:50.590
So, scaling with the command line, benefits,
command line interface you have more options

00:23:50.589 --> 00:23:53.419
at the command line than you do at the GUI.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.550
You can chain all the different commands
together with what's called shell scripting.

00:23:57.549 --> 00:24:00.419
I want to take a side not here about scripting

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.990
I don't know if anyone's necessarily given you
a definition of scripting versus programming.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:08.430
We have World Wide Developer Conference,
we have a lot of programmers.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:15.460
Scripting, one common thread that I've found in all of
scripting is that the code that you write is in text.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.350
Its human readable.

00:24:16.349 --> 00:24:17.369
It's not compiled.

00:24:17.369 --> 00:24:18.869
It's not a binary.

00:24:18.869 --> 00:24:21.949
Some tools for scripting, you can
then compile them into a binary

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.600
but generally speaking you'll find that they're just text.

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:28.149
You can get to these files then from any text editor.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:34.030
So, we're going to discuss in this with shell scripting
as many other kinds of scripting Pearl, Python,

00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:36.109
Ruby on Rails is another common popular one.

00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:41.449
The, but I'm going to be discussing
shell scripting in this case.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.819
Command line, it has the ability of advanced tools.

00:24:44.819 --> 00:24:49.139
Remember as I mentioned earlier, the
GUI, you only have as many options

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.440
as the author of that GUI application has created.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:59.559
There's many more commands at the intermediate and at
advance level to be able to troubleshoot and fix problems.

00:24:59.559 --> 00:25:05.309
The single most valuable thing that I have ever found
about the command line is how many times have I wanted

00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:09.379
to run software update and a user
is logged into the computer.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.720
I couldn't do things.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.170
I want to wait for them to log out of
the computer but then you have to walk

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.670
over to the computer to run software update.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:21.769
Command line doesn't require a user to
be logged in to be able to perform tasks.

00:25:21.769 --> 00:25:24.769
I'll even take a moment here to
give credit where credit's due.

00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:28.990
The gentlemen this morning even had a little
clever trick of how to have no one log

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.029
in from the systems when you wanted to do work.

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:33.250
You can do this at the command line.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.259
Perform your tasks.

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:36.470
You don't need to be at the GUI.

00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:41.990
Now, I discussed the power of where the
command line can be extremely useful.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.160
Great you have the power of the command line.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.690
But, how do I have the ease of the GUI?

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.029
And the answer is you can.

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:52.119
I don't know if any of you had an
opportunity to play with Apple Remote Desktop,

00:25:52.119 --> 00:25:56.919
or some of the other automation
tools like Automator for example.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:04.000
You can have all of these commands or scripts located
on the system and you can call them from the GUI tool.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.329
You have the ease of the GUI
and the power of the command line.

00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:11.549
You have the power of two.

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:14.289
So, we're discussing about the command line.

00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:15.619
How do I get to it?

00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:18.539
Everyone has said Mac OS X has the power of Unix.

00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:22.180
The power of Unix is underneath Mac OS X.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.130
Where is it?

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.400
How do you get to it?

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.830
So the first thing, they way you get
there is a program called Terminal.

00:26:27.829 --> 00:26:31.179
It's located in applications/utilities/terminal.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.170
For those Windows gentlemen, I don't know how much
opportunity you had to play in the world of Unix

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.650
so forgive me if this is being repetitive.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.370
Unix notation, whenever you give a path in directories
you denote it with the first beginning slash.

00:26:43.369 --> 00:26:48.209
For those that live in the world of GUI it's the same
thing as double clicking on the hard drive on your computer.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:53.660
So, double click the hard drive on your computer,
applications, utilities, and the program is called Terminal.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.890
Here is an example of the Terminal interface and
the icon so it's easier for you guys to find.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:04.450
Again, for clarification this is the 10.4
version of the icons and the interface.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.900
So, we know where the application is.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.470
We now know where to find Unix.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.620
We now know where the command line is.

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:13.159
Well, we know where all the applications are in the GUI.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.860
It's, they're in one location and where
are the ones for the command line?

00:27:17.859 --> 00:27:20.119
Well let me show you where.

00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:26.069
So, we have a GUI, we have the command line, we have
user-based applications and system related applications.

00:27:26.069 --> 00:27:27.389
So let's start with the GUI.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.270
We know they're in /Applications.

00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:33.529
They also can be found in what's called
~/Applications for those again

00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:35.569
who don't know necessarily the world of Unix.

00:27:35.569 --> 00:27:40.019
The "~" implies the location based on
the user that's logged into the computer.

00:27:40.019 --> 00:27:42.660
So that would be ~/Applications.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.680
For the system files can be located
in /Applications/Utilities.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.880
They are also located in /System/Library/CoreServices.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.500
Recommendation, unless you get really
comfortable with the Mac I don't recommend to go

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.769
into the later locations for some of these applications.

00:27:59.769 --> 00:28:04.680
Some don't have a GUI interface or some are for
just very advanced troubleshooting or tweaking.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.370
So where do I find those on the command line?

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:10.459
Command line has very similar corresponding locations.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:16.450
You can find a lot of the basic
commands in /bin and /usr/bin.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.289
Notice I said user even though its spelled USR.

00:28:19.289 --> 00:28:24.490
If you ever move your computer right now and look in your
finder you're going to find these directors are not visible.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:30.150
Apple has intentionally hid them from your normal consumer
and Office-umer because we don't want to confuse them.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.810
If you open up the command line you'll find
that you'll see the files are located there.

00:28:33.809 --> 00:28:37.980
The system files are located in /sbin and /usr/sbin.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.750
There are sometimes other locations where
you find where Unix programs are installed.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.029
These are where you will generally
find where those applications can be.

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:50.250
So, we know how to get to the command line.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.730
We know where the applications are.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.819
But, how do I find out about them?

00:28:53.819 --> 00:28:59.569
If I have a GUI I just go up to the menu bar it
says help ,I click on that, type whatever I want.

00:28:59.569 --> 00:29:00.460
There's no menu bar.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.299
How do I find out information about
the commands at the command line?

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:07.099
And the way you do that is with a simple command called man.

00:29:07.099 --> 00:29:09.490
Its short for man pages.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.700
The simple way to use it is type man
and the commands you wish to use.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:19.039
If you want to find out how to use the command
pages for example you can type man man.

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:21.190
Great. Now we know where the applications are.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.240
We can go find out about those particular programs.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.640
But, what if I don't know what program I want to find?

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.480
Man pages has an ability of searching for a key word.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.450
It's very basic but it's able to search for key words.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.980
So let's say we wanted to find out about Kerberos.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.259
Well I can type man -k Kerberos.

00:29:38.259 --> 00:29:42.879
It'll find all the man pages that happen to have
that key word on the man pages and I can get an idea

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.640
of which commands I should be interacting with.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.910
Sometimes commands on the command
line have built-in usage help.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:53.900
And you can call that by usually running the
command by either a suffix of a  -h or a,

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.800
if you notice very closely I don't know
if you guys can see it from the back

00:29:56.799 --> 00:30:00.619
of the room, that's actually a --help.

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:01.669
So it's either one or the other.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.539
So it's either -h or --help.

00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:07.509
You can find out information about how to run the command.

00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:14.440
For Mac OS X server, with all of the GUI tools and
technologies there is a document that Apple has presented

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.730
on how to interact with all of the Mac
OS 10 technologies from the command line.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:24.150
If you got to www.apple.com/server/documentation,

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:27.440
you'll find a document called command line administration.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.009
There's a whole bunch of other documents there as well.

00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:32.289
You'll find this in regards to other technologies.

00:30:32.289 --> 00:30:38.099
The command line will show you how to do everything
you can do with the GUI at the command line.

00:30:38.099 --> 00:30:41.889
So we know where the applications
are but, and I know how to use them.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.570
But why, why would I want to use them?

00:30:44.569 --> 00:30:46.529
I can just do everything at the GUI.

00:30:46.529 --> 00:30:52.109
Well, a simple example, and again to clarify this is
10.4 here we're looking at, a tool to use to interact

00:30:52.109 --> 00:30:53.559
with your service is called Server Admin.

00:30:53.559 --> 00:31:00.409
Apple has created an equivalent counter part at the
command line, which coincidently is called serveradmin.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:05.960
I want to make sure for those who haven't necessarily
played with the command line, notice that the command

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.920
for this command line doesn't have
any capital letter or any spaces.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.710
It's a subtle but very important distinction.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:18.059
Every thing that you can do with the Server Admin
GUI you can do with this command line tool.

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:21.649
Another example, everyone needs
to run software, softwareupdate.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:25.360
Apple tool is going to be an Apple command line
equivalent and Apple's done a very good job

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:27.699
of keeping things simple and straight
forward and consistent.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:33.990
Software Update? softwareupdate. No spaces,
no command line. Excuse me, no capitals.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:37.089
Another one that's very important
that people have interacted with is.

00:31:37.089 --> 00:31:38.529
How do you install software?

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:40.629
It doesn't have to be through the GUI.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.240
You can do I through the command line.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:48.170
So, you have installer for your GUI interface
and you can have installer for the command line.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.930
To show you that this isn't always the
case, for technologies that aren't related

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:58.110
to Apple-based technologies there are other tools that
the command line has that are similar to the GUI tools.

00:31:58.109 --> 00:32:05.179
A common one that I imagine some people played with
for troubleshooting is Activity Monitor, excuse me.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:10.950
Where activity monitor gives you CPU usage, memory usage,
different programs, tasks, there's a whole bunch of,

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:15.110
there's a handful of different command
line tools that perform the same function.

00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:18.149
top, I don't know if any of you
have necessarily played with this.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.250
You have ps, which is for processes.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:25.829
iostat will show you disc IO usage, if you
want to find out how much reading and writing

00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:28.449
to your drive you're doing at that very moment.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.340
We know where the applications are.

00:32:31.339 --> 00:32:33.319
We know how to get to the command line.

00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:35.809
We know how to find out about these applications.

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:38.349
And now, you're starting to see that
there's some value of why you want

00:32:38.349 --> 00:32:41.959
to use the command line where you
don't need to have the GUI.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.500
So, how do we take this a step further?

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.299
Well, you tie it with shell scripting.

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:52.750
Before I get into the shell scripting, though, there's
one piece of information that I'd like to empower you all

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.390
with so that you don't get confused when you see this.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.330
In the OS world we have Mac OS X we have Microsoft Windows.

00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:04.220
Two different (unclear) of software they do two different things.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.440
More importantly the environments are different
so you have to treat the environments differently.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.710
The shell environment is exactly the same way.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.460
There are different kinds of shell environments.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.690
Each are different.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.680
Each have their strengths and each have their weaknesses.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:25.470
There isn't necessarily a fundamental
reason why any one is better than the other.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.549
So, if you speak to a Unix Admin he'll
probably disagree with me off hand,

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:30.240
probably have a preference of one over the other.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.289
For the sake of conversation here that I'm going to
have in this session I'm going to focus mostly on bash.

00:33:35.289 --> 00:33:38.359
And the only reason why I even
mentioned tcsh here is the fact

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:41.009
that those are the defaults that have been in Mac OS X.

00:33:41.009 --> 00:33:49.289
To go through the list real quick so that you're aware they
have bash, tcsh, csh, zsh, sh, and ksh.

00:33:49.289 --> 00:33:53.819
Again we're going to be focusing mostly here on bash in
the demonstration and everything I'm going to be giving you

00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:58.500
because that's the default shell environment on Mac OS X.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.500
So, shell script, shell script is a
wrapper that you put around a whole bunch

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.569
of individual commands on the command line.

00:34:04.569 --> 00:34:09.590
So, you can run just basic commands,
put this wrapper around it, and ta da.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.980
You've done shell scripting.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.289
Well, in order to do that there's a few points that we
have to remember when we create a text shell script.

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:19.250
The first thing is, is on a shell script
file you have to give it a header.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:24.099
And this header starts with what
the Unix people call shebang.

00:34:24.099 --> 00:34:29.130
It's the # and !, then you put /bin/bash

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.349
in the case that we're doing bash coding here.

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:36.480
It is to the command line interpreter
where to find the shell environment.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:42.230
In your shell script it's always wise,
it's the difference between a good scripter

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.110
and a bad scripter is whether or
not you leave notes for yourself.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.370
We all know that command line can be cryptic.

00:34:47.369 --> 00:34:51.489
Leave notes for yourself so that you know when
you come back later you'll be able to find things.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.509
Adding comments is very useful.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:58.550
Some common things to be able to put in here,
whenever you're, excuse me I'm jumping ahead.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:02.130
Whenever you add comments you always want to
preface those comments with the #

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.599
and the command line knows to ignore those settings.

00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:08.400
We working here, there we go.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.829
Very important thing to always put
at the top of you shell scripts,

00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:16.519
I know this is probably old, old,
old, knowledge for Unix Admins.

00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:22.130
The idea is to add who the author is and
the date at which you wrote the script.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:27.090
Some people even add an extra line if they
modify the script who modified it and the date,

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.460
very useful for troubleshooting or
finding out if things have changed.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:35.070
I always, it never hurts as well to add
the title of what this is, the shell,

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.830
excuse me at the top of the shell script.

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:41.969
It makes it very useful especially with Spotlight if you
want to find your commands for shell scripts you'll be able

00:35:41.969 --> 00:35:46.549
to look in these files and find the
title of what your shell script is.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:52.950
Lastly, not that it's terribly important, it's handy
for us as we are humans and we are mere mortal,

00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:56.879
that if you name your shell script genuinely with a ".sh".

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.450
The command line doesn't require it.

00:35:58.449 --> 00:36:00.679
It's handy for if you need to do searches or find things.

00:36:00.679 --> 00:36:03.549
Some people even use the notation of ".bash".

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:07.590
For the sake of my presentations
I'm going to just be using ".sh".

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:12.789
So at this time I'm going to walk you
through a demo here on introduction of how

00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:17.239
to use the command line and how
we can tie all of this together.

00:36:17.239 --> 00:36:20.159
Excuse me I forgot one thing real quick.

00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:26.039
Jason if you can hand me my badge
I left some of my notes there.

00:36:28.809 --> 00:36:30.389
Thank you.

00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:43.190
Okay, so, I'm going to show you here on this
computer how we're going to be able to interact

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.720
with the command line and how to tie it all together.

00:36:45.719 --> 00:36:49.659
Before I go too much further, one thing I'd like
to clarify for all of those that are in the room.

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:52.149
I'm going to be typing in several of the commands.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:57.680
Some of them are going to be cryptic and I want you not to
get caught up in how I'm typing the command or the syntax

00:36:57.679 --> 00:37:01.839
of the command but the general flow that
I'm going to be giving you of these commands.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.210
So, before I can do anything on the command
line I have to find Terminal and launch it.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:10.519
I do so by Tiger, double-clicking
on the hard drive, Applications.

00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:13.420
Scroll down here to Utilities.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.820
And we can find Terminal.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:16.890
Yes I know it's in the doc.

00:37:16.889 --> 00:37:19.400
I was doing this for those who didn't know how to find it.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.860
So we launch Terminal.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:26.510
Okay, to make sure everyone can see this here.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:32.820
( Typing on keyboard )

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.630
If you can read this please follow the instructions.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:36.519
( Applause )

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:40.329
Thank you, thank you, oh, oh okay we're
back to the speech right, oh okay sorry.

00:37:40.329 --> 00:37:42.210
Got a little sidetracked.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.490
Okay, so we're here at the command line.

00:37:45.489 --> 00:37:47.659
And we started, we launched terminal.

00:37:47.659 --> 00:37:51.549
And let's say the first thing I want to
do is, great, we have software update.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:54.660
Mac OS X has this tool that automatically updates software.

00:37:54.659 --> 00:37:56.589
We don't want the user to automatically do it.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.740
I want to take some control.

00:37:57.739 --> 00:38:02.529
So, the first command I want to do is I want to turn
off that automatic check by software update.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:08.810
And the command is software update as we found earlier.

00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:15.409
And that scheduler, excuse me schedule, and off, ta da.

00:38:15.409 --> 00:38:16.349
I ran the command.

00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:17.130
I turned this off.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.670
I didn't require the GUI.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:23.309
This tool happens to give a little feedback letting me
know that I successfully turned off that software update.

00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:28.679
The next one I want to do is I have some
users that want to use the zoom function

00:38:28.679 --> 00:38:31.069
but they don't know where to find that in the preferences.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:33.350
So, I want to enable that in default on all my systems.

00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:35.989
So, I'm going to use a command called defaults

00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:42.729
Defaults is a Mac OS X technology command line
that allows you to edit Mac OS X preference files.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.610
So, I'm going to say defaults.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:53.680
I want to write the settings here and that
would be com., it's always frustrating

00:38:53.679 --> 00:38:56.569
at the command line because I always have these typos.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:04.320
universalaccess and close, see.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.760
Did I type that right?

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:14.660
universalaccess, see this is command line why
some people don't necessarily like to use this.

00:39:14.659 --> 00:39:23.759
So, universal ccess and its closeViewDriver value is 0.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.810
Ta da. I typed a command, took
me a little while but I did it.

00:39:27.809 --> 00:39:30.380
Okay, so I now turned off that setting.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.910
I also want to turn off one more setting.

00:39:31.909 --> 00:39:35.500
I have people with laptops and I have these Office-umers.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.179
They always seem to leave more than one finger
on the track pad and it always confuses them.

00:39:39.179 --> 00:39:42.690
So I want to turn off that double finger ability of clicking.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:50.300
So I'm going to turn that off with a defaults write

00:39:50.300 --> 00:40:05.100
and the syntax will be .GlobalPreferences com.apple.trackpad,
God typos they're always frustrating,

00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:18.610
preferences com.apple.enableSecondaryclick,
God this is taking forever, ta da.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.230
I just sent that command.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:23.590
So I spent all this time and energy
in writing all these commands.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:28.350
Now if I tried to do this over 50 or
100 compuPters it would take me forever.

00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:31.230
Especially how many times did I make a typo here?

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:34.840
And I did that intentionally so you guys
could see that the value of command line.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.579
( Laughter )

00:40:36.579 --> 00:40:40.309
Why, great of the command line had these
problems, why would I want to use it?

00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:42.549
Well, this is the value of a shell script.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.740
Not only can we minimize the human error
with things, we can speed up this process.

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:50.349
So, I'm going to walk through the steps here
of making the very same steps and commands.

00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:52.339
And we're going to make a shell script.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.980
So, in order to do so, I need a text editor.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.039
Everyone may have their favorite
preference of which text editor.

00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:03.599
There's BBEdit there's TextMate, there's
a whole bunch of other GUI text editors.

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:08.429
I'm going to discuss here for this that
there are command line text interpreters.

00:41:08.429 --> 00:41:12.159
I personally like to use them because they're always
on the computer and I can work on the remote system

00:41:12.159 --> 00:41:14.190
without having to launch another program.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:22.409
Commonly some people have heard of VI, Emacs, maybe
even Pico, which is now being replaced with Nano.

00:41:22.409 --> 00:41:26.679
For the sake of the demonstration I'm going to stick with Nano.

00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:28.569
So, going to launch the program called Nano.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:32.830
And the reason why I sort of use this is that even thought
it's a command line tool it's a little bit more helpful

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:37.489
with some of the instructions on how
to interact with the Nano editor.

00:41:37.489 --> 00:41:45.429
So, following the instructions that we discussed
we're going to have #!/bin/bash.

00:41:45.429 --> 00:41:48.239
Put in the author of who this is.

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:53.799
Written by Fred Licht and today's date.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.030
And we're going to put a title here.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:03.220
This is an example for session 510 at WWDC.

00:42:03.219 --> 00:42:07.239
Okay, so we now have an author, we have a
date, we have a title, we have the #!.

00:42:07.239 --> 00:42:10.209
So, we have everything ready now to start our shell script.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:14.150
So, the next step that we're going to do
is, well, I'm not going to type the command.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.950
I'm going to be useful, I'm going to add a comment
to tell me what it is that I wanted to do.

00:42:17.949 --> 00:42:23.019
The first thing we wanted to do is disable software update.

00:42:23.019 --> 00:42:28.590
And just type in, just like I did earlier, the
exact command that I typed at the command line.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:35.220
Software update, assuming I can
spell it correctly, schedule off.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:41.309
Okay, what was the other command I ran, which
was I wanted to enable the zoom feature.

00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:49.690
going to type in that command defaults write,
let's make sure I type this correctly,

00:42:51.150 --> 00:43:02.840
com .apple.universalaccess closeViewDriver 0.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.269
Okay and lastly what we said is we want to
disable the right click on the laptops.

00:43:07.269 --> 00:43:15.280
So, again, disable right click on laptops.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:22.019
Same command, I'm not changing anything different
from what I was typing earlier and this was the syntax

00:43:22.019 --> 00:43:28.920
of global preferences, excuse me,
globalpreference and com.apple.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:34.260
There's a reason why we have computers
with built in spell checking.

00:43:37.409 --> 00:43:45.920
And com.apple.trackpad.enableSecondary

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:51.400
( Typing on keypad )

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.269
And the value of 0, so here's our whole command.

00:43:56.269 --> 00:43:56.699
Let's make sure.

00:43:56.699 --> 00:43:57.579
Did I type all that right?

00:43:57.579 --> 00:44:01.699
Write right stop globalpreference
com.apple track., okay.

00:44:01.699 --> 00:44:02.029
Looks right.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.540
Am I doing, did anyone catch something
I did spell that right?

00:44:05.539 --> 00:44:06.650
Okay good.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.740
Okay so, written the shell script.

00:44:08.739 --> 00:44:09.750
Write all the commands in.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.389
They're all correct. I can double check it

00:44:11.389 --> 00:44:15.750
without running the commands and maybe
writing something I shouldn't be writing to the system.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:21.630
In Nano in order to save a file you use the command
with the control key and the letter O. If you notice

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.680
on the screen there's a little carrot symbol.

00:44:23.679 --> 00:44:26.009
That's the notation for using the control key.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.690
So, I'm going to do control+O for writing the file.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:34.300
I'm going to call it changesettings.sh.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:40.019
And to exit I do a control+X. Great.

00:44:40.019 --> 00:44:41.259
I've wrote a shell script.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.920
It's right here in the same location
of where I entered in the text editor.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.240
And I want to run that shell script.

00:44:47.239 --> 00:44:51.579
In order to call that shell script
I call the shell environment.

00:44:51.579 --> 00:44:54.259
Some Unix people may say just run the command as is.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:00.270
I have found that it's very useful to run the
shell environment directly, so /bin/bash,

00:45:00.269 --> 00:45:02.500
because we're calling the bash environment.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:07.480
And I'm going to call my change setting script.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.300
Now if you guys are ready.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.160
Now watch this.

00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:13.569
Done. Took a lot less time.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:18.050
This is the value of having a shell script. Goes faster,

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:21.840
doesn't have human error assuming you
type it in correctly to begin with.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:28.539
And you can then take this shell script, apply it to a whole
bunch of different systems and run it at the same time.

00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:33.809
So I've not taken the power of the command line wrapped
so that I have the ease and the power that I may even

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:37.099
to be able to pass to a junior Admin,
have him take care of these tasks.

00:45:37.099 --> 00:45:39.719
He doesn't need to know the syntax of the commands.

00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:43.699
And then you can automate this by
distributing it to a whole bunch of systems.

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:45.739
So, that's the demo that I have here.

00:45:45.739 --> 00:45:52.959
If we switch back to the presentation,
that was the command line.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.519
That was shell scripting and how easy it is to
take some basic commands you may already know

00:45:57.519 --> 00:46:01.280
or you might Google or AFP548.com, that you found.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.570
Here's a little fix.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:08.500
You can wrap them in a shell script and you can automate
it and speed up the time it takes to run those commands.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:13.110
So, great, I showed you where the
applications for the command line are,

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.690
where to find them, how to find more information.

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:18.700
You're comfortable where you see some of the value.

00:46:18.699 --> 00:46:23.859
In my experience as I have become a SysAdmin, up here
are a whole bunch of commands that I have encountered

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:28.480
that are very useful in my progression
into being a SysAdmin.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.730
You saw me earlier using the defaults command.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:35.639
That's for changing plist files,
the preference files for Mac OS X.

00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:40.109
A very useful one that's one of my
favorites is called fs_usage.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:44.620
It taps into the similar technologies
that Spotlight can use.

00:46:44.619 --> 00:46:50.909
Excuse me, where if you started to launch this
program and you were watching live what was changing

00:46:50.909 --> 00:46:55.960
on your file system, if you ran a tool
or a system GUI tool and you wanted

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.460
to know what files it was changing you could see
those files being read or written to using this tool.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.460
It's really handy to find out what gets changed sometimes.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.280
lsof, it stands for list of open files.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.670
How many of you have ever tried to
install some software on a disc image,

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:16.840
sorry I can't inject the disc image file
is in use, or excuse me, volume is in use?

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.070
Well, the way you can find those
files is by running this command.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:24.620
It'll give you a list in the full path so you can
find out what application might be running a file

00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:28.829
that you think is closed but may not necessarily be closed.

00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:35.940
An interesting piece is the launchd. Where launchd
is a daemon and a process and a core of the OS.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.550
The way you interact with it actually
is the tool launch control.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:41.570
That's launchctl.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:45.940
This tool is interactive it replaces a whole
bunch of other Unix tools such as cron

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:53.369
such as watchdog, xnet d, even Mac OS X start up server.

00:47:53.369 --> 00:47:59.529
These tools are to automate and schedule
things, great for running your scripts.

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.840
Another favorite one that I've
encountered is the open command.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.870
It seems, very, very, very simple even though we're here at
the command line you always still seem to work in the GUI.

00:48:08.869 --> 00:48:14.559
If you ever do an "open .", it'll
open the directory you're in, in the Finder.

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:18.119
And there's always times you've run around, you
found the directory but you wanted to open it

00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:21.549
up in your GUI text editor but
you wanted to navigate to that path.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:27.100
And you're already there in the terminal "open .",
it opens that up, very easy to use.

00:48:27.099 --> 00:48:32.829
Once you get more comfortable with the command line there
are some tools that help do with searching and text editing.

00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:36.400
That would be grep, awk, and sed.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:40.710
I suggest go ahead and do Google on them there's
tons of research on those three commands.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.740
I could probably spend a week on those alone.

00:48:43.739 --> 00:48:49.039
Lastly as I mentioned earlier the text editors that
come built into Mac OS X so they're always available.

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:50.980
More importantly they're free.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:55.269
So it's always available and you always
know they're there is vi, emacs,

00:48:55.269 --> 00:48:59.710
and Nano also know as Pico at least the older versions were.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:06.150
So, with all of this discussion we were talking
about how to be a more effective SysAdmin.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:12.650
We discussed how scaling the individual, your tools,
your functions, how you as an individual can do more,

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:16.340
empower yourself to do more with sometimes less.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.710
We discussed how you can use the command line.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:21.500
The power of the command line beyond what the GUI has.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.190
Remember the command line's free.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:27.320
GUI applications may be shareware, they
may cost money, command line is always there.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.789
You don't have to wait for developers
to create a GUI interface.

00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:33.239
And lastly is scripting.

00:49:33.239 --> 00:49:35.509
Sometimes programming can be overbearing.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:36.950
It might be intimidating.

00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:40.789
It's not hard to take these shell
commands wrap them together

00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:44.710
with a shell script and you've created yourself automation.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:51.710
So, scaling do more with computers.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:54.050
You can grow your IT model if you're a manager.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:58.160
You can then create these tools and empower
your staff to be able to do the tasks.

00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:01.250
You can stay ahead of the growth curve,
something I know all of us fight.

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.420
We never have enough time to get
all of the jobs we want to get done.

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.119
Save time.

00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:08.460
You'll have more time available to work on other things.

00:50:09.519 --> 00:50:12.230
Command lines. Get your hands dirty.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:13.860
I know it's very intimidating.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:19.309
It's about half a dozen years ago
I was afraid of the command line.

00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:21.239
It was so scary.

00:50:21.239 --> 00:50:24.559
And today, looking back, I don't know what I was thinking.

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:28.949
There is so much power I couldn't be able to do
my job today if it wasn't for the command line.

00:50:28.949 --> 00:50:33.699
With the command line you also have extra
features, indepth or advanced tools to fix things

00:50:33.699 --> 00:50:36.159
since Mac OS X is based on a lot of open source tools.

00:50:36.159 --> 00:50:37.989
Those are the very advanced.

00:50:37.989 --> 00:50:41.769
You can dig in deeper to solve
problems without the infamous "woo...,

00:50:41.769 --> 00:50:45.009
I don't know how to fix the computer
its time to reinstall the OS".

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:48.200
Something I know everyone dreads having to consider.

00:50:48.199 --> 00:50:51.389
Scripting, tie it all together.

00:50:51.389 --> 00:50:56.920
Automation, do all the tasks at
the same time on multiple systems.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.730
Empower you as the SysAdmin.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:03.269
To find out more information about
the command line and how to interact

00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:06.000
with it you can go to developer.apple.com.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.190
The search system you can search up any of the command line
commands, they'll be there for you just like the man pages.

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:17.250
As I mentioned earlier
the www.apple.com/server/documentation.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:23.159
For those that probably heard of AFP548.com,
I want to take a moment and applaud.

00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:29.059
( Applause )
It's one of my favorite sites.

00:51:29.059 --> 00:51:31.250
Another one is macenterprise.org.

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:35.590
They have webcasts to teach you about
technology, third party software,

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:38.970
as you can see a step below they even have an email list.

00:51:38.969 --> 00:51:44.839
It's very important for communication not just within
your own company but outside with other Mac Admins.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.480
Another interesting one is mac-mgrs.org.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:52.599
Notice that the subtle little typing in
syntax they use there for Mac Managers.

00:51:52.599 --> 00:51:55.539
A little bit of warning, Mac Managers
has their own little etiquette

00:51:55.539 --> 00:51:58.159
for their own little meeting lists
or excuse me their email list.

00:51:58.159 --> 00:52:02.649
Do me a favor read their instructions before you
apply any questions, excuse me ask any questions.

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:06.400
They have an archive you can do a full search through.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.090
So, we talked about the resources
of where you can finance this.

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:12.210
But what happens if you find an answer
and you don't know what to do with it?

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:16.250
Apple has a website called bugreporter.apple.com.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.449
So, let me ask a quick question.

00:52:18.449 --> 00:52:22.149
How many of you in this room consider
yourselves programmers?

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.119
Okay, we got a handful.

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:28.679
So, Bug Reporter, don't, programs have bugs.

00:52:28.679 --> 00:52:30.429
So, isn't that a programmers tool?

00:52:30.429 --> 00:52:36.799
And the answer's no, Bug Reporter,
despite its name, is for all of us.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:44.000
If you encounter problems, if you have a feature request,
if you would like something changed in Mac OS X in the OS,

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.539
or a command is not working the way it should.

00:52:46.539 --> 00:52:51.050
This is the website you need to go
to an fill out this information.

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:57.470
If you don't communicate back to Apple via this
method, Apple won't know to fix these problems.

00:52:57.469 --> 00:52:58.569
I know one of the hardest things is.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:03.650
How do we tell Apple, we need this, this
would be useful, this isn't working?

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:08.340
Here's your method of how you can tell
Apple how to fix or change those things.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:12.230
So, if you walk away with one thing at
least remember bugreport.apple.com.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:17.260
You can have feature requests, bug reports, and other ideas.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:25.390
Lastly, in order to be a more effective
SysAdmin it requires communication.

00:53:25.389 --> 00:53:27.920
So, this is quote that I'd like to put out there.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:33.099
It's called networking, networking,
networking, make new friends.

00:53:33.099 --> 00:53:40.069
If all of you would do me a favor right now while
I'm talking, pull out your business cards. Right now.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.519
Pull them out.

00:53:42.659 --> 00:53:45.480
No joke, I'm not, this is not just
a little speech I'm standing here.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.880
Pull out your business cards.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:53.000
Hand one to the gentleman to your right or woman
and one to your left and in front and in back.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.920
The most important thing with any
of this is networking make friends.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.639
Everyone in this room is your friend.

00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:01.509
It's your best resource.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:11.820
( Crowd talking )

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.930
So, I've gone through this whole speech.

00:54:14.929 --> 00:54:18.639
I know some of it is highlight some of it is review.

00:54:18.639 --> 00:54:21.400
If you guys have any questions feel free to contact me.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.889
I'm at flicht@apple.com.

00:54:25.889 --> 00:54:29.629
I know that there's a lot more depth in any
of this concept that I can go further in.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.619
I'd be happy to answer anyone's questions.

00:54:31.619 --> 00:54:35.029
If I don't know how to answer their
question I'll do the honor the best

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:37.260
to be able to forward them in the right direction.

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:43.370
Or if I can, no promises, find any
answers for them if I discover any.
