WEBVTT

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.740
>> Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.679
And welcome to Session 600.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.140
This is the fundamentals of digital video session.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.870
And today, we're going to be joined
by three very special guests.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.810
The first presenter is going to be Craig
Syverson from gruntmedia.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:24.939
And the next two presenters are from Pixel Corps.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.380
We have Ben Durbin and
Kenji Kato.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:33.079
And these guys are going to give you a pretty good
overview of the entire video production process

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.189
from the very beginning all the way through, you know,
actually getting your video on the web and then all those,

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:42.030
you know, camera formats and everything you
need to understand about making great video

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.109
that looks, you know, even better when compressed.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.450
So with that said, I'm going to hand it over to Craig.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.679
>> Thank you very much.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.700
>> Steven Tuttle, Ladies and Gentlemen, from Apple Computer.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.780
>> He can't introduce himself,
so I'll introduce him for him.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.530
Thanks a lot for coming.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.710
We're going to do a survey of digital video.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.170
Very kind of a big broad overview.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.829
So we're not going to be really technical here.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.609
This is not the technical session.

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:09.060
This is the 9:00 warm-up, oh my gosh,
we've got to start this whole video thing.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.140
So I'm going to go through a presentation that I've made
that addresses people just getting started in podcasting,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.349
wanting to get a sense of what does
it take to create a video podcast.

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:25.669
And I'm using my own video podcast as the model for that.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.030
So that would be us.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.439
And the show that I'm-- my company is gruntmedia.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.989
And my first show that I've done is called videogrunt.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:46.089
And this is a shot of my logo, which was up
on the QuickTime content guide last summer.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.500
I don't mean to brag.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.700
Okay, I'm going to brag.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.490
I was the first independent podcaster
put on the content guide.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.469
So thanks to the content guides for that.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.260
That was really great.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.600
My show is about the basics of digital video.

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.829
It's a digicational show.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.539
I teach people, you know, what's an
aspect ratio, what's a frame rate.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.609
It's not a how-to.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.709
It's more of a what-is.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:14.650
But moving on, the thing I'm going to talk about right
now is I want to give people a 30,000-foot overview

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.490
of what it takes to get a video podcast from 0 to 60.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.150
But I'm only going to go three inches deep.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.280
So we're just going to give you a big picture.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.629
And that big picture is kind of broken up into these
four different groups of these twelve different points.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.060
Starting in the green area, you know, it's getting the show
together, it's thinking of what the show is going to be

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.150
like all the way up to the top part about promo and
monetization, which none of us know anything about because

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.569
of all the millions of pico dollars
that I've been making off of podcasts.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.439
It's going to happen soon.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.509
So let me just start right ahead
here talking about the first section.

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:59.199
This green section is about really, you know, when you
want to start a show, it's really important, I think,

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:03.979
and I've found in preparing my shows, is
to really think about what you want to do.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:09.409
Obviously you'll want to figure out what you want
to have done at the end, and what's the feeling?

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.509
That's kind of the main point of
this thing is what's the vibe?

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:17.639
You know, do you want to do a comedy, do you want to do
a round table discussion, do you want to do a news show?

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.439
And it's really important, I think, at the beginning
to kind of feel what it is you're trying to say.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.069
And you'll want to get a sense of what people
are going to feel like when they see it.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.169
If you can nail that at the beginning,
it will really help you down the line.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.929
A lot of people start off with one idea
and they kind of, you know, go to comedy,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.069
and then they realize they're not
funny, so it goes somewhere else.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.019
And it can be a real mess.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.219
And another thing to think about is
how it's going to be experienced.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:49.310
This is where the whole podcasting and online media
is slightly different in that the actual conditions

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.990
by which your audience are viewing your media are different
than the old days, different than, and by the old days,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.710
I mean those of us who have been in video production.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:04.230
We're sort of used to having people watch our stuff on
screens in a reasonably controlled room or a projector.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.169
And with online and podcasting, they're
in a totally different space now.

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.919
They're on the road, they have a lot more distractions.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:17.719
So in thinking of the show, it's really important to really
think about that user experience down the line, right?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.450
>> Indeed.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.449
>> Just say yes, you're great.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.479
>> Yes, you're great.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.509
>> You're great.

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:23.189
>> Thank you.

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.160
And so next in this green section
then is think strategically.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.490
And this is part of what I talked with for corporate
people is, you know, how does this podcast fit in overall

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.009
with your company strategy, realizing that this
media edition is sometimes just an element.

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:46.230
Don't try to make-- if it's part of a corporate thing, don't
try to make this show the entire conveyance of information.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.670
Think of it as a supplement to a lot of other things.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.040
And use media in its proper way, sort of in the
proper macluinistic way of, you know,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.350
what can it accomplish best, what
can moving media accomplish best,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.750
which is more about feeling and
experience more than part data.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.470
And think about how to scale it.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.520
This is a problem a lot of Web 2.0
companies have, of course, is how to scale.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:14.029
But even for, you know, small individuals like me who
are starting off, you've got to be prepared for success.

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:19.099
You've got to really understand that if it does take off,
you've got to be able to grow your bandwidth, you've got to,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.490
perhaps, grow your production line or your
production flow, enhance your website.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.530
What's that?

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:29.159
>> Enhancing your website, things like that.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.720
>> So one observation I've made in looking at just
symbolically representing radio or audio on the top

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.150
and video on the bottom or traditional media, just in
being involved in the podcasting world for the past couple

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:42.949
of years, just the observations that I've made.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.209
And I also am involved in audio podcast as well.

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.829
I do a weekly show with Kenji and
two others called This Week in Media.

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:55.439
And I do a fort nightly show on
venture capital called Venture Cast.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.959
So I have my hand in both audio and video production.

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:04.779
And things I've observed with online media and podcasting,
in particular with audio, is that compared to radio

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:10.179
and other traditional sort of audio media
formats, with podcasting, we can go longer.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.680
We don't have these time constraints, we don't
have these commercial marks that we have to hit.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.720
And do you know, people download stuff, they tend
to be more, you know, focused and specialized,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.650
so they're willing to deal with our hour
and a half, two hour jawing on of things.

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:27.939
And I actually love listening to it.

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:29.219
I actually like things to be longer.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.170
Especially for me in listening to
audio podcast in the car with my iPod,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.520
I don't want to be switching programs a lot while driving.

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:40.060
So I like these one-hour programs.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.170
I just hit the button once and go.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:49.810
And the other thing about the audio, at least in
podcasting in general, is culturally, it's more candid,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:56.139
it's more casual, certainly in a corporate setting with the
corporate podcast, you tend to get a more humanistic vibe

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.779
out of the CEO rather than just the straight-up,
you know, we're doing great kind of comments.

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:05.689
On video, what I've noticed is
that for online, it's shorter.

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:07.769
There's a lot of good reasons for it to be shorter.

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:12.629
You know, bandwidth and all that notwithstanding.

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:14.870
Bandwidth and that will be a problem
that will go away very soon.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.209
So it's not really-- that's really not the reason.

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:23.769
The reason is that, again, this context of viewing,
shorter attention spans, and it's really, I think,

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:26.049
given rebirth to this idea of the short-form video.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.139
It's the last time-- the only time we've really had
that historically has been on cartoons, things that are,

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.949
you know, contained programs that are five minutes or so.

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:42.959
But I'm finding that with video, there's a really great
spot for short length programs in the non fiction space.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:45.579
It's really great because it's really easy to do that.

00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:53.449
And I'm finding that as a barrier, not as a barrier, but
as an entry point, non fiction for me is a lot easier.

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:57.379
Now, I think those people who are doing fiction,
who are doing comedy, they're very brave.

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:01.050
I think they're awesome like Ask a Ninja
and those guys because they're really talented.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.629
So you have to kind of, again, this goes back to, you
know, what's your vibe, what are you trying to accomplish?

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:11.089
And really think about how you can optimize your
talents with what you've got available to you.

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:12.310
And video programs are simpler.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.470
We've got smaller screens.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.240
The whole composition aspect of
designing a screen for a video podcast

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.430
versus a presentation is a big, big different for me.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.040
It's a completely different way of looking at it.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.420
So I'm finding that these-- the
whole layout and the whole way

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.189
that you're presenting information
can be a lot simpler, right?

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.879
>> Indeed.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:34.600
>> Yeah. Format.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.340
Basically, this is just, once you're designing your
show, you're thinking about what you want to do.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.340
Then build your format.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.440
And the format is sort of the professional edge.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.100
You know, it's the professional touch, it's the consistency.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.680
And, you know, can you have your
format tie in with your concept?

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:55.459
It's a subtle point, but it really somehow--

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:02.030
sometimes the way that your program flows actually
enhances the concept that you're trying to give off.

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:08.959
And it really helps you tighten up your script
writing or tighten up the concept of your show,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.129
if you give it constraints because
constraints give you a lot of power.

00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:20.950
And so this is just a very quick sort of survey
of the shows that I've done in the grunt series.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:26.450
I took the average length of a show and sort of figured
out how much time I was devoting to each section.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.540
So I just did this little graph for someone
who's helping me with script writing.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:35.959
And I was saying, you know, the sections of
the show, this is roughly how long they are.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.780
And this whole circle represents about five minutes.

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:47.370
And starting at the top, I have a-- in that orange section
in the top, I have a fake commercial on videogrunt.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.909
It's a satirical non-commercial-- I won't go into that.

00:09:50.909 --> 00:09:56.110
Then I have an intro bit, and then I'm on
camera for a little bit introducing the subject.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.310
Then that blue section down there, I do a lot of motion
graphics or I'm, you know, into the meat of the subject.

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:05.119
I come back on camera with an exception
or as a reminder that I'm there.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.560
Again, more motion graphics.

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:09.859
I come back at a close, closing tag, and we're out.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.769
And so that's kind of the format.

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:19.210
To me, this was the culmination of really the six or seven
months I took in just thinking about this green section.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.250
It really took me the most time to get that ready.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.289
So now we're moving up into production.

00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:28.599
And this is sort of the, you know, this
is the heart of where we come in here

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.450
with Apple and actually making the podcast.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.200
Kenji and Ben are going to go into
a little more detail on the guts.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.990
So I'm going to go through this rather quickly.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:44.610
But for me, for the kind of show that I do, my
most important thing is having a good writer.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.430
That it's all about the script, in my case.

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:49.699
Now, obviously certain shows aren't scripted.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.000
But in mine, it is.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.279
So that's my most important asset, is
to have a good writer and a good host.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:59.740
It happens to be me, but that's just
because they can't find anyone else.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.279
And you really have to pay attention
to copyrights and permissions.

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:06.279
It's a whole other, you know, week-long session about that.

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:09.929
And this notion that people are
beginning don't really understand.

00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:12.549
And that is that pictures are easy and sound is hard.

00:11:12.549 --> 00:11:18.129
And, you know, video cameras are really sexy and
they're really, you know, new technology about imaging,

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:23.769
but really the hard part is the sound because if you're not
really paying attention to sound, you get these crappy mics

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:29.829
on these cameras, so my whole emphasis for people
who are getting started is buy the camera last.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.280
Worry about your script, worry about your sound,
buy your mics and practice on the sound first.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:38.079
Then go with the video part.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.840
So very, very quickly, one way that I'm, you know,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.310
suggesting people go is to start
with at least HDV for cameras.

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:53.299
There's no reason to not do HDV or
high definition if you're starting out.

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:57.419
It's very important, I think, that you do, that, you know,

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.649
people are always saying, well
it's always so small at the end.

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:03.669
But those of us involved, you know,
you always want it as high as possible.

00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:07.689
And then at the last minute, you can
cramp it down to whatever size you need.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:14.030
And these guys are going to go into a little
bit more about video formats and the like.

00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:17.289
For audio gear, I think it's super
important to have a lavaliere mic.

00:12:17.289 --> 00:12:20.610
These are two that I've used in the past.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.659
I currently use the Sennheiser.

00:12:21.659 --> 00:12:24.589
These are under $1,000.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.940
Don't spend less than $500 on a
wireless mic because it just won't work.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.040
Or it will work for a week, and then it won't work at all.

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:32.919
And it's just really, really critical.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:38.529
You could spend up to 10 grand for wireless
stuff, but you can start here around $5,000.

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:43.929
And then I suggest if you actually do want to
go further, these are, I call them Kung Fu mics,

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.189
but the countryman doesn't call them that.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:55.370
But this is a great microphone company, that the lavaliere,
this little B6, the diameter of that mic is smaller

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.659
than the diameter of the wire of my current wireless.

00:12:57.659 --> 00:13:02.219
I mean, incredibly small, incredibly
well made, and they sound great.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.940
And so obviously the smallness means
that they're hidden on the video camera.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.150
And that's a good thing.

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:15.509
Other mic types to use, there's
a shotgun mic, this guy here.

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:17.450
This is a Heil PR40.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.100
This is more for voice podcasting.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.190
This is a handheld mic, which is good for field work.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:30.810
And I put this one up here, the camera mounted mic,
only because if you have to do a camera mounted mic,

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:34.299
which is like the last thing you
want to do, but if you do it,

00:13:34.299 --> 00:13:36.419
Rode makes a pretty nice one, from what I hear.

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:41.110
I don't use it, but it's got a shock mat, which
is this guy here, which absorbs some of the s ound.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.330
And they really thought about, if you
have to have a camera mounted mic,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.230
How it would be a pretty
good one for a reasonable price.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.310
I think they're like 150 bucks or something.

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:50.459
Guys, do you know?

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.250
>> Sounds about right.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:58.049
>> Yeah, so, you know, if you can help it,
don't use the camera mounted mic, is my point.

00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:01.979
Okay, so the mic production process, our
most important tool is a word processor.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.720
Like going back to the whole writing thing.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.800
And so, you know, I write the script, and what I'll do
is I'll actually record what I feel is the first draft,

00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:14.529
I'll actually record into my digital
recorder so I can hear it.

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:15.990
It's all about the auditory things.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.310
It's not about, you know, looking and
hearing are two totally different things.

00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:20.479
Lots of rewrites with that.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:28.129
Lots of changes and, you know, weird onomatopoeias or
things like that you don't notice when you're writing.

00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:34.129
I'll flow them to soundtrack and actually maybe even
do some sound editing to help me edit the script.

00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:38.299
And so that creates the cycle of, you
know, until I get the thing that I want,

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:41.449
which is the script, that's sort of the key.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:49.190
And using the script, and I will record myself using a
little HDV camera by Sony, and like I've been talking about,

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.180
I don't use the onboard mic, I use a shotgun mic.

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:56.479
And then I tie that, in the old
days, when I first did the podcast,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.090
I tied it straight into my iMac
G5 and recorded straight to there.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:07.310
And the whole first series of videogrunt was done with
an iMac G5, which I think is a huge testament, again,

00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:13.129
to Apple that I could produce a high definition
podcast with a quote consumer computer.

00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:16.820
And it was truly amazing that I did that.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.879
It worked really, really well.

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:26.029
Step footage goes into Final Cut, and there I've
captured my on-camera stuff and I've captured the voice.

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:30.850
I've basically captured a script into Final Cut.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.100
So now I've recorded.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.430
Let's go on to post production.

00:15:33.429 --> 00:15:34.620
What you need is a good editor.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:40.490
And I don't mean the actual software, I mean the person,
someone who understands cadence, understands timing, and,

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.690
you know, it's that whole je ne sais quoi
of how you hook up things together.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:49.290
We've got to do sound sweetening
because, again, harping on sound.

00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:53.209
Your motion graphics, thinking of the
screen, thinking of the small composition.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:16:00.139
And then the part that is really not sexy, but it's about
workflow and backup, and that's the part I usually talk

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:02.600
about because no one else likes to talk about that.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:10.620
A little bit on the workflow, so if I consider
my scripts get translated in the Final Cut,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.320
then in terms of the pictures, everything I do
goes into motion and comes back in Final Cut.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.560
So Final Cut is my entry point and my assembly point.

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:24.799
I actually don't do a whole lot of cutting
or special effects or anything in Final Cut.

00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:27.339
It's all pretty done in motion.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:33.910
So a very quick example of this is my on-camera
stuff, the shot for a Final Cut, throw it in motion,

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:39.939
and then I do that in motion too, make the black
and white, add the tag, move me a little bit.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.000
And then that will go right back
into Final Cut onto the timeline.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:53.149
And then for other elements of the show, be they from
older versions of Photoshop Illustrator, or I show you,

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:57.009
which is that blue icon there for the screen capture.

00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:59.509
Everything that I get goes into motion.

00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:05.890
And in motion, I set the right screen size and do all
I want to do and then send those back to Final Cut.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.690
So this is my Final Cut timeline.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.330
Here's a close-up.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:16.119
Again, everything is driven by the script and the
sound, then the voice recording is the script.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:21.689
So, you know, that is my timing, that's my metronome,
that's where all the important cuts are based on.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:27.660
And so on this particular timeline, how I do it is
on these lower rows, that's all the stuff that moves.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.610
This is all the things that move that are from motion.

00:17:30.609 --> 00:17:35.759
And then the parts that don't move I
can create still-frames in Final Cut.

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:39.829
So I'm only doing the rendering of
the parts that are actually moving.

00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:41.639
And then Final Cut does a great job with still frames.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.330
So then I can just drag those along
to meet the timing of the voiceover.

00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:51.240
So that's how I can kind of get a
pretty efficient workflow out of this.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.799
So then when we're done with the pictures, then
we go into sound and do a little sound sweetening.

00:17:56.799 --> 00:18:03.809
This is a quick little illustration using the early
version of soundtrack of my voice as recorded.

00:18:03.809 --> 00:18:05.929
And then I have one that's just slightly modified.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.860
If the sound is working, we'll hear it right now.

00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:09.529
>> This is program five, videogrunt.

00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:11.099
I'm Craig Syverson.

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:16.629
Okay, we've all seen what happens to a wide screen film
when it gets modified for television using pan and scan.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.350
And as many of you, the days of pan and
scan-- this is program five of Video Grunt.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:21.909
I'm Craig Severson.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.790
Okay, we've all seen what happens to a wide screen film
when it gets modified for television using pan and scan.

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:29.159
And as many of you, the days of pan and scan--

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.790
>> So the differences there are pretty subtle,
pretty subtle, pretty minor, but important.

00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:38.230
I use, you know, sound compression to sort of bring the
presence up, some noise reduction for the noise in the room,

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:45.319
very simple sound sweetening, but that's just that little
bit really helps the whole understanding of the show.

00:18:45.319 --> 00:18:48.299
Then this is kind of the workflow idea.

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:57.450
And if this green box sort of represents the amount of data
that I'm creating in production, arbitrary walk of data,

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.220
be it from tape or, you know, from hard drive recording,

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.850
when I get into post production,
that amount of data really gets big.

00:19:03.849 --> 00:19:08.509
And then when I'm actually getting down
to my final edit, the amount of that data

00:19:08.509 --> 00:19:12.009
that that final edit is, it representatively is smaller.

00:19:12.009 --> 00:19:17.039
And then, you know, my actual final output,
of course, is a very, very small little file.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:21.549
But the point that I'm making here is that for
people getting started, especially beginners,

00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:25.440
really understand that your storage
needs are going to go through the roof.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.700
And it really gets big, it really swells really fast.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.360
So be prepared with, you know, hard drives.

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:32.740
Buy a lot of them.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.319
Be prepared.

00:19:33.319 --> 00:19:38.299
And then the other thing, of course, is that you might have
a lot of hard drives, but you've got to back everything

00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:43.500
up because, you know, this time machine
is telling us, but as I've always said,

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.119
you know, one copy of data is just charming.

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:49.709
But it's not-- to me, I don't have data
unless I have at least two copies because if,

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.930
you know, we all know it can go away in a flash.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:58.960
So in production, be really prepared to
get really smart about large scale storage.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.970
You guys deal with a lot of storage, lots.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.740
Yeah, you guys-- this is like amateur
hour compared to what you guys are up to.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:13.019
Moving onto the whole file compression thing,
the best I can say is that it's a dark art,

00:20:13.019 --> 00:20:16.710
that it's something that really requires practice.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.829
I can't give you a formula.

00:20:18.829 --> 00:20:20.240
Every show is different.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.240
And it's just hard, it's just hard.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.579
And the thing with video is that there's
different flavors as well out there on the web.

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:35.849
You can go with Flash or Windows
Media Player, sorry, or QuickTime.

00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:39.799
But you kind of have to make a decision,
I feel, I'm telling people, you know,

00:20:39.799 --> 00:20:43.549
you either offer everything one is kind of my approach.

00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:46.169
It's like you can go down that path.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.440
And I thought well, I'm doing a show about
digital video, I should offer them all.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.740
And then I realize that's crazy.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.099
I'm just going to do H264 because it's the best.

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:59.119
And even if you find settings that work for one
show, it doesn't mean your next episode of a show

00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:01.319
or program is going to work with those same settings.

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:04.799
To optimize your video, indeed.

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:09.220
So, again, here's this idea of all this data.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.839
In my particular flow, I shot everything HDV.

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:14.899
I keep it HDV all the way to the end.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.880
This is going to probably change.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.700
I'm working now with Final Cut 6 and strongly considering
that I'm going to convert everything to Progress 422,

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.779
even though in my particular case,
that will mean a larger amount of data.

00:21:29.779 --> 00:21:34.849
But there's so many advantages to having this
central point of the central hub of a standard

00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:39.439
and Progress 422 really looks "promising that it can be that.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.700
But the point I'm making here is keep the
resolution high all the way to the end.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.630
And then, you know, what I have is the
final output file off of the timeline.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.690
You know, I export out of QuickTime
movie of that complete program.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.500
So that's the stem cell of this program.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.589
That's the thing that's going to, from there,
then I will throw it into a compression software

00:22:00.589 --> 00:22:03.639
from which I can create these other formats.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.130
Of course I have no interest in the
other two, so, you know, for me,

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.440
it's all about how do I make a really good H264 out of it?

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.130
And used Compressor to do that.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:21.240
And in the old days, like before
Compressor 3, 2, before the new Compressor,

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.319
they didn't have really good presets
or settings for the iPod, oddly enough.

00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:31.119
So I actually used this little piece
of shareware, great piece of shareware

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:34.439
with a somewhat unfortunate name called Viddyup.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.180
But it's awesome.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.009
This plasma software makes it $10.

00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:44.259
And it does really, really great encoding.

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:48.099
It has custom settings where you can go in
and monkey with it as well as having presets.

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:53.589
You can do batch processing, which I discovered
completely by accident that it could do that.

00:22:53.589 --> 00:22:58.929
And for a lot of people, too, it didn't require
QuickTime Pro to do a lot of QuickTime Pro like things.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.500
So I recommended this a lot.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:06.880
I do recommend this a lot, especially to, you know, start-up
podcasters who might not have Compressor, but I've always,

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.720
always pushed them to get the Final Cut Suite.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.900
And then these are the particular
settings, which you can't see.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.590
It doesn't matter because they're not right.

00:23:15.589 --> 00:23:19.339
These are the settings from my
show, but it won't work for you.

00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:26.209
In my particular show, the way I've shot it, the way I've--
the elements that I have are very efficient for online.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.660
I go on black and white, but that's not really the point.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.040
The point is that I'm not on camera much.

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:32.409
I use a lot of motion graphics.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.670
And motion graphics, by definition, are very efficient
in being compressed because they're very predictable

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.450
and they don't, you know, it's not like a tree with moving
leaves where you have to recalculate all those frames.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.769
So I could do a really low data rate.

00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:43.859
And my files are really small.

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:45.000
And they look really good.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.890
But that's because I planned it that way from the beginning.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.970
So, again, it's the dark art.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.549
So now we've done our show, we've
compressed it, we have this great file.

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:58.599
Now we want to get it out in the world.

00:23:58.599 --> 00:23:59.419
What's the next step?

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.910
This is the hard part of the blue
part of getting your feed ready.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:10.110
And then this section identity is basically
just a rant on my part about naming.

00:24:10.109 --> 00:24:13.500
But it's really important.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.259
And I don't know if Pete Alcorn is here.

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:17.970
He's the iTunes directory.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:25.089
He rants about this too, which makes me feel good, in
that you have all this opportunity with all this metadata

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:32.609
with the file itself, the ID 3 tags, the information
in your RSSV itself to really optimize the O

00:24:32.609 --> 00:24:35.709
in the SCO, having people find your show.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:42.009
And so-- and to me, it's just asthetically better to be
consistent in your naming because if these things show

00:24:42.009 --> 00:24:49.259
up in a list over time, so you really have to consider that,
sorry, I clicked on that accidentally, each show has its--

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:53.509
each file has its own name, each RSS feed
might actually change the name of the show.

00:24:53.509 --> 00:24:56.299
You know, be consistent with the spacing.

00:24:56.299 --> 00:24:59.930
I mean, I don't have to tell a lot of you this,
but this is, again, this is my personal rant.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.910
Just be aware that, you know, we all know
how things get alphabetized in computers.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.590
And just, you know, be consistent.

00:25:06.589 --> 00:25:11.189
And I rant about this, and then just last
week, I misspelled David's name on a show.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.910
So there you go.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:13.340
What can you do?

00:25:13.339 --> 00:25:16.649
I'm not going to go through the entire section.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.440
I'm going to go up to feed.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.950
Basically, this is, after you've got your thing
ready, how do you get your RSS feed out there?

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:30.150
And you have to build the feed file and find a
good host, maintain the integrity of the feed

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.420
and perhaps add some extra information to the feed.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:40.930
And I use a really great little program called
Podcast Maker, $30, it does a very wonderful job

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:46.580
of creating the whole RSS feed for my show.

00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:52.500
And these are sort of the two screens
that I did just to set it up.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.859
And then the rubber hits the road when I
actually go up and post the file to my server.

00:25:56.859 --> 00:26:03.129
So in this diagram, this is me,
and I've just created a show.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.780
That's the QuickTime movie.

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:06.349
And I used Podcast Maker.

00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:10.299
What I do is I send that up to my host, which is Cache Fly.

00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:13.759
Cache Fly is a content delivery
network that's very, very fast.

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:19.500
And Podcast Maker creates the RSS feed
itself and the media file sits on Cache Fly.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.859
The next thing I do, or I did it initially,
was get an account with the FeedBurner.

00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:29.490
And I told FeedBurner point to this RSS file at Cache Fly.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:34.690
And why? Because what that does is this
gives me this really nice address of,

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.720
you know, where people can find an RSS feed.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.250
And I'll talk a little bit about
why I like that in a second.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:46.839
The next thing I did is I contacted the iTunes directory,
and I said here's my new show, it's at FeedBurner.

00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:50.169
So, you know, go there to get my feed.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:56.660
Then the audience eventually hears about my show, they
go to the podcast directory, which then bounces them

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.860
to FeedBurner, bounces them to Cache Fly.

00:26:58.859 --> 00:27:01.919
Cache Fly then sends my audience the file directly.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:08.370
So that's the whole feedback loop of the RSS
feed in kind of diagramatic form.

00:27:08.369 --> 00:27:14.759
After this initial subscription, my audience now has a
direct relationship with FeedBurner, as you probably know.

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:16.519
The iTunes directory is out of the loop.

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:18.829
They're just there to set up the initial thing.

00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:24.779
They don't continue that monitoring of the flow, you
know, the programs don't ever go through Apple itself.

00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:28.099
They just pointed my audience to my feed.

00:27:28.099 --> 00:27:36.399
The reason I like FeedBurner is that for whatever reason,
but I can't imagine, but if I would ever leave Cache Fly

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:42.110
and change to another service, this means my feed changes.

00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:45.139
And feeds are very, very fussy little irritating things.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.130
They get really upset if things change.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.680
And so you could blow a feed.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.560
You can have a feed break or weird things happen.

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:53.549
And it happens all the time.

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:58.480
And then you've got everybody redownloading
all of your shows again or weird things happen.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.099
It's really easy to make things go wrong on an RSS feed.

00:28:01.099 --> 00:28:07.259
So what I like about it is that if I-- should I ever
change where I'm actually hosting my files themselves,

00:28:07.259 --> 00:28:15.089
as long as I tell FeedBurner that I'm at a
new place, my audience both new and existing,

00:28:15.089 --> 00:28:18.449
are still pointing to the FeedBurner
address, which stays consistent.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.630
So I have a less likely chance
of things going south from there.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.920
I think I'll-- that's kind of the main part.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.200
And then we'll go on to your bits.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.140
>> Sounds great.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.440
>> We're going to take questions at the end.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.120
We're kind of blowing through this now.

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:37.809
In fact, I need to blow through
this now to get to your slides.

00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:46.730
Basically, I build my website in iWeb, goes
up on Media Temple, and then people get--

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.000
the website, the webpage is from Media Temple.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.819
I get the actual media file from my webpage from Cache Fly.

00:28:52.819 --> 00:28:57.099
It's the same piece of data.

00:28:57.099 --> 00:29:04.659
Do you guys want to enter this while I flip
through, what you're going to talk about?

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.150
>> Yeah.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.220
>> My name is Ben Durbin.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:12.789
I work with Kenji at the Pixel Corp. And the Pixel
Corp is a guild for people doing media development

00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:17.230
and post production work, whether that
be visual effects or video podcasting.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:21.069
We're doing research and training
in a bunch of different areas.

00:29:21.069 --> 00:29:25.500
And one of the things that we do is podcasts.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.210
Mac Break is one of our podcasts.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.970
We have a couple at N stable, some audio
podcasts that were mentioned this week in media,

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.190
Mac Break Weekly and some others along those lines.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.789
>> Our new N Mac Break Tech that we're on.

00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:37.759
>> Right, Mac Break Tech.

00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:42.539
So one of the things that we're going to talk about is
just build on Craig's presentation and talk a little bit

00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:46.710
about the things you'll need to consider
once you're going to scale a given project.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:51.440
A lot of projects do start out single
person, sort of a one-man band sort of thing.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.860
And there's all sorts of considerations
you'll need to keep in mind when you start

00:29:56.859 --> 00:29:59.859
to grow that to something larger than that.

00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:05.969
And so welcome this morning to Session
600 on file naming and organization.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.519
I'm going to follow up on Craig's rant.

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:10.970
It's something that bears repeating.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:17.500
As developers, you're probably already sort of in this
sort of structured mindset with how you organize your files

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.900
and how your naming conventions are taken care of.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:26.259
But especially when you start to work with media folks who
maybe aren't thinking in that way, and just in general,

00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:30.029
when you're trying to scale a project where you
have multiple people coming in to work on it,

00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:31.710
you're going to need to keep these things in mind.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:37.660
So one way or one way to sell a naming conventions and
file organization for people who may be somewhat resistant

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.720
to it is it's sort of the precursor for growth.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.180
It becomes very hard to scale beyond just a few people.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.080
And I would argue that six months from now, you might
forget exactly what you were doing naming something,

00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:52.089
whatever you were naming six months ago.

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:53.679
>> That's never happened to me.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:00.740
>> Right. Take advantage of the fact that-- or bear in
mind that your memory is bad and it's going to get worse.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.690
So taking care of these things early
is going to save you in the long run.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:11.420
Now, what some people end up doing or one
of the things that I've found is something

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:20.120
that people punt is I can't organize this stuff until
I've got a clear idea of what everything is going to be,

00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:21.909
what all the assets are and what everything is--

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.130
where everything is going to live
in this space at the given project.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:29.570
And what I would argue is that even if your
names are somewhat arbitrary to begin with,

00:31:29.569 --> 00:31:33.470
as long as they're consistent as developers,
you know that you can easily transform

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.630
that to whatever scheme you end
up with using in the long term.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.460
So as long as you're encouraging the users
to come up with something that is readable,

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.029
I would argue against short codes and numeric-based systems.

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:51.910
You can use those as you get to a larger system or if you've
got a metadata system that is sort of reading those codes

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.890
on behalf of the user and just presenting
them with user friendly information,

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.310
but start out with something that's
just readable and consistent.

00:31:58.309 --> 00:31:59.230
Use full words.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:05.029
Use a consistent delimiter to take
care of fields in your file names.

00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:11.710
And know that file names are a sort
of medium quality solution at best.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.370
They provide you a single view.

00:32:13.369 --> 00:32:19.309
You're sort of baking in an idea of what the fields are
going to be and what their hierarchical relationship is

00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:24.419
and which view you want of that hierarchy at a given point.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.990
But know that that's going to fail you at some
point and know that you're probably going to need

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.430
to move to some sort of metadata solution.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.720
>> And consistency is the big thing now.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.410
>> Consistency is a big thing.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.620
>> Make sure you stay consistent.

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:35.969
>> Exactly.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:40.759
So as you move on to something a little more
robust, you can move to metadata formats

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:46.390
that are either text description files, they could
be XML data that's read by some sort of user system.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:50.340
It could be something as simple
as structured spotlight comments.

00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:52.970
But you will definitely find at some
point you're going to need to move

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.569
on to something that is beyond just the file name.

00:32:55.569 --> 00:33:01.359
So a general trend, just start simple, readable,
consistent, knowing that you can transform that later

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:06.349
and you can enhance that by adding metadata
through some sort of metadata system.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:14.029
So one other thing that you'll run into, and this is
actually a boon to those of us who are trying to scale this

00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:17.720
to more of a couple folks working on
it or working in distributive fashion.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.900
We have folks working on our podcast
that are all over the world.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:27.530
And one of the things that we're starting to
work on now is leveraging the XML file formats,

00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:31.740
both in motion and Final Cut, to start some automation.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:37.870
Now, the last slide was really just a way of getting
everyone on board with the file name because that's one

00:33:37.869 --> 00:33:40.459
of the things that enables this
sort of automation down the road.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.210
We do a lot of blue code in python.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.819
It's one of our preferred languages.

00:33:44.819 --> 00:33:48.079
And the nice thing about Final Cut

00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:55.139
Is that you are able to do programatic
transformations to file.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.600
There's an actual specification,
an XML specification for Final Cut.

00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:04.559
And the way this works is that you're
able to export an XML file from Final Cut.

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:11.969
The new version has even added an enhancement where instead
of having the user have to manually export the XML file,

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:16.379
you can set an option where the XML
file gets baked out at every save.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:21.059
So when you're ready to go in with your
scripts and make transformations to the file,

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:24.639
you can do that without having user interaction there.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:30.569
A couple of things that you can do
with that, you can validate projects.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:35.809
So if there aren't any conventions or structures within the
file itself with the way that you're organizing your bins,

00:34:35.809 --> 00:34:41.539
the way footage should be named, even the way lengths
of different section, time between lower thirds,

00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:45.400
if it's a lower third heavy or an information heavy podcast.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.550
You can validate those things programatically
rather than having someone have

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.519
to open up the file and sort of do a manual.

00:34:50.519 --> 00:34:51.659
Oh, you can do this right here.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:52.789
You can do this right here.

00:34:52.789 --> 00:34:55.279
That can push change requests back to the editor.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.900
You can change the project state.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:02.050
We do a lot of offlining for our podcasts,
especially some of these commercial ones

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.110
that we're starting to work on Cocktails on the Fly.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:08.510
>> And the reason offlining is a big
thing is that it's just too heavy,

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:13.380
even with fast bin to move large data sets
around, especially when you're working with HD.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:19.079
So we do a lot of offlining and sending out edits and
so forth because a lot of our editors are not here

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:21.340
in the bay area, where we're actually based.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.380
So we're sending out edits all around the world

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.030
and basically having editors work on
low res versions and sending it back.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.740
And being able to manage that workflow
can be tricky sometimes.

00:35:29.739 --> 00:35:33.019
But as you maintain some good practices, it helps.

00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:37.820
>> Right. So changing the project state, you get an
edit back, an offline edit that someone has done,

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.630
and you need to reconnect that to all of the
large format media so you can do your final render

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.150
and start the compression process locally.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:49.389
And you can do those sorts of transformations,
changing sequence settings, reconnecting to media,

00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:53.259
you can do that programatically using the XML interface.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.390
And then assembly of per episode content.

00:35:55.389 --> 00:35:58.239
And we're not doing this quite as
much as we used to with Mac Rate,

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:05.379
but in the beginning we were doing a fairly lower
third heavy sort of format, where we would add a bunch

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:12.150
of information beyond just introducing the guests, we would
add a bunch of information and click the links to podcast.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:18.110
And that was done in a distributive fashion as well,
where you would have people reviewing the edit,

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:22.010
and they were sort of tooling around looking
for good pages to link to or good data

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:25.230
to enhance what was being discussed in the podcast.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:30.480
And then they were making time code notes, so we would
have a fairly simple database where you have a bunch

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:36.460
of lower thirds with what the title is going to be,
what the URL is going to be, or on the display URL,

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.240
and then actually where all the people would click on.

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:44.399
You can add that programatically using XML as well so you
could have a track where lower thirds that were being baked

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.780
out of motion or being added to
the timeline at the time stamps

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.850
that were designated by the folks who were creating them.

00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:56.569
So another third party that's working remotely on
this, and then that data flows back into your project.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:01.320
And in general, these examples just show how
you can start to work in a distributive fashion,

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.970
which is becoming increasingly important.

00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:05.419
Not everyone is local to your project.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.610
And this is one of the technologies that enables that.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:14.220
Do you have any data on this photo?

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:19.879
So what we're going to do for the rest of the
presentation is talk about some workflow considerations

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.400
and technical considerations that you'll run into.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.269
This being an intro, we're going to sort
of just tell you about all of the issues.

00:37:27.269 --> 00:37:31.960
These are categories of things that you will run into when
you start to work with video, whether you're a consumer

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.860
of someone else's video or you're creating it yourself.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.019
And then this is sort of going to build for
you a foundation that you can take with you

00:37:39.019 --> 00:37:43.159
to the other more detailed sessions that
dive into all of these topics in depth.

00:37:43.159 --> 00:37:45.549
>> And this is truly just a primer
we're going to go through.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.320
We're going to go through this fast.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.900
Just because we want to get to
questions you guys might have.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.030
But there's a lot of stuff up here.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.480
We could spend days on all the information up here.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.030
And we have.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:58.650
We had a conference not too long ago
called the Gear Media Tech Conference

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:02.010
where we spent basically three
days doing nothing but what you see

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.230
up here pretty much and talking about podcast production.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.510
So there's a lot of stuff involved here.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.300
And we're going to really just
glance over this really quick.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.950
>> So moving on, the things that we're going to talk
about, we're talking about the acquisition formats,

00:38:13.949 --> 00:38:20.689
what's coming out of the cameras, what you should expect to
be handed to you at some time for inclusion in a project.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:25.079
Frame rates, what are the common frame
rates that you'll end up dealing with.

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:32.090
Dealing with pulldown where 24P material, 24
frames per second material, is imbedded in a stream

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.980
that is not 24 frames a second
and having to get that data out.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.369
We'll talk about that.

00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:40.799
Resolutions, some common resolutions that
you'll deal with, and the aspect ratios.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.610
And then the peculiar monster pixel aspect ratio,
which is one of the things you'll also run into.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:53.120
A little discussion on color space, the different
color spaces and how video space deals, or excuse me,

00:38:53.119 --> 00:38:57.650
is differentiated from the traditional RGB
color space that many of us are used to.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:59.639
And then a little bit about codecs.

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:05.129
Codecs you'll expect to be using or finding
useful when you go to compress your content,

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:11.860
whether that be intermediate stuff like we were
talking about for the offline edits or final renders.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:18.309
And then delivery formats, the sort of packages, the
containers like QuickTime that you'll expect to run into.

00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:19.739
>> And a real quick word on this.

00:39:19.739 --> 00:39:24.009
If you don't think this stuff is important or you think,
oh, well, I'm just worried about the final delivery format,

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:30.060
things like that, even if you're only in a small portion of
this, you have to worry about all of these steps in essence

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:37.579
that as a maybe a web developer, if I'm putting my webpage
up and the video looks crappy, why does it look crappy

00:39:37.579 --> 00:39:39.969
up there when it looked great at the acquisition?

00:39:39.969 --> 00:39:41.909
And some of these things come into play.

00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:46.489
So if you understand the basis of where all of
this is coming together, how it fits together,

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:50.279
you can understand why your video that you're
putting up on the web might look totally bad compared

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.210
to the original source of material that you've
acquired early on using maybe a really high-end camera.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.240
>> Because every one of these things affects the end.

00:39:58.239 --> 00:39:58.629
>> Yeah.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.769
>> Every one of them.

00:40:00.769 --> 00:40:03.730
>> So let's talk a little bit about acquisition.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.250
Kenji, do you want to talk a little bit?

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:10.349
>> Yeah. So up here, basically, is just a
quick rundown of different acquisition formats.

00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:16.319
So you have DV NTSC, you've got DV
PAL, you've got DV 2 offline RT.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.350
This is just a sampling of some of the
ones you're going to find inside Final Cut.

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:24.559
It's a small sampling, but these are some of the ones
that you're going to encounter more often than others.

00:40:24.559 --> 00:40:29.029
And what we mean by acquisition formats is what
is the camera acquiring in the first place?

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:35.280
Is it a DV camera, standard, you know, I go down over to
the Sony store, for example, and buy a standard DV camera.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.940
Or is it an HD camera?

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.860
Well, if it's an HD camera, what
format is it recording into?

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.930
For example, HD has several formats.

00:40:41.929 --> 00:40:48.259
There's DVC Pro HD, there's HDV, there's these
different codecs that you have to worry about.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:57.790
Up until just recently, if you were just doing DV video,
standard 720 by 480 or 640 by 480, depending on how you want

00:40:57.789 --> 00:41:01.489
to look at it, video, you pretty much had to worry
about one format, and that was DV, either NTC or

00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:04.739
PAL, whether it was European or
North American standard, basically.

00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:07.769
Beyond that, you were basically dealing in the pro realm.

00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:12.070
Now that's changed, especially
with the consumer level HD cameras.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:17.570
And even if you get it in HDV format,
HDV is not a true format in the sense

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.460
that everyone plays the same game with that format.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.940
Every camera manufacturer has implemented HDV differently.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:28.240
So you can't just apply one rule
set to HDV for every camera format.

00:41:28.239 --> 00:41:30.429
So this is where it starts getting really tricky.

00:41:30.429 --> 00:41:33.989
Now, one of the advantages to the new version
of Final Cut that just came out is it starts

00:41:33.989 --> 00:41:36.979
to handle these formats a lot easier
than the old versions did.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.340
In fact, any other application did.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.200
Up until just recently, it's been a major headache.

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:47.460
I literally would spend a week at a time, if we had
three cameras on the shoot, conforming the formats,

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:53.070
the right formats, getting the footage into a
standard format that I could use for editing purposes.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:42:00.200
>> About HDV is that we came across on a shoot that I did
is I brought my Sony camera one day for a shoot, and I left,

00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:03.319
and then they took my tape and
they couldn't play it back on the--

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.410
>> Yeah, a different camera.

00:42:04.409 --> 00:42:07.159
>> HDV same quote format.

00:42:07.159 --> 00:42:08.269
But it's--

00:42:08.269 --> 00:42:10.860
>> Yeah, it gets interesting.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:16.450
So beyond the acquisition formats, you
want to move on into basically frame rates.

00:42:16.449 --> 00:42:19.259
Now, what I mean by frame rates is how you're recording it.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.120
Most of you are probably familiar
with the frame rates that are up here.

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:25.670
But, again, there can be some differences here.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:28.200
And some of you might not understand
the differences between progressive

00:42:28.199 --> 00:42:31.039
and interlaced and the way systems are capturing it.

00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:36.619
I'm here to tell you right now that unless you're using
a very special camera, everything you're capturing

00:42:36.619 --> 00:42:41.190
on any consumer level or even pro consumer
level camera is actually interlaced footage,

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:47.889
even if it says it's progressive scan, you have to play some
tricks to get it to an actual true progressive frame format.

00:42:47.889 --> 00:42:53.920
So even though we say 23.98p up there
or we say 24p, these are probably going

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.500
to be interlaced formats inside
the camera as you're acquiring it.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:04.059
And basically it's just a series of different
frame rates you're going to see out there.

00:43:04.059 --> 00:43:08.489
A lot of video professionals are really
excited about 24p because of different reasons.

00:43:08.489 --> 00:43:14.649
One of the biggest reasons for delivery is that actually
the nice thing is that it makes a smaller file in the end.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:21.480
So it might be a little more headache up front to
deal with 24p or 24p acquisition, but in the end,

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.730
you have a smaller data file and it actually
works very nicely in Apple PD in a way.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:30.050
24p footage is going to work a lot better
because you can get more data into the Apple TV

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:33.360
than a true 30p or a 60i program basically.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:39.630
>> One other reason you'll find folks excited about the
24p is that they're doing narrative or dramatic content.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:43.320
Getting the film look has been one of those holy
grails that everyone has wanted for a video,

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.160
and there are various tricks and
successes and failures along those lines.

00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:53.869
But getting that 24 frame look, the kinetic look
of it anyway, is something that people are after.

00:43:53.869 --> 00:44:00.889
And you'll notice that even some of the pro consumer cameras
I guess you'd call it, the new Canon HV20 that just came

00:44:00.889 --> 00:44:04.299
out is actually using a progressive CMOS chip.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.519
And it will do a 24 frame mode$.

00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:11.269
Now, like Kenji said, what's coming out of your
camera, since it's HDV, is still an interlaced--

00:44:11.269 --> 00:44:14.710
it's an interlaced format, 60 frames a second,
and we'll get to this in just a second,

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:18.579
but there's a method by which you
extract that 24 frame materi$al.

00:44:18.579 --> 00:44:23.130
But you can get, even now you're starting to get
progressive material from some of the lower end cameras.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:32.690
Until recently, it's been the domain of higher end, the
Sony CineAltas and these more money than we have cameras.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:36.030
>> So pull bend, which Ben was just alluding to.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.740
So getting from 30 to 24.

00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:43.769
Now, even if the camera says it's
acquiring at 24p or some wei$rd 24, it's not.

00:44:43.769 --> 00:44:45.880
Again, it's requiring in something else.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.190
So this is just a quick rundown, a
little geek bit talking about this.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:54.610
And the reason I want to bring this up is that a lot of
these new cameras that people are shooting with, HV20,

00:44:54.610 --> 00:45:01.380
which is probably one of the most popular new entry level
HD cameras, it's a Canon camera, it's a great camera.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.750
You can actually hook up.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.219
There's adapter kits to hook 35 millimeter lenses to it.

00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:08.259
You can get all these great attachments for it.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:08.720
>> On HV20?

00:45:08.719 --> 00:45:09.049
That's cool.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:13.350
>> But the problem is going from
the 24p into the final mode.

00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:15.110
So I want to walk through this.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:22.090
And it's basically-- it has changed a little bit because
the new version of Final Cut it handles is better.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:29.220
But 24p source, and I just want to walk you through this
real quick, if we look at it as a series of frames, A, B,

00:45:29.219 --> 00:45:33.239
C and D, that information gets
recorded actually in the 60i.

00:45:33.239 --> 00:45:36.759
So that actually gets recorded into field information here.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:42.060
And this is how it actually gets broken up in a standard
what's called 23 pull bend when you break that up.

00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:46.659
So you actually have the A frame getting
interlaced, in essence, twice together.

00:45:46.659 --> 00:45:50.069
The B frame gets interlaced twice together as a whole frame.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.470
Then it gets combined with the B and C frame.

00:45:52.469 --> 00:45:53.980
The C frame gets a whole frame.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:46:02.849
And then the D frame gets interlaced
again on the disk, interlaced again.

00:46:02.849 --> 00:46:06.440
So when you reverse that, you're, again, pulling frames out.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:10.320
And this is what the reverse telecine
or pull-down of that means.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:14.030
Is it you're recombining frames to get a 24p source out?

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:17.550
So the top is the original 24 frame acquisition.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:23.800
The intermediate is how it gets recorded to tape
and then how it gets pulled back down into the 24p.
$

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.890
Now, a lot of you are probably familiar
with the DVX if you've done any video.

00:46:26.889 --> 00:46:28.029
It was really popular.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:31.470
It was the first consumer level
digital video camera that did 24p.
$

00:46:31.469 --> 00:46:35.059
It used a different pattern, which
is called the 2332 pull down.

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:39.130
And I'm just going to run through this really
quick just so we can get to some questions.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:43.970
But this is basically, again, how
that gets broken apart back into 24p.

00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:46.339
So you can start to see this is getting kind of complex.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.809
You're like A B B B C. This is stuff
that really you don't have to worry

00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:52.750
about as much anymore because the new version of Final Cut.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.530
There's some things that are taken
care of for you a little bit more

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.180
that in the past you had to run through all these hoops.

00:46:58.179 --> 00:46:59.750
So it's a little easier.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.639
>> What happens to those Bs and Cs?

00:47:01.639 --> 00:47:03.129
>> They just get left out.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:09.700
All to make it compatible with the current video technology
so that video engineers didn't have to reengineer all

00:47:09.699 --> 00:47:12.369
of their equipment and change the
standards and things like that.

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:16.269
Now, the Sony V1U is an interesting example.

00:47:16.269 --> 00:47:17.509
It's a higher end camera.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:18.350
It's prosumer.

00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:19.949
It's about $4,500.

00:47:19.949 --> 00:47:22.960
Actually, you can get it probably for less than that now.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.940
It's a great camera.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.510
It has one of the best looks we've found
on a consumer level camera hands down.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.370
It's got some great features in it.

00:47:30.369 --> 00:47:32.389
But again, it works a little differently.

00:47:32.389 --> 00:47:36.539
When we first started using it doing editing, we
were getting all these weird patterns and no one

00:47:36.539 --> 00:47:38.230
on the internet could figure out how to use it.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:43.000
You shot in 24p, but no one knew how
to get it out into a delivery format.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.190
And it takes some tricks.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:49.309
When you look at it as a pure QuickTime movie, so
if I went into Final Cut and I was to capture it,

00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:53.739
this is actually how it would look as a QuickTime
movie is you would see three whole frames.

00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:56.750
And actually, it's not quite-- you would
see three whole frames, I should say.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:02.590
And you would see two interlaced
frames in the way it gets broken up.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.090
And you have to play some tricks
going through and cutting it up.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.050
Now, the new version of Final Cut, actually,
I haven't had a chance to test it yet,

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.730
but supposedly it fully supports the V1U
now so you don't have to worry about this

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.079
if you're using the new version of Final Cut.

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:18.009
But if you have someone who captured
footage using a V1U before the new version

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.780
of Final Cut, this doesn't quite work.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:24.840
You'll get these weird frame rates, you'll
get these weird interlacing problems.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:31.760
Just be aware that a lot of these new
HD cameras, you'll see these problems.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.700
Okay?

00:48:33.699 --> 00:48:34.849
So resolution.

00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:38.860
Really quick, there are different
resolutions most of you are probably with.

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:42.390
640 by 480 and 720 by 480.

00:48:42.389 --> 00:48:47.629
The 720 by 480 is really what most people,
what most digital cameras are acquiring.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:49.869
Your television set is 640 by 480.

00:48:49.869 --> 00:48:51.130
And actually, it's not even that.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:56.380
It's actually half that when you really get into how it
all works and how it signals coming down your TV set.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.860
That's the great thing about things like
Apple TV and new digital TV formats.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.780
They're using these true HD formats.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.519
Apple TV is using the 1280 by 720 format.

00:49:05.519 --> 00:49:08.800
And then on the high end, you have 1920 by 1080.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.000
So when you hear 1080i or 1080p,
it's actually a 1920 by 1080  image.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.150
Now, the i or the p is the big thing,
whether it's interlaced or progressive.

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:21.400
So if you're looking at a nice high end display,
you want to get the best picture quality.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.760
You want the best overall delivery.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.000
You want a 1080p screen.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.849
But those are still relatively expensive.

00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:31.569
And really, most people are going
to be looking at the 720p format.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:38.210
In fact, most of you who get HD cable or get HD over
satellite, you're actually only getting 720p usually.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:40.559
There are very few people actually doing 1080i.

00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:45.980
And there's no one really doing 1080p broadcast right now.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:52.869
>> It's worth mentioning that even if your output resolution
right now is not one of those higher end HD formats,

00:49:52.869 --> 00:49:54.920
the demand for that, of course, is growing.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:02.619
So be thinking in terms of future proofing your content
by rendering out to the full HD spec, if you can,

00:50:02.619 --> 00:50:05.210
if you're capturing at a resolution
that will hold up to that.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:11.179
And knowing that six months down the line, a year down the
line, you'll probably be starting to put that content down.

00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:12.960
Mac Break is a good example.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.329
We put out a full 1920 by 1080 version of the podcast.

00:50:16.329 --> 00:50:22.819
And folks with larger monitor and a CPU to
handle the H264 at that resolution love it.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.559
>> And that's a good point.

00:50:23.559 --> 00:50:27.549
We master all of our footage now at full 1080 quality.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:29.320
So this frame actually gives you an idea.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.850
The full image here is that full 1920 by 1080 pixels.

00:50:32.849 --> 00:50:35.739
The blue outline box is at 1280 by 720.

00:50:35.739 --> 00:50:37.759
That would be a 720p image.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:44.150
The yellow box is showing you what standard
DV cameras would acquire, a 720 by 480 image.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:50.590
And then the smaller one is the good old standard
NTSC 640 by 480 image there, to give you an idea.

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.769
And most of you have seen pictures like this.

00:50:52.769 --> 00:50:58.230
But the thing is that even if we're delivering
down to a 320 by 240 small web image,

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:02.990
we're still mastering in this full image
quality to maintain the maximum resolution.

00:51:02.989 --> 00:51:06.539
One of the things that happens when you
take large images and you scale them

00:51:06.539 --> 00:51:09.380
down is you get that nice image quality still.

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.070
You have more data to work with there.

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:15.240
It might take longer to process your footage
or it might take longer to crunch through it,

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:19.049
but your end result is going to be much better
than if you start out with an image that's 640

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.750
by 480 and you're going down to 320 by 240.

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:26.880
So whenever possible, you want to get your
footage in a maximum quality possible.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.130
So pixel aspect ratio is really quick.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:31.860
Square versus non square.

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:36.269
This is really a difference between
acquisition and final delivery.

00:51:36.269 --> 00:51:40.449
Most people are not going to worry about this on
their computer because you're just aware of pixels.

00:51:40.449 --> 00:51:42.189
So one-to-one ratio.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:46.429
And if that image would represent the square pixel ratio.

00:51:46.429 --> 00:51:48.809
Then you get all these non square ratios.

00:51:48.809 --> 00:51:53.090
So you get DV, which is a .9.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:52:01.240
You get DV, which is a .9 aspect ratio.

00:52:01.239 --> 00:52:04.939
So a lot of you might be familiar in the
old days when you put graphics up on screen,

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.059
circles would also look like ovals, things like that.

00:52:07.059 --> 00:52:09.190
It's because of your pixel aspect ratio.

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:10.559
But then there's all these other ones.

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:15.239
There's a 1.2 pixel aspect ratio, which is a wide screen DV.

00:52:15.239 --> 00:52:22.349
This is when you take a standard consumer level camera, you
shoot wide screen, and it's still a standard NTSC signal,

00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:28.769
but they're playing this pixel trick to make the image
wide screen basically into your standard DV camera.

00:52:28.769 --> 00:52:35.509
On the higher end, on the 720p, where
HDV uses a 1.33 pixel aspect ratio.

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:39.640
And this is, again, because of the way they're using it.

00:52:39.639 --> 00:52:42.670
Now, when these camera manufacturers
say they're shooting true HD,

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:45.760
there is no one shooting true HD except on the high end.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:51.570
They're all shooting some smaller resolution,
and they up res it to a 1920 by 1080 resolution.

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:56.710
So, for example, HDV actually shoots at 1440 by 1080.

00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:02.470
And DVC Pro HD shoots at 1280 by 1080.

00:53:02.469 --> 00:53:05.750
So it's a 1.5 pixel aspect ratio.

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:11.699
Now, cameras like the HV20 actually has-- is one of
the first cameras that has a true 1920 by 1080 sensor,

00:53:11.699 --> 00:53:15.939
meaning that the actual acquisition chip is a true HD chip.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.480
But again, because this is getting recorded
into the camera, it's getting crunched down,

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.690
it's getting reprocessed, things like that.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:25.530
One of the first cameras that really
is going to be usable at a less

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.850
than quarter million dollar price that's
coming out soon is the red camera.

00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:32.929
Many of you might have heard about coming
from the founder of Oakley.

00:53:32.929 --> 00:53:34.869
That camera could revolutionize things.

00:53:34.869 --> 00:53:39.069
And its resolution is four times the highest HD right now.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:41.940
It's 4096 by 2048.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:49.130
You could fit four 1920 by 1080 HD resolution images
in the same area as a red camera's acquisition.

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:50.970
>> Is it square pixel?

00:53:50.969 --> 00:53:52.869
>> And it's square pixel.

00:53:52.869 --> 00:53:55.170
So it will change the game.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:58.269
If you haven't heard about red, you're
going to start hearing a lot about it.

00:53:58.269 --> 00:54:00.429
They're getting ready to ship those cameras.

00:54:00.429 --> 00:54:05.309
And it will probably revolutionize
the video industry single handedly.

00:54:06.659 --> 00:54:08.879
Color space.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.480
Yes, color space is interesting.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:15.639
>> One other thing to talk about on the last slide,
too, is not so much to scare you about this bunch

00:54:15.639 --> 00:54:21.940
of different pixel aspect ratios, and your stuff is going
to be stretched or squeezed without you asking for it.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:27.220
One thing to keep in mind is that you may end up with source
footage that's that way and knowing that you're probably,

00:54:27.219 --> 00:54:31.819
unless you're going back out for broadcast,
you're going to be going out as square pixels.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:36.970
So one thing to keep in mind is that even if you have
one of these strange sort of non square resolutions

00:54:36.969 --> 00:54:42.719
that you're working with coming in, you just choose
the appropriate square pixel resolution coming out,

00:54:42.719 --> 00:54:46.599
whether that be the 720p or the 1080p, that sort of thing.

00:54:46.599 --> 00:54:47.519
So color space.

00:54:47.519 --> 00:54:50.900
There's always a need for compression, as we know.

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:56.809
And one of the ways that they've done this with
video signals in the past is to split up the signal

00:54:56.809 --> 00:55:02.650
into its luminance, its light and dark
values, and then the colors separately.

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:07.880
So RGB, we're used to the sort of additive color model
where you've got three channels, you add a certain amount

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.519
of each and you get your resulting color.

00:55:10.519 --> 00:55:16.659
Going back to days of black and white television, that
was just a single luminance channel, light and dark.

00:55:16.659 --> 00:55:22.489
The two others that you'll run into, and these acronyms
are just there for demonstration purposes, is to--

00:55:22.489 --> 00:55:26.829
when you split the color out, you're able to do something

00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:30.619
where you're scaling the color channels
to reduce the bandwidth of the signal.

00:55:30.619 --> 00:55:37.599
And the reason that you're able to do this is that we are
more sensitive to changes in light than we are in color.

00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:39.699
We're more rods than cones.

00:55:39.699 --> 00:55:44.480
So the trick that they used is to split--
there's a way to transform an RGB signal

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.250
into the luminance and two color channels.

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:52.389
And the two color channels are differences between the
luminance and the red and the blue, if memory serves.

00:55:52.389 --> 00:55:56.969
But in any case, you'll end up with these
different color spaces for your video signals.

00:55:56.969 --> 00:56:07.149
So when you're getting to seeing things like, I'm going
to skip one here, we'll get back to that in just a sec,

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:12.760
so you'll see these sorts of designations when you're
talking about the color depth of a given camera.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.330
You'll see 4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:1:1, 4:2:0.

00:56:16.329 --> 00:56:21.880
What those represent is that scaling of those color
channels to reduce the bandwidth for a given video stream.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:28.349
So 4:4:4, there's some historical
stuff behind why 4 is 100 percent.

00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:30.839
But for our purposes, 4 is unscaled.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.190
It's 100 percent resolution.

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:36.789
And the first of those in that triad is your luminance.

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:39.389
And then the second one is your first color channel.

00:56:39.389 --> 00:56:41.670
The third one is your second color channel.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:45.539
So the high end codecs and high
end cameras, like the CiniAltas,

00:56:45.539 --> 00:56:50.050
can capture two codecs that have no
degradation of the color channels.

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:55.600
And this is especially important if you're doing
things like color different keying for visual effects.

00:56:55.599 --> 00:56:59.139
Since that is relying on the color
information to pull your key,

00:56:59.139 --> 00:57:01.420
you can get edge artifacting with these lower color depths.

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.720
That's why DV has historically
been hard to key, for example.

00:57:05.719 --> 00:57:11.689
So there are custom codecs in some of these high end video
card manufacturers that will capture the 4:4:4:4 color data.

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:16.170
Now you're going to end up needing raids
that can capture at a speed that CiniAlta,

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:19.670
for example, captures at 190 megabytes per second.

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.769
So you need some hardware to take care of these.

00:57:22.769 --> 00:57:28.130
But know that there are codecs out there, capture
codecs that will preserve all of your color information.

00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:30.280
>> And you can capture new a codec.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:38.120
But if your camera doesn't acquire the video at
that color sub sampling, then it doesn't matter.

00:57:38.119 --> 00:57:42.609
So there's only really a couple cameras out there
that are actually going to capture 4::4:4 video.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:46.590
There's the F950, which is a qPuarter million dollar set-up.

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.360
The new red that's coming out.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:52.150
A couple cameras along those lines are going to do 4:4:4.

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.010
Most cameras in the high end are only doing 4:2:2.

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:58.250
And prematurium (phonetic) below that is doing 4:2:0 or 4:1:1.

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:04.460
>> So the 4:2:2 designation means that
the color channels are being scaled,

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:09.079
I believe it's horizontally, so you
are losing some color data there.

00:58:09.079 --> 00:58:15.210
Now, perceptually, if you're not doing-- if it's not a green
screen shoot and you're not doing a key or doing some sort

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:20.820
of alpha channel generation off of that,
you will most likely not see the difference.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.340
If it's just out in the field shooting,
there's nothing wrong with 4:2:2.

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:29.410
In fact, the 4:2:0, which is just a sort of funky
designation to say that they scale, instead of just scaling

00:58:29.409 --> 00:58:35.009
on one direction, they're scaling on both
directions, X and Y on the color channels.

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:39.640
Even HDV footage, you probably will not notice
a big difference because of the color scaling.

00:58:39.639 --> 00:58:43.269
It's just a way of crunching down
the signal to get it to tape.

00:58:43.269 --> 00:58:47.500
And then lastly, 4:1:1, just because it's
something that's been used in the past.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:51.670
If you're using standard definition and
DV footage, you're going to be on 4:1:1.

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:56.680
So the color channels are actually scaled to one
quarter of the resolution of the luminance image.

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:07.710
>> Just really quickly, codecs, your
delivery format, the codec magic.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:11.550
>> So there are a couple different
ways to think about the codecs.

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:13.510
You want to think about the codecs that are going to be used

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:16.430
when you're capturing the footage
or when it's delivered to you.

00:59:16.429 --> 00:59:20.669
Photo jpeg is one that's worth mentioning
because you can use it for offlining.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:26.789
There's a spec called offline RT, which is
pretty much a photo jpeg compressed video stream

00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:29.250
that is at a small resolution.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:32.000
We use 3D4 by 216, I believe.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.690
And this is what allows us to get a couple hundred
megabyte files that we can throw to our editors,

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:40.920
have them do a remote edit and send us back the Final
Cut profile, and then we reconnect to something,

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.829
whether it be the CiniAlta or HDV or something like that.

00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:48.590
We connect to the large footage that's way
too big to try and move out to everybody,

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:51.670
and possibly even with the CiniAlta, too big to edit on it.

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:52.960
It just won't play back well.

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.730
>> And Final Cut has this built in as an offline format.

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:58.690
It's actually what the basis of their offline format is.

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:01.760
>> Right. And then DV and HDV, which we've covered.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.700
Now, AIC is interesting, and it's Apple Intermediate Codec.

01:00:04.699 --> 01:00:11.849
And what that is is it's an all full-frame codec where
it's like a photo jpeg, where each frame is compressed,

01:00:11.849 --> 01:00:18.460
but there's no interframe compression
like you'd find with MPEG2, MPEG 4HH264.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:23.030
And what that allows for is on lower end machines, you
can get better playback than you would if it's trying

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:26.550
to do the HDV stream where it's got to
take the change information and compute

01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:28.230
that on the fly when you're scrubbing around.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:31.699
So it's worth mentioning AIC is another one that's in there.

01:00:31.699 --> 01:00:34.619
DVC Pro HD is a higher end acquisition format.

01:00:34.619 --> 01:00:38.259
The electronic news gathering camera's shooting this.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.830
And it's something that you can use.

01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:44.639
In our project, we use it as the codec
to conform all of the other codecs.

01:00:44.639 --> 01:00:47.449
This is before the sort of open timeline
stuff in the new version of Final Cut.

01:00:47.449 --> 01:00:48.789
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:53.329
>> And then the new and exciting
one, of course, Apple ProRes 422.

01:00:53.329 --> 01:01:00.029
And what's interesting about this is it's a low
bandwidth codec that has very high visual quality.

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:03.670
You can use it either as something to
push all of your footage too to use

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:06.019
as an intermediate codec and everything conformed.

01:01:06.019 --> 01:01:08.800
And it's also light enough to be edited on a laptop.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.539
So you can get very high visual quality.

01:01:10.539 --> 01:01:14.300
The thing about the photo jpeg and the offline
RT, I'm not sure if anyone's seen footage

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.920
like this before, but it is very highly degraded.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.079
>> And it looks crunchy.

01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:19.349
>> Yeah, very crunchy.

01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:24.949
It's hard even to see numbers on the smart slate or
something like that, if you're trying to do sinking.

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:30.859
So the nice thing about the ProRes is for
a very low, relatively low bandwidth rate,

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.579
you're getting very high quality
footage that can be edited on a laptop

01:01:34.579 --> 01:01:39.309
with a FireWire 800 drive or something like that.

01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:41.369
>> Yeah, and we'll jump onto some questions.

01:01:41.369 --> 01:01:46.769
Real quick, I won't talk too long on it, is
the output format H.264, which must be our--

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:54.019
we're familiar with QuickTime, MPEG4, MPEG2,
and many of you might not know, or maybe you do,

01:01:54.019 --> 01:01:58.259
that the flash video actually uses on to codec.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.140
So it's their own codec or they bought the codec.

01:02:01.139 --> 01:02:05.739
It's a nice codec, but we actually don't
prefer it as much as the H.264, personally.

01:02:05.739 --> 01:02:10.559
>> H.264, for size versus quality, is still
sort of king of the hill in our opinion.

01:02:10.559 --> 01:02:13.650
>> And real quick, I want to mention on
this before we drip to some questions is

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.200
that delivery format is different than codec.

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:18.779
Your codec is the way it's encoded.

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:24.030
The container, which actually holds
that codec, is your delivery format.

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:28.600
It's a dot movie, it's a dot MP4,
it's a DVD, it's a .swf file.

01:02:28.599 --> 01:02:31.989
So don't confuse your codec with the delivery format.

01:02:31.989 --> 01:02:35.809
There's a container format, and then
the encoding within that container.

01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:41.340
The worst of these that drives us all crazy
is AVI, because there is no standard for it.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.579
You have no idea what's inside this container.

01:02:43.579 --> 01:02:45.329
It is just a pain in the butt.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:48.909
So we personally hate AVI most of the time.

01:02:48.909 --> 01:02:53.449
>> QuickTime is also an architecture, so
it also will play back the other format.

01:02:53.449 --> 01:02:54.569
>> Yeah.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.860
>> But adds to the confusion a little bit.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.140
>> So we're going to go ahead and jump past this.

01:02:59.139 --> 01:03:01.819
We want to see if you guys have some
questions in the last couple minutes here.
