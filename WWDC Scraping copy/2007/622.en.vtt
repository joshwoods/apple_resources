WEBVTT

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.570
>> And joining me today is going to be Alex Lindsay of
Pixel Corpss whose going to talk about all things podcasting,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.710
so without further ado, I'd like to invite Alex on stage.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.650
( Applause )

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.129
>> Thank, thank you very much.

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.250
This is, this is a really big stage.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.870
( Laughter )

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.990
And a really, really big screen.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.390
I, I was working on this thing and I, and I
didn't realize how big the screen was going to be,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.890
so hopefully, hopefully the graphics work out well.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.579
So, so let me give you a little bit of background.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.250
The Pixel Corpss, we make a lot of podcasts.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:54.480
I think we make a total of about 15 podcasts,
both internally and then also for exterior clients.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.250
A sampling of some of the stuff that we do internally.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.859
We do one called This Week in Media.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.260
And we're actually going to have some of the guy from
This Week in Media up later at the audio podcast

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.530
on every week, whatever's going on in the media area.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.310
We have the VFX Show, which is I used to work
at Lucas Film and Industrial Light and Magic.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.969
So me and a bunch of other guys talk about
visual effects and, and that type of thing.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.560
We've also got MacBreak, which some of you might,
how many people have actually seen MacBreak,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.469
just so I get a sense of, okay, so you know what that is.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:30.549
And, and then we also have Inside the Black
Box which is more of how to do visual effects.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.439
Other ones that you probably haven't seen
yet are, are some of our client podcasts.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.670
We work, there's a, there's a lot of folks that are working
in, that are you know raise money to build a network.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.730
And they need the show is actually produced
for them, so they hire us to do that.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.800
And so some of those are one called Local
Wisdom, which shows you where the locals go.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.370
There's also Cocktails on the Fly, it's great to
have a show that shows you how to make mixed drinks.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.609
Very rough to have the bartender showing you in the office.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.040
The, we also have Food Science which just shows you the,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.030
kind of the geeky side of, of food
and why food does what it does.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.650
And one called I am Blackness, which is all about Africans

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.260
and Africans Americans showing kind of
a different side of, of that culture.

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:27.030
So this is handful of them and, and so because we've done
a lot of this stuff, we've really started to learn a lot

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.449
about the, you know the podcasting realm.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.979
We started doing podcasts before there were podcasts.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.509
We just called them weekly web content.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:42.750
And that, we started back in 2001 doing
stuff for my other company called DB Garage.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.740
So let's see, the first thing, and
by the way, this is the end of WWDC

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.140
and you're going to find this one's a little lighter
than most of the ones I've been sitting through.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.309
So hopefully this will give you guys
a little bit of time to breathe.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.009
We're mostly going to talk a lot about conceptual things.

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.840
So what we want to do is talk a little bit
about how to think about what's coming.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.349
If you're thinking about building a podcast.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.180
How many people here actually do a podcast?

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.700
Okay, so a lot of you do podcasts.

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.369
How many people are thinking about doing a podcast?

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.330
Okay, well, I guess that is pretty much everybody right?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.830
You, you wouldn't be here if that wasn't the case.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.240
So the first thing is to realize
that we're not CBS, we're not NBC,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.000
we're not you know all these, you
know we're not a big network.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.919
We're not trying to do Lost.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.039
We're not trying to do 20/20, we're
not trying to 60 Minutes.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.719
We need to find a niche that we can serve well

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.620
And that's one of the key things is
to think about what we can serve.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.800
When you think about CBS, they need to have five to seven
million viewers minimum or they're going to cancel the show.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.520
That's five to seven million people have to watch it.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.969
When we think about niche markets, what you
want to be thinking about is 20000 to 200000.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:59.849
You know that is a much, much smaller area, a much
more focused view on what's actually going on.

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.430
Now that may not seem like that many people.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.060
You're like, well how can I build a business
if it's so small and CBS is so large?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.840
Well when you walk into, into Borders Bookstore and you look
at a magazine rack, what you're seeing is a niche of most

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.199
of those magazine are somewhere
between 20000 and 200000 readers.

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.219
And, and when I, when I look at that, I actually
walk in and I see all these niche markets that need

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.880
to be served with video, and it gives me a headache.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.610
So, so anyway.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.270
That's, those are the kind of niche markets.

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:28.319
Those are niche markets.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.029
That's, that's the precursor to what we're doing.

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:34.759
The next thing is that you, a lot of
the stuff that people are really looking

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.759
for is nonfictional and I'll talk about why in a second.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:47.269
And then finally if I can get my, my
little controller to do the next one.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:48.289
Is a long shelf life.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.290
If you're going to make these things, now, we I
just said that after we do This Week in Media.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.910
But, but you want a larger, a long
shelf life for a lot of the stuff.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.000
The thing to remember is the people aren't tuning
in this week to look at it most of the time.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.149
So a lot of our other shows, we think about how do we
have it be good for the next six month or the next year

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:08.289
of the next two years because people
will actually download them.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:15.230
We had I think probably, I was looking at one of our
shows this last week that we released 18 months ago

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.250
and it had 1500 or 2000 downloads last week.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.589
You know to give you kind of a sense of, you know.

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:22.659
And it, it's long over.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.970
There's no, there's no good reason
to download that podcast.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:33.420
So now, the, the thing that we want to look at when we look
at where we want to, where we're going with, with podcasting

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:40.000
and where we're going with this kind of content, is what
I would consider a new market versus a mature market.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.550
The new market is, is video.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.620
Remember these are video cassettes,
just in case you're wondering.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.379
Yeah, these were, these were this
thing that they put video on

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.899
and they went extinct a couple of
years before the DVD went extinct.

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:56.319
So.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.000
( Laughter )

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.930
So, and so anyway.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.709
These, this is 90 percent fiction.

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:08.659
So most of what's happened over the last 100 years,
and 100 years in the land of content is very old.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.920
I mean we started 10000 years ago scrawling and
scrolling in stone, and that was, that was content.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.319
Wasn't very interactive, but it had a long shelf life.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:26.079
So, so the, the thing is that you have this new market
that for some reason got into this, because of Hollywood,

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:30.839
because of that's where the money
was, was 90 percent fiction.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:32.599
This is 90 percent nonfiction.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.150
When you walk into a bookstore, what
you see is 90 percent of the content is

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:39.469
about things that people are passionate about.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.940
It's about what they're interested in.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:46.129
It's about business or cars or philosophy
or whatever it is, but it's not,

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:52.149
the fiction section is one little section
inside of a very, very large bookstore.

00:06:52.149 --> 00:07:00.129
The difference between these two and, and this is what we're
looking at is that the, the tension as I would, as I would,

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:08.600
from a physics point of view, between 90 percent on end and
90 percent the other, is what I call a market opportunity.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:16.689
So this is where there's going to be an enormous amount of
content that needs to be produced for nonfictional content.

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:23.219
Now what, what I mean by that, that's the how tos, that's
the historical, that's the documentary style pieces.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.290
These are all things that people are going to be interested in

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:31.770
I believe that we're going to get to a point where
we assume that we can learn things through video.

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:37.109
You know we're going to be a little perturbed if we want to learn
how to do calculus or we want to learn how to you know a lot

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.580
of other things and we can't find a video on it.

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:44.099
And, and it's really, really important because we
can actually assimilate the information much quicker

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.560
and much younger when we get it in video format.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.079
I, my daughter when she was 10 I was asking her what she
was learning in school and she was, and she said, well,

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:55.759
I been really learning a lot about string theory.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:57.709
You know she's, she's 10 years old, you know.

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.899
And I said, so, so what is string theory?

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:01.239
And she went into describing it.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.800
There's this, you know there's quantum physics and then
there's the big bang and, and they don't really get along,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.480
but there's this theory that if you keep on going into
the molecules and you go in, you keep on going in,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.150
you end up with little strings of energy.

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:14.529
And this ties together the big bang
and the, and the, and she, I mean,

00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:16.569
she described it better than most college students.

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:19.959
You know and I asked her you know how she learned that.

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:22.099
And she was like, Nova.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.930
You know and, and there was this Nova thing
on, on string theory that tied it all together.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:31.720
Now she's a 10 year old that understands
something that most graduate students had a,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.800
would have a hard time describing
because she got it visually.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:41.169
She didn't have to have her ability to accumulate the
ability to read and all the, all the historical stuff

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.599
to be able to actually absorb that information.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.149
Because of that, there's going to be an enormous
pressure, especially when we look at elearning

00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:52.500
for lots and lots and lots of video content.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.639
So another thing to think about
when you're when you're starting

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:59.259
to put this stuff together is the frequency
of the kind of thing that you're doing.

00:08:59.259 --> 00:09:02.230
And I'm really only talking about two different frequencies.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.610
Because in my opinion, these are the only two that work.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.909
Which is either once a week or once a day.

00:09:08.909 --> 00:09:11.870
Once a day you really have to be committed.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.879
That you're going to, you're going to actually produce that.

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:16.960
We've tried once a day and it's painful.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:23.840
So you can do it but you have to really think about
how to build an efficient pipeline to make it work.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.560
Once a week is probably the best if
you're getting started in podcasting.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:31.149
There's a lot of people that put out pod
casts kind of whenever they finish them.

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:33.939
Or they put a couple out, then they
wait for a couple months and they,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.280
and the big thing is you're not really
going to build a listener ship that way.

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:39.699
You're not, or a viewer ship that way.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.150
You're not going to build a following unless you're regular.

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:46.350
And I say that as we, we've gone up and down
of being regular, you know back and forth.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.110
We, we do it mostly once a week for most of our shows.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.500
But that is the, that's a much better approach

00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:00.669
And so you, the key when I talk about that is that you
want to think about how you're going to design a set of shows.

00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:06.819
For instance, our new shows now, from learning
from all the other podcasts we've done is

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:15.230
that we generally have four shows done in the can,
figured out before we turn the, turn the spicket on.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:20.950
You know we're, we make sure that we have a buffer kind
of built in before we get going to make sure that we get,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.060
that we have a little bit of room to start to work in.

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:25.149
Then we try to keep that buffer going.

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:31.600
MacBreak, that many of you have seen, has
actually only been recorded about four times.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.940
So to give you kind of a sense of how much we buffer.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.030
( Laughter )

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:40.709
We, we can typically shoot 12 to 18 MacBreaks in a day.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.990
And so, so those things get all you know buffered together.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.000
And that's one of the things that we do, we do a lot of.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.679
And one of the things to make this work is efficiency.

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:53.849
Now if you start to think, and I'll
get back to efficiency in a second.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.269
When you start to think about how you build your
podcast, you really have obviously two podcasts.

00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:59.210
You have audio.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.050
And audio, one of the things you have to think
about is what are people doing when they're,

00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:05.490
when they're watching or listening to your show.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.169
With audio, they're working.

00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:11.649
They might be stuck in a traffic
jam, if they're in San Francisco.

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:16.490
And also they might be just walking,
exercising, so on so forth.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.830
What this equates to is a much longer
format, a long length, 30 to 90 minutes.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:29.900
We have gone back and forth with This Week in Media going
short, long, figuring out and for a while we thought

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:32.269
that maybe we should really be
doing it for 30 or 40 minutes.

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:33.689
Like we should do a really short piece.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.950
People told us well it takes me about 35
minutes to get to work, that's all I want.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.940
And so for about two or three months,
I would ask every person who said

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.520
that they listened to the show how long they wanted it.

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:45.590
You know do they care about the long ones or the short ones.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.740
And almost every, everyone to a person said they didn't
care how long it was or that they liked the long one.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.080
And the reason is that they're
just playing it in the background.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.740
They don't really care.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.080
It's just filling up time.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.250
You know it's just, it's just like NPR, it's
just something that goes in the background.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:03.960
So you can do a, a much longer format with
audio and people will be pretty understanding.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.810
With video, they're sitting in front of their computer.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:12.419
They're watching their AppleTV or they're watching it on
their iPod, their phone, their iPhone, all of those things.

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:19.889
And what this equates to and this is the difference, is the
audio you're really having it, it's a secondary activity.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:21.500
It's not really happening in the foreground.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.490
Video is a primary activity which means that you
really are looking at three to eight minutes.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.590
This is really the sweet spot when
you're actually doing video work.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:36.740
A lot of people think about doing podcasts that are 15
minutes long and 20, you know 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes long.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.850
But we have to sit there and watch it.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.389
You know and there's two problems with that.

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:47.149
One is that A, you're sucking up, now you're taking
away my actual work time to get this stuff done.

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:52.699
The second thing is that you're working
typically on a lower budget than Lost.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:58.120
You know or ER and, and it's gotta be
really good if it's going to last 20 minutes.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.679
You know that's, there's, there's not many
things you can do on a low budget that,

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:05.799
that is worth actually putting that together.

00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:10.490
So, so anyway you, you really especially
you want to keep it you know simple.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:17.620
There's a quote that has been referred to, back to both Mark
Twain and Abraham Lincoln, depending on who you talk to.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:23.080
Which is that it's better to keep one's mouth shut
and look foolish than to open it and remove all doubt.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.129
So this applies directly to our video of making
sure that we move through things quickly,

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:30.659
try to keep it short and not hang too long.

00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:36.399
Another thing that you have to pay attention
to is the scale of what you're shooting now.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.909
So what you see in the lower corner is standard definition.

00:13:39.909 --> 00:13:44.360
That's bigger than a lot of what you would
normally put on your iPod, the little 320 by 240,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.680
although now you can put much larger formats on there.

00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:50.069
But that's standard definition.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:57.030
720p is kind of, that's really the, the largest
size you're going to put on an AppleTV right now

00:13:57.029 --> 00:14:05.629
and 1080p is pretty much full broadcast, well
full, I mean that's theatrical release size.

00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:11.549
But one of the things that's really is that you
can shoot all of these fairly inexpensively now.

00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:20.689
There's not, I would, if you feel like you're producing
content that is worth keeping around and hopefully

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.110
if you're building a podcast, that's what you're doing.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.379
You know if you don't think its worth keeping
around then you should find another podcast.

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:33.389
But if you really feel like its worth having, one of
the things that I would highly consider is getting rid

00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:36.519
of the DVD camera and going ahead with an HDV camera.

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:38.120
There are great cameras out here.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.320
We've been doing a lot of testing
with an HD20, the Canon HD20.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.370
It is 1000 dollars.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.830
And, and the images are pristine.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.780
You know for 1000 dollars.

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:55.959
It's totally enough to do the kind of work
that you'd want to do for your podcast.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.190
And you're going to get that, it actually shoots 1080p.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.870
And so you're able to get that full resolution
or you can bring it back down to 720p.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:09.570
Another thing that you want to you know think
about is how much you need to do with a set.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:15.400
And I'm going to talk a little bit about this a little
bit later, but here you have a, a shot we did,

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:20.409
this was for Mac World and here's the actually piece.

00:15:20.409 --> 00:15:25.370
And one of the things that you want to look
at is, is how to piece this stuff together.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.210
This isn't, this has gotten a lot easier.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:32.170
And I'll kind of walk through some of the sets,
some of the pieces of that a little bit later.

00:15:32.169 --> 00:15:38.479
But one of the things to look at is whether you can get away
with doing you know doing green screen rather than trying

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.100
to build a set for everything that you need.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.159
A lot of times you can make something look kind of nice.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:46.850
When we did this, there was some guys
that Mac World I guess that I was told

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.769
that they, they were like, where is that office?

00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:50.659
You know, it's, that's a really cool office.

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:51.159
We should sit there.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.909
And that's all done you know really, really quickly.

00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:56.509
That's like four hours of work
to put that background together.

00:15:56.509 --> 00:16:04.539
One of the things that we have to think about while
we're doing this is the price per finished minute.

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:05.990
We are not broadcast.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.450
You know right now we're a niche market, we're a new market.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.270
We're all these other things.

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:15.259
And we have to think about how do we keep
our production costs as low as possible.

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:22.639
To give you an idea, we tend to try to keep our production
costs below about 200 dollar per finished minute.

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:28.929
You know so a lot of the stuff requires
us to think in kind of mass production.

00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:34.149
So for instance, a typical show, we will
shoot a minimum of six shows in a day.

00:16:34.149 --> 00:16:40.949
And typically we'll shoot you know as many as 12
and as I said up to 18 episodes in a single day,

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.430
because that lowers our physical production costs.

00:16:44.429 --> 00:16:49.699
To give you a sense of that, a small cable
network might be 2000 dollars a finished minute.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.100
So 10 times more than the kind
of budget that we're working on.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.580
And something like Discovery Channel might be
something closer to 5000 dollars per finished minute.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.300
To give you an idea of the kind
of expenses that we're, the scale.

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:08.389
To put one more, I didn't put one more in here
because it, it'll screw up the whole graph.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.580
Which is that ER you know is 200000
dollars a finished minute.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:17.379
So, so you're really looking at, I mean
that's what, that, that's the difference.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.630
But what's exciting is that we can
actually work inside of that, that number.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:27.260
We can actually make podcasts that are, that
are interesting especially when we get back,

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:29.240
when we come back to this nonfictional content.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.630
When we're making something that is about
things that people are excited about,

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.860
especially if they, if they're underserved.

00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:40.719
If they're not, if people who are really into knitting
aren't really, don't really have a lot of broadcast shows.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:47.019
I mean they can't tune in on Tuesday night
on CBS to watch a knitting, knitting video,

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:52.789
they're very likely to be pretty understanding about your
technical quality as you started to put that stuff together.

00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:56.829
So there's a, there's a real opportunity and
people are going to be much more understanding,

00:17:56.829 --> 00:17:59.710
especially as you get more and
more into that, that niche market.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:00.150
Here is.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.519
>> "Nitrogen is normally a gas."

00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:03.099
>> Can we turn that down just a little bit?

00:18:03.099 --> 00:18:03.789
There we go.

00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:04.509
( Laughter )

00:18:04.509 --> 00:18:09.460
So this is an example of one of our
little podcasts and this is all done

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.620
in motion, all the graphics in the background.

00:18:12.619 --> 00:18:15.539
>> "Which are building blocks for our proteins."

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:21.559
>> Now, the interesting thing about that is that
it's not, this isn't that difficult to put together.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.500
I say and Kinsey's is going to be like well, alright.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.440
So but the main thing is that what
we're, what we're skipping is a lot

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.809
of camera motion, a lot of moving stuff around.

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:33.539
Now we do have other cameras, this is a three camera shoot.

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:39.710
But by adding those graphics and finding ways to use up
that space rather than trying to put a big set in there,

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:47.240
we actually use that as a, as an opportunity to make
sure that we could you know add a lot of detail and,

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.370
and do something that you wouldn't
necessarily see in a broadcast show.

00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:54.609
But added a lot to the show.

00:18:54.609 --> 00:18:55.859
Another show here, this is.

00:18:55.859 --> 00:18:57.939
>> My favorite time is a time.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.710
>> This is.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.350
>> So the goal here is not to.

00:19:00.349 --> 00:19:02.389
>> One of our favorite shows.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.450
Mostly because I get to have lots of drinks.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:11.509
So. We actually, we've now designated,
we've started to designate stunt drinkers.

00:19:11.509 --> 00:19:11.910
( Laughter )

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.060
Because, because here's the deal.

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:18.690
What happens is that Alberta is an artiste, you know.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.799
And we had, we had one conversation with her
about, we had one conversation about her,

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:24.389
you know we could just use water on the set.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.450
And, yeah, she almost quit.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.870
So.

00:19:26.869 --> 00:19:27.689
( Laughter )

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.820
So she, so, so it was, it was a bad scene.

00:19:30.819 --> 00:19:35.309
There was a lot of swearing and upset
and so, so we backed off on that.

00:19:35.309 --> 00:19:39.230
And then she made the drinks and we said so we
can pour them into the, into the, into the sink.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.059
And then, you know she almost quit.

00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:41.440
And so.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.490
( Laughter )

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.839
And so, and so anyway.

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:48.129
So she, she really required us to drink the drinks.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:54.580
And, and one of the things that we learned is that if you
let the cameraman drink the drinks, you gotta reshoot.

00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:54.869
So.

00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:56.039
( Laughter )

00:19:56.039 --> 00:20:00.889
So, so now we invite guests to come
and, and sit on the, on the couch.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.630
And they're only job is to get up and drink.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.930
So.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.310
( Laughter )

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:10.230
It's not paid, but oddly enough
there's a long line, you know, it's.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.829
( Laughter )
So anyway, so.

00:20:11.829 --> 00:20:17.629
To give you an idea what that looks like,
it's not that, not that complex a set up.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:24.640
And this is, you're pretty much seeing the entire set
up here where we, we actually found my partner at,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.690
at the Pixel Corps or one of my partners, that's his kitchen.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:33.620
So we, you know there was a lot of like figuring out
what kitchen we could actually use to make this work.

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:35.609
So we, we found his kitchen.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.799
We used pretty much one light.

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:40.490
We have a couple other lights that
we'll throw around, but a big light.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.930
And if you're doing podcasting, if
you're doing any kind of broadcast work,

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.090
there's nothing better than a big, diffused light.

00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:50.240
I mean you can, you can use those little sharp
lights and you can have all the stuff, but a really,

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.500
really big samara is really the way to, the way to go.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.190
So that always makes everybody look good.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.910
We have a kind of a big camera at
the office that you can see here,

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.120
but you don't need to use a camera
like that to make it work.

00:21:04.119 --> 00:21:07.969
One of the things that we do a lot
of is capturing direct to drive.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:12.900
If you're doing production, it is a
real pain in the neck to deal with tape.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.190
How many people here know how much
of a that is a pain in the neck?

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.380
Alright, so yeah, yeah.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:17.990
We hate tape.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:24.329
So we're actually hoping by July, the end of July
to be pretty much a completely tapeless process.

00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:32.179
And that's really become a, a real obsession of
ours because we still have some tape in the system

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.100
and it's the worst part of the entire process.

00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:39.139
What we use here, what you're seeing
here is a, is a program called ScopeBox.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:46.480
And we use both ScopeBox and Final Cut to capture directly
into, into the, ingests straight into the computer.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.610
With most of these small cameras, you
can ingest straight into a laptop.

00:21:49.609 --> 00:21:52.779
So you don't really need a big
computer to, to make all of that work.

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:54.259
And it's really worth it.

00:21:54.259 --> 00:21:57.910
You're going to really accelerate the, the amount of time.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.240
And once again, when we're trying
to keep things at a budget,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.740
a lot of you are probably your podcast is a labor of love.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.450
But when you want to turn it into a
business, you're going to really need to think

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:10.690
about how do I cut every couple minutes here,
couple minutes there, couple hours here,

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.559
couple hours there to make it something
that's actually financially viable.

00:22:15.559 --> 00:22:16.460
Here's another.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.250
>> This has to be shinier still.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.789
So I'm going to go in there and with my dodge and
burn tool, I'm going to add a few more features.

00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:27.430
Let's add a little dark tone right there and
maybe a little one right in there like that.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.130
Just a little tone in there.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.910
And with my dodge tool, let's go in there
and lighten up a little chunk right there.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:38.600
And maybe a little highlight right there
and maybe one right down the middle.

00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:39.509
See?

00:22:39.509 --> 00:22:46.279
>> So this is a show we do for a company, for Revision3
and it's called Pixel Perfect and it's with Burt Monroy

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:48.680
and he, who actually taught me Photoshop.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.830
You know, 15 years ago.

00:22:49.829 --> 00:22:59.079
And anyway, so this is another style of capture
and this is what it looks like in our office.

00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:00.710
That's actually what our office looks like.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:08.870
And so we, we you know kind of use whatever's
available but it's simply a, a one green screen.

00:23:08.869 --> 00:23:12.399
We happen to use green screen from a
company called Composite Components.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.550
And we, we swear by them.

00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:19.990
They're lycra, they're washable, and, and they,
you just spray them with water once they're up

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.329
and they get all the wrinkles go
out and, makes it really work.

00:23:23.329 --> 00:23:27.569
So but you, you can see it's not a very high tech set up.

00:23:27.569 --> 00:23:33.369
One of the things that by the way when you look at all
these lights and you start thinking about how expensive

00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:36.729
that is, we barely own, actually own any lights.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:43.799
So when we do shoots, and this is one the reasons we
shoot so many in a single day is that we rent everything.

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:50.879
So when we, when we're doing a shoot, we simply just rent
an airy kit, rent kenos, rent you know all of those pieces.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.890
It's really, one of the things that may stop you
from getting these nice light kits and or you know

00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:00.030
that you think you're going to have to spend
3000 dollars or 4000 dollars to buy it.

00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:05.990
Where you can go down to Gassers here or
whatever you're at, there's always going to be,

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.059
any major city there's a rental house somewhere.

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:13.399
And a good light kit, everything except for
the kenos, all those little, all those lights

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.440
and everything else is going to cost you about 75 bucks a
day,u you know to 100 dollars a day to rent that stuff.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.350
And so, that is a way to just kind of, if you really want to
have something like a lot nicer, you can throw those lights

00:24:24.349 --> 00:24:27.379
up and you don't have to go through that big expense.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.800
Now the key is when is we don't worry about them too
much because we're shooting you know 10 episodes.

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.710
So we just think about it well it's
not, we don't think of it as 75 dollars,

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.900
we think of it as 7 dollars and 50
cent per epPisode that we need to.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.680
We do a lot of work, a lot of our pod
casts are kind of worked out on Excel.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.240
( Laugh) So.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.609
Here's the, kind of the other angle, so you
can kind of see where the lights are set up.

00:24:49.609 --> 00:24:52.049
The, here are the keno flows.

00:24:52.049 --> 00:24:55.119
Those are pretty much the best
way to light your green screen.

00:24:55.119 --> 00:25:01.149
And you can see our very high tech way of getting
that overhead shot from, from Burt up there with the,

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:06.860
we've got a little HV, or HVX200 just sitting
on our little tripod, kind of perched down.

00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:10.250
I'm sure we could think of something
that looked better, but it works.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.940
So, this is MacBreak which a lot of you guys have seen.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.250
( Music )

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.940
So I won't, we won't go too far into this.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.789
( Music )

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:27.440
One of the things that does make a difference
here is that we did spend some time on an open.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.000
And you know I was a little bit of
a curmudgeon for a while about that.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.730
Saying ah, we don't need to do all of that stuff.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.769
But people, people really expect it.

00:25:35.769 --> 00:25:36.039
( Laughter )

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:41.329
And they, and they get kind of frustrated if you, if
you don't give them their open, their little music.

00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:45.279
The one thing that we have noticed is that for a three
to eight minute piece, it needs to move pretty quickly.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:49.980
So you know while you'd think on a broadcast
TV show, you'd think about 22 seconds.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.110
And we're slowly moving most of our
new shows to something more like 10.

00:25:54.109 --> 00:26:00.889
You know it's a three to eight minute show, don't feel
up 50, you know 15 or 20 percent of it with the open.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:05.080
You know, so that's kind of one of the things
that we've, we've really gone into here.

00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:10.919
This is kind of what, what it generally
looks like when we're shooting MacBreak.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.090
This is, we shoot this at a, at a the San
Francisco School for Digital Film Making.

00:26:15.089 --> 00:26:18.129
This is right, right past the ballpark here.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:23.430
And so you can, you can kind of see, now once again, like
I said, we use kind of big cameras because we have them.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:29.460
But you, you can use anything you want
as far as this stuff goes through here.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.769
But it's a pretty simple set up from our point of view.

00:26:32.769 --> 00:26:36.599
We're capturing in this case directly into Final Cut Pro.

00:26:36.599 --> 00:26:40.379
The great thing about Final Cut is that
you don't have think about it at all.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.890
You know whether we're using a 950, which is what
we're using here which shoots 4, 4, 4 uncompressed HD

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:49.770
or we're putting a DV camera in, we can
just, all of that stuff just goes in as long

00:26:49.769 --> 00:26:52.680
as you have a drive fast enough to, to pull it in.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.529
I want to talk a little bit about green screen,
because I know that I'm showing all this green screen.

00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:58.460
So I thought I would just show very, very quickly.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.000
I don't want to go too deep into this.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.049
If you have questions about it, at the end,
I'm going to try to leave enough time for you

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:06.460
to ask the questions that you might have.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:12.509
But one of the things that's really important is really
looking at when you're lighting your, your green screen,

00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:16.190
thinking about the process in a, in a very mathematical way.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:21.549
And I know we're at the developer's conferences, so
it's easier for me to talk to you about this and,

00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:24.730
you know I talked to artists about
it, and everyone starts to glaze over.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:30.329
You know, so but we really do, tend to
do our keying by you know by the numbers.

00:27:30.329 --> 00:27:32.279
So I don't have to look at a lot.

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:34.649
I don't need little filters to look at the green screen.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:40.350
all I'm looking at here, this is an RGB parade that
after I've captured some, I capture some sample footage,

00:27:40.349 --> 00:27:44.149
I'll put it into the RGB and what I'm looking for is the,

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.800
is the distance between my red channel,
my green channel and my blue channel.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:50.750
Obviously if it's a green screen, I
want my green to be the brightest.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.400
This one is actually is actually a little under lit.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.380
What I really want is that green
to be up at about 90, 90 percent.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.910
If we start to clip it, we're going to start to pull the
edges, make all the edges really hard because the things

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.630
that are light green, you know the
green should be white and the things

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.000
that are light gray are going to be the, my nice fine edges.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.960
So if I, it's not just a matter of
exposing the green as hard as you can.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.100
You really need to look at the numbers and know
whether you're going to clip your signal or not.

00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:21.719
You want the red and the blue as
far from the green as possible.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.319
This is about minimum, minimumally what you'd want.

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:30.389
But the more, the further you can
get that apart, the better.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.800
So that's, you know how we kind of approach that process.

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:36.450
I'll show the, kind of the process of keying.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.500
We're using a plugin.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:44.619
We, we developed a plugin with a
company called Lacquer called Conduit.

00:28:44.619 --> 00:28:50.589
And what it is is basically like a mini
shake that sits inside of Final Cut Pro.

00:28:50.589 --> 00:28:53.529
And once again, this is easier
for me to talk to developers about

00:28:53.529 --> 00:28:56.339
or people who are here at this conference than artists.

00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:59.609
So what you have here is basically
a flow graph of being able to kind

00:28:59.609 --> 00:29:03.169
of work your way through, you know a set of instructions.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.810
So here you have the input, here
you have a color difference.

00:29:06.809 --> 00:29:13.179
This is basically subtracting the, a average of
the red and blue channels from the green channel.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:18.430
And what that does is that the green, the red and
blue channel were dark, so they're closer to zero.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.380
And the green should be white.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:25.410
And in the area where your subject is, all of those
colors are the same or they're close to each other.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.490
They're the same in value.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:31.059
So when you subtract them and when you subtract
the red and the blue, what you get is a black

00:29:31.059 --> 00:29:33.579
in the center, because they were very close.

00:29:33.579 --> 00:29:36.879
And you get just a, kind of a little bit
darker gray because they were close to zero,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.760
so they're not subtracting very much from the green.

00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:44.490
The other thing that we do is what we call
and unspill process, which is using that matt

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.890
to actually remove all of the green from the scene.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.040
And we really eliminated all of the green.

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.170
So including the spill and everything else.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.090
From there, there's a color correction.

00:29:55.089 --> 00:29:59.409
And this color correction takes into account the
blue background that we're going to put him over.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:03.259
So we're kind of hedging the background
a little bit towards that.

00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:07.440
Because we want to make sure his edges will fit into
the, to the background that we're working with.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.330
And then here you can see the final composite.

00:30:11.329 --> 00:30:14.859
Where we just simply stack all of those pieces together.

00:30:14.859 --> 00:30:19.689
So that's kind of the, the approach that most
of our, most of our podcasts go through.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.490
The ones that are working in front of green screen.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:26.420
There's a lot more detail there, but I thought
I would spare you for the last session.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.740
So, so here you can see the piece.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:36.750
Now another thing that's important
here is, stop this here for a second.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:42.869
So one of the things to look at here is you'll
notice that the, from a broadcast point of view,

00:30:42.869 --> 00:30:47.549
from a broadcast point of view, this,
these lower thirds are very big.

00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:54.279
So if I was actually putting this on an HD monitor and I was
actually playing this, this is a really, really big lower third.

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:58.389
One of the things that we're working on is while
we deliver almost everything that we do at 1080p,

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:04.450
we have to remember that there are going to be a
lot of people watching them on iPods, on iPhones,

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:09.269
on smaller apparatuses so we
have to really design for kind of both.

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:10.509
And so we try to split it.

00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:16.960
We try not to make it too big, so it looks like a cartoon
on a HD monitor, but we also have to know that those are,

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.059
that we have to make sure it's still readable
when it's sitting in front of an iPod.

00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:24.589
So those are the kinds of things that you have to think
about as you're starting to put this stuff together.

00:31:24.589 --> 00:31:28.679
By the way, I'm not going to show too much of it, I'm not doing
a lot of demos today, but, but one of the things to notice,

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:36.490
this little animation that comes in here, and I'm going to talk
about this when I talk about the tools just a little bit.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:41.000
It all, it looks nice and complex
and you know it's, I mean it's simple,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.529
but it's a nice little element to add these little 3D fly-ins.

00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:49.480
This is all done with a program
called Pro Animator by Zack Wartz.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:58.839
And it is the secret weapon to logo animations and
everything else for, for broadcast, for podcasts, for,

00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:03.569
what it does is it basically, this, this
Macworld Best of Show that you see here?

00:32:03.569 --> 00:32:09.819
They sent me, they sent me an EPS, so an illustrator
file of that, of that file, just the outlines.

00:32:09.819 --> 00:32:13.579
And I had that model in about 25 minutes.
%

00:32:13.579 --> 00:32:18.149
You know it was a nice 3D model, it was totally
animated, I had the animation done about an hour later.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.540
I hope no one from Macworld is sitting in here because,
they won't be that impressed with it anymore.

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:23.990
So they, they thought it was great.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.259
So anyway.

00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:28.680
So the point is that all of this stuff
was put together very, very quickly.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.019
It just does it really, really quick for you.

00:32:31.019 --> 00:32:34.779
And it is, if you want to do any kind of impressive graphics,

00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:38.869
or I mean just like little flourishes
that look bigger than you are.

00:32:38.869 --> 00:32:41.219
It's a must have piece of software.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.380
The rest of this is all done in, In Motion.

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.360
So let me go to the next one here.

00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:52.889
So to, to jump into some of the tools that we
use to kind of give you an overview of some

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.780
of the tools that were actually putting together.

00:32:54.779 --> 00:32:58.930
Of course we're going to capture in, in Final Cut.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.240
We're also doing capture in ScopeBox.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:07.329
The reason we use ScopeBox a lot is because
we can, we can get that, that RGB parade live.

00:33:07.329 --> 00:33:13.879
We have a lot more control and a lot more feedback of live
content while it's coming in than what we get in Final Cut.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:22.020
And so sometimes we don't actually capture in ScopeBox, we
still capture in Final Cut, but we, we measure everything

00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:26.240
and we make sure that all of our lighting is set up
and everything else while we're working in ScopeBox.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.940
And then we use for the screen grab, that we're
putting together, we use a program called Snapz Pro.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.860
I think a lot of you probably know Snapz Pro.

00:33:32.859 --> 00:33:38.990
The other one that we use occasionally is a program
called iShowU, which we like to say iShowU.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.220
So, we, we find it, it sounds better that way.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.390
So, so anyway.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.920
iShowU is from Shiny White Box?

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.500
Is that right?

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:53.200
And the advantage of iShowU when you're doing screen
grabs and I think a lot of you if you're building training

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.559
for software or your doing any of this stuff, the
advantages of iShowU is when you're done, it's done.

00:33:57.559 --> 00:33:59.019
Like there's a QuickTime.

00:33:59.019 --> 00:34:03.879
You're not waiting for Snaps to do
whatever it does to put stuff together.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:09.640
And, and the problem with it is that it tends
to be a little bit more processor intensive.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:13.449
So when we're using something like if we're
doing captures of Shake or a 3D program,

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:16.119
it'll tend to be, it'll tend to bog down a little bit.

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:17.529
And Snaps tends to be a lot better.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.160
So it's a little better mixture of the two of those.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:24.079
For production, we're doing all of our
editing and I'll talk about this in a second,

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:27.079
all of our editing in Final Cut of course.

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:34.150
We do all of our sound, all of the stuff
from, for our sound shows in, in Sound Track.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.440
And we're very, I'm very happy with that.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:42.210
So and then we do, I think we do most of our,
I think we, do we do all of our opens in?

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.500
Not all of them?

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.900
We do a mixture of the opens in
Sound Track and Garage Band, so.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.740
The reason we use Garage Band is because we can
use keyboards and we can't do that in Sound Track.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:54.309
So, so we can make you know kind of do our
little midi thing and put stuff together.

00:34:54.309 --> 00:35:01.090
But, but most of our opens and most of our little sound
pieces are all done between Sound Track and Garage Band.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:05.769
The graphics as I said, Zack Wartz
Invigorator, if you don't have it, you need.

00:35:05.769 --> 00:35:09.610
You gotta, I mean you just, you
want to make anything look like it,

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.470
like you meant to do it, you need that piece of software.

00:35:13.469 --> 00:35:21.059
All of our 3D animation for broadcast work beyond Zack's
Works, so if its more than just a simple little animation,

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:28.000
we need to build a digital set, we need to build, we need to
do larger animations, the open for MacBreak for instance,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.500
is all done in a program called Cinema 4D.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:38.940
This by the way is not, we're not rebels in this, the
majority of broadcast designers doing broadcast work,

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.130
for networks and cable networks and so
on, so forth are also using Cinema 4D.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.980
We use a lot of different 3D apps.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:51.250
We use Modo and XSI and a lot of other things that
to, for a lot of the different things that we do.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:58.150
But when it comes to broadcast graphics, this is by
far the best application that we have to do that.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:05.690
And then of course, most of our, our 2D
animation and now some of our 3D animation as far

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:11.490
as basic 3D pieces is done in, In Motion
which we're, we're also very happy with.

00:36:11.489 --> 00:36:16.479
To give you an idea of how the pipeline works, and
this is very simplified version of the pipeline,

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.750
of what we do, just to give you kind of a process.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:26.900
For most of our stuff, we capture the two formats
that we tend to capture in is HDV which is the devil.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.130
And, and uncompressed.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:39.789
So from, from there we take the HDV and we move it to
Apple ProRes 422, we've been moving it to DVC Pro HD.

00:36:39.789 --> 00:36:45.960
But we've just begun to start turning over
to Apple ProRes 422 which is much better.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:52.170
And this gives us a very quick format
that will edit easily and so on, so forth.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:57.250
Now we will, I will say when we're doing green
screen, when we're coming from uncompressed,

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:04.280
we'll actually do the keying first before we move into
422 because we actually have a higher quality format.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.370
Then we convert this all down to PhotoJPEG.

00:37:07.369 --> 00:37:12.500
Now you may wonder why we do that, why we
convert our nice ProRes 422 to PhotoJPEG.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.000
And the reason is that we send this out to editors.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.739
So our editors are spread over I think three continents.

00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:21.439
( Laugh )

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.150
So we have editors all, you know and going on four.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:28.210
So that what happens is we need
to make it as small as possible.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:32.250
The resolution I think is 384 by 216.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.059
And if I remember correctly.

00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:38.480
And I think that's one fifth of 1920 by 1080.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.039
And it's PhotoJPEG.

00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:43.869
The editors job is not to figure out whether the,
whether the shots were done well or not well.

00:37:43.869 --> 00:37:45.679
Their job is just to cut the thing together.

00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:47.659
And so they don't need it to be any higher.

00:37:47.659 --> 00:37:52.960
And that may sound like a crazy thing, but the
thing to remember is that Star Wars which is,

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.190
when I was working on Episode One,
they were editing, I wasn't editing.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.320
I didn't do any editing in Star Wars.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:05.280
But they were editing on what was called
AVR6 from Anavid which is very low quality.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.150
And the entire movie was done that way because the editor
didn't have to figure out whether it was a good shot

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.769
or bad, you know whether it was clean or not.

00:38:10.769 --> 00:38:12.179
That was someone else's job.

00:38:12.179 --> 00:38:16.190
Their job was to say once it's in here,
I'm going to put it together and, and cut it.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.730
And so that's why we send it out that way.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:25.969
This really, the difference in size goes from the 422
might be you know two gigabytes or three gigabytes.

00:38:25.969 --> 00:38:29.769
By the time it gets to PhotoJPEG it
might 300 megs or something like that.

00:38:29.769 --> 00:38:36.820
and that becomes a reasonable file that we can put up on
a FTP server, have the editors pull down and do the edit.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.940
What happens there is they send, they only
send the Final Cut Pro document back to us.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:49.559
So we don't have to you know we don't, Final Cut is not,
is just doing a reference out to the actual content.

00:38:49.559 --> 00:38:53.779
So we just simply reconnect it with the
high quality footage and then hit render.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.240
So I mean there's a little bit more than that.

00:38:55.239 --> 00:38:57.250
we have some little pieces and graphics and stuff.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.829
But most of the work is done by the
editors on a very low res version.

00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:03.670
We reconnect it to the high res.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.900
And that makes it very light.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.260
I mean the Final Cut Pro document is one
meg, two megabytes, something like that.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.010
it's pretty, pretty small.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.230
And then from there we output to H.264.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.340
So that's kind of the, the very, very basic
pipeline of how we put stuff together here.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.840
So of our output considerations, computer.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.920
We have no true maximum resolution.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.039
So we do produce MacBreak at 1080p.

00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:30.809
And, and we put it out there.

00:39:30.809 --> 00:39:34.159
I think we have a feed that, the 1080p feed.

00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:42.869
The truth of the matter is that when you start considering
legacy, when you start considering legacy computers,

00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:46.449
you're real effective maximum really is 960 by 540.

00:39:46.449 --> 00:39:50.149
If you start making it bigger than
that, you get emails from guys

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.930
that are can't play it on their, you know their G3 laptop.

00:39:53.929 --> 00:39:56.279
So, so anyway.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.740
So you get lots.

00:39:57.739 --> 00:40:01.009
And when you have enough viewers,
when you get to 50 or 60000 viewers,

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.310
those emails turn into its not like two people.

00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:08.219
You know you get like 40 emails a
day of I can't, it keeps on skipping.

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:11.459
So, so you're 960 by 540 is what you have there.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:17.079
Interactive Max and why I say that is we do add a lot
of interactivity which I'll talk about in a second.

00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:23.900
When you start making things clickable for us, the maximum
is about 800 by 450 before things start to jump around.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:30.190
AppleTV of course, the maximum
resolution is 1280 by 720 or 720p.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.220
And that is only 24 frames a second.

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:41.109
So if you, if you go to 30 frames a second,
then what you need is to go down to 960 by 540.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:46.380
There have been, I was one of the people
who actually was complaining about the fact

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.710
that the AppleTV didn't go to 1920
by 1080 and  why isn't it 1080p?

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:58.990
And it has been proven to me beyond any reasonable
doubt that unless your monitor is larger than 60 inches,

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:03.250
and you're closer than 10 feet to the screen,
which isn't really healthy by the way.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:07.739
You're not going to see the difference between 720 and 1080.

00:41:07.739 --> 00:41:14.059
So you really, 1080 is you really, really requires a
very, very large projection to make any difference.

00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:16.699
So this is really a perfect resolution.

00:41:16.699 --> 00:41:21.219
Because if you started doing 1080 just because
you could it makes the file that much bigger.

00:41:21.219 --> 00:41:23.779
You know and so this works out really well.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:29.560
With the iPod your max res, I think the max resolution I
mean the effective resolution on your iPod is about 320

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:35.920
by 240, but you can stuff 720 I think, 720 by 480 in there.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:41.639
The big thing with, with it is the max bit rate which
is 768 kilobits per second if you're doing H.264.

00:41:41.639 --> 00:41:47.179
And there's no interactivity of course in entire
the AppleTV or the iPhone or iPod of iPhone.

00:41:47.179 --> 00:41:51.190
Well I shouldn't that for iPhone
because there's there is isn't there?

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.440
Or we think there will be.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.740
So if we learn how to use the web.

00:41:54.739 --> 00:41:56.419
So, so anyway.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:04.170
The other thing to understand as you're starting to put your
stuff together, and I'm going to talk about this a little bit

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:07.269
because people really treat compression like a mystery.

00:42:07.269 --> 00:42:09.630
And for us it's not that complicated.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:13.700
I mean I feel like we just kind of, we've
kind of just found our way to pretty small files.

00:42:13.699 --> 00:42:18.029
I mean people always talk, a lot of people ask
us how MacBreak gets to be really, really small.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:25.880
And, and so I want to talk a little bit about it
and hopefully it demystifies it for a couple of you.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.880
So the first thing is there's really
two types of compression that's going

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.110
on anytime you're doing any, any work like this.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.360
And that's the first one is spatial compression.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:42.220
And what you're really looking at here with spatial
compression is what pixels look alike in a single frame.

00:42:42.219 --> 00:42:47.579
So as I'm looking at this frame, the blues are going to be
start, it's going to start grouping those blues together.

00:42:47.579 --> 00:42:49.039
It's going to group the grays together.

00:42:49.039 --> 00:42:51.550
It's going to group the purples in Leo's shirt together.

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:55.970
It's going to group all of that stuff together and it'll
find as many pixels as it can to group those together.

00:42:55.969 --> 00:43:00.949
And if it can't, the higher you turn the compression,
the more it forces those pixels to be the same.

00:43:00.949 --> 00:43:06.449
It says, well they're close enough, I'm going to make this
block all, all the same number of, the same kind of pixel.

00:43:06.449 --> 00:43:09.849
That's where you get blocks by the way is
because it, when you start turning it up,

00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:13.049
it forces those pixels into, in to corrals.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:17.150
So this is one, one piece of the compression technology.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.610
The second is temporal compression.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:24.240
And the temporal compression is really
looking at what changes between frames.

00:43:24.239 --> 00:43:30.129
So if I look at this frame and then I go down
a couple more frames, between these key frames,

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.140
and that's what you're looking at,
when you're looking in, in QuickTime,

00:43:33.139 --> 00:43:37.269
what you're looking at there is it,
you'll see this little key frame number.

00:43:37.269 --> 00:43:39.880
A 12 or 24 or whatever.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:45.680
What it's saying is I'm going to lay an entire
frame down no matter what, what's happening.

00:43:45.679 --> 00:43:52.919
And, and then its gotta have, these are kind of like
if you're thinking about climbing up a mountain,

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.090
it's where you're driving your spikes into the ground.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.320
In, into the wall.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.140
You know, so you're going to get up to a certain
height and you're going to go I'm going to drive one in

00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:01.269
and then I'm going to walk up a little bit further.

00:44:01.269 --> 00:44:04.789
So what it's doing is adding these key frames in between.

00:44:04.789 --> 00:44:10.150
The further out you put those key frames, the
more efficient your compression is going to become.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:19.019
So one of the things that we tend to do is turn our key
frames up to 100 and sometimes up to 200 key frames between,

00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:21.079
I mean you know frames between key frames.

00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:31.579
This makes a huge difference often times with the quality
of your, you know or the size of your, of your file.

00:44:31.579 --> 00:44:35.529
Other things that make a difference
are things like how you shoot.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:40.150
So and how, how you shoot your podcast makes
a huge difference in how you compress it.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.190
Now a lot of people don't connect these two things.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:45.880
One of the things you'll notice about a lot of
our podcasts is the cameras don't move a lot.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.349
The reason they don't move a lot is
because it, every time you move the camera,

00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:52.440
it has to add what you call a natural key frame.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.840
It has to go, well too much has
changed in this, in the scene.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.720
And so I'm going to add another key frame
to make sure that things are based on it.

00:44:59.719 --> 00:45:03.459
If you move the camera too slowly,
and you have big wide distances

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.119
between key frames, that's when you start to see a tear.

00:45:06.119 --> 00:45:09.289
You know because it'll tear because
it doesn't realize that enough,

00:45:09.289 --> 00:45:11.329
you know it doesn't realize that
things have been moving too much.

00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:13.659
And so you start to see artifacts.

00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:15.339
So that's what's actually happening there.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.500
So we don't, what we try to avoid is a lot of slow pans.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:23.699
And we also try to avoid the camera moving when we,
when we, we'd rather edit, cut from one frame, you know.

00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:26.639
Cut from one camera to another than move the camera around.

00:45:26.639 --> 00:45:34.109
The other thing that is will really kill
your temporal compression is handheld shots.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.960
So its, it looks really cool, but you
gotta be really careful about that

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.090
because the handheld shot defeats
all of the temporal compression.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:44.480
And so that's going to be something that's
going to make your file literally five

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:49.159
or six times bigger, to have your, those kind of pieces.

00:45:49.159 --> 00:45:53.969
So we all want to be like MTV, but
unless we're really happy with our,

00:45:53.969 --> 00:45:59.250
you know how we're going to feed this content
out, you gotta be kind of careful of that.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:06.519
So another thing by the way, one of the reasons we use
green screen is because the green screen, there's grain.

00:46:06.519 --> 00:46:08.059
You know I'm sure any time you've looked,

00:46:08.059 --> 00:46:11.750
you've looked closely at your video footage
and you'll see little grains changing.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.500
That can defeat your temporal compression as well.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:20.639
By using green screen with a still behind it,
what happens is those pixels become identical.

00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:26.559
And it makes the, because there's no grain in the area that
the green screen was in, what you end up with is a very,

00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:31.039
very efficient temporal compression because those
pixels that its looking at from frame to frame

00:46:31.039 --> 00:46:38.050
to frame are remaining totally identical, you know perfectly
identical which makes it much, much more efficient.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:46.560
So the, the next thing that I'm going to show here is
what we would consider kind of the next frontier.

00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:53.179
And we don't need any sound in the back there.

00:46:53.179 --> 00:46:57.690
The, this is a test that we actually did
about a year, about a year ago I guess.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.460
Little over a year ago.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.820
And that when I had longer hair.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.320
And, and more hair actually.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:10.070
So. So the one of the things we're going to notice
down here is this is kind of interactive frame.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:13.660
Now what we're getting ready to do of course is start
to take some of the stuff that we learned this week

00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:16.629
and find ways to do this inside
of Safari and all that stuff.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:20.019
But this is all built actually into the QuickTime.

00:47:20.019 --> 00:47:25.559
I strongly believe that what we're looking at is this year
is going to be a year of let's get our video up on the web.

00:47:25.559 --> 00:47:28.029
Next year is going to be a year of let's make it clickable.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:33.460
You know so we're going to want to be able to click on
just about everything within the next 24 to 36 months.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.559
And so we've been doing a lot of research on that.

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:41.119
What you're seeing down here is a
little extra movie that's playing along.

00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:47.549
Now what's going on here is that if what we did
is that of course there's some stuff that some,

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:50.580
some folks that have supported us
and so on, so forth that's in there.

00:47:50.579 --> 00:47:53.779
But we're really linking to anything
that we're talking about.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.560
We're not trying to make it an advertisement.

00:47:55.559 --> 00:47:59.519
It's not a banner that every single,
you know that all paid for.

00:47:59.519 --> 00:48:05.579
This is a really, really important point when you start
to look at this secondary piece because if, there's an ad.

00:48:05.579 --> 00:48:05.960
( Laugh )

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.920
So that's an ad but it's mixed in, 60 to 80 percent
of everything that you see has nothing to do,

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.460
it's not paid for, it's just what we're talking about.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.610
And that is, that keeps that area live.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:18.990
It keeps people interested and actually looking at it.

00:48:18.989 --> 00:48:20.379
And clicking on it.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.340
While I can't really show this
inside of a keynote presentation,

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:27.660
if I click on any of those it takes me straight
to the website, you know where those were,

00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:32.460
you know to the either the manufacturers
website or a place that people can buy it.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:37.800
We, with one of the microphones we, we were noticing that
every person that we talked to had said oh I got this mike

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.730
or I bought that mike and so we called one
of the mike manufacturers and asked them.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:47.490
You know we've link to your, you know to your site
and literally it was just because we went into Google

00:48:47.489 --> 00:48:51.250
and just you know found someone
who sold the mike and link to it.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:56.309
You know we were just experimenting, so we didn't like
try to get any deal or work anything out ahead of time.

00:48:56.309 --> 00:49:00.539
And the guy was just like, oh man,
he goes we got in on Monday morning,

00:49:00.539 --> 00:49:03.769
we usually get 20 or 30 orders  a day, we had 400 orders.

00:49:03.769 --> 00:49:06.079
You know it was like, he was like
we had no idea what hit us.

00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:11.509
He goes, and we got through the end of Monday and
we got to Tuesday morning and there were 400 orders.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:18.120
You know you know and and I said, and he said,
he said he had 400 orders every, every day.

00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:21.829
And I asked well why was it 400 orders and he
goes well it turned out that there was a problem

00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:24.159
in the web page that it would max out at 400.

00:49:24.159 --> 00:49:26.549
He goes, we just never had 400 orders before.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:34.789
You know and so, so it was, so, so the thing is that
when you're and the reason that's important is that

00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:37.449
and that's one by the way I really
wished I'd asked for 10 percent.

00:49:37.449 --> 00:49:40.000
So, so anyway.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.570
The, the thing that's important is that when you're
creating content and this is what's different.

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.110
A lot of people think of interactive content like
I'm going to be watching Oceans 11 and clicking

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.680
on Brad Pitt's shirt and you know all that stuff.

00:49:50.679 --> 00:49:52.359
The problem with that is if I'm, if I'm worried

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:57.590
about what Brad Pitt is wearing during a
movie, you know can't be a very good movie.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:58.890
You know if I'm paying attention.

00:49:58.889 --> 00:50:02.529
Now I told that to a woman in LA and she
said well you're obviously not a woman.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:03.019
So.

00:50:03.019 --> 00:50:03.759
( Laughter )

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.830
So, so anyway.

00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:13.299
So the, the thing is that narrative content I don't
think is really a great place for interactivity.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.640
I don't people, people just want to,
they don't want branchy movies.

00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:20.730
I don't want six different versions of
Oceans 11 or Oceans 13 now I guess, whatever.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.460
I just want to watch the movie and I want to go home.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:29.159
You know I have enough trouble just keeping track of
Pirates 3, you know let alone actually having it branch

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:31.210
or be clicking on things and so on, so forth.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:38.960
But when we get into actually doing how tos,
things that about what people are passionate about,

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:42.380
they are much more likely to be
interested in clicking on something.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.700
They're much more likely to be
interested in what you're using.

00:50:44.699 --> 00:50:50.869
Now this is microphones, but it could be, I could be talking
about cars and I might want to know about the wrench or the,

00:50:50.869 --> 00:50:54.599
or what, you know what type of
carburetor is being used or what,

00:50:54.599 --> 00:50:56.739
you know all of those things I might want more information.

00:50:56.739 --> 00:51:01.169
As we get closer to what people are interested
in, this interactivity becomes much more useful.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:06.769
Also the viewers are much more likely to
not be bothered by stopping the program

00:51:06.769 --> 00:51:09.019
so they can find out more about what they're doing.

00:51:09.019 --> 00:51:13.469
And what you're looking at it an interactive experience
where they're watching video, but they're stopping,

00:51:13.469 --> 00:51:17.179
they're looking at the web, they're doing more
research, they're, they're buying products.

00:51:17.179 --> 00:51:18.079
So on, so forth.

00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:23.769
And this is going to be, as this starts to
really move forward, you know we strongly feel

00:51:23.769 --> 00:51:26.400
that this is going to be a huge industry.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.510
As it, as it really starts to move
forwards as long as the tools are there,

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:33.220
which it all looks like its going down that direction.

00:51:33.219 --> 00:51:38.959
Here you can see integrated in to QuickTime, it's
contextual so the information is about it, its hyperlinked

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.250
and the results as I said were pretty impressive.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:43.940
This is the second version of what we're doing.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:49.360
And so what you see here is this is a
lower third just you'd normally have except

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.769
that you can click right on the lower third.

00:51:51.769 --> 00:51:59.239
So there's not, I can't click on it here, but
if I, if I back up here just for a second.

00:51:59.239 --> 00:52:03.509
I think. Or not.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:10.990
( Period of silence )

00:52:10.989 --> 00:52:12.329
Then I won't try that.

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:21.909
so the, so what, but the main thing there is that if I
click on that lower third, what I'm able to actually do is

00:52:21.909 --> 00:52:27.519
that way, what that allowed us to do is have an
integrated pipeline where we just made the same product.

00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:29.130
All that is is a hotspot.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:33.380
So we're, now we're not building an extra movie, we're not
building anything extra, we just have a lower third firing

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.000
in and we're able to just kind of click if it's interactive.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.869
So if you're watching on the iPod, if you're watching on
the AppleTV right now, you wouldn't be able to click on it.

00:52:42.869 --> 00:52:46.009
But if you're watching on your computer, you could
click on it and get more information, so on, so forth.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:51.070
And so, so that's another, that's kind of a little
piece that we've, we've kind of gone done the path.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:57.890
Now the next thing that we're, you know the next place
that we're going is being able to click on everything.

00:52:57.889 --> 00:53:00.980
So we want to be able to click on Leo's shirt,
we want to be able to click on the monitor.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:07.059
We want to click on you know and distinguish between
the monitor, the, the keyboard, so on, so forth.

00:53:07.059 --> 00:53:10.670
We think that's going to be something that
is going to be very, very interesting.

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:20.630
And the reason is that it allows us to very subtly
add a whole lot of extra content, extra information,

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:25.380
extra areas to sell into, so on, so forth
without bothering the person who just wants

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.670
to passively turn it on and watch it on their TV.

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:29.960
So they don't have to you know it's just there.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.610
Once you know it's there, like we tell
you at the very beginning, by the way,

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:35.000
if you're interesting in anything you can click on it.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.219
That's all we have to do.

00:53:36.219 --> 00:53:38.209
You know and while what will happen, we believe is

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.800
that people will start getting into
the habit of oh I'll click on that.

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.010
You know and they won't do it immediately, but they'll
start getting used to it and before you know it, they're.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:46.810
You know and we think that that might be strange,

00:53:46.809 --> 00:53:52.009
but I also thought that instant
messaging was strange you know a year ago.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:58.470
So, and now you know my bill comes in and
I get, I get called in the CFO's office.

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:04.069
And so, so that, that was strange and interruptive
and everything else and now it's just commonplace.
