WEBVTT

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.729
>> Welcome.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.820
I am Shawn Geddis.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.109
Security consulting engineer in
the Apple Enterprise division.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.539
Today we really want to take a serious
look at some of the additional ways

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.079
that you can enhance the security or
the fortification of your systems.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.189
And we will get through the presentation here.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.800
I just want to give you kind of some advanced information.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.459
In addition to my sharing some information,
I also have a colleague from NSA joining us.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.789
And we're going to be sharing some of our joint guidance.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:54.619
Some of the direction we want to give you as users,
administrators, developers, and how to, again,

00:00:54.619 --> 00:01:00.979
fortify the security within OS X. So
let's kind of walk you though this.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.849
If I can use the clicker.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.489
We want to introduce you to some concepts
and then back that up with some guidance.

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:10.369
And the first is system hardening.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:18.600
A lot of times they'll -- people will mention
system hardening, and they're not sure what that is.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.159
Yeah. We're hearing something back there.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.349
We'll ignore them.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:29.409
We're going to review some of the security
services and the tools that are in Mac OS X today.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.329
Both as users, Admins, and of course development.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.599
And then we want to let you know both for now and ongoing,

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.759
the resources that you have available
to you for additional guidance.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.780
Because securing systems is not an easy thing.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.620
And it's not a win time thing.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.060
It's a constant battle, and it gets harder and harder
as you get more and more people attacking things.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:05.030
So what we hope you will learn out of this really is to
better understand what that hardening in your environment.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.479
Because hardening your system if
you look to the person to the left

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.099
and the right, it means something totally different.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.120
Because the system is in a totally different environment.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.270
If you're in a hot spot, if you're in
kind of your own kind of personal network,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.410
if you're in a corporate enterprise environment, if
you're kind of exposed out in a travelling environment.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.490
So again, that's where you're hitting the different
hardening techniques for different environments.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:43.070
I struggle to figure out what would best -- what I would
have best to share with you on how to do this hardening.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.299
Because it gets kind of tedious, it
gets kind of mundane after a while.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.790
And so I really kind of hit the top ten items.

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:54.689
So really target something that all of you
in this room should be able to do today.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.069
Right? Something that even people new to OS
X should be able to do some of the tasks,

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.359
some of the approaches that I am going suggest here.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.030
And you'll walk away with a better
protection of your system.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.449
Mentioned about the guidance vote from Apple and from NSA.

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:18.229
And then I mentioned also about some physical
guidance documents and some other groups externally

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.060
that you have as kind of your security tool chest.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.650
So first of all, what does system hardening really mean.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.810
Well, the purpose of it is really to in
one way reduce and hopefully eliminate any

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.879
of that risk that's possible in the environment.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:38.569
Like I mentioned.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.319
In the environment that the system is running in.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.939
If I have a stand-alone computer that in my
house, it's not attached to anything, no network,

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:54.009
that's in a different attack environment than if
I'm sitting at a Starbucks going through T Mobile.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:04:01.239
So let's kind of walk through the ten
-- as I say the top ten steps that all

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.240
of you in this room should be able to do today

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.109
They're kind of categorized.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.000
And when it comes to security, you have to start protecting.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.430
You have to start with a good protection from the get-go.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.750
So what is it that all of you in this room
should be able to do right out of the gate?

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.800
Well, first of all I am surprised on a daily basis how
many people will, whether they're in an organization,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.000
very large company, maybe even kind of a small business.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.189
And they'll kind of share systems.

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:36.879
They'll kind of -- hand me downs.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.319
You know, you get a brand new system
and you hand that next system off.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.949
That -- now you should be taking
that system back and starting fresh.

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.050
Wiping information off, starting from a fresh install.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.170
If you don't, you're now starting
with any kind of configuration,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.430
any kind of potential embedded attack
that may have been there before.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.639
So start clean.

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:59.909
Start from a known state.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.820
Again, these are very simple, should be common
thinking in your day-to-day approach in the computers.

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.829
Never assume that the system's okay.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:14.569
If you got somebody, or it got shipped
to you, or it's in your organization.

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:20.240
So on each one of these steps I kind of want to
also hit on some of the tools that we have as Apple.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.199
There's always some third party open source and others.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:30.229
I want to specifically point out those that Apple
provides that you can use today to address these.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.090
So to really start out, obviously some
of the typical ones is the installation.

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.889
Disk utility.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:41.689
Many of you that may not be familiar with the fact that
in Disk Utility you can do the secure erase of your drive.

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.000
Kind of a nice user interface, so you
don't have to know the command line.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.329
You do secure erase of that disc plus
what's known as securely erasing free space.

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:58.019
Free space is where you may have let's say 100 files, and
there's a whole bunch of kind of space that's not allocated,

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.669
or not supposedly allocated in that drive.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.340
It may still have some data written there from before.

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.000
It may have had some temp files that have been deleted.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.920
You can use disc utility to securely
erase all that area on any given volume.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.100
It's always a good idea to do that on
-- particularly some external drives.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.040
If you're travelling between individuals, your sharing them.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.410
ASR is for the restoring.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.390
Apple software restore.

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.740
So if you're restoring imaging.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.970
A lot of you folks are using other
tools built on top of ASR.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.290
And then net install.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.140
Again, most of those are geared
towards restoring a corporate image.

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.389
Many of you are doing a lot of imaging.

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.000
I think you've been to some of the sessions on that.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.850
Very simple.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.010
So we're starting out clean.

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.019
So let's kind of keep going forward with this.

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:48.609
What are some ways that you can secure the host?

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.310
So we're going to work our way on up.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.470
We're talking about the host; we're
talking just that physical box.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.720
What are some of the ways that you can
increase the protection of this box.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.460
Whether it be your lap top or your desktop.

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:09.449
One is the discussion that many folks have
had of leveraging the lock down of firm ware.

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:15.349
Okay, had we had the PowerPC systems,
it was referred to as the open firm ware.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.280
When we had the Intel based, and you've got EFI.

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:28.319
It really is the boot -- the starting process of the
hardware, and you're actually booting your system with OS X,

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:33.430
with your machines, whether you're
back to PowerPC or on the Intel.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.879
That's where your whole boot process starts.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:40.189
And you can lock things down with
tools that we have within the OS.

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:44.420
Now if you're doing the firm wear
lock down, it's related to a password.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.870
And many people new to this aren't familiar
with the fact that the password related

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.280
in firm wear has absolutely nothing
to do with a root account.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:56.299
It's not the root account, it's not your Admin account.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.020
This is really maintained within that firm wear.

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:05.549
Another key thing that I've seen in many environments
is probably many of you have external FireWire drives.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.660
Maybe even with you.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.680
Right? And they're in a housing.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.329
And many of you might have even opened that up
and taken the drive out and swapped the drives.

00:08:14.329 --> 00:08:19.370
When you're doing -- if you look at start up disc and
you're selecting that image, and when you go to lock it

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.410
down with the firmer utilities,
you're really locking it down to

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.780
that unique identifier -- unique identifier for that drive.

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:34.009
But note that with FireWire drives, really, the
unique identifier is the bridge chip; not the drive.

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:42.009
So if you locked it down to that external FireWire
drive, you open that up and you swap drives out,

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:45.850
the system would still boot from that carrier.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.090
You wouldn't be locking the physical drive out.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.920
Most of you should be aware of these.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:54.959
The open firm ware password utility
was on the PowerPC side.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.820
Firm wear password utility is on the Intel machines.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:04.410
And those -- on your install DVDs, again,
that's where you'll be getting those as well.

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:09.399
And then those of you that are not faint of heart
here, we're getting down to the command line.

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:11.720
Getting down at firm wear.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:19.100
On the PowerPC systems you could actually drop
directly into firm wear and set up the security command

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.790
and enter that password and lock it down that way.

00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:26.639
Okay. So locking the host down initially.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:30.659
Hopefully, again, everyone in this room should
be able to do this as you walk out of this room.

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:33.990
Second of all; very simple things.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:40.700
I am surprised at how many systems when you go
to a public environment are broadcasting the fact

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:46.440
that they have Bluetooth, broadcasting their
own wireless, they've created their own ad hoc.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.430
These are attack vectors.

00:09:47.429 --> 00:09:50.909
These are now areas where you broadcast your existence.

00:09:50.909 --> 00:09:54.189
You're letting other systems now that you're available,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:10:01.040
and you potentially have listening processes,
you potentially have a point of attack.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:02.329
Simple things much turning them off.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:09.570
In some cases some environments go further and
physically disable components, or remove them.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:15.520
The key particularly with related to some Bluetooth
pieces is making sure that you don't retain

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:20.769
that discoverability beyond your set up time.

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:26.799
The standard tools -- many of you guys are going to use
on this -- are local management, System Preferences,

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:30.759
turning things on and on from the GUI
line, from the GUI space.

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:36.850
Work group manager, if you're doing centralized management
you can lock out those devices, lock out the media.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:43.470
For instance, you don't want to
the CDs, DVDs and some other cases.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.470
And then the Terminal.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:52.550
Many of you guys are doing scripting, you're doing desktop
and pushing out some scrips that modify the work stations.

00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:56.679
Again, these are tools and services
that I am highlighting are from Apple.

00:10:56.679 --> 00:11:03.739
There are so many other as well from third
parties being court-martial and open source.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:09.419
This is one that's near and dear to
my heart, many of you that know me.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:12.199
Passwords -- we should be moving off of passwords.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:20.570
Moving off of the age old attempt at entering
something that we know -- that's our attack.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.190
Moving to something that's a secure
and reliability form of authentication,

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.680
but still retains some simplicity in the user's experience.

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:35.839
So doing the use of two-factor authentication
like smart cards, or one-time password use.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.730
But the first two there, I always thought that
these were so common that people should just know.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.649
But first of all, operating as an Admin is a
typical thing that we always tell everybody.

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:52.579
But yet everyone that is an experienced
administrator I think what happens is they all know it.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.639
But they still operate as an Admin.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.110
There's a lot of functions, right?

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.820
Everyone in here doesn't act as Admin, right?

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.240
Come on! Be honest!

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.570
Okay. Won't tell.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.060
The other thing is a lot of folks are
new to the platform, thinking of Unix,

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:12.789
they're starting to enable the root -- the root account.

00:12:12.789 --> 00:12:17.689
On OS X you really should never ever
have to enable root on the client.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:22.200
And so those very two simple things --
we'll get into some auditing later on --

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.950
these are some simple steps of protecting.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.850
But with user authentication -- another
point I want to get at in just a minute --

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:35.350
some of the modifications that you can make
to the authorization rights and the rules.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.399
System preference, work group manager, and Terminal.

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:43.850
Again, tools that you can use today whether you're
doing a direct kind of one to one management,

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.590
centralized management across your organization.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:52.310
Or if you're wanting to do a lot of integration with
other scripting or other tools off other systems.

00:12:52.309 --> 00:13:04.049
Okay. So there's a couple rights and rules within the net C
authorization that I've had several customers quite alarmed

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:08.389
at situations that they just weren't
aware of the default setting there.

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:13.889
And it's a very simple thing to modify according to
policies that they may have in their organization,

00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:17.309
or just to kind of be a little bit more secure themselves.

00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:20.349
So a lot of people deal with the screen saver.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:26.649
You set your system aside or you're leaving
it; you go away to get your Starbucks coffee.

00:13:26.649 --> 00:13:29.620
You come back, your screen saver's engaged.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.620
You need to authenticate.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.500
Well, so the right associated with being able

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.820
to authenticate there is the system
dot log in dot screen saver.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.720
And the point that I want to point
out here is the rule at the bottom.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:48.370
The name of the rule that's used for that is
authenticate with a session owner or Admin.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.000
That's a key thing to keep in mind here, look at this.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.460
That's the default configuration.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.379
So let's look at that a little bit closer.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:04.860
And if we look at the rule, the definition of the
rule now, for authenticate session owner or Admin,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:11.879
it means that if someone is in the
group Admin, or me as the user,

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:17.899
either one can unlock that screen
saver and get back into that session.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:27.429
Okay? So if I'm the user, I stepped away, I went to
Starbucks, and my Admin's down a couple of cubes from me.

00:14:27.429 --> 00:14:34.729
And Admin is capable on that machine could unlock
that screen and actually gain access to my session.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.820
But this is something, again, that's very
easy to tweak if you are in that kind

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.510
of attack environment, or potential attack environment.

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:44.429
We're looking again at the very bottom of this.

00:14:44.429 --> 00:14:47.669
This is the owner of Admin associated rule.

00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:50.120
So how can we correct this problem in this environment?

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.649
Well, let's go back to the original right.

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:54.429
Remember, down at the rule.

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:58.000
We're going to use a different rule for this.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.629
For this now we want to use just
authenticate with session owner.

00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:09.439
And I've eliminated the potential of any Admin to
unlock my screen saver and gain access to my session.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:17.510
So if we look specifically -- come on -- there we go.

00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:22.669
If we look at that rule in the name of
that rule is authenticate session owner,

00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:25.649
you no longer see the ability of a group.

00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:29.529
There's no Admin group now that's
capable of doing that authentication.

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:34.029
This will take you about two seconds,
and now you're change that environment.

00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:40.049
There are so many -- there are so many modifications
like this that you can do within the Nets authorization

00:15:40.049 --> 00:15:45.449
to match the various requirements maybe
policy, maybe just kind of a desire

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:50.070
in the working environment in your -- at work or at home.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.560
There's a couple other ones here that I like to point

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:58.239
out because people again are sometimes
unaware of how OS X does this enforcement.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.769
Think about installation.

00:15:59.769 --> 00:16:02.439
We're going to install some software.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.910
So one of the rights for that is system install Admin user.

00:16:05.909 --> 00:16:11.409
Right? So this would be something that the user's
going to go ahead and install, in this case an Admin.

00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:15.299
Going to install an application let's
say into the applications folder.

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:18.490
It says that the group that's allowed is the Admin.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:26.570
And I also want to point you down to the lower part
-- oops -- the lower part that shows the time out.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:31.629
Okay. Of the time out means that
if I authenticate, I'm an Admin.

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:41.679
And I do this install for the next 300 seconds I can
repetitively do other tasks that require the same right.

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:50.589
Okay? So if I make a slight change, here I might be
in an environment where I don't want just any Admin

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:57.720
that has access to this machine to
do installs in my -- on this box.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.879
I can leverage a different group.

00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:02.149
I can create a different install group.

00:17:02.149 --> 00:17:04.879
Here I changed it to My Install Group.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.520
And I can also change that time out to zero.

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:13.750
Means that every time it needs to authenticate,
it's going to force me to do that authentication.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.839
It's not going to resolve automatically
for me in those 300 seconds.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:26.979
Okay. So hopefully you got an idea there.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.870
There are lots of changes that you can make
-- again, specific to your environment.

00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:35.589
The way the default configuration covers the masses.

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:39.159
We're trying to help you understand how
you can configure this according to yours.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.250
We're hitting on a couple of points.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:45.289
Let's go on to how do you maintain some
of this good posture once you've got --

00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:48.250
once you've set up your system and made some changes.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:54.809
Well, hopefully one of the first things that many of
you are doing -- how many people are using File Vault?

00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:55.970
Everybody?

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.140
Put up your hand.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.009
Protection of data at rest.

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:06.329
How many people have heard of lap tops
stolen in your area in the last month.

00:18:06.329 --> 00:18:14.750
Okay? How many of you heard of lap tops stolen
in the government in the last couple of months.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.680
We didn't used to have to worry did that, did we.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.140
I mean, it was -- things got stolen, that kind of stuff.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:25.410
But what's happening is we're carrying around, you
know, some of us couple of hundred gig drives now.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.080
It used to be -- I can remember when
you had a hundred gig drive and you felt

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:32.199
like you just spent your week's pay to get that drive.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.190
We're carrying tons of data around.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.600
What we're doing now also is we're
carrying tons of sensitive data.

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:39.019
Very sensitive data.

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:43.990
Whether that is financial information,
whether it's personal information,

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.549
or whether we're actually carrying somebody else's data.

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:50.889
Somebody else's confidential information.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:56.350
At least within the government space, a
reference to typically identifiable information,

00:18:56.349 --> 00:18:59.449
is PII -- Personally Identifiable Information.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.670
Something that uniquely identifies you.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.630
So if that data's there, you're in the airport.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.960
Let's say you go to SF O here and you put your lap top down

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.200
and you turn around, and all of
a sudden your lap top's gone.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:17.610
Right? Without protection you now have the
potential for that data going anywhere.

00:19:17.609 --> 00:19:21.289
Being used in various nefarious ways, I guess.

00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:26.779
So the protection that we have in OS X
for this, is File Vault is being one.

00:19:26.779 --> 00:19:30.879
File Vault is -- many of you should know,
we've had several sessions on this as well.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.250
Protecting the user's home directory.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:38.200
And Tiger had 128 bit A S, Leopard's bringing 256 built.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.289
Just stronger protection, stronger data protection.

00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:44.569
Making it much harder.

00:19:44.569 --> 00:19:50.359
And in some cases hopefully impossible, for
someone to ever be able to recover your data.

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:55.619
We then, of course, have the portable
encrypted containers, or encrypted disc images.

00:19:55.619 --> 00:19:57.789
Anybody using those?

00:19:57.789 --> 00:20:03.659
There's some cool features related to that, that I think
hopefully either you're aware or we can help you be aware

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:09.970
of some of the added advantages to the approach
Apple took in providing that encrypted storage rather

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:16.890
than physically locking it down to a particular drive or
a single entity without giving you the ability to share.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.640
So we'll hit on a couple of those I believe.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.640
And of course with Leopard, you've got Time Machine.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.050
You're going to have the ability of actually
storing that in an encrypted format as well.

00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:27.230
Secure virtual memory.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.220
You should be doing that as well where on that
Unix system you're doing a lot of swapping.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.819
Right? You're running tons of applications.

00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:37.379
System's got to swap that data back and forth.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.180
Well, that stuff gets written to a drive
just like you storing your physical data.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.170
You don't want to expose any of
that information physically on this.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.180
Anything that can be recovered at a later time.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.440
Some folks truly believe that when
they erase those files they're gone.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:01.330
Well, probably every single one of you is in a company
that had a drive restored by a company that has good tools

00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:04.819
to do some very low-level interrogation to do that recovery.

00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:06.309
Okay. Think of that.

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:12.190
If you're got readily available tools and companies to do
that, that means that they can get access to your data.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:17.850
Okay. One thing that I didn't quite mention on a lot of
these slides is the fact that when it comes to security,

00:21:17.849 --> 00:21:27.849
the methods you use, the tools, the expense you go to to
protect your data really should reflect the importance

00:21:27.849 --> 00:21:37.059
of that data or the value, the financial loss, the impact
to your personally or corporately, if that data exposed.

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:45.419
If I have a machine that has some, you know, game scores
and some information that really is typically irrelevant

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.800
and just information -- I'm not going to spend a couple
hundred thousand bucks to just protect that data right?

00:21:50.799 --> 00:22:02.470
It has to be relevant, it has to be in direct correlation to
the value of that information if it got potentially exposed.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.230
So again, the same kind of tools.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:11.750
The new stuff within Leopard being the fact that
you can force File Vault as well on those accounts.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:16.730
Those of you that are familiar with H D
I, the Terminal, or managing disc images.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:22.720
Hopefully you're also aware that in Leopard, added
a huge feature in giving you the ability of using

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:28.779
that two factor authentication smart
cards with the unlock of that File Vault.

00:22:28.779 --> 00:22:29.720
Encrypted home directory.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.690
So you would have one of those smart cards.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.630
Whether they're in this form factor
or kind of a USB download.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:42.000
Again, we've got a lot of these tools
built in locally or on the server side

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.849
to give you the ability of managing
the protection of your data.

00:22:46.849 --> 00:22:48.299
Encryption.

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:52.769
So a couple points that I wanted to
bring out related to disc images.

00:22:52.769 --> 00:22:57.309
Hopefully this is review for most
of you, maybe good news for others.

00:22:57.309 --> 00:23:02.279
That disc utility is where your performance
action -- here's one of the newer screen shots.

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:07.859
You see that the encryption there is
bringing the new level of 256 bit.

00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:14.899
But with the approach of encrypted images, you
can put that encrypted container on any media.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:21.590
Okay? There's been a lot of folks that ask, well, I found
this thumb drive, but there's a driver for it to encrypt it

00:23:21.589 --> 00:23:25.569
on windows, and I don't have a driver
to encrypt it on OS X. Why not?

00:23:25.569 --> 00:23:29.639
Right? They're looking for third
party software to provide that.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:36.570
The nice thing about the encrypted disc images here is
you can create a container and store it on any media.

00:23:36.569 --> 00:23:41.899
Whether it be that thumb drive, whether
it be a CD DVD or a network volume.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.519
You could fill that thumb drive with one
big image and store everything inside.

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:51.950
Take it with you, and now you have
protection if ever that thumb drive is lost.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.960
You physically lose the data, or
hopefully you've got copies.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.120
You backed up.

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:58.239
Maybe use Time Machine.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.289
You can store this data anywhere.

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:06.369
So what do we do -- what are some of the
added advantages of this approach as well?

00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:09.719
Well, lots of you create multiple partitions.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.970
You probably have at least two or
three partitions on your drives.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:20.480
Well, remember that with the disc images, that
image should be viewed as that hard drive.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.910
Anything you can do with your hard drive
you should be able to do with the image.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.310
Partition it.

00:24:25.309 --> 00:24:30.339
You can have multiple partitions,
different data, different disc formatting.

00:24:30.339 --> 00:24:33.839
But the whole container is all encrypted.

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:40.549
There's a lot of folks who are doing this for partitions
-- for instance, years ago there were folks that did this

00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:45.809
for some Unix apps that required both the data
and the application to be on a U F S partition.

00:24:45.809 --> 00:24:48.639
They didn't have to physically partition their hard drive.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.320
But they could do it with disc image.

00:24:51.319 --> 00:24:54.919
Others are using virtualization
software, like parallels and others,

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.700
and storing that container on one of those images as well.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.769
But there's -- oops.

00:25:01.769 --> 00:25:03.150
I have I missed a slide.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.210
Let me go back.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.100
Use this as a guidance for you.

00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:13.059
But explain one more -- one more approach here.

00:25:13.059 --> 00:25:20.659
With disc images, the physical file, again like I
mentioned, can be stored on any kind of accessible media.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.269
So let's use the scenario of storing
that file on a file server.

00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:27.289
Corporate file server, Internet accessible server.

00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:28.559
You name it.

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:33.359
And I am on a -- I am at home, I could be at a hot spot.

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:34.779
I could be anywhere.

00:25:34.779 --> 00:25:38.629
And I need to gain access to some of that data.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:45.060
What I've now done is given myself the ability
to access that data across the Internet,

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:49.379
and I've mounted that image on my desktop, just as a volume.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:58.590
All the data that's traversing from that file server
to my desktop is now again either 128 bit in Tiger,

00:25:58.589 --> 00:26:00.839
or all the way up to 256 built in Leopard.

00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:06.329
I'm getting blocks of encrypted data that
that file server to my local work station.

00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:09.919
CPU -- local lap top, desk top, you neighboring it.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.900
Without any overhead.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:17.110
Without any additional infrastructure, I've now
protected my data physically at rest, and in transit.

00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:21.289
Without any complexity, any more complexity to myself.

00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:23.359
All the runtime environments have access to that.

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:30.299
So if I'm running job apps, if I am running a
local OS X app, if I am running a virtualization,

00:26:30.299 --> 00:26:34.940
I can have access to that same data when
it's available and mounted on my desktop.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:41.330
So there's a lot of value add in using
encrypted images for accessing data remotely.

00:26:41.329 --> 00:26:48.750
So some of the high visibility attacks and compromises
and thefts of lap tops that have been around, even lately.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.049
Some of the physical ones being
like the V A in the government.

00:26:53.049 --> 00:26:57.389
It was all because the lap top had
the data and they took it with them.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.690
And the lap top got stolen.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.029
But in that work scenario, or that usage scenario.

00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:09.970
If that individual would have gone home and even V-PINed in,
or gained access in, they could have mounted that data just

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:14.900
like I just mentioned, had full
access to it, unfettered locally.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.530
The data would have been encrypted, passed
back and forth from the file server locally.

00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:23.430
And yet if someone stole their
lap top, the data isn't local.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.400
Right? That data was back on that file server.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.900
So again, there's some significant valued there.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.740
So let me move on again here.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.890
The next is how do you secure the
services that you have on your box?

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:41.800
Probably the first thing that all of us say -- this
is one that Kim and I start out with a lot of folks --

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:46.210
is if you aren't using the service, disable it.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.170
Or in many cases just physically remove it.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:54.140
Don't leave any additional -- we always
refer to it as kind of an attack factor.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.530
Don't leave something there that
potentially exposes you to further attack.

00:27:58.529 --> 00:27:59.980
Don't leave something on.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.930
Something listening.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.750
A service file sharing, Web sharing -- something.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.009
If you're not using it.

00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:08.599
The easiest thing you can do is disable it.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:14.149
That's exactly what Apple does when we ship
OS X. All those services are turned off.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.310
That's the best protection.

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:24.129
Always use the as I would say the security enhanced
version of a lot of the command line tools.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.790
Many of you should be standard using secure shell.

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:31.480
You're doing sessions between hosts.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.839
Some folks are still using kind
of the old tell net approach.

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:38.759
The difference is you're exposing
data, you're exposing information.

00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:43.480
This is standard, easy approach to solving problems.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.349
We also have all the service Apples.

00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:50.789
Right? In Tiger as well, and that further
is enhanced in management in Leopard.

00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:55.019
But this gives the ability of that fine
grain control over who gains access.

00:28:55.019 --> 00:28:57.430
So this is just typical permissions.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.900
That's all it comes down to.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:06.540
Same tools, System Preferences, Server Admin for the
management of those services, and then command line.

00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:10.940
We could go through and step you through
how to lock down some of these services.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:16.990
But what we'll show you here towards the end is
we've painfully gone through a lot of this work

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:24.339
and tried to provide service by service instructions
to how to further enhance this in the security guides

00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:27.359
that we provide out to all of you
that are publicly available.

00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:29.740
We'll talk about that in a bit.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.859
So if you've enabled some services, the best
thing for you to do is enable the firewall.

00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:36.699
Okay? The firewall is one level of protection.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.590
It's another layer.

00:29:37.589 --> 00:29:42.490
And when it comes to security, the best
thing for you to do is layer things.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.480
Right? You don't just -- you don't
want just one level of protection.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.259
If you to, as soon as you break
through that, you're exposed.

00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:53.400
You want layers of protection.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.070
Firewall's one of them.

00:29:55.069 --> 00:29:59.269
So if you enable that for any services,
you should enable a firewall.

00:29:59.269 --> 00:30:03.730
Some of you might remember -- some of
you might be using it right now on Tiger,

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.620
when you enable the firewall you
actually have the little stealth mode.

00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:09.429
Everyone remember that little option for stealth mode?

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.279
Hopefully you're aware of what that does.

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:19.309
And that is that if someone's -- let's take for example
Sarah, you're out in that hot spot and stay you're

00:30:19.309 --> 00:30:23.639
on the a Starbucks, I kind of like
Starbucks, so that's where I'd go.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.650
And I have services running on my machine.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:31.500
If someone's kind of doing probing and scanning all
the machines in that area they would start finding

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:37.990
out what services are running, what potential attack
vectors they could use for those various sources.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:46.870
Well, in the stealth mode, it's just not going to respond
to those probing tests, or the scanning for various tools.

00:30:46.869 --> 00:30:50.669
It would not acknowledge the fact that
that service really was running there.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:57.000
And then in Leopard, there's a brand new
method of enabling the protection when it comes

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.710
to services application acre session within Leopard.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.430
Kind of limiting the Internet connection,
the incoming connections

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:08.160
and out going connections in Leopard in the firewall.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.790
Okay. System preference, severer Admin, and Terminal.

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:18.049
Again, I keep bringing several of these up so you're
aware of what tools you have available from Apple

00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:21.809
to enable and manage a lot of these services.

00:31:21.809 --> 00:31:24.339
Okay. So you've got all the set up.

00:31:24.339 --> 00:31:26.429
You started out secure.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:30.710
You kind of fortified a little bit, your hardware.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.910
You started out fresh.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.029
And then a week from now somebody identified a problem.

00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:38.220
The first thing you did is well,
you said well, there's an attack.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.190
I am not going to worry about that.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.370
Security is not going to hit me.

00:31:41.369 --> 00:31:44.000
Well, you have to vigilant all the time.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.210
Regardless of whether it's an operating system or an
application, or maybe just a small tool that maybe you used.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:57.329
You need to be constantly vigilant in
protection, and getting patches to those services.

00:31:57.329 --> 00:32:01.799
So first of all, if Apple's gives you that
there's a notification that there's a patch

00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:06.210
out for something that's been identified, heed that warning.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.120
Right? Corresponding Apple security patch.

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:11.809
We provide those to you.

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:16.839
Use them. The biggest problem that folks
have on various platforms is the simple fact

00:32:16.839 --> 00:32:19.289
that people aren't up dating their systems.

00:32:19.289 --> 00:32:20.920
There's an available patch.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.230
People just don't do it.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:27.589
These are simple things that people
can do to protect themselves better.

00:32:27.589 --> 00:32:29.220
Maintain vigilance is what I mentioned.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:35.600
And other things, particularly since most of you are
getting more and more into pulling in open source projects

00:32:35.599 --> 00:32:41.480
that aren't already shipped in OS X. When you're
getting to additional open source projects,

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.029
be very vigilant in what updates they may have.

00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:52.670
Because remember, we test and we provide those updates
for the open source projects that they ship on the OS.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.840
But we're not providing it for that third --
third party or that additional open source program

00:32:56.839 --> 00:32:58.769
that maybe you pulled from somewhere else.

00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:02.349
So that's an area that you need to be especially vigilant.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.640
Remote desktop is an additional one here.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.040
And that is the ability for you to go out
and push and maintain those remote systems.

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:16.000
Remote desktop is an awesome tool to give you that
additional capabilities and -- with the -- able --

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.690
with the ability to do Unix commands within remote
desktop you literally can do anything that you need

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.380
to do on each one of those clients or hosts.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:33.560
So the other thing related to software
update is that many folks may

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:38.419
or may not may have their own software
update server internal.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:44.440
You may be running Mac OS X server with
a software severer inside your agency.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.710
But in many cases you don't want the
end users to arbitrary get an update,

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.809
maybe even from us, without being able to test it yourself.

00:33:54.809 --> 00:33:56.359
You may have additional applications.

00:33:56.359 --> 00:34:00.349
You may have additional special configuration.

00:34:00.349 --> 00:34:05.109
This is -- this is less so on the security
side, but more so on the stability.

00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:09.279
And yet stability can lead to problems on a security side.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:14.910
So it may just be the fact that a new update conflicts
with something that you've already got on there.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:21.179
So one of the things that many folks do
is physically redirect that client --

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:25.149
you can do this manually, or obviously
through of the tools here.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.920
Is redirect it to another server.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.670
The nice thing about the client is you can redirect
this to a server that that client may never get to.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:37.010
Right? But it's going to silently fail under the hood.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:42.240
That client, that CPU, that lap
top, whatever the people have.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.349
They're never going to be going out and getting an update.

00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:52.029
So you can have better control of that in making sure
that only you the Admin and only you the policy enforcer

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:57.500
in your environment are able to apply those
updates that you've validated yourself.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.760
So one of the default settings on that rather than kind

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.280
of my server dot company dot com,
would be the software update dot com.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:11.920
That's where each one of those systems is pointed to
originally in getting software up dates from Apple.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:17.909
Okay. The next thing is we've done all
this work, we've maintained our updates.

00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:23.190
But how do we know if what we have in our system
is what we should still have in our system.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:27.510
Right? So this is kind of validating the integrity.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:33.440
And to know what you've had on your system that nothing
is changed, the first thing is you've got a baseline.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.559
You have to know physically what was on there before.

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:43.259
You have to have a method to say, these are the ten
applications I've had, or I had previously on my machine.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.980
And nothing has changed.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.750
Just previous sessions dealing with code signing.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.969
And that was a way of making sure
that that app hadn't been changed.

00:35:50.969 --> 00:35:52.129
That's one method.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:57.450
There are other methods of knowing and
ensuring the integrity of the applications,

00:35:57.449 --> 00:36:00.849
the integrity of files, physically, on your machine.

00:36:00.849 --> 00:36:02.500
Snap shotting, kind of that concept.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.630
Doing comparisons.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:08.760
A lot of folks will be doing and using
tools comparing hashes of binaries.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.780
Like, there's all kinds of ways of doing this.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:18.530
And if you have a questionable system,
if the user has a system that is --

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.890
appear to have been potentially compromised.

00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:27.199
Appears to have had some altered services -- one of
the easiest thing is to do really a quick comparison

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:33.960
to your baseline system to ensure for yourself that you
have -- you truly have a system that you can rely on.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:40.340
That you're validating the integrity.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:45.059
Auditing. Remember that lots of
your applications log information.

00:36:45.059 --> 00:36:50.980
You can even enable more log in capabilities
from within applications or services.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:51.679
That's one method.

00:36:51.679 --> 00:36:56.279
That's the application telling the
system what happened or what transpired.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.019
Auditing goes further than that.

00:36:58.019 --> 00:37:02.800
Auditing is -- think of auditing as a
view from the outside saying what happened

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.269
that may not have been reported by the application.

00:37:05.269 --> 00:37:07.469
Right? Kind of the environment.

00:37:07.469 --> 00:37:10.549
So OS X has auditing built in ESM.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:16.890
So if you do kind of the single user
boot you will actually see ESM enabled.

00:37:16.889 --> 00:37:22.319
Built into OS X. But this is where I want
to take this opportunity to help many

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.590
of you understand how you can leverage that
auditing capabilities built into the OS.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.470
Because probably many of you weren't aware of that.

00:37:29.469 --> 00:37:33.869
Right? How many of you are using
the auditing services in OS X?

00:37:33.869 --> 00:37:36.549
Probably about ten of you?

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.269
Okay. So within OS X, it's somewhat hidden.

00:37:40.269 --> 00:37:42.949
We did a really good job, I guess, of hiding it from you.

00:37:42.949 --> 00:37:52.689
Part of our certification of OS X, and this goes back
to the 10.3 days, is related so a world wide standard

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.240
for certification of independently
validating products on the common side.

00:37:56.239 --> 00:37:58.509
Or referred to as Common Criteria.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.880
Associated with that is when we
provided the auditing services.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:09.570
And if you go to any of the Apple Web sites and you do a
search on Common Criteria you will see several references,

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.039
and one of them's kind of the portal
to all of the related documents.

00:38:13.039 --> 00:38:16.329
And here I talk about the CC tools,
or the Common Criteria tools.

00:38:16.329 --> 00:38:20.799
That's really the auditing, the additional
auditing services that give you that ability

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:29.550
of modifying the auditable events, changes what it is you
want to know about that's happened on this environment.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:35.000
And the ability to actually look at the
physical logs themselves, physical audit logs.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.239
And CC tools, they're available
out there for the PowerPC systems.

00:38:40.239 --> 00:38:44.669
And when we shifted from PowerPC over to Intel,

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:51.190
remember the certification there was
on 10.3.6, we've shifted to Intel.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:56.240
So if you are in an environment and you
need to use auditing tools on Intel,

00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:59.049
that might be some of you that talked to me afterwards.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.080
We can help you out on that side.

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:07.799
But the audit log viewer is a GUI
version to allow you to view the logs

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.780
and of course the tools give you the
actual ability at the command line

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:18.730
to display the audit records, display
the whole audit log file itself.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:19.929
Or even to reduce them.

00:39:19.929 --> 00:39:22.269
To physically only look at certain events.

00:39:22.269 --> 00:39:27.769
Maybe you want to see how many times somebody
has failed to authenticate at log in.

00:39:27.769 --> 00:39:35.009
Failed to access a particular service, or
who has attempted to gain access to an object

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:39.070
or a file that they did not have the authorization for.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.140
All these kinds of events, these are auditable events.

00:39:42.139 --> 00:39:43.629
Not kind of a system log.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.470
But your auditable events.

00:39:45.469 --> 00:39:57.539
And this final one, many folks have the need within their
organization or it's become their policy that in addition

00:39:57.539 --> 00:40:03.679
to doing all this work, they have to be sure
that the people using that machine are notified,

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:06.359
that if they use that machine they're being monitored.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:11.030
What transpires if they do nefarious things to that machine.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:16.890
So notifications, even though it seems
somewhat of a standard configuration change,

00:40:16.889 --> 00:40:22.359
it really is one of the key changes that
you can and should do, related to security.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:28.430
Because many times there have been
event last where folks have attempted

00:40:28.429 --> 00:40:32.569
to protect systems, people have compromised them.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:40.269
And ironically due to the fact that it's not specifically
notified to that user, even though they're attacking,

00:40:40.269 --> 00:40:50.110
specifically notified that this is a government or
corporately owned machine, an all the legalese there.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:55.519
That that gets into issues on the legal side
as to whether they were properly notified.

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:58.409
You don't want to get into that situation.

00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:07.529
And on the notifications, many of you have probably been
doing modifications to the log in window P-list, right?

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.600
Yes? No? Nobody?

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:11.969
Am I talking to the right people?

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:16.000
Many of you have been doing the log in window P-list.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.199
You've been modifying the little nib file and changing it.

00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:24.609
And sometimes it looks good, sometimes it doesn't.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.910
That's the typical method you've been using over the years.

00:41:26.909 --> 00:41:32.989
There's actually some good -- a good resource, and many
of us have been chatting about this before and that is --

00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:38.819
and I'm trying to remember when it was actually
shipped on one of the DVDs -- developer DVDs.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.580
But some of you should be familiar with off plug-ins.

00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:45.940
Right? When you go to authenticate, you know,
like, say when you did the log in window.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:52.970
The off plug-ins is what is enforcing how that is
displayed, and what are the mechanisms behind that.

00:41:52.969 --> 00:42:00.119
And one of the off plug-ins that was even on the developer
DVD a while back was referred to as a banner sample

00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:02.429
This is -- was already out there in your hands.

00:42:02.429 --> 00:42:03.730
So you might not have known it.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:12.659
This really is a perfect way that you can create your
own corporate or organizational banner, the notification,

00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:15.170
that you can push out to all those machines.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:16.250
It's an off plug-in, right?

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:23.969
You dump it into the directory for the off plug-ins
and all you do is add that to the first line

00:42:23.969 --> 00:42:27.209
of the authentication mechanisms
in system dot log in dot console.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:31.490
If you just want this to be in the log in window.

00:42:31.489 --> 00:42:36.239
There's already a sample there and
it shows you what you can do with it.

00:42:36.239 --> 00:42:38.939
Set it up, put it out to your machines.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:46.860
The key here is that you no longer are modifying
the operating system to do this notification.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:52.840
Again, trying to help you out with definitely
meeting the legal needs to this side as well.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.920
Of course you're going to do Xcode off
plug-in, you're going to hit the Terminal.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:04.880
So hopefully at least what I've walked you through gives yu
a little bit better idea on what steps that every single --

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:11.500
I truly believe every single one in this room should
be able to do in mitigating the risks on their machines

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:20.039
in whatever environment, he ever kind of attack environment
you are in, either now or later, those incremental steps.

00:43:20.039 --> 00:43:23.860
Of course we do a great job of a default configuration.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.780
But everybody's environment changes.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:26.700
Everybody's system changes.

00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:30.230
You have different apps, different tools that you use.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:36.150
So you start protected, you maintain that
good protection throughout, doing the updates,

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:40.780
being vigilant on open source projects
that you've added as well.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.350
Making sure that you know for sure what's on your system.

00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:48.079
Baseline. And then kind of that notification in the end.

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:54.329
So for my part of this piece, you
should take this as a take away

00:43:54.329 --> 00:43:58.739
that you should feel confident you don't need
your IT staff to tell you how to do this.

00:43:58.739 --> 00:44:03.000
You should be able to walk out and ensure
that your system is better fortified

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.010
So I will welcome Kimberly Cummings from NSA,

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:12.000
but we do a lot of collaboration on
various approaches, various tasks.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:23.269
And one of those pieces of collaboration was on
providing the security guides for all of you,

00:44:23.269 --> 00:44:31.250
and helping you in somewhat of an exhaustive way walk
through the services, walk through of the steps of how

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:39.559
to take each one of these areas of your system and better
enhance the protection in various attack environments of the

00:44:39.559 --> 00:44:41.349
so at this point, I will turn it over to Kim.

00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:42.400
>> Thanks Sean.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:48.280
( Applause )

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:52.620
>> I'm looking out here and I thought
nobody was interested in security, Sean?

00:44:52.619 --> 00:44:57.159
I thought I was going be talking to ten people!

00:44:57.159 --> 00:44:59.109
Maybe I should make you do my slides.

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:02.130
Well, okay.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:09.570
As Sean said I am Kim Cummings, I work for the System
and Network Analysis Center at National Security Agency.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:13.500
And I am going to talk to you today a little bit about --

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.360
well, what I want to start out talking to you about
is just a little background about the security guides

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.700
and how we got where we are today with those.

00:45:23.699 --> 00:45:29.719
And then I am going to talk to you a little
bit about kind of our -- perspective.

00:45:29.719 --> 00:45:33.169
Our psychology on security.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:41.170
And give you an idea of how you should kind of think
about security to look at your systems and your security

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:49.409
and really how you should think about it to
secure your systems and look at your systems

00:45:49.409 --> 00:45:53.379
to make sure you know what you're doing with your security.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:46:01.630
So first of all, with the configuration guides, one of the
functions of the Mac center over the last several years is

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:07.599
to develop security configuration guidance
for computer operating systems, hardware,

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:10.920
and applications for the defense community.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:17.599
Before we were writing security guidance we had
begun noticing that when customer requests came in,

00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:20.759
most of them had the same questions over and over again.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:26.140
And most of them were making the same
configuration mistakes in their systems and networks.

00:46:26.139 --> 00:46:32.629
At the same time, we realized that as a result of
the analysis we do, we frequently had questions

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:35.170
about how the system should be configured.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:39.130
But we didn't have any practical way of
getting that information out to our customers,

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:44.800
and this ended up resulting in
our first configuration guides.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.720
So when we first began this process,
the guidance was all researched,

00:46:48.719 --> 00:46:53.759
developed, and maintained by NSA within our center.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:59.270
We began with a single product, and because
of the success of the guidance for that,

00:46:59.269 --> 00:47:03.630
the request for our services for other products came in.

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:09.110
Eventually, with trying to develop new guides
as new requests came in and maintain guides

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:14.099
that we had already developed, and develop
new versions of the guides we already had,

00:47:14.099 --> 00:47:17.279
we realized this job was just overwhelming.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:24.170
And we also realized that vendors themselves could do a
much more efficient job of keeping the guides current.

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:29.670
The only difficulty was making sure the level
of security in the guides was at the level

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:33.090
that we considered to be sufficient for our customers.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:41.030
So we started approaching some of these vendors to
develop relationships with them for working on the guides.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:46.050
NSA asked that these vendors work with us
to develop the next versions of the guides,

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:50.120
and we agreed to assist them as much as possible.

00:47:50.119 --> 00:47:56.819
And with -- we had the vendor ultimately
develop -- publish the guides.

00:47:59.139 --> 00:48:03.670
This ended up with having NSA vendor collaborations.

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:14.230
We would have NSA remain involved by providing reviews,
comments, suggestions, and we do all this in order to ensure

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:22.409
that our guidance -- or that the guidance they
provided was secure enough to be used by our customers,

00:48:22.409 --> 00:48:27.480
but that the vendors would be the runs providing it.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:34.490
Any place where the NSA and the vendors couldn't reach
a consensus on what was going to go in the guide,

00:48:34.489 --> 00:48:43.439
the vendor could publish what they wanted, and then
NSA could then put out an addendum out on our site

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:51.010
so that any differences -- we could tell
our customers what we wanted them to do.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:59.410
All of these guides can be found out on the NSA
dot gov site under the Information Security page.

00:48:59.409 --> 00:49:04.699
We have a number of different guides out
there, including guides for Panther and Tiger.

00:49:04.699 --> 00:49:08.629
And the Tiger guides are the ones developed by Apple.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.640
And NSA has not put out any addendums for them

00:49:11.639 --> 00:49:14.839
We were able to come to agreement on everything.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.380
( Applause )

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:27.960
okay. Now I'm going to talk a little bit kind
of about your philosophy for securing a system.

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:36.059
First of all, kind of -- just the major factors of a
secure system, which as you can see, user education,

00:49:36.059 --> 00:49:40.679
system monitoring, system patching,
and system configuration.

00:49:40.679 --> 00:49:45.219
And of course what we're talking
about is system configuration.

00:49:45.219 --> 00:49:54.649
The others are all important, but that's really the largest
factor in making and keep a system and a network secure.

00:49:55.829 --> 00:50:01.860
There we go.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:06.710
System configuration not only plays a
huge role in keeping systems secure,

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:12.130
but it's really difficult, because
the system's always changing.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.269
Someone always has a new requirement for the system,

00:50:14.269 --> 00:50:18.230
a new machine to add to the network,
something breaks and has to be replaced.

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:23.050
Software up dates come in, users want new
software, or they just want different software,

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:26.430
or access to something that they don't have access to.

00:50:26.429 --> 00:50:29.139
The systems need patched.

00:50:29.139 --> 00:50:30.900
Am I forgetting anything?

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:35.000
Am I forgetting a lot of things?

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.880
And none of that even addresses
vulnerabilities in the system.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.130
We all know holes are found all the time.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.260
And that's part of the reason that patches are needed.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.540
But these holes don't suddenly appear.

00:50:47.539 --> 00:50:50.420
They were there long before they were ever found,

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:55.119
and an attacker could have been using
them before they were publicly disclosed.

00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:59.839
And the hardest part about all of this is
that those of us protecting the systems have

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.170
to worry about blocking every single hole.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:05.789
Because we don't know which one
is the one that will be used.

00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:15.349
And of course, the attacker only has to find one of them.

00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:19.500
So first I'm going to give you some
examples of some poor security.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:24.320
And first of all Sean talked about
having multilayer security.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.519
Poor security is having single layer security.

00:51:27.519 --> 00:51:33.590
You rely on just your passwords, you rely
on just a firewall, something like that.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:41.019
By providing only a single layer of security you give only
a single point for an attacker to break into your system.

00:51:41.019 --> 00:51:46.320
Layered security, having a firewall, requiring
passwords, bio metrics, smart cards or all three,

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.380
configuring systems in network securely,
removing any services not needed on the network

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:55.849
and other such cautions provide multiple
blocks against an attacker's efforts.

00:51:55.849 --> 00:52:02.279
It's unlikely that one layer will be completely impervious,
but by overlapping multiple layers it becomes less likely

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.290
that an attacker will find its way
through all the layers of security.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.860
Then there's poor system hygiene.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:16.670
If you don't delete old, unused, and
outdated software, services, and users.

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:20.019
When the software services or users
that are no longer being used remain

00:52:20.019 --> 00:52:23.659
on the system, they become targets for attackers.

00:52:23.659 --> 00:52:28.769
Old software and services are no longer being patched
and they may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited

00:52:28.769 --> 00:52:32.570
by an attacker to elevate privileges on the system.

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:36.860
An unused user account is also a target for an attacker.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:45.090
It's an account that can be used by an attacker with
which his intrusion is less likely to be noticed

00:52:46.909 --> 00:52:53.099
as Sean talked about, not keeping good separation
of administrator and regular user accounts.

00:52:53.099 --> 00:52:59.119
I know we talked about this a little, but I
am going to pound on it just a little more.

00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:06.230
I saw that quite a few of you do use
just your administrator account, right?

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:10.480
Uh huh. I've been guilty of that on my home system.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.780
I was until recently.

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:20.530
And when -- actually in the process of doing the
guides I realized that that really wasn't a good idea.

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:25.050
Because you know, you're sitting there, and
you're using your administrator account,

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:27.170
and then you decide, oh I need to go look something up.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.780
And you use the Web browser.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:36.420
And tell me, where are the most -- most
recent vulnerabilities in the system found?

00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:40.629
Yeah. Well, Windows.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.619
Okay, okay.

00:53:47.239 --> 00:53:54.129
But in -- when you see vulnerabilities come
out under OS X, where are they usually located?

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:56.070
Web browsers.

00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:01.620
You go look at something and you're an
administrator, and you're using your Web browser.

00:54:01.619 --> 00:54:03.909
And that's actually for any of the systems.

00:54:03.909 --> 00:54:07.849
A lot of the vulnerabilities are up in the Web browsers.

00:54:08.949 --> 00:54:13.619
You -- and that's just one reason
not to be an administrator.

00:54:13.619 --> 00:54:21.420
You forget that you're an administrator and you accidentally
go do something and erase something that you shouldn't have.

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:25.030
There's just so many reasons not to do it.

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.850
I can't stress that enough.

00:54:27.849 --> 00:54:31.519
It's one of the biggest things you shouldn't be doing.

00:54:33.199 --> 00:54:39.069
Another thing, not limiting your remote access.

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:42.400
Often those configuring a system
will assume that setting up some form

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.710
of authentication such as SSH for remote access is enough.

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:52.420
But opening any remote access to a
system is an invitation to attackers.

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:57.180
To help provide layered security that
access should always be further limited.

00:54:57.179 --> 00:55:00.250
That can be done through the firewall.

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:08.269
Using the example of SSH, it can also be done by
configuring SSH to limit which users can use SSH.

00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:13.079
And disabling root SSH log ins.

00:55:13.079 --> 00:55:15.539
And then passwords.

00:55:15.539 --> 00:55:17.420
I know Sean talked about that some too.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:21.480
But -- I'm going to talk about that a little bit.

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.070
Let's face it.

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:23.769
Passwords are a problem.

00:55:23.769 --> 00:55:27.280
Users hate them, attackers break them.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.060
Administrators hate them because users forget them.

00:55:31.059 --> 00:55:32.670
What do we do?

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:33.800
Smart cards are out there.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.070
Bio metrics are out there.

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:39.960
Some of them work and some of them don't.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:45.190
There's a lot of different manufacturers and some
places -- some companies have trouble moving over.

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:51.750
A lot of places still seem to be stuck with passwords.

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:54.429
A lot of places are just stuck for them for now.

00:55:54.429 --> 00:55:59.989
As long as we have to deal with them, we have
to have a policy to deal with them securely.

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:04.179
The mistakes some make are not
putting policies on passwords at all.

00:56:04.179 --> 00:56:06.730
Or not putting strong enough policies.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.429
No minimum length, no password aging, no password history --

00:56:10.429 --> 00:56:15.039
no requirement for special characters or
numbers in the password -- things like that.

00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:19.289
Make sure you put some policies on
your passwords that make them strong.

00:56:19.289 --> 00:56:24.179
You want users to be able to remember
them so they're not writing them down.

00:56:24.179 --> 00:56:29.639
But you've still got to make is so that they
can't put dog for their password either.

00:56:29.639 --> 00:56:33.609
You know? So you need to do a few things like that too.

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:38.519
Let's talk a little bit about what an attacker can do.

00:56:38.519 --> 00:56:40.610
This is just a very short list.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:43.720
But it gives you a few examples.

00:56:43.719 --> 00:56:44.109
First one.

00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:45.190
Steal cycles.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:50.820
This one, okay, it can cost businesses
money because it slows down the systems.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:57.180
But if that's all an attacker does
to you, you've gotten really lucky.

00:56:57.179 --> 00:56:59.639
Crashing the system.

00:56:59.639 --> 00:57:03.199
That's what people tend to worry about the most.

00:57:03.199 --> 00:57:08.929
Virus coming in and attacking the system and
wiping it, and causes everything to be lost.

00:57:08.929 --> 00:57:11.219
Makes the system unusable.

00:57:11.219 --> 00:57:14.119
An attacker coming in and trashing the system.

00:57:14.119 --> 00:57:17.409
Yeah, this can cause a lot of damage and cost a lot.

00:57:17.409 --> 00:57:23.839
But it can actually be a lot less
damaging than the next two on the list.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.480
Number three.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.840
Stealing data.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.990
An attacker can come in and read what's on your system.

00:57:28.989 --> 00:57:32.229
And quote unquote, steal the data.

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:35.610
You might not even know what on the system he's accessed.

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:42.780
But if you know an attacker's been there, you can
probably assume that every single thing on the system,

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:49.100
or at least everything on the system
that wasn't encrypted was compromised.

00:57:49.099 --> 00:57:57.420
So if you have any company secrets, the
attacker now knows them if it wasn't encrypted.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.920
Next is stealing identity.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.039
An attacker might infiltrate a system
to use it to get into other systems

00:58:04.039 --> 00:58:07.230
that give access to the system being compromised.

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:16.409
Once a system has been compromised, any trust
relationships that system had have also been compromised.

00:58:16.409 --> 00:58:21.699
An attacker will bounce through any number of systems
to get to the system in which he's really interested.

00:58:21.699 --> 00:58:25.579
So he might not be breaking into
your system to get to your system.

00:58:25.579 --> 00:58:31.579
He might be breaking into your system to
get to another system five systems over.

00:58:31.579 --> 00:58:36.190
Might be just bouncing through to get
to the system that's really important.

00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:40.200
Or he might be bouncing through
five systems to get to yours.

00:58:41.619 --> 00:58:48.029
And finally, he could be coming
in hide time bombs or back doors.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:53.060
There might not be any indication that anything
on your system has been compromised at all.

00:58:53.059 --> 00:58:58.460
It might appear that he didn't do everything, and you
might not even be sure anybody has even been there.

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:04.340
An attacker can hide code on a machine that will execute
at a later time to give him access, ship him data,

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.110
destroy the machine, or just cause annoying problems.

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:13.780
He might also make changes somewhere in the system
that will either give him an account he can access

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:18.630
or open up a known vulnerability
in the system he can later exploit.

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:30.030
Okay. Now, I'm going to move on a
little bit to guide development.

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:34.200
What goes into developing a security configuration guide?

00:59:34.199 --> 00:59:40.019
Well, the amount of data that we
consider for this can be overwhelming.

00:59:40.019 --> 00:59:42.519
The list here's kind of long.

00:59:42.519 --> 00:59:46.920
And these are just general overall categories.

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.460
As we start breaking out each area and we're working on --

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:54.909
when we're working on a specific
product the list keeps growing.

01:00:02.639 --> 01:00:06.679
Okay. So some general principals about your --

01:00:06.679 --> 01:00:15.349
these are just general principals you need to think
about when you're using a guide and when you're trying

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:19.150
to figure out how you want to secure your system.

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:23.070
The first principal you need to think
about is separation of function.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:29.970
You really want to try and put
different functions on different servers.

01:00:29.969 --> 01:00:36.679
It's especially important to have a
separate firewall providing an in between --

01:00:36.679 --> 01:00:43.139
you know, have a separate firewall between
outside networks and your internal network.

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:47.940
E-mail and Web servers should be on separate
machines from any other servers whenever possible.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:53.619
The user database should reside on
its own server whenever possible.

01:00:53.619 --> 01:00:58.769
Having these services reside separately means that
if someone should compromise one weaker service

01:00:58.769 --> 01:01:02.889
he won't necessarily be able to
compromise your entire network.

01:01:02.889 --> 01:01:07.849
Having good separation between the services by
putting them on separate servers and having good,

01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:16.529
strong authentication required between the
services adds yet another layer of security.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:17.930
Separation of rights.

01:01:17.929 --> 01:01:21.589
Having separate Admin and user accounts.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:26.070
Just pounding on it a little bit again, I know.

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:30.650
Encrypting wherever possible, even locally.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.260
Encryption provides yet another layer of security,

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:38.240
and no remote log in should ever be
done without some sort of encryption.

01:01:38.239 --> 01:01:44.659
And then minimize -- as Sean had talked about,
minimizing services, especially network services.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:49.909
Any services that are not absolutely
needed should be stopped on the system.

01:01:49.909 --> 01:01:53.199
That's also true of any unused code in the system.

01:01:53.199 --> 01:01:55.419
And this one's more for developers.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:02.369
If you're developing code and you have code
that turns out you're not using, you know,

01:02:02.369 --> 01:02:05.380
you've changed the code, you've got unused code.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.559
Don't just leave it in there.

01:02:06.559 --> 01:02:09.170
Take it out.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:11.010
Clean up your code.

01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:19.970
It helps. Another case, even though
it's not exactly a service, is IPV-6.

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:23.159
IPV-6 is currently started automatically in the system.

01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:27.980
But a lot of people have not switched
over to IPV-6 addresses yet.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:32.699
And if you haven't, you should
disable IPV-6 on your systems.

01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:40.689
Because any unused services or code in a system that
are active are potential windows for an attacker.

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.000
Also, kernel extensions.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.239
You should remove unnecessary or unwanted kernel extensions.

01:02:53.239 --> 01:03:02.759
They can provide an attacker a window, and this can also
be a good place to remove capabilities from the system.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.270
Such as the ability to use USB flash drives.

01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:11.820
If you have a requirement in your organization
that people not be able to have flash drives,

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.440
that's a place where you can remove that capability.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:22.700
The thing you need to remember is that kernel extensions
might be restored any time of the system is updated.

01:03:22.699 --> 01:03:29.889
So if you have used that capability --
that way to remove these capabilities,

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:36.329
then any time you do a system update you need
to also remove those kernel extensions again.

01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:45.529
Kind of a corollary to this is in the
guide we use this way to remove things

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:55.630
like Bluetooth and Airport and things like that.

01:03:55.630 --> 01:04:02.890
If -- any of those things that -- if
that's not sufficient enough for you,

01:04:02.889 --> 01:04:07.480
you might need to remove them in
the hardware, or the microphone.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:19.480
If having a microphone in your system is a security risk
in your area, you might have to remove it in the hardware.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.199
You might have to find a service provider that

01:04:22.199 --> 01:04:28.119
there are service providers out there
that have specialized in doing that.

01:04:28.119 --> 01:04:32.269
And you might have to go and have
that hardware removed or become a --

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:41.519
an Apple authorized technician
and actually remove the hardware.

01:04:41.519 --> 01:04:45.050
There are a number of ways you can do these things.

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:48.250
Those are for extremely secure areas, of course.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:50.829
Most people don't have to go that far.

01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:55.190
But those are possibilities too.

01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:00.789
Another thing with these guides is
when we create them, we always --

01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:04.980
we tend to do them with the idea of making
them as locked down security-wise as possible

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:09.880
and still have the system be useable
for some guides, as they've evolved,

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:14.780
they developed into providing different
levels of security in them.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:22.050
Generally, however, our philosophy is that if we
provide the most locked down mode possible in the guide,

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:26.030
the users of the guide can determine
what risks they're willing to live with

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:29.860
and then loosen up the configuration from there.

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:35.289
So because we do try to make the
system as locked down as possible,

01:05:35.289 --> 01:05:38.369
we also try to explain the implications of each setting.

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:45.329
What it will break if you do set it, what risks
you'll -- you'll take -- take if you don't set it.

01:05:45.329 --> 01:05:49.420
For the most basic settings that should
always be used, we don't always do this.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:56.079
But for services where some sites may want to use
them and some may not or for other such settings,

01:05:56.079 --> 01:06:01.929
this allows the users of the guides to determine
whether or not the risk of using a feature is worth it.

01:06:01.929 --> 01:06:07.889
And we also try to put in step by step
instructions for everything to make sure how sure --

01:06:07.889 --> 01:06:15.659
how all the configurations are done is completely clear
to everyone, no matter what the experience of the user is.

01:06:19.159 --> 01:06:23.210
Okay. And then I just have a few best practices for you.

01:06:25.989 --> 01:06:30.189
And this is kind of an idea about how to use the guide.

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:34.079
And this sounds simple, but it isn't always.

01:06:34.079 --> 01:06:38.559
And this is a list -- you know, determine what you have.

01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:40.460
What level of security you want.

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.670
What level of services you need.

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:49.840
And then you take the guide and then you
customize it to fit your particular circumstances.

01:06:51.019 --> 01:06:55.590
First of all, your current architecture
may be completely wrong.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:07:02.809
So weir (Phonetic) management allow you to
tear it completely down and start from scratch.

01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:06.309
I'm guessing in most cases no.

01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:09.610
If not, what will you be able to do?

01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:16.630
You know, Sean recommended completely
reloading your machine.

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:22.420
Completely reloading a machine may be somewhat realistic.

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:30.010
But completely tearing down your whole network and
redesigning from scratch what your entire network is going

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:33.980
to look like probably isn't it a lot of cases.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:37.679
So you're going to have to try and
figure out what you can do realistically

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:44.719
without upsetting the network too much
and upsetting your bosses too much.

01:07:44.719 --> 01:07:47.980
So you have to figure out what your current architecture is.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:52.690
What you have, and how you're going to be
able to fit it into your security plan.

01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:56.369
Best, of course, is always to reload and start from zero.

01:07:56.369 --> 01:07:59.619
Scratch the whole network and start from scratch.

01:07:59.619 --> 01:08:04.839
But as I said, that's frequently not very realistic.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:12.800
You also need to figure out what your risk is, what the
threat is, and what you're trying to protect against.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.300
Are you a non-profit with very little risk?

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:19.659
If so, you might not be as worried
about shutting down services, then.

01:08:19.659 --> 01:08:25.189
If your company is a research and development company that
may have competitors looking to steal company secrets,

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:31.599
you're going to want to protect against outside threats,
and you will have some concern about inside threats as well.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.220
If the projects are short term projects that go to market
quickly, you wouldn't have as much concern as the firm

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:40.829
that has long term projects that
stretch out over many years.

01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:45.930
Since the security breech would not hit you as
hard as it would a long term research company.

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:50.440
Financial institutions, generally, need
to protect their systems very heavily.

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:56.699
And of course the level of services you have
is effected by the level of security you need.

01:08:56.699 --> 01:09:02.579
The higher your level of security, the fewer
services you can, or at least should have.

01:09:02.579 --> 01:09:08.479
The thing to remember is that every service you allow,
every privilege you open up, every trust you allow,

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:12.419
makes it easier for someone to break into your system.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:17.640
And once you have a grasp of the different factors
of your system, your network or your enterprise,

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:22.369
then you can use the guide to come up with your
own customized security configuration guide.

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:28.250
And finally, don't forget.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:31.659
User policies and administrator policy.

01:09:31.659 --> 01:09:37.090
Policies for how machines will be kept
up-to-date, overall security policies,

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:43.590
and policies for how security incidents will
be handled, policies for reviewing the logs,

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:47.810
you're going to need policies for
how to handle all of your security.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.440
That needs to be put into place.

01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:53.869
User education.

01:09:53.869 --> 01:09:58.849
Even though people have gotten
a lot more security conscious,

01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:02.310
most users still don't know a lot about security basics.

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:05.730
It might be worthwhile to give users some security pointers,

01:10:05.729 --> 01:10:10.699
or at least point them to some
sort of security primer for users.

01:10:10.699 --> 01:10:14.970
And securing a system or network is never a one-time effort.

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:19.750
Keeping all of the patches updated, keeping all of the
security matched up with any changes in the systems

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:26.189
and any time works, responding to any attacks to the
systems, or responding to newly found vulnerabilities

01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:29.969
and other such changes requiring
security updates means that the work

01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:36.829
to keep your systems and network secure is never done.

01:10:36.829 --> 01:10:42.069
And with that, I'm going hand it back over to Sean.

01:10:42.069 --> 01:10:45.119
( Applause )

01:10:45.119 --> 01:10:46.300
>> Thank you.

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:51.939
Okay. As we're kind of winding down, we
want to be sure that all of you are aware --

01:10:51.939 --> 01:10:53.639
we've been throwing a lot of stuff at you.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:58.910
We've been trying to keep it high level so you can
kind of take away and take some action right away.

01:10:58.909 --> 01:11:03.409
But there's a lot of resources
that you can go to now and ongoing.

01:11:03.409 --> 01:11:08.939
First of all, we both mentioned the
guides that we jointly collaborated on.

01:11:08.939 --> 01:11:16.659
The 10.3 guides were formerly developed by NSA
and we worked closely to contribute to that.

01:11:16.659 --> 01:11:22.000
The 10.4 guides is when we as a
vendor took that upon ourselves.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.590
We developed those guides with the feed back and
the validation from the NSA guide -- from NSA --

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.550
so whether you want to get these from our site,

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:36.100
from the server documentation location,
or from the NSA dot gov SNAC sites.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:41.289
It's the same document, 10.4 mirrored on both places.

01:11:41.289 --> 01:11:50.479
There is additional security services,
resources I wanted you all to be aware of.

01:11:50.479 --> 01:11:56.609
Just kind of the security overview at Apple, Apple
security overview at Apple dot com slash security.

01:11:56.609 --> 01:11:59.599
Product security, which covers many things.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:06.270
Kind of the action for notices, the
action for providing software update.

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:12.050
So the Apple security updates post each one,
correspond changes that have been done or provided.

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:15.960
And the corresponding CDEs in those up dates.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:21.390
And all of you, or all of the IT folks
actually implementing and deploying a lot

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:28.510
of these systems should definitely be leveraging Apple's
security training and certification process in this as well.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:33.940
And additional external resource at NIST,
National Institute of Standard Technology,

01:12:33.939 --> 01:12:39.859
is another form of guidance on product security checklists.

01:12:39.859 --> 01:12:45.889
There you will find references to Mac OS X, and all of
these are really in the process of merging together.

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:52.800
So in years to come, whether it be in combining all of them
with NSA and NIST and DISSA and Apple.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.210
All of these will be merging into
a single document in the future.

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:59.260
But until now, you have additional resources.

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:05.449
So with that said, if you are enterprise customers,
typically you would be dealing directly with me.

01:13:05.449 --> 01:13:12.710
If you're developers, deal directly within your
-- on the developer relations side of the house.

01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:18.149
And those of you that need to get into some auditing
on the Intel side, you can talk to me off line.

01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:22.479
Since we're very short on time, we aren't
going to be able to do Q and A here.

01:13:22.479 --> 01:13:30.589
But hopefully we gave you the ability of truly
understanding the purpose of system hardening,

01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:35.510
better understanding what you can do right now,
what you can do ongoing in protecting yourself

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:40.070
in the changing environments that your
systems are in with those top ten steps.

01:13:40.069 --> 01:13:45.750
And we've given you some excellent
resources to provide to ongoing guidance.
