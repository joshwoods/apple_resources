00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.370
>> Good evening.

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.729
This presentation is Getting Started
With Mac OS X Administration.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.190
My name is Brian Loose, and I'm a
senior systems engineer with Apple in enterprise sales.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.910
And with me today is Jason Deraleau.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.570
He is a certified systems engineer,
certified systems administrator,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm sorry, as well as an MCSE, and a Unix CME.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.630
And he'll be doing the demos for the presentation today.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.670
So the first thing I should do is preface this
by saying we're not showing Leopard today,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.560
this is all going to be done with
Tiger, and Tiger applications.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.620
And the reason for that is that Tiger is what is shipping
now, it's also what is being deployed in most places.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:05.379
And we feel that any serious administrator
is not gonna be deploying Leopard,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.159
even within the October timeframe
when we're looking at release.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.729
So you're definitely looking at a good period of
time down the road before you're gonna see Leopard.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.050
So everything is Tiger, and we'll take
questions on Tiger as well at the end.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.329
So really the goal of today is to give
you an overview of Mac administration.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:30.129
Most of you are probably new to the platform, and what
we'll try to do is give you some, the basic concepts

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:35.219
and the terminology that we use on the platform,
and to show you some of the tools and utilities,

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.400
give you demos of those, and finally use that to build
on the knowledge that you have of other platforms,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.850
typically Windows and Unix, and see how
those, that knowledge applies to the Mac.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.500
A couple of things that we need to cover, but
we won't really go into any depth on these.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.359
And the first one is hardware.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.299
Now a lot of you know that starting in 2006,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.479
Apple transitioned the entire platform
to the Intel processor.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:14.500
So one of those benefits of that is that we use
a lot of PC components in our computers now.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.680
And it gives us a lot of flexibility,
and a lot of choices in components.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.450
But there are a couple of things that we
do a little bit better on our platform.

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:32.039
We switched to the EFI standard from Intel for our firmware,
and the traditional PC vendors are still using BIOS.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:36.189
Now the good thing about EFI is it allows
us to do a lot of really interesting stuff.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:44.060
One of those, a few of those things include really great
boot options at the time when you start up your computer.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.150
In fact, with Apple's remote control that's bundled with
our machines, you can in fact use that remote control

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.950
at boot time to select which operating
system you'd like to start up.

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.119
So a little known fact.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.750
But a couple of really interesting things
have come out of that ability to use EFI.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.580
And that's to have that great boot options, but also
we've got something called universal applications.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.290
So you build one application, you can run
that in Power PC, so the older platform,

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.579
and you can also run it on Intel,
the newer platform machines.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.990
So one double clickable app, you're going to
see more about that during the week,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.450
and a lot of developers have already
been building those applications.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.229
Now secondly is Boot Camp.

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:37.799
And Boot Camp is, gives you the ability to boot
the Mac completely in a Windows environment,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.280
to allow you to run all those Windows applications that
you may have a little utility to use here or there,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.069
but you don't, you're not going to
use them on an everyday basis.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:56.479
Now another thing that we're not really going to spend a
lot of time on though, is the command line interface.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.509
Now Mac OS X has a beautiful interface, in fact
we just saw some great updates today to that.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:05.219
But underneath you've got a great Unix heritage.

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:11.439
And if you were to look down inside the command line
of a Mac OS X machine, you'd see a lot of the types

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.439
of commands, command line, I'm sorry, command
line tools in a lot of the file structure

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:20.300
that you'd see in a free BSD installation.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:27.439
Now you're not going to see everything that you'd see in
a free BSD installation, there are a few things missing

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.189
that just don't need to be there for the platform.

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.579
And, but you'll also find some additional tools.

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:38.819
And usually those are command line tools that you're
able to use specifically for the Mac platform.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:44.620
In a lot of cases those are also tools that
are either a GUI, have a GUI equivalent,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.730
but are also very powerful command line tools on their own.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.759
Next is networking.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:58.560
So the Mac has a very robust TCP IP stack, okay.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.740
It bundles in IP, IP v six right now, and we've
got some great additions like a built in firewall,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.470
and also VPN support that works with
most of the firewalls out there.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.830
Now your network's not always going to
work perfect, and if that's the case,

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:17.719
we've got some great diagnostics tools built in as well.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.190
We'll go into demoing that application for you.

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:29.399
As well as you always have the Unix commands at your beck
and call, such as ping, trace route, and things like that.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:38.000
And finally, the Mac makes use of DHCP, NAT,
and DNS, all the standard TCP IP utilities,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.279
so the Mac is very standard, it'll
work well on your network.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.829
So let's take a look at some of those tools and
utilities that we're going to use to admin the Mac.

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:54.449
The first is System Profiler.

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:01.319
This is a great application that was really going to
look into your system, give you a great overview

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.610
of all the hardware, all the specs on that hardware.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.600
It'll look into your system.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.330
It will see if you've got any kernel
extensions that are loaded, including Apple

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:13.740
and third party kernel extensions,
great for debugging things.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.340
And it also contains a lot of information
about some of the log files as well,

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.560
you can get a quick look at some of those log files.

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.120
The next is activity monitor.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:35.399
If you're familiar with the Linux or Unix platforms,
this is really a combination of TOP and the PS commands.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:42.310
So very good information, real time information about
applications and the resources that you're using,

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.740
the amount of memory that they're
using, network and discI/O.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.069
And if you really need to get into an application, you can
double click on it, get in there, and actually sample it,

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:58.379
and see where the application is spending time, in
case you've got a little issue with an application.

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:05.800
Next is the Console application.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.139
This is a very, very simple application.

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:14.089
All it does is give you a very simple interface into
all various log files that Mac OS X generates.

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:17.639
And because it is Unix underneath, there are
a lot of log files that can be generated,

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.209
so a lot of information can be found in these log files.

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:24.899
And Console is a very quick and easy way
to list all those different log files

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:26.789
and be able to look through the very quickly.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.520
We'll get a really nice demo of some of
the capabilities of that in a second.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.000
And finally, well next we've got System Preferences.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.519
Now system preferences, it's very
similar to control panels on Windows.

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:45.189
And really that's where you would
modify things such as date and time,

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:50.410
modify the background picture,
similar to wallpaper on Windows.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:56.320
But what's really neat about this application is
that we built into it a way to query information.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:59.870
So if you're not sure, you know you
want to be in system preferences,

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.240
but you're not really sure where you change DNS information.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.040
You could just go ahead and query and type DNS, and it would
go ahead and highlight the particular system preference

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.670
that you would need to go into to modify that.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.870
Now it's great that it works with Macintosh terminology,
but it also works with Windows terminology as well.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.550
So if you're coming over from that side, and you happen
to know well I know this is what I call it on the,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.829
when I work with it on Windows, you can
go ahead and type in that search term,

00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:28.019
and most likely it'll go ahead
and find that information for you.

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:32.019
Next is Disk Utility.

00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:42.230
Disk Utility is what we use to format disks, we can
partition disks, we can use it to create disk images,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.610
either AES one twenty eight encrypted,
or regular disk images.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.159
And it also features a security erase command.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:52.589
If you ever need to send a computer out
to be serviced or anything like that,

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.990
you can do a nice security erase on that disk.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:06.340
Now Network Utility is that application I mentioned that
allows, in one application about ten different tools

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.019
to query the network, do pings on the network, trace route.

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:14.370
You go ahead and really do diagnostics on that network.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.940
It's really a one stop shop for all those network tools.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.680
Now Directory Utility is probably one that
you're, most people are not familiar with.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:26.729
And that's a tool that allows you
on both the client and the server

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.779
to specify how your computer is
connected to a directory system.

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:40.189
So whether it is Apple's Open Directory,
utilizing LDAP, or active directory as a plug-in,

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:46.040
you would use a Directory Utility to configure
how you were tied into your directory system.

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:50.990
Now the next two are server, mainly server applications.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.409
And we've got Server Admin and Workgroup Manager.

00:09:53.409 --> 00:10:01.319
Now Server Admin is the application that is installed by
default on server, and is also on the server admin tools

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.360
that you'd install on a client so
that you could admin the server.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:10.110
And this application primarily is for
investigating and starting, stopping,

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.409
and configuring the actual server processes.

00:10:13.409 --> 00:10:18.669
So something like the web server, or the file server.

00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:20.750
That's how you configure it, start it, stop it,

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.289
and get all of your configuration
information about how it was performing.

00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:30.069
Now it's really meant to be used as a network application,

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.590
so your server's probably going to be sitting
back in a closet somewhere, not always.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.720
But it's meant to be used as a remote application.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.930
But it works fine if you launch
it on the local machine there.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:47.420
And really, it's very similar to the services
control panel applet, or maybe web min on the Linux,

00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:49.339
that you might use to configure a machine.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:55.670
And now Workgroup manager is the second
application, it's kind of the twin to server admin.

00:10:55.669 --> 00:11:03.549
But this is what deals with actual creating of users,
groups, and creating share points on that server.

00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:07.379
So while the other one is more on the services
side, this is more on the actual directory,

00:11:07.379 --> 00:11:12.580
creating the directory, users, and groups.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.170
And lastly, Apple Remote Desktop.

00:11:14.169 --> 00:11:18.250
Now this is a tool that while it's
not bundled with the system,

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.179
this is a tool that just about
every Macintosh admin I know uses.

00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:29.309
And really it allows you to have view or
control access on all the Macs on your network,

00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:36.569
it allows you to distribute files to all those files
on the network, whether it's one computer at a time,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.420
or whether you want to broadcast the file
to all the computers on your network.

00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:43.449
And it also allows you to collect asset reports.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:48.720
So you may want to decide, well I know we need
some RAM upgrades for the next OS upgrade,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.950
and a lot of the machines are five
twelve or, megabyte of RAM.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:57.840
You'd very easily do a query on the information that
that application collects, and show all the machines

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.470
that have a deficient amount of RAM
for the next operating system upgrade.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.450
It's also a great way to install packages,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.350
software that needs to be deployed that's
in the dot pkg, or the package format.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:14.690
You can go ahead and send that out over the network, and it
will automatically install on the machines on the other end.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.460
Okay, so now we're going to call Jason up.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.560
And Jason is going to give us a demo of what
a typical Mac admin's dock might look like,

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:26.329
show us each one of those applications
very briefly, and perform a task

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.470
or two with that, just to show you kind of how those work.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.360
So if we can go to the demo A please.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.120
>> Thank you Brian.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.980
All right, so I have in front of me a Macintosh client.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.480
I just want to point out that this is
Mac OS X client, it's not server.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.129
So I'm using an admin machine, I'm going to
use all the tools remotely as we go through.

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:48.659
Now some tools certainly operate on the local machine,
and those are the ones I'm going to start out with here.

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:53.500
So as we mentioned, System Profiler, you'll
find this in the utility, utilities folder.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.909
This is going to give you all the different types
of information that Brian was mentioning earlier.

00:12:56.909 --> 00:13:01.959
You can find out some information about your hardware, for
example, if you wanted to take a look at a particular drive,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.460
you can find out what this particular
DVD burner is capable of burning.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.840
You find information on network configuration settings,
you can find information about those extensions,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:17.840
which are like device drivers on Windows, information on
developer libraries, a lot of great information in here

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.120
that you can use all in one place, eventually.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.960
It's looking a little slow there.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.690
As far as some other things you can
do with your applications in here,

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.870
the next one we're going to take a look at is activity monitor

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:35.289
And when you first open up activity monitor, you'll
notice at the top it's only going to show your own processes.

00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:38.849
So usually when you come in here, first thing you want
to do is put this on all processes hierarchically,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.129
and that'll show you just about
everything running on the machine.

00:13:42.129 --> 00:13:49.049
It'll tell you how much CPU time it's using, how much memory
is being used, what particular user is running the process.

00:13:49.049 --> 00:13:53.969
And you can even go in then as Brian was mentioning,
you can inspect it further using this inspection panel,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.029
or even quit the process right from here.

00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:59.120
Additionally, along the bottom here
we have some abilities to take a look

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.190
at different sections of system information specifically.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:06.020
So if we wanted to take a look at like overall CPU usage,
like in this machine we can see we have four cores,

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:10.340
or system memory, disk usage, same kind
of stuff you might find in task manager

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.769
on a Windows machine, or like TOP or PS on a Unix box.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:19.549
As far as some other things you can do that are kind
of neat with activity monitor, you can come down here,

00:14:19.549 --> 00:14:24.069
and there's an option here for dock icon, and now
you can have your CPU usage down in the dock icon,

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.160
and it'll give you a nice indicator right there.

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:30.199
Or by the same token, if you wanted to
have some other information in there,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.820
you can come through and tweak the settings.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.610
There's a lot of nice little stuff you can do with it.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.879
Next thing we're going to take a look
at is the Console utility.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.769
And when you come in here, you'll notice along
the left hand side we have all the different logs

00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:46.309
that the system's using to record information.

00:14:46.309 --> 00:14:51.109
So when we're looking at the log files, we can go
through, we can see okay, this is the system log,

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.120
this is the type of operations that are begin performed.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.600
And the neat little thing here is
you can click this mark button,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.700
and what that does is put that
time stamp right on the bottom.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.770
So then as you perform other tasks on the machine, you'll
see them occur in the log, and then you can mark it again.

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:07.850
So if you're using this as a troubleshooting tool, you
can kind of mark before you do something, mark it after,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:13.269
and then try to determine what problem might be
occurring by using the information in between.

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:18.909
As far as system preferences go, you'll find this off
the Apple menu right here, or in the applications folder.

00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:24.120
And using system preferences, it's again, organized
pretty much very similarly to the Windows control panel.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.220
So you'll have different aspects, different
little applets to come in here and configure.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.690
And as Brian was mentioning before, you can
kind of type in your Windows terminology,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.210
and you can find the information using that particular tool.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.410
So in this particular case, you know, desktop
picture is what we call our background on a Mac,

00:15:39.409 --> 00:15:41.459
on Windows you usually call it a wallpaper.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.280
So if I type in wallpaper in the box, I get desktop.

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:50.329
As far as disk utility goes, this is the tool you're
going to use to manage different disks on the machine.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.940
And you'll notice that on this particular machine we
can see all these different drives installed inside this

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.880
particular machine.

00:15:55.879 --> 00:16:00.649
Also you'll see beneath them they have the
different volumes on it, so different partitions.

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:04.120
This also has some nice diagnostic
utilities built right into it.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.700
For example, you can come in here, verify
disk permissions, verify the disk's integrity,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:14.230
ability to support software RAID, you can make
images of a particular volume and then restore it

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.180
to another volume, so you can clone volumes.

00:16:16.179 --> 00:16:17.939
It's a lot of nice little stuff in here.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.940
Another one in particular, you have
the option to do secure erase options.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:27.140
So if you needed to zero out a hard drive, or wipe it with,
wipe the data before you put it up on eBay or something,

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:30.740
you can come in here and make sure
that information's eradicated.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.440
Next tool we'll take a look at is network utility.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.320
And as far as network utility goes,
again, this is like a one stop shopping

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.370
for all the different network configuration
information you need.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.870
On this particular case here, I
can take a look at it and say okay,

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:47.799
I have information on different network interfaces, I
can tell if it's active, what the negotiation rate is.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:51.319
I can come in here and net stat,
and I can display the routing table,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.770
or get information from a ping or trace route.

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:57.480
And another great thing about this is that
these all are again, command line utilities.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.430
So if we come in here and do a net stat command,

00:17:01.429 --> 00:17:05.200
I'll get the same kind of results I'm going to
see on the net stat command over here.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.660
So again, you know, network utility's a great
tool to go into and make use of if you need

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.370
to troubleshoot a network conductivity issue, and you
can pretty much get everything you need in one spot.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:16.109
Now as far as directory access goes, this is where again,

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:20.399
you're going to configure how your system's
accessing different directory systems.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.030
And the big thing the directory access
is it's based on a plug in architecture.

00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:28.250
So as you look through this different setting on the service
tabs, you'll see different plug ins for different types

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.529
of directory systems, active directory, net
info, LDAP, which is going to be for Open Directory.

00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:37.019
And then each of these individual plug ins has
different configuration information depending

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:38.009
on the type of plug in it is.

00:17:38.009 --> 00:17:42.609
So values that are particular to that particular service.

00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:45.199
Another thing to keep an eye on
here is this authentication tab.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.789
And this is the order that your machine uses
when it queries the system for accounts.

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:54.210
So for those of you who are used to working on Windows
machines, your login window's going to have three boxes,

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.650
a username, a password, and then a
domain, or a realm at the bottom.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.590
Mac OS X only has username and password.

00:17:59.589 --> 00:18:04.139
The way it determines which particular domain
you're logging into is based on this search path.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.850
Notice it always searches the local node first,

00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:08.469
which means it always checks the local
machine before it checks your network.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:13.970
Now there are some tools we're going to take a
look at are again, the server based tools.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.279
And in this particular case I'm
popping open server admin here.

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:23.450
And server admin is a great way to find out all the
different information on your particular server.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.840
You can come in here and take a look at login
information again, another way to access the logs,

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:30.509
because Console's only going to give you your local logs.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:35.400
You can get some information on basic system status,
like percent disk space used, or quota information.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.200
You can even get these nice little graphs of CPU usage.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.900
The neat thing about this one is you can drag it
off, and then you get a nice little tiff file,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:49.519
and you can paste it on a web page, or put it on your
expense report or something, I got some new hardware.

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:52.879
Ability to access software update right from the
server, and then also some information as far

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:58.260
as configuring your settings, time,
service ACLs, lot of great stuff in here.

00:18:58.259 --> 00:19:04.730
Along a similar token to this particular tear out with the
CPU usage, you'll notice in a lot of the different plug ins

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.220
and server admin there's a little proxy icon
down here in the lower right hand corner.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.110
If you drag that out, that has the configuration
information for this particular panel.

00:19:13.109 --> 00:19:16.669
So in this case I'm getting server
config, that's my service ACL information.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:22.000
If I come down here to look at the AFP service, if I drag
this out, that's the configuration for my AFP service.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.950
So it's an easy way to backup all your different settings.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.009
And not only that, you can drag it back in and restore them.

00:19:27.009 --> 00:19:30.150
As far as each of these individual
services goes along the left,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.600
you'll notice we have a plethora
of different services available.

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:36.259
Most of the services when you go
into it will have an overview tab

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.379
that will tell you what the service is doing at that time.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.300
And then they'll also have some tabs beyond
that that will vary depending on the service.

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:45.970
So some of them will have log information,
some of them will have a graph, others may not.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.180
It really depends on the nature of the service.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.549
The principal too you'll see though are going to
be that overview, and then the settings.

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:54.750
And the settings is where you're actually
going to configure the service itself.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.200
So these are again going to be different
depending on the service.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.539
In this case for AFP I have some
AFP settings I can put in here.

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:05.109
If I take a look at DNS, I can come in
and see that I have different zone files,

00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:08.389
or DHCP I can come in and see my subnet information.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:13.759
So it's a way to not only see the status of your
services by an easy icon, you know, green is running,

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:18.589
but also that you can configure the
services and work with them from one place.

00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:19.869
Starting and stopping a service?

00:20:19.869 --> 00:20:22.199
Just click the button, and it's stopped.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.080
Really easy to use.

00:20:24.079 --> 00:20:28.429
One thing to point out also with this is
that when you're working with server admin,

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.910
it can support multiple machines on this.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.120
So if you had more than one server, you can put
them all in a list along the left hand side,

00:20:34.119 --> 00:20:39.819
and you can actually have all the different services beneath
it, and manage multiple services from one application.

00:20:39.819 --> 00:20:43.089
Again, this is why we encourage the use of remote tools.

00:20:43.089 --> 00:20:46.139
Last tool we're going to take a look at is workgroup manager.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.740
And the way I think about workgroup manager
is I look at server admin as the tool used

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.349
to configure the server itself, what the services are doing.

00:20:52.349 --> 00:20:56.480
I'll use workgroup manager to configure
what the server is sharing out.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.089
This is where it have you set your
different account information, you know,

00:20:59.089 --> 00:21:02.539
configure your users, groups, computer accounts.

00:21:02.539 --> 00:21:06.500
You can come in here and set up different share points on
the server, so if you need to share out different services,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.339
you know, I want to share my users
folder, I can come in here, click sharing,

00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:12.349
and then here are my different share points.

00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:15.779
I have the ability to work out a per
protocol basis, network mounting,

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:18.619
all the stuff you would need to work with on a share point.

00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:21.199
By the same token, they have the ability
to manage preference information,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.750
which is something Brian's going to
touch on a little more later.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.180
But through this you can come in here and
manage the way your systems are, and users are,

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.180
and even groups are affected with
different parameters in the OS.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.690
So again, these are the tools you'll see
principally in the dock along the bottom here

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.950
that you'd use as a system administrator.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.910
They're all designed for, the server
admin and workgroup manager are designed

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.160
for remote administration of servers over a network.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.470
As far as these other tools go, like
system profiler, activity monitor, Console,

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.500
those are all going to be local to your particular machine.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.289
So as you're working with these tools, just kind of
be aware that when you're doing remote administration,

00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:56.180
make sure you're working with the right machine.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.289
And that's just kind of a look inside the Mac admin's doc.

00:21:59.289 --> 00:22:00.250
Brian.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.049
>> Thanks Jason.

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:03.579
He'll be back to do one more demo a little bit later.

00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:05.429
Back to slides please.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:16.230
Okay, next we're going to talk about, you know, some of
the basic terminology and technologies that are common

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:21.750
to virtually every operating system,
so Windows, Linux, and Mac.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:26.390
And we're going to look at how each one of them
does things, and we'll kind of point out some

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.800
of the similarities, some of the differences.

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:34.329
And the first one that we're going to look at is the, how
the disks in the file systems work on each platform.

00:22:34.329 --> 00:22:49.259
Okay, so if we look at the disk, generally all platforms
have the capability of partitioning a disk into you know,

00:22:49.259 --> 00:22:52.200
multiple partitions for it to be used for different things.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.809
And all platforms do that a little bit
differently, they use them differently.

00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:59.950
But after it's partitioned, those
partitions are usually turned

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.580
into a volume, and a file system is installed on them.

00:23:04.579 --> 00:23:09.230
Mac supports a number of different file
systems, but we'll talk about what we support,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.750
and how we compare to some of the other operating systems.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:20.000
So really the file system hierarchy is going to depend then
on what file system has been installed on that partition.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.359
And really all the platforms support all the
standard things like CD, DVD, file system access.

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:30.740
So let's look at how Microsoft does things first.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:37.849
And generally you're going to use the disk management MMC,
and you're going to configure a disk for the Windows machine,

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:44.029
and generally you're going to have one disk, one
disk and one partition, and one boot system.

00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:49.899
And it's either going to be, on Windows XP
it's going to be FAT 32 or NTFS,

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:55.380
and now on Vista I believe it's NTFS only.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:00.040
But if you're looking for you know, additional file systems,
you're pretty much out of luck, you're going to have to go

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:04.230
with system third parties, and probably purchase those.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.799
Now in Unix things are quite a bit different.

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:11.849
Generally a disk is partitioned
as part of the install process,

00:24:11.849 --> 00:24:15.669
depending on the distribution and
the version that you're using.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:21.090
But you're probably going to, you're probably going to
have three partitions, probably one for the system,

00:24:21.089 --> 00:24:28.119
one for the user data, and probably also one
for virtual memory, that's pretty typical setup.

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:36.489
And you've really got, in Unix you've
got your choice of file system types.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:41.809
So you know, it seems like every few months there's a
new one out there that's trying to get some attention,

00:24:41.809 --> 00:24:45.529
and maybe has a very specific type
of function that it's very good at.

00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:53.009
But in general, UFS and EXT three,
you know, pretty standard formats.

00:24:53.009 --> 00:24:59.670
And in the Unix it's pretty straight forward
from a command line how you would create those.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.370
Once you're familiar with it, creating
them from the command line's pretty easy.

00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:05.689
And then the GY tool that you would
use is probably going to differ,

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.910
really depending on the Unix or
Linux distribution you're using.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:16.850
Now on the Mac, you've got really one,
the same situation, one boot partition,

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:24.419
and that's also used for the virtual memory,
it's also used for the user areas most likely.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.140
And the Mac uses HFS plus.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.930
Now HFS plus is, it's a little bit different, it's a
little bit newer than some of the older file systems,

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.830
and we'll talk about some of the things specific to HFS,

00:25:35.829 --> 00:25:40.129
and some of the peculiar things that
we deal with on, from the Mac side.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:47.900
Now we do support UFS, NTFS in read only,
and FAT 32 in a read write mode.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:54.080
So if you have maybe a, one of those disks from an older
machine and you want to pop it into a Mac, you can do that.

00:25:54.079 --> 00:25:58.259
If you've got maybe a firewire drive with that format,
you can go ahead and hook that firewire drive up,

00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:01.660
and chances are it's going to pop up right on the
desktop, and you're going to be able to use it

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.910
to at least read the files off of it, if
not be able to use it read write mode.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:11.700
And we use the disk utility application,
which Jason mentioned, for that.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:22.710
Now this is one of those things that's a little bit
peculiar to the Mac, and that's something called file forks.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:28.430
Now the Macintosh has a concept of
a resource fork in the file system.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:35.269
And the resource fork is really a way
to store meta data, or data about data.

00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:43.539
Now some file formats, like MP3s, or maybe
the pictures that you shoot on your camera,

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:49.779
MP3s got ID3information tags, a
photo is going to have EXIF information about that,

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:53.430
information about when that picture was
taken, maybe the exposure information.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.100
And a lot of times that information
is stored right in the file.

00:26:56.099 --> 00:27:04.059
Well a lot of vendors use a separate resource fork to store
that information instead of putting it right in the file.

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:10.379
So on the Mac you have this concept of the data portion
of your file, and then the resource portion of that file.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.750
But in the Mac all you see is a single file.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:19.819
And what happens is when you move that file to what
we call a foreign file system, that's when you,

00:27:19.819 --> 00:27:24.939
the Macintosh has to take some
maneuvers to get that file into a format

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.180
that can be properly be stored on that external file system.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.110
And generally that means using the Apple double file format.

00:27:31.109 --> 00:27:35.779
Now Apple, what Apple double will do is it'll
take the resource and fork and the data fork,

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:38.369
and it will actually create two files on that file system.

00:27:38.369 --> 00:27:43.699
And that's commonly why you'll see the dot
underscore file, possibly when you're looking

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.080
at a file server that serves Mac and PCs.

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:49.980
And you might see those dot underscore files.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.900
Why are those there?

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.450
Well those are resource forks that
the Mac has copied onto that server.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:28:00.740
Now when the Mac copies that file, because that file
system didn't, doesn't have support for resource forks.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:06.279
But when the Mac sees those, and it copies those
files back, it's going to take that dot underscore file,

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:09.200
recombine it with the original file when it brings it back

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.920
onto the Mac file system, so it
again appears as one single file.

00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:24.649
Okay, now let's look at the file system presentation on the
Mac, Linux, I'm sorry, on Windows, Linux, and Mac as well.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.780
Now the file system in Windows generally
your drives are mapped to a drive letter,

00:28:29.779 --> 00:28:33.279
and traditionally C is your first
hard drive volume, then D, E, F,

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:36.480
and you've got some network drives
that are attached to those letters.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.660
And the Windows Explorer is used to navigate that.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.830
And every once in a while some people will
use command line for some limited tools.

00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:54.619
On Linux and Unix and the Mac,
things are quite a bit different.

00:28:54.619 --> 00:29:01.379
You know, on Linux everything is mounted at
the root, or a slash a lot of people call that.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:08.200
And on Linux the extra file systems that you may have on
those disks, or external disks that you might plug in,

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.730
those are mounted at some point in the file system.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:17.829
And generally it's up to you where you
want to mount those into the file system.

00:29:17.829 --> 00:29:22.619
Now it really depends on the distribution
you're using, but it,

00:29:22.619 --> 00:29:27.739
you may have some specific file explorer
type of application to use to navigate that.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:35.150
But the real strength in Linux and Unix is the
ability to access those files, sort them, move them,

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:39.170
using the command line tools, using
scripting languages, things like that.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.630
Very, very strong point on that.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:50.660
Now on the Mac, each additional disk or file system is going
to appear as an icon and a disk in your, in the Finder,

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.340
which is what we use to browse the file system.

00:29:53.339 --> 00:29:59.589
That's great, cause it gives you a very easy way
to navigate the file system from a GUI perspective.

00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:02.579
But we also have that great heritage of Unix as well.

00:30:02.579 --> 00:30:09.319
So we need to get down into the command line and really get
into those files, and so some things programmatically or in,

00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:12.230
using scripting, we were also able to do that as well.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:17.839
So we really have the best of both worlds on the Mac.

00:30:22.309 --> 00:30:28.019
Now we're going to take a look at file system
domains, and the concept of bringing some structure

00:30:28.019 --> 00:30:30.190
to the typical file hierarchy that you'll see.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:38.029
Now what this does is it really
organizes the file system by scope.

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:42.569
And what I mean by that is part of, you'll
see the four domains there, a user domain,

00:30:42.569 --> 00:30:47.200
a computer domain, the system domain, and a network domain.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:55.920
Now the user domain really consists of the user's
disk, the user's directory, and a lot of times a file,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.289
I'm sorry, application preferences are stored in there.

00:30:58.289 --> 00:31:03.990
It's also where the, the typical location for a user's
home directory and all the data files are going to be stored.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:10.319
And that directory is owned by that
user using the permission structure.

00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:16.569
So the other users can't get in there and get
into the files unless access is given to them.

00:31:16.569 --> 00:31:19.309
Now the next domain up is the computer domain.

00:31:19.309 --> 00:31:25.190
And things can be stored in the computer domain that are
really read only for all of the users on the computer.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:32.420
So that may be resources such as fonts, or screen saver, or
any types of files that you distribute out of the computer

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.220
that all the users of that computer would need.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:39.600
And once again, that would have the ability
for, the permissions would be set on that

00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:43.250
for all users to be able to access that directory.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:50.470
Now third is the system directory, which
mainly is reserved for operating system,

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:54.900
and operating system update files that
would be put into that system file.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:59.220
It's really an area that you don't want to change,
you don't want to delete files out of there,

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.110
you don't want to just generally add things.

00:32:01.109 --> 00:32:07.079
And in most cases it is very, very well protected
from a typical user, and they won't be able to put

00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:11.949
in anything unless they've got some
type of an admin access to the machine.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.910
So it's really for Apple provided software.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:18.769
Now the fourth is really interesting,
and that's a network domain.

00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:23.139
In the network you're able to have a network
mount, or what's called an auto mount,

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:29.480
so every time the computer logs in, the mount is put
into the system, and resources can be stored there

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.759
that are also available to all users of the system.

00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:39.930
But what's nice is that you're able to change those on the
back end in one place, but every user has access to those,

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:49.390
and it could be anything, fonts,
system resources of any type.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.560
Okay. Another thing that's very
unique to the Mac, and that's bundles.

00:32:53.559 --> 00:33:03.240
Now a lot of you, if you've used the Mac even
just basically, you've seen applications.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:10.620
And a lot of times they can appear as directories
if you look at them in the command line,

00:33:10.619 --> 00:33:14.069
but when you see them in the Finder,
or when you navigate them they appear

00:33:14.069 --> 00:33:16.789
as a single file and you can't really get into them.

00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:18.079
Well that's what a bundle is.

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:26.029
It has a specific bundle bit set on that folder, and so
it presents that directory or that folder as a single icon

00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:28.849
that can be double clicked or dragged somewhere.

00:33:28.849 --> 00:33:33.139
And now what's inside that bundle is
really another entire folder structure.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.250
So in the case of an application, you may
have system resources, code resources,

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:44.400
there may be a folder structure inside that contains
all the graphics that are used in that application.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.759
So it's a very convenient way, and a very unique way in the
Mac platform to take all of those resources and put them

00:33:49.759 --> 00:33:55.059
into a single icon that can be moved
or distributed in a very easy way.

00:33:55.059 --> 00:34:03.129
And we'll talk about that in another slide, but one of
the things we also do is if you've ever used Keynote,

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.560
obviously you've seen Keynote presentations,
because we're doing those all today.

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:10.489
But a Keynote file really is also a bundle.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.449
So a document can also be a bundle.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:19.279
It's really a directory that has all the Keynote
data that needs to present the Keynote presentation,

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.070
but then any movies or graphics
that are applied to that slideshow,

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.720
those can be stored right inside that file bundle.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:34.939
And it's not just a garbled mess of binary bits
inside there that you'd find in a typical file.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:43.730
What you'd see if you looked inside that bundle is that
you'd see the actual dot TIFF files, the dot PNG files.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:48.960
So very easy to pull those resources out
if you need to, or add a resource back in,

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.059
if you had to rescue a file for some reason.

00:34:51.059 --> 00:35:00.079
Okay. Next we're going to talk about directory services.

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:06.239
And directory services over the last really five
years, you know, some people more than that,

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:12.649
people have been using directory services as a really
nice way to make their networks and their machines,

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.740
all the machines on their networks much more efficient,
and a much better way to manage their systems.

00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:21.709
So it's no different on Mac OS X,
but we'll take a look at how each

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:26.329
of the specific platforms once again
handles those directory services.

00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:30.230
So they're great at consolidating account information,
because I can handle all of that on the back end,

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.940
I have one place where I can modify
user accounts, things like that.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.039
And it's great because I only have also
one place to back up those user accounts,

00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:43.050
rather than having individual user accounts stored on
every single computer, that if I wanted to add one I'd have

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:49.460
to visit every computer, or figure out some way
to add that account on every computer remotely.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:56.369
It's also great because you can have just, well some
people would have just a single source place to do that,

00:35:56.369 --> 00:36:02.029
but in most directory systems you've got the
concept of backups, or in the Mac OS X replicas,

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:08.350
so that you can not only have backups, live backups of that
data running, but also it provides load balancing as well.

00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:10.650
So when you've got a lot of authentications to be performed,

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.530
and those can be pretty CPU taxing,
that handles that as well.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:20.320
And you'll find that most people are
doing this around the LDAP standard.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.300
So how does Microsoft do it?

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.480
Well, you're probably pretty used to active directory,

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.250
it's pretty hard to go somewhere
and not hear about active directory.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:32.860
But it's really based around the
concepts of, and really is based on LDAP,

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:38.470
and some modified Kerberos thrown
in for the authentication pieces.

00:36:38.469 --> 00:36:43.419
And it's primarily administered by the active
directory users and computers application.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.360
And they use a little bit of a custom
scheme to do their own things that are,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.200
that apply specifically to the Windows platform.

00:36:50.199 --> 00:36:57.179
So, Unix is a little bit different because you've got the
concept of probably a lot more directory systems out there

00:36:57.179 --> 00:37:02.849
that you tie into, in fact some people may even write their
own directory systems if something doesn't fit their need.

00:37:02.849 --> 00:37:08.940
That's just how handy you know,
Unix admins and Unix people are.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.010
But typically a lot of those are based on LDAP as well.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:18.500
But what's difficult about that platform is
that you may have a system administrator leave,

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.030
and they may have the only knowledge
about how that directory system works.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:27.620
And typically every one of them is going to work completely
differently, they're going to have different applications,

00:37:27.619 --> 00:37:34.889
and different tools and commands that they're going to
use to administer that particular directly system.

00:37:34.889 --> 00:37:41.670
Okay, so let's take a little bit, a
look at how that's done on the Mac.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:45.909
Some things are very similar, but you'll
see that some things are very different.

00:37:45.909 --> 00:37:48.809
Our solution is based on Open LDAP.

00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:54.900
So open source implementation of an LDAP
server, and we call it Open Directory.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:02.450
Now that term Open Directory applies to both the
client, as well as a lot of the concepts on the server.

00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:07.509
But the one thing that's nice about Open Directory is
that it's a very convenient, and very consistent way

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:15.170
to handle directory services, whether
it is on the client or the server.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:23.309
So Open Directory is also a term that we
use to talk about whether the, how the,

00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:26.049
what state the server is in, or what type of a server it is.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:32.620
And on the Mac we call that an Open Directory master, and
that's where it would be hosting the entire LDAP directory,

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:36.789
as well as all the authentication information.

00:38:36.789 --> 00:38:42.269
Now being bound to an Open Directory
server is how we describe the client.

00:38:42.269 --> 00:38:49.059
So using that directory access utility, you would go in and
bind the client to the server, and you have the concept then

00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:53.690
of Open Directory from the server,
and Open Directory on the client.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:39:00.050
And as Jason mentioned, it's an entire plug in
architecture, so if somebody wants to write a plug

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.180
in for our Open Directory architecture, they can do that,

00:39:03.179 --> 00:39:08.589
and that can tie into another completely
different directory system, such as Novell

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:13.559
or some of the other ones out on
the market if they needed to.

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:18.880
So to sum up on the directory service tools,
server admin and workgroup manager we've shown you,

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:25.430
and directory utility we showed you as
well, it's a plug in based architecture.

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:30.619
And then what we haven't mentioned are some
of the command line tools, and that is a DSCL,

00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:37.239
or directory services command line, and also lookup D. If
you're doing any serious directory services work on the Mac,

00:39:37.239 --> 00:39:42.809
you're probably going to run into those tools, and there
are actually a couple more that we won't get into.

00:39:42.809 --> 00:39:45.889
But that's probably what you're going to use.

00:39:45.889 --> 00:39:53.379
Okay, the next concept is client management.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:59.710
And just like directory services, client
management has a lot of people to do,

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.730
to be much more efficient with their client administration.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:10.639
And it's a great way to define who is able
to do what, and you find those IT policies

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:14.159
that you're going to push out to the
systems around the network.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:25.559
So for the ability to define what capabilities an
application has, where a user is going to store certain data,

00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:31.820
enforcing those IT policies, maybe
determining whether somebody has the ability

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.990
to burn a CD on that computer or not.

00:40:34.989 --> 00:40:40.879
And generally those are, while they can be set locally,
generally those are going to be pushed out in mass numbers

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.680
from a directory service which we just mentioned.

00:40:44.679 --> 00:40:48.419
So let's take a quick look at how Windows does this.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:54.289
Generally all of those preferences and settings
and controls are stored in the beloved registry,

00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:58.800
and a lot of us know that the registry,
it's a very great, it's a great concept.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.670
If something happens to that registry,
you've got problems, okay?

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:06.639
So it's kind of all the eggs are in that one basket.

00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:12.219
Let's take a look at Unix.

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:19.199
Now Unix is really a mess, because you've got application
and system configuration files that are strewn all

00:41:19.199 --> 00:41:25.199
over the operating system, and unless you're an expert,
which many people are, and they know where every single one

00:41:25.199 --> 00:41:33.839
of those files lives and exactly how to edit that particular
flavor of config file, you've also got problems in there

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.220
because it's very, it can be very difficult.

00:41:36.219 --> 00:41:39.859
So what you've really got on the Unix
platform is what you used to have on Windows

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.769
with all the ini files, and all that mess.

00:41:42.769 --> 00:41:47.300
So you know what a pain that can be.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.350
So how do we do it on the Mac?

00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:56.190
Well long time ago when, oh geez, it's
what six years now, seems so long.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:03.559
When Mac OS X was being formed, you know, we, the
engineers, Apple engineers had the ability to look

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:10.150
at what everybody else had done in the Unix world and
Windows, and they had the ability to see how not to do it,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:14.210
and to see well, maybe we should
try to do some things like this.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:21.030
And so they had the ability to say well we should
really use some structured configuration files,

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:26.640
we should store them in various central locations, very
easy to find, most of the files all go in this one spot,

00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:30.000
and they made them all be the same
format, which is a P list,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.210
what we call a P list format, which
is really just XML formatted data.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:41.280
So it's very human readable, it's very easy to
edit those files, hand edit those if you need to.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.019
So it solves a lot of those issues
from the other platforms that we saw.

00:42:46.019 --> 00:42:49.840
Additionally, a lot of these property
lists, or configuration files can be pushed

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.019
out from our client management tools,
or what we call managed client.

00:42:55.019 --> 00:43:00.009
A lot of you have heard of this as MCX.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:06.790
So we're going to bring Jason back up, and Jason is going to give
us a quick demo on, and show us a little bit about P lists,

00:43:06.789 --> 00:43:09.449
how you can edit those, and how easy they are to work with.

00:43:09.449 --> 00:43:12.129
So over to demo A please.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:12.559
>> All right.

00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:15.809
So we're going to take a look at some P list information here.

00:43:15.809 --> 00:43:19.259
And the first thing I'm going to do is open up
a P list file so we can take a look at it.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:26.140
I'm going to go into my user folder, into my library,
whoa, sorry about that, technical difficulty.

00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:29.799
Into my library folder, and then within
this folder I have my preferences folder,

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.630
where the majority of preferences are going to
be collected for my particular account.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:39.140
In the list here you'll notice most of these are
formatted with a name like com or org or net,

00:43:39.139 --> 00:43:43.349
depending on what particular domain it is, the
company, and then the particular application.

00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:48.739
So the docs preferences are com dot Apple dot
doc dot P list, or in the case of something

00:43:48.739 --> 00:43:51.609
like Safari it would be com dot Apple dot Safari dot P list.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:55.090
So let's go ahead and open up Safari here first.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:44:01.130
And one of the big things we were talking about with Safari
today is that we have this new feature of draggable tabs.

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.740
But in Safari the tabs are actually disabled by default.

00:44:04.739 --> 00:44:09.409
So the first thing I'm going to come in
here is go to preferences, hit my tabs

00:44:09.409 --> 00:44:10.969
and then go ahead and enable tab browsing.

00:44:10.969 --> 00:44:17.250
We'll close the window, and now let's take
a look at what that did in the back end.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.239
Here's that com dot Apple dot Safari P list,
I'm going to go ahead and double click that.

00:44:20.239 --> 00:44:24.449
And that's going to open up in an
application called Property List Editor.

00:44:24.449 --> 00:44:29.399
Now Property List Editor is not installed by default
on Mac OS X, it's part of the X code tools.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.300
So this is an optional install, it's on the same install
media, but you'll have to go through an extra step

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.720
to install Property List Editor on your machine.

00:44:35.719 --> 00:44:39.739
Even if you're not a programmer, I highly recommend
installing the developer tools on your machine,

00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:44.139
because there's just a lot of great tools in here
beyond not only Property List Editor, but Package Maker

00:44:44.139 --> 00:44:47.199
and some other tools that you'll use as an administrator.

00:44:47.199 --> 00:44:50.549
So as I take a look through here, you'll
notice that this information's structured kind

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.730
of like, similar to the Windows registry.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:57.480
You'll, we have a root, we have different
values, they have types like a Boolean or a string.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.460
And right here we can see that tab browsing
value where I say okay, tab browsing is enabled,

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.210
and as we saw in preferences a moment ago, it is enabled.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:13.190
But if I were to change this value to a null
and then save it, I can come back in here now

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:16.030
and notice that tabs are no longer enabled.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:21.140
So really what this is showing is that the
correlation between these settings and the way

00:45:21.139 --> 00:45:24.409
that actually the system stores
it is through that P list file.

00:45:24.409 --> 00:45:29.649
Now one of the nice things we were talking about is that P
list files are structured data, so we give you some tools

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.340
to work with the stuff, not only Property
List Editor, but also some command line tools.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.090
And one of the neat things about the
command line tools is that you can go in

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:41.250
and you can sometimes set hidden parameters that
aren't normally available in the application.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:46.570
So if I switch back over here to Safari just for a moment,
you'll notice in my menus across the top I have file, edit,

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:50.510
view, history, kind of your typical
choice, with my last option being help.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:56.030
I'm going to go ahead and close Safari for just a moment,
and I'm going to issue a command here using defaults.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.820
And defaults is a command used
to set these different values.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.210
So in this case I'm going to say defaults, and
then I'm going to use write, which is the action.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:07.769
And then remember we're going to use com dot
Safari dot, I'm sorry, com dot Apple at Safari

00:46:07.769 --> 00:46:11.070
to modify that particular set of settings.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:15.370
In this case I'm going to use a hidden
feature called include debug menu.

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:17.589
And then I'm going to set it to yes.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:21.660
I hit enter here, and I'm going to come back to my P list file,

00:46:21.659 --> 00:46:25.519
let me just close this and reopen
it so we'll see the change.

00:46:25.519 --> 00:46:29.050
Now if I look in the menu, I see this new
option include debug to menu is set to yes.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:34.650
So now if I open up Safari, you'll notice now that
after the Help menu I have a new choice of a Debug menu,

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:38.740
and using this Debug menu I have some additional
options that aren't normally available in Safari.

00:46:38.739 --> 00:46:43.239
So using the defaults command, I can go in and set some
different values that may not normally be presented

00:46:43.239 --> 00:46:46.719
in the graphical interface through the preferences panel.

00:46:46.719 --> 00:46:51.669
Another great tool for working on the command line
with a P list files is there's a tool called PL util.

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:56.740
And what PL util will do is it will allow you
to verify the integrity of these property lists.

00:46:56.739 --> 00:47:00.059
It kind of does a check sum, an integrity check of it just

00:47:00.059 --> 00:47:03.070
to make sure it has the right values
and it's structured properly.

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:11.750
So if I run PL util, and I take a look at that com dot
Apple dot Safari file in my preferences folder here,

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:15.679
I notice that it reports back after
I run PL util on it that it is okay.

00:47:15.679 --> 00:47:20.369
So I know that this property list is
properly formatted for the system.

00:47:20.369 --> 00:47:33.559
Now just to kind of give you an idea of what
it'll look if I put some junk data on here.

00:47:33.559 --> 00:47:38.469
Okay, so I just put some extra junk data on the end there,
and now I'm going to run PL util again on that particular file,

00:47:38.469 --> 00:47:41.929
and you'll notice it reports back that
the information's not structured properly.

00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:47.619
So what I can do at this point is I know I have a corrupt
file preference, in order to reset this value back

00:47:47.619 --> 00:47:52.509
to its default, I can drag the P list file
into the trash, and then reopen Safari,

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.870
and it'll reset back to the application defaults.

00:47:55.869 --> 00:48:00.049
So if you ever have an application that seems to freeze when
you first open it, you can kind of drag that P list file

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:03.680
out of the way, and that'll reset the
application back to its original settings

00:48:03.679 --> 00:48:08.509
so you can be sure you have a pristine environment when you
first open it, and you don't have something cluttering it.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:12.510
So again, these are just some of the different tools
you have available to you in working with P list files

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.240
on the command line, and in the graphical user environment.

00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:20.599
And property lists are a great thing to
learn how to use and work with on Mac OS X.

00:48:20.599 --> 00:48:21.469
Brian.

00:48:21.469 --> 00:48:22.449
>> Thanks Jason.

00:48:22.449 --> 00:48:24.919
Back to slides.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.230
The next thing we're going to talk
about is software deployment.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:31.800
And there are a lot of tools on
all the platforms to do this.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:37.330
Once again, a very similar concept regardless of the
platform, but there are a couple of different ways

00:48:37.329 --> 00:48:40.779
that we can do it on each platform, and
we've got some real advantages on the Mac

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.210
for doing that, so let's take a look at that.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:50.639
So really software deployment is getting the bits in
the software and the files on the machine that you need

00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:53.139
to be there so that the user can get some work done.

00:48:53.139 --> 00:48:57.079
And you can use some tools to do some
bare metal installs right on the machine

00:48:57.079 --> 00:49:00.029
to get that machine up from a blank state.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:04.519
But then you also typically need some tools
to keep that machine updated as you go

00:49:04.519 --> 00:49:08.920
through the year, you got system updates.

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:16.720
So on Windows, most of those, most of the install files
are, come as dot msi files, and you've got a number of ways

00:49:16.719 --> 00:49:19.259
to distribute those and install them over the network.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:25.840
And you've got even some third party
tools, like VISE on the Mac and Windows.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:34.079
And from a network, or even a floppy disk and CD
standpoint, you've got tools such as Symantec's Ghost

00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:40.059
which has always been very popular, and now you've got on
the higher end some things like Altiris,

00:49:40.059 --> 00:49:42.960
and some automated ways to push down software.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.389
But a lot of people use software maintenance capabilities,

00:49:46.389 --> 00:49:50.639
the remote installation server and
the Windows software update server.

00:49:50.639 --> 00:49:59.139
On Unix, most of the software distribution
is, it's done in a custom way.

00:49:59.139 --> 00:50:03.889
They either write their own scripts, or
they may purchase a piece of software

00:50:03.889 --> 00:50:08.289
that also can install Unix files over the network.

00:50:08.289 --> 00:50:12.559
But a lot of it is typically done by
admins that say oh well I can do this.

00:50:12.559 --> 00:50:17.279
I can whip some scripts together, and I
know how to move files around the network.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:21.460
In other cases they may just do network mounts for this.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:27.360
But you've, sometimes you've got to get that system up from
bare metal, and then you've got the ongoing maintenance,

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.970
which a lot of people use read mind
and custom shell scripts to do.

00:50:32.969 --> 00:50:38.149
Okay, so not very consistent, very easy methods to do that.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:44.030
On a Mac you've got a number of ways to distribute software.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.460
We'll talk about these in depth.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:51.230
We've got drag and drop which is really the easiest, and
you've got NetBoot, and we'll talk a little bit more

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.980
about that in depth, NetBoot and net install.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:51:00.929
You've got the command line tools which really is, can
be considered part of that disk utility we showed you.

00:51:00.929 --> 00:51:04.539
And that's a tool called ASR, or Apple Software Restore.

00:51:04.539 --> 00:51:13.570
Mac OS X server has a software update server built
into it, so if you wanted to use that as a proxy

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:20.250
to mirror Apple software updates, and then test
those updates, and then choose to make them public

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:24.699
for the machines on your network, you can go ahead
and do that, and then you don't have a thousand

00:51:24.699 --> 00:51:30.859
or ten thousand machines going out to the Internet to get
software updates, they're all hitting your central point,

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.849
your central server, and they're
getting only approved software updates

00:51:33.849 --> 00:51:37.539
which you've allowed to be distributed to them.

00:51:37.539 --> 00:51:40.949
And then lastly, Apple Remote Desktop,
which we've mentioned a couple of times.

00:51:40.949 --> 00:51:44.750
You can also push out system updates that
way, and have them installed over the network.

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.949
So we'll get a, take a little bit more
of a look at some of these methods.

00:51:47.949 --> 00:51:50.219
A drag and drop is really one of the easiest methods.

00:51:50.219 --> 00:51:59.379
And for, when you've got users in an environment
you know, very typically like at Apple,

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:06.180
very educated users that you know, Apple pretty
much says you're responsible for your machine,

00:52:06.179 --> 00:52:10.569
and we trust you with software, and if
you need to install some software you can.

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:15.690
You can distribute, and a lot of people do over
the Internet, software stored on a disk image.

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:20.400
And you simply double click that disk image after
it's downloaded, and it's a single file on there.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:24.610
And remember we talked about that single file, it's
probably a bundle, and you take that and you drag it

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:26.740
into your applications folder, and it's installed.

00:52:26.739 --> 00:52:29.939
Okay, you don't have sixty five
thousand files that are strewn

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.670
across the operating system, everything's
enclosed in that file.

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:37.269
So drag and drop for a lot of people can be the easiest
way to distribute software, as long as you've got users

00:52:37.269 --> 00:52:42.070
that are somewhat capable of doing that sort of thing.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:46.550
Another way that we'll look at
now, well let's go back there.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:53.280
One of the things that, from an administrative standpoint
is that it doesn't leave any tracks or any history

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.960
that the person has dragged that
into their applications folder.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.990
So that could be one downside.

00:52:59.989 --> 00:53:06.229
Now probably the next typical way is that
you'll see people distribute dot pkg files,

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:08.170
or a packet, what we call package files.

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:12.680
And when you double click on that file, it's
going to launch the Mac OS X installer.

00:53:12.679 --> 00:53:19.009
And that installer is going to look at that package, and
you'll use that to go ahead and install that package.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:23.920
And typically a package is used when you've got
a little bit more complex installation, you need,

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:28.409
you do need some files to go in some places
that are spread out across the system.

00:53:28.409 --> 00:53:33.909
But what's really nice about this package file is
that in addition to that payload that you deployed,

00:53:33.909 --> 00:53:37.059
you can also have pre and post install scripts.

00:53:37.059 --> 00:53:47.029
So the process can be, if you're creating your own
package files, you can create a system that has a payload,

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:53.180
or you can choose not to even deploy a payload, and
just deploy an installer file that does some action,

00:53:53.179 --> 00:53:58.639
such as maybe move some things, delete certain
files, add some certain files in hidden places.

00:53:58.639 --> 00:54:01.239
So it's very flexible from that standpoint.

00:54:01.239 --> 00:54:07.069
And after that's deployed, it does leave a record
in your slash library slash receipts folder.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:10.550
So you do have a programmatic way that
you can go in and look in that folder

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:13.120
and see if a specific package has been installed.

00:54:13.119 --> 00:54:15.299
So some nice benefits of that over the drag and drop.

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.640
And then you've also got third party installers.

00:54:18.639 --> 00:54:23.619
There are some installers specifically that
people have written for Java applications

00:54:23.619 --> 00:54:28.239
that will install a Java app on any platform, regardless.

00:54:28.239 --> 00:54:30.569
You've got VISE on the platform.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:37.120
And from a Linux or a Unix standpoint, if you've got some
applications, some very, your favorite source applications,

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:42.849
you can install Think, and through the command
line you can very easy, easily browse and select

00:54:42.849 --> 00:54:50.500
that open source software to either install the binary
on your machine, or download all of the source code,

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:54.469
have it compiled and installed
all in a couple of keystrokes.

00:54:54.469 --> 00:55:04.459
Okay, so you've got the concept now of, we'll talk
about bare metal deployments and software updates.

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:07.429
So in a bare metal deployment, you're
really putting software on the computer

00:55:07.429 --> 00:55:11.109
from scratch, something that has nothing there.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:16.640
And because we support a number of different boot
methods, you could, to get that software on you could boot

00:55:16.639 --> 00:55:22.250
from a fireware hard disk, you could boot over
the network, which is typically the most common,

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.960
you could boot from a DVD and run that installer.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:31.190
Okay, so the most popular methods obviously for a large
scale deployment are network, because the machine can sit

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:38.710
where it is, and it can be invoked, that NetBoot can
be invoked at the user end, or programmatically your,

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:42.849
you can tell your machines over the
network to boot off of a NetBoot server.

00:55:42.849 --> 00:55:50.420
Okay, so let's take a little bit of a
look at, now at the entire boot process.

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:56.039
And in Mac it's, in some ways it's similar,
again, a lot of ways it's different.

00:55:56.039 --> 00:55:59.320
The first thing that happens when you turn
that on is you get the power on self test.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:05.550
And if that passes, and most times
it does, it moves on to the firmware.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:12.380
And the firmware is going to look now for a boot loader, or
valid boot loaders, and the boot loader is then going to bring

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:18.070
up enough of the kernel that the system is
now running, it's got enough services running

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:20.039
where the computer can start to function.

00:56:20.039 --> 00:56:24.039
And then what happens on the Mac is that
a process called Launch D takes over.

00:56:24.039 --> 00:56:32.210
And Launch D really is a replacement for all those
Unix RC script files that can start up processes,

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:35.500
and bring up all the processes that you
need to have running on your system.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:41.980
So what Launch D does is it looks at all of the different
services that your system has installed on them,

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:47.130
and the way that they're keyed is that they
have priorities, and they all have requirements.

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:55.420
So instead of hand editing in RC script file to determine
what order something should load in, when people develop,

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:02.210
in the system when they develop the system processes,
inside of that process there's a P list that tells it well,

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:09.829
I'm a directory services service, and I require
networking services to be available before I can start up.

00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:17.360
So Launch D analyzes all of the services that you have,
it prioritizes which one needs to be launched first,

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.760
and generates an entire order that
they need to be launched in.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:26.180
Remember I said all of them have you know, some
dependencies on other things that have to be loaded first.

00:57:26.179 --> 00:57:32.399
So Launch D handles all of that automatically, and
that will bring up all the services that your Mac needs

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.940
in the right order automatically, and
it's very, very slick and well done.

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:41.000
So once that happens, you've got a Mac that's booted up,

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.480
and you start to see the little bar comes
across, welcome to Mac, and you can log in.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.150
Now let's talk a little bit more about NetBoot.

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:54.660
NetBoot has a, we'll talk a little bit
about the process of NetBooting a machine.

00:57:54.659 --> 00:57:58.230
The first thing that you would need
to do is build a NetBoot image.

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:05.550
So that process involves taking a system that
generally has a system already installed,

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:09.039
the way that you've customized it and you like it to run,

00:58:09.039 --> 00:58:13.440
and you would use a system image utility
to create a disk image of that system.

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:27.519
Now you could also take a software restore disk that
we ship with the computer, or you could have an entire,

00:58:27.519 --> 00:58:31.400
complete up and running system that you
could turn into, you could start that system

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.559
up with a firewire drive, and you
could image that entire system.

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:40.380
So there are a number of ways you could
create this net install, or a NetBoot image.

00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:46.550
So you take that image, put it on the Mac OS
ten server that has the NetBoot server running,

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:50.240
and you'd start the machine up, and
typically you're holding down the N key,

00:58:50.239 --> 00:58:52.469
and that tells the computer to start up in NetBoot mode.

00:58:52.469 --> 00:58:57.029
And it really probes out in the
network, and it asks for a DHCP address.

00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:03.070
Well it's going to get a DHCP address from somewhere,
typically you've got a DHCP server out there.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:08.570
But the NetBoot server is also going to augment
that DHCP information with a NetBoot response.

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:16.320
And that NetBoot response is going to tell it hey, I'm a
NetBoot server, and I have some NetBoot images located

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:20.620
at this location, this IP address, and this path.

00:59:20.619 --> 00:59:28.690
So once the machine says oh well, I want to NetBoot, I
have my IP address, and it goes ahead and it starts to take

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:31.730
that information, and it says okay,
I know where that file is.

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:38.289
It loads the NetBoot image, and it starts to
boot the image located on that NetBoot server.

00:59:38.289 --> 00:59:42.529
Now at that point the system can
boot and run across the network.

00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:46.910
It doesn't need any local disk to pull any resources from.

00:59:46.909 --> 00:59:52.319
However, it is very helpful, it can use that hard
disk as a scratch location, rather than running that,

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.130
running scratch information back to, over the network.

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:57.019
So it can work either way.

00:59:57.019 --> 01:00:03.000
But at that point you're completely
running over the network.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:12.769
Now net install is a variant of NetBoot, and net install
would basically use NetBoot just to get the system up

01:00:12.769 --> 01:00:18.250
and running, but then net install would take over and
you could use the net install capabilities to then,

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:26.630
after the machine was booted, install a complete operating
system, or even just a few packages on that system.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:34.500
And then finally, net restore is a very popular third
party application that a lot of people are using.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:41.219
It has a lot of customizability into it, so you can do,
and you can specify a lot of post install operations

01:00:41.219 --> 01:00:47.179
that happen, such as giving your machine a name
based on its Mac address, things like that.

01:00:47.179 --> 01:00:50.559
A very, very popular application.

01:00:50.559 --> 01:01:01.380
So we talked about NetBoot and net install being the
way that you would put information or the software

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.340
onto a machine from bare metal, basically from nothing.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.920
But software update server is how you
would keep that updated over time.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:17.010
So software update server is a service in Mac OS X server,
and as we mentioned, it will proxy all those updates.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:24.650
Now like I said, you can determine when those updates get
allowed to be sent out to your users, or have, you know,

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:30.660
allow users to be able to install those, and all that
is configured through server admin, which Jason demoed.

01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:39.230
Now the way that you configure that is in managed
preferences in workgroup manager, you would configure all

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:43.010
of your machines to use a specific software
update server at a specific address.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:46.990
So that's how you would push that information out.

01:01:46.989 --> 01:01:55.019
Now Apple updates are really the only thing you
can push out through that software update server.

01:01:55.019 --> 01:02:02.730
It doesn't, it doesn't, it isn't able to also just
distribute third party software updates in that way.

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:05.710
So at this point we'll tell you a little
bit more about how Apple does updates.

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:06.929
Some of you may be familiar with it.

01:02:06.929 --> 01:02:14.369
But in general, every so often Apple
has software updates many times a year.

01:02:14.369 --> 01:02:21.299
And a lot of times those are full dot release
updates, so from ten dot four dot three

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.260
to ten dot four dot four, things like that.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:30.330
So those are called delta updates, and those install
files that are, have only changed from the last release

01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:33.900
to the current release, and they're
very, typically very small

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.860
And then what we have are called combo
updaters as well, and that will take you from,

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:43.740
let's say if the current operating system is
ten four four, that combo updater would take you

01:02:43.739 --> 01:02:46.279
from a 10.4.0 all the way to 10.4.4.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.590
So it has all the accumulated updates,
and those are combo updaters.

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:53.960
Okay, so that's how we handle software updates.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:03:02.940
And in addition to those, we also have security updates, and
every once in a while you'll see a QuickTime update as well.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:08.990
Now lastly, Apple Remote Desktop also has the ability
to be able to push out those updates if you choose not

01:03:08.989 --> 01:03:12.149
to do it with the system, software update server.

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:19.309
So literally on your network, you could monitor a
hundred machines, three hundred, five hundred machines.

01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:26.539
You simply could select those machines in a list, tell the
specific update package that you wanted to be installed

01:03:26.539 --> 01:03:32.449
on all these machines, it would get sent out over the
network, and it would be a, the installer would run locally

01:03:32.449 --> 01:03:36.379
on the machines, and that package
would be deployed and installed.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:42.619
And if needed, the operating system would tell the
user please restart the machine now if it needs to be.

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:46.609
There are also capabilities within remote
desktop to have remote desktop server running,

01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:51.240
so that if you're in a mobile environment, or you have
machines that are constantly on and off the network,

01:03:51.239 --> 01:03:56.299
when that machine comes back on the network,
the software update server, or I'm sorry,

01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.940
the Apple Remote Desktop server would notice that it didn't
have the update installed, and it would then go ahead

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.920
and send it when that machine came onto the network.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.630
So at this point we're going to have
another quick demo by Jason.

01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:11.309
>> All right.

01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:16.949
So for this next demo I'm just going to show you
some of the features of Apple Remote Desktop.

01:04:16.949 --> 01:04:21.489
Again, Apple Remote Desktop is an additional
utility beyond Mac OS X or Mac OS X server.

01:04:21.489 --> 01:04:23.519
So it's an additional purchase.

01:04:23.519 --> 01:04:27.980
But I highly recommend it for just about any
environment that you're supporting multiple Macs.

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:31.940
When you first open up remote desktop you'll notice along
the left hand side we have some information here as far

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:37.369
as computers that are on, in particular my client, a
scanner, that task server that Brian was mentioning earlier,

01:04:37.369 --> 01:04:40.500
as well as some active tasks and a task history.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.369
On this particular case I'm coming over with a scanner

01:04:42.369 --> 01:04:46.099
and I'm just going to scan my local
network, and look here, I see my server.

01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:50.099
Well to add the server to my machine,
I'm just going to drag it over here,

01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:55.730
and it's going to prompt me for my credentials on that server.

01:04:55.730 --> 01:05:00.510
I type in my credentials, and now it's going to add it to
my all computers list, and now I can see that right there

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:05.310
in this particular list, I have a
new remote desktop client to manage.

01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:08.449
Now one important thing to point out here is
when you first add a client to the machine,

01:05:08.449 --> 01:05:10.569
you'll notice that sometimes it'll
tell you it has an old version.

01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:18.610
This is because the version of remote desktop that ships
on OS X, the client portion of the application is based

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:22.620
on like two point oh or two point two,
it's based on an older version of ARD.

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:26.579
Since there's a newer version of the management application
out there, you're going to have to upgrade client software

01:05:26.579 --> 01:05:31.429
on that particular machine before it's going to be
able to be managed properly with a new ARD 3.

01:05:31.429 --> 01:05:34.969
What we're seeing right now is it's
copying the remote desktop package file,

01:05:34.969 --> 01:05:37.189
and it's going to push it over to my main server,

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:42.050
and then it's going to actually install this
particular bundle on, package file on that machine.

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:46.530
And it'll just take a minute here, and
we'll kind of let that go in the background.

01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:50.860
Something else I just want to show you with
remote desktop is that while you have it running,

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.420
a lot of great fields you can come in
here and get some more information from.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:57.210
You have a report menu, you can kind of collect
different information about the machine as far

01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:02.240
as maybe how much RAM is in it, how much,
what USB devices might be plugged in,

01:06:02.239 --> 01:06:05.449
get some information about its current status.

01:06:05.449 --> 01:06:07.409
A nice thing about this is you can even do file searching.

01:06:07.409 --> 01:06:11.759
So if you wanted to look on multiple machines for a
particular file, you can just hit that and have it go.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.830
Let's come back over here.

01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:16.500
Looks like my update's complete, so
let's do a quick little report on this.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.659
I'll pull back some information on my server, it's going to
report to me the memory that's installed inside it.

01:06:21.659 --> 01:06:25.210
So I can see here that I have the main
server, I'm going to click get report.

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:30.289
And it's going out to the server right now,
and it's collecting that information for me.

01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:33.170
Or maybe not.

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:34.240
It should.

01:06:34.239 --> 01:06:37.769
As far as this goes beyond this, there's some
other nice things you can do with remote desktop.

01:06:37.769 --> 01:06:41.840
One of the biggest features of it is the ability
to control and remotely observe machines.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.900
So if you're in like a help desk scenario or something
like that, you can use this when someone calls

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.480
in to remotely connect to their machine, and walk
through them on the phone with what they're doing.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:54.340
As I pointed out earlier, a lot of these tools have
been running from my remote administration machine,

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:59.410
so we're going to go ahead and take a look at that server, and
we'll see this other demo machine I have next to me here.

01:06:59.409 --> 01:07:01.960
And that right there is the contents of my server machine.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.119
So I can resize this window a little bit,
give myself some more room to work with.

01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:09.259
And on that particular machine I'm
now managing that server remotely.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:14.120
It's based around the VNC client, VNC protocol, which
is an open source protocol out there you can use.

01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:19.489
There's clients for it for Linux, for Windows, and
there's also servers for it for Linux and Windows.

01:07:19.489 --> 01:07:24.469
Which means that using a remote desktop
management application on your Mac,

01:07:24.469 --> 01:07:29.439
you can connect to a Windows machine or a Linux box
running VNC, and take control of it and observe it.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.000
These other features won't work because there's
something conditional to Apples rolled into it,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.230
but that basic aspect of being
able to look at another machine

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:38.159
and seeing what it's doing is still available to you.

01:07:38.159 --> 01:07:41.210
As far as some other things we can do in
here, just to quick show you a couple here.

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:44.320
We can send the remote Unix commands to the machines.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:49.070
So if I wanted to do a PS command on a particular
machine, I can type that up here, click send,

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:53.780
and that'll run that PS command and
report back to me its information.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.960
I can copy files and install packages.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.440
So if I need to deploy any particular
software over to it, I can come over here,

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.090
say I want to copy a file onto my server, let's see.

01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:06.430
I'll go to my documents folder
here, I have this admin guide file.

01:08:06.429 --> 01:08:11.639
I'm going to go ahead and add that to my list of items to
copy, and I'm going to put it on my current user's desktop.

01:08:11.639 --> 01:08:18.409
So I hit copy here, that pushes the file
over, and now if I come back over here,

01:08:18.409 --> 01:08:23.889
we can see that admin guide file
is now on the desktop on my server.

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:26.940
So a lot of great things you can do with remote desktop.

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:30.989
As Brian said, there's like a task schedule functionality
of it where you can have it run tasks if you're away

01:08:30.989 --> 01:08:34.069
from the office or you're using a laptop scenario.

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:36.359
Information to collect system reports, monitoring.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:39.829
It's a really comprehensive tool
that does a lot of different tasks

01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:43.640
that is just invaluable in a Mac environment.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.119
Brian.

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:48.279
>> Thanks Jason, back to the slides please.

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:54.599
So really to sum up.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:01.260
You know, all the platforms, they all generally need
the same kind of TLC, and they all need the same types

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.890
of upkeep and administration done to them.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:09.079
But you know, a lot of those tools are
different from one platform to another.

01:09:09.079 --> 01:09:15.949
A lot of them share a lot of similarities,
and a lot of them are different in some ways.

01:09:15.949 --> 01:09:22.789
But as I think you found that we've shown
you that a, from Windows to Linux to Mac,

01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:28.350
there's really a lot that you can take from some of the
other platforms that you've administered over the periods

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:34.930
of time, use that expertise and take that to
the Mac, and use that on some of our tools.

01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:40.520
So we hope that we've shown you a good sampling of some
of the administration tools, and given you kind of some

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.850
of the ideas that you can use in some
of the sessions later in the week.

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:48.100
I think there's a Best Practices
for Mac OS X Administration.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.610
So you can really kind of look through
that guide and say well where do I want

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:53.979
to focus my time, and what do I want to focus on, okay.

01:09:53.979 --> 01:10:00.169
So I hope you enjoyed the presentation, and we've got some
time left, about five minutes left for slide, for questions.
