WEBVTT

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.130
>> We really appreciate the travel
time you took to come here.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.550
The energy the student community brings to the
Developer's Conference is always reflected back

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.530
to the engineering community and the other
attendees as a really positive experience.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:34.240
And we want to give you some sign posts and
guidance today to help you maximize that energy

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.450
and to help you take the best advantage of
the Developer's Conference for this year.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.750
The first thing I'm going to start off with is just
talking about what the point of your being here is.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.869
It's not just a week of fun.

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:52.049
It's a week of your future for most of you in the room.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:59.099
It's an opportunity for you to interact with
professional software developers both from Apple

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.090
and from a great many third parties from information
technology organizations and from large universities.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.799
Take advantage of that time.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.640
This is probably one of the few times in your career where
you'll have the opportunity to interact with people

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.650
from skill levels from super guru to beginner.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.969
And get in their heads, but don't get in their way.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.409
There's a lot of conversation going on in the hallways.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.799
Participate by standing around and listening.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.090
If you're invited in, join in.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.210
But do a lot of listening.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:42.829
Pay attention to what your fellow programmers, who may have
a lot more years under their belts, are paying attention to

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.659
and are talking about, because that's going to
guide you on what's important for your career.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.969
And a lot of what this is is basic hallway hygiene.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.730
The other thing to think about is what you want to do.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.130
We have three real important clientele
in this building this year.

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:11.769
We have the information technology folks, two tracks, two
rooms full of information technology subjects all week long.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.420
We have the traditional API developers doing
Cocoa, doing Carbon, doing UNIX programming.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.009
Do you fit into that community?

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.780
And then third is content and media.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.300
This morning one of the things that I hope that you take
away from the keynote and what you have an advantage

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.330
over someone, like me quite frankly, is Web 2.0 and Ajax.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.550
That's the way to develop an application for the iPhone.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.660
It's a way to develop an application
for Safari on Mac and on Windows.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.189
Go to those sessions, dive into that and
show us the way to be creative with that.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.840
Some of us have been around too long
to have new ideas in those spaces.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.770
So take advantage of your fresh viewpoint in there
and get some ideas that are going to surprise all of us.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:11.540
And finally, this is your chance to look eye to eye with a
software developer at our developer bash on Thursday night,

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:16.629
or at lunch, or in the evenings and
say, tell me what it's really like.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:25.419
I may have spent all this time in high school,
in college, in post doc or post graduate studies,

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.509
learning how to do something called software.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:37.699
But what is it really like when eight to 16 hours
a day, five to seven days a week, you're writing

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.149
and debugging code, code that's not yours?

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.270
Code that may be going into a database application
that powers American Airlines' reservation system?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:58.219
Or it may be something as compelling as a game, but
you're only doing the file system portion of it.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:04.569
Learn from people here how they survive those times
of it's not really creative, it's not really fun,

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.120
it's a grind of being a programmer day to day.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.310
You'll find from a lot of them that it's not a grind.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.830
It's still a lot of fun.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.750
But the transition from being in the academic
side of learning how to become a programmer,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.670
to actually being a coder, watch the labs, watch people
in the hallways, and if you have the opportunity,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:32.390
talk to people about their experiences and what saved
their sanity in their progress to being master programmers.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.669
That's your opportunity this week.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.629
Many people don't get that opportunity as they
transition from school to the professional community.

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.490
Take advantage of it.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.509
Now I'd like to bring up Michael to give
you some more perspectives on the week.

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.079
( Applause )

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:53.399
>> Michael: Thanks, CK.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:58.339
So CK is actually my boss's boss, so I
have to watch what I say when I'm up here.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:00.829
Excellent that'll make it a lot easier.

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:01.620
All right.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.490
So my name's Michael Jurewitz.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.329
I work as a developer technical support
engineer, so I work in CK's organization.

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:13.979
My job is to work with 3rd party developers like
yourselves, like those who are premiere and select members,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.230
and I answer code level questions
that come into our frameworks.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.800
I focus primarily on Core Data, Cocoa, and bindings.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.329
So if you see me throughout the
week, feel free to ask me a question.

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:28.029
So first and foremost, welcome
to everyone of you who are here.

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:32.969
This is a really exciting WWDC for all
of us, especially for the students.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.590
We have over 450 of you from oPver 30 countries.

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:42.500
It's actually the biggest WWDC we've ever had and
the biggest student contingent we've ever had.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.040
So we're actually really excited about this.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.780
And the most important part is that all of this
happening at this conference, the sessions, the labs,

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:57.029
the conversations happening in the halls, they're all
for you guys, and that's the really important part.

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.149
So make sure that you know that, and make sure that
if you see people in the labs, don't be afraid.

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:02.039
Go in there.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.850
Ask questions.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.730
Because this week we're here to educate
you, we're here to answer your questions,

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.520
and we're here to show you our
cool stuff in the form of Leopard

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:13.069
and various other things we have happening during the week.

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.110
And really remember, we're human.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.360
We're engineers at Apple, but a year ago, I
was a student like yourself just graduating

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.610
from college and here I am working here now.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.259
And we're always eager to answer your questions.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.629
For a lot of engineers throughout the week, this is
the high point of being able to deal with everyone

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.569
and seeing the people who are actually
using the technologies

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.129
and those who are really excited
about the things that are being done.

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:37.000
So don't be bashful, get in there an ask questions.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.560
Really dive deep with this.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.259
So this is a really exciting time for us to work at Apple.

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.399
Apple's one of the top 10 most valued brands.

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:55.049
We have over 100 million iPods we've sold, stock's at an all
time high, and we have over 500,000 developers registered

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.050
with the ADC, all of which you guys are a part of.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:06.050
And the real key with this is that you
guys are the future of the platform.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.360
There are awesome applications coming out these days written
by people just like you, who really understand what it is

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.759
to be a Macintosh programmer, understanding
the user interaction side of things.

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:24.620
Whether that's Checkout, Coda, Delicious Library, or any one
of the really awesome new applications that are coming out,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.800
the real focus is on the user and we're counting on
you guys to really help drive us forward as a platform.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.310
So now to do that, we have tons happening this week.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.750
We've got six tracks, whether you're
looking for the Mac OS X essentials.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.040
So most of the foundational technologies,
Leopard innovation, a lot of the new things

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.500
that are happening this week, or even information
technology or content and media, if you're really interested

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.120
in delivering content to things
like the iPhone, for instance.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.019
We also have some really awesome
extracurricular fun for all you guys.

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:58.659
The design awards are happening this evening.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.840
You get a chance to honor our best developer who have
really done exceptional work throughout the year.

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:09.699
It's a good chance, too, as students, to see some of that
work and understand how you can build on that in the future.

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:12.269
After that, we've also got Stump the Experts happening.

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.439
It's a great chance to battle wits
with some people who have been at Apple

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:18.920
for probably longer than they'd be willing to admit.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.199
And later in the week, we've got Matt
Neuburg who's going to be coming

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.709
in doing a session called Packets of Pure Power.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:30.430
So that one sounds kind of interesting, I'm
going to have to see what's going on with that.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:37.320
There's also the bash also happening up here on the campus,
or up here at Mascone, across the street at Yerba Buena.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:43.320
We've actually taken the campus bash
from Cupertino, brought it up here,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.410
made it so that you guys don't have
to hop on busses and deal with that.

00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:49.549
It's going to be a great time, so we're
looking forward to having you there.

00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:53.870
So one of the real problems, or I guess
one of the real awesome things, actually,

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.580
about WWDC is there are tons of sessions to go to.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.460
If you look in your packet, how
do you possibly decide which ones?

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.050
I always find myself asking that exact question.

00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:05.949
Which sessions should I go to?

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:11.910
so I've prepared a small list here of highlights
that if there are a few sessions you go to this week,

00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:16.089
you're going to want to try to pick up, especially as students,
but really even if you're just new to the platform,

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:20.300
or even if you've been coding for a long
time, these are really foundational sessions.

00:09:20.299 --> 00:09:24.250
So Tuesday morning we've got Coding
Smarter with Objective C2.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.629
I'm actually presenting in that,
so come see it, please, please.

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:34.029
We also have later on Building Animated Cocoa User
Interfaces and Adding Core Animation to Your Application.

00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:40.299
One of the major new technologies in Leopard is
Core Animation, and it is incredible what you can do

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:43.069
with the user experience when you take advantage of that.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.930
These are going to be excellent sessions focusing just on that.

00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:48.429
I highly recommend that you come in.

00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:51.529
So Wednesday, Cocoa drawing techniques.

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:54.429
Again, we look at the quality of user experience.

00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:58.309
It's all about being able to really present
a UI that they user feels comfortable

00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:00.579
in and that facilitates their experience.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.990
So this will be an excellent session,
make sure you come to it.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.180
Thursday, we have Leopard User Interface Design.

00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:12.929
So John Geleynse who will actually be talking later
on in this session will be doing that one on Thursday.

00:10:12.929 --> 00:10:16.599
It's always a great way to understand how
you should be structuring your applications,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.909
again, from a user experience standpoint.

00:10:19.909 --> 00:10:21.879
So we're looking forward to seeing you there as well.

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:28.039
And this one's a pretty interesting one, and it's probably
not something that as a student you'd run into very much,

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:30.819
so Friday we have Code Hardening Techniques.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.860
Obviously security is a big issue these days with code,
so we're going to be diving into this on Friday and looking

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.460
at ways that you can write more
secure code and help to make sure

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:46.610
that you're awesome application isn't going to be the
victim of all the not so good things that can happen.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.289
So staying sane this week, there's a ton going on.

00:10:50.289 --> 00:10:51.789
Is it really possible to stay sane?

00:10:51.789 --> 00:10:53.209
That's the real question.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:59.680
Well, you can try hydrating or eating bananas,
but really you just want to jump right in.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:05.929
This is a great week for all of you guys to be here to
soak up everything that's happening here at the conference.

00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:12.509
And you want to make sure that you go to sessions, between
those sessions grab some snacks, go to more sessions,

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:15.129
after that, grab some Odawalla juice, it's delicious.

00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:17.320
After that, go to more sessions.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.020
You're here really to just soak everything up.

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:21.689
And make sure you go to labs, too.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:27.230
Again, I'm going to keep on pounding that in because
this is really your time to spend with Apple engineers

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.840
and to ask them questions, and as CK said, to
listen and to find out what other people are asking

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.200
who have had more experience on the platform as well.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:40.270
So look for people who have got these blue shirts
there in the lab and come up to us, don't be bashful.

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:43.909
So a lot of this is really geared around you.

00:11:43.909 --> 00:11:48.110
And the whole idea is that we really
need you guys as developers.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.730
You guys are the future of our platform.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:56.450
So this year was really unique because we were
able to provide you with seed access to Leopard.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:01.910
I don't think ever, in our history, that we were
able to provide seeds to students ahead of time

00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:05.370
from the conference simply because
they received a scholarship

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:10.409
So this is really something new and we're really excited
about that because you guys have had a chance already

00:12:10.409 --> 00:12:15.009
to be building applications, to be
building around with the new technologies.

00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:23.379
So the big thing is that we're counting on
your guys to find things that don't work,

00:12:23.379 --> 00:12:26.909
to find things you don't like and to let us know about it.

00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:31.879
We've got a few months here to go until Leopard's
going to be shipping in October and we need to make sure

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:35.439
that this is going to be the most solid OS release in history.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.020
You guys are going to be a big part of
that by helping us in filing bugs.

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:42.669
So please, do that for us.

00:12:42.669 --> 00:12:44.379
Sometimes it can be a little bit of a cool process.

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:49.330
Sometimes you'll get a bug that comes back to you
and you lose site of what's actually happening

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:55.170
with the original issue, but the high point of that is
that we know about the issue and that's the important part.

00:12:55.169 --> 00:12:56.759
So help us out as developers.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:01.419
Pound on Leopard, do your development even if there's
UI things you don't like, let us know about it.

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:03.799
We really do want to know.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:08.699
And remember, again, this week is all about you guys.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.440
So there's probably three different
kinds of you out there in the audience.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.070
People who are interested in standards,
standards compliant, UNIX type development,

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:22.000
people who are hardcore Cocoa developers, and people
who are more interested in cross platform development,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.029
so whether you're in SciTech or just focused more on Java.

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:30.100
Or perhaps, more realistically,
you guys are a mix of all three.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.930
So what do we have happening this week to cater to that?

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:37.519
Well I guess for open standards in UNIX, why
would you be interested in the first place?

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:41.120
So obviously it's a solid foundation for the future.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.389
So you've got a wealth of projects to work on.

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:45.819
The open source community's huge.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.570
It's vibrant.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:52.370
And the skills that you learn there you're going to be
able to apply in almost any job that you have anywhere.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.060
And sometimes it can be rather lucrative.

00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:57.979
If you're someone who's been involved with
rail development, you'd know that for sure.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:04.750
So sessions happening later in the week that you might be
interested in, if that's where you find your interest lying,

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:11.179
so we've got Getting Started with OS X, Mac OS X Kernel
Programming, again, the Fundamentals of Kernel Debugging,

00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:17.709
the Inside the Mac OS X Boot Process,
and Developing for Unix on Mac OS X. All

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.950
of these are really solid session I recommend.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.230
If this is where your interest
is, definitely check those out.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.750
So for Cocoa, obviously it's the future of our platform

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:32.279
and we're seeing tremendous growth here,
a continued need for skilled developers.

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:38.159
If you're on any of the Cocoa lists, whether the
student lists or even just the regular Cocoa dev lists,

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:43.199
you'll notice that people looking for Cocoa
programmers has increased substantially.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.850
It really is necessary for the vibrancy of our
platform that people like you learn these technologies,

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:55.060
apply them and that you're there to
provide quality software for our end users.

00:14:55.059 --> 00:15:01.169
So session you might want to check out, again, Coding
Smarter with Objective C2, be there, Cocoa Today,

00:15:01.169 --> 00:15:06.509
it's a great session, Getting Started with
Cocoa Bindings, again, Cocoa Drawing Techniques,

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:09.620
and Developing Cocoa Applications with Python and Ruby.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.320
This is a new one.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.430
It's pretty different.

00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:17.429
We've actually delivered on some very interesting
technologies in Leopard in the form of the scripting bridge.

00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:18.379
So come check that out.

00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:26.679
This actually allows you to write native applications,
native Cocoa applications, in Python or Ruby calling

00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:28.709
through directly to the objective C APIs.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:29.800
It's really rather cool.

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:31.879
I recommend you come out to it.

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:35.419
If you're interested in cross platform
development, well, obviously,

00:15:35.419 --> 00:15:37.599
there are lots of large companies that need your expertise.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.529
Whether you're talking bout Microsoft, Adobe, Mathematica,
any of these big houses that have been doing development

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:49.389
for quite some time or that have products they want to
be able to span the gap between both platforms.

00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:54.179
And it's really important that they have new
blood for new perspectives on development.

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:58.399
You guys are the people who are going to provide
that for them and they want your talent.

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:03.949
There's also, obviously, a wealth
of projects for you to work on.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.879
Again, these are pretty similar to the Cocoa slides.

00:16:06.879 --> 00:16:14.049
I've also put in a Quartz session, Creating Leading Edge
2D graphics with Quartz and the main focus with that is

00:16:14.049 --> 00:16:19.319
that you really are going to still need the same foundations
as a cross platform development in Cocoa developments,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.210
that you understand the issues on both sides.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:28.970
Additionally, knowing things about our graphic subsystems,
like Quartz, will really help you in those endeavors.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:36.410
So after the conference, what can you guys to for yourselves
to really make sure that you've gotten the most out of this?

00:16:36.409 --> 00:16:40.669
Well, the first thing is to continue
to use the coding headstarts.

00:16:40.669 --> 00:16:43.769
This is the first year that we actually
delivered on these coding headstarts.

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:46.329
They're really a unique concept if you've done some of them.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.210
You might have seen me in the video for the Objective-C
2 session that you should see tomorrow morning.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:56.680
So these have been great because they're actually in
the form of Apple sample code that we've walked you

00:16:56.679 --> 00:17:02.989
through the steps of creating a brand new project and
exploring the technologies that we've brought to bear.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:08.529
So now the really neat thing is that you can
take this code and extend it in any way you want,

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:12.210
turn it into your own project and ship an app with it.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.890
Apple sample code let's you do that.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.020
It's there for you to use as you see fit.

00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:18.549
And that's really the point.

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:20.259
Build an application.

00:17:20.259 --> 00:17:26.819
Whether you just want to do it for fun, or whether you
want to do it to be able to show off to an employer.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.470
But employers especially want to see this.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.650
They want to see that you know
what App development really is.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:38.920
That you know what it is to usher an app through that
creative process, to push it out in the mainstream,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:44.690
and then get feedback, make changes, understand
what it is to deal with users at that end.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:50.640
It's going to go a huge way to you when you sit down in an
interview to say, yeah, I've written an app, here it is,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.440
it's awesome, and be able to show that off to them.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.680
And most importantly have fun.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.549
Because this is what this is all about.

00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:59.029
It's going to be a great week.

00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:00.470
It's going to be a tiring week

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.390
But soak it all up and enjoy every bit of it.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:10.950
And now I'd like to introduce Kyle McNealy, he's
the marketing manager for the campus rep program.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.950
I've had a chance to work with Kyle for
about a year and a half now I think.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:19.240
I was the campus rep at northwestern
before I came here to work for Apple.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.509
So yeah, Kyle.

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:27.039
( Applause )

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:32.019
>> Kyle: So I have to admit, a lot of that stuff went kinda
over my head because I'm in the marketing realm of things,

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:39.359
but I, myself just graduated about a year ago from college
and came out to San Francisco, moved out here without a job.

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:44.109
I had saved up some money during school
and applied to a lot of different places.

00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:47.879
I ended up finding a contract job
within the developer relations group,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.700
continued interviewing and finally
got this job in education.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.819
So kinda the moral of that story is if you really want it
and you want to find where you want to go once you graduate,

00:18:57.819 --> 00:19:01.679
spend a lot of time, spend the energy,
go out there and just try it out.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.259
You know, kinda just dive in like Michael said.

00:19:04.259 --> 00:19:09.259
So on behalf of education group, welcome to WWDC.

00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:12.849
Show of hands, how many of you is this your first WWDC?

00:19:12.849 --> 00:19:15.389
We've got a bunch of you out there.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.790
Okay. How many of you have been to San Francisco before?

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:21.129
Hands up. Great city.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.810
Fun town. What I want to talk to you
specifically about is the campus rep program.

00:19:25.809 --> 00:19:30.409
So the campus rep program has hundreds
of campus reps all across the country.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.110
And what their core goal, what their job
is, is a sales marketing function on campus.

00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:40.809
So they're supposed to make Apple very visible
among student groups, amongst Greek life,

00:19:40.809 --> 00:19:43.759
amongst student government, all those sorts of things.

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:47.259
And I think we actually have a few campus reps out here.

00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:50.990
Raise your hand or stand up if you're campus reps.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.750
Cool. So if you guys have questions about
campus rep programs later in the week,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.650
ask these guys right here, they're
a great source of information.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.320
Each person kinda approaches the job a little differently.

00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:09.939
We've got some core tools that you can use to help
evangelize the brand on campus, but we also allow for you

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:16.930
to kinda brace or grab hold of your passions, the things
you're really interested in and you want to kinda pursue.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.990
So we have a diverse group of people.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.579
And one way we take advantage of this
is help each other, share those ideas.

00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:27.099
So we do a pod cast on a monthly
basis, a couple times a month.

00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:33.480
And I want to share you a quick little video on that pod
cast, kinda show you what some of the campus reps are doing,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.509
who they are, where they're at, that sort of thing.

00:20:36.509 --> 00:21:22.720
( Video playing. )

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.579
>> Kyle: So we've got all sorts of different
people doing all sorts of different things.

00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:30.939
I know Michael was able to weave in kind
of his development passion into his job.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:36.700
He was able to team up with people running events because he
could help them with databases of running a dance marathon,

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:43.440
or any kind of student activity he was able to give
his services, let his skills, the Apple technology

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.370
and solutions kinda be the hero, enhance that event.

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:48.839
So there's opportunities for those sorts of things as well.

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:54.619
Kind of the main focus we'd like to have
with campus reps is to build relationships.

00:21:54.619 --> 00:21:58.419
So build relationships with the
student groups, with faculty and staff,

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.150
because it's all about those connections you're able to
build and then leverage later on when you try to get a job,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.720
which we all will have to do at some point, sadly.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.710
Additionally, a large portion of the
job is something we call table tops.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:17.600
So you will set up a table on campus and
demo the latest Apple products and solutions.

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:22.839
Some things campus reps do are have Photo Booth
open so that people come up take a quick picture

00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:24.699
and then they can upload it to Face Book.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:31.250
It just gets more people's hands on a Mac and
exposed to our platform, which we want, right?

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.490
Also, we do some kind of bigger events.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:40.579
So we had a campus rep for the Tiger release get a baby
Tiger from the local zoo, and I've kinda thrown a challenge

00:22:40.579 --> 00:22:45.579
out there for all of our campus reps across the country,
if anyone can get a Leopard for the Leopard release.

00:22:45.579 --> 00:22:48.859
Big Prize will be involved.

00:22:48.859 --> 00:22:52.119
We also have a lot of campus reps
that are really creative in nature.

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:54.979
They're photography majors or they're into design.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.250
So we help them pursue those passions as well.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:06.799
We had a campus rep up in Michigan who put on a multimedia
art exhibit, so he was able to get 20 - 24 inch iMa cs

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:12.149
and instead of having art up on the wall
on a piece of canvas, it was on the iMacs.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.970
So they submitted either a picture or
multimedia piece and they were able

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.710
to throw an art exhibit over this sort of thing.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.420
So really cool stuff.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.550
His idea and then we just helped him execute it.

00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:27.500
We also do corporate type events
and marketing with our campus reps.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:33.140
This was with our partner Nike at the
University of Washington, Huskies Stadium.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:39.290
It was a relay for life event and what we were doing is we
brought a Nike Plus iPod Van so people as they were walking,

00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:44.500
24 hours straight, could record how far
they've gone, what their current pace is

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.670
so that they could better understand the Nike Plus solution.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.070
So we also do those type of corporate events.

00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:52.629
Get more hands on a Mac.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.930
That sort of thing.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.960
And my next slide.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.519
If you're interested in this, if this sounds
interesting, something that you might be able to weave

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:06.829
into your current activities on campus,
please go to the campus rep website.

00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:10.919
You can see a couple of profiles of current
campus reps, what they like about the job.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.289
Also in the body of that page you
can see what the core duties are.

00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:20.009
The URL for that is Apple.com slash
education slash campus reps.

00:24:20.009 --> 00:24:27.509
Or find one of the campus reps that stood up throughout the
week and chat with them about information about the job.

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:28.529
So that's all I got.

00:24:28.529 --> 00:24:37.730
I want to introduce John Geleynse, the
manager of Software Technology Evangelism.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.509
Thank you.

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:44.049
( Applause )

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:44.250
>> John: Thank you.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.619
Well, welcome.

00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:51.429
What evangelism does is that we are the team that
works very closely with third party developers

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:57.480
and gives them the technical guidance that they need to
build really awesome products in Mac OS X. So I have a team

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:03.660
of six people, including myself, and we all specialize
in a variety of technologies on Mac OS X. And we meet

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.640
with hundreds of companies over the course of any given
year and we sit down with those companies and we walk

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.520
through their code, we look at their UI, we look
at all different aspects of what they've done

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:17.920
and we help them understand how to take those
things that they've done and make them even better.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.240
So it's a great job.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.620
And what I want to share with you is based on my experience
working with these companies, this number of companies

00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:29.339
for the last seven and a half years that I've been at Apple.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.450
There's a great quote that I want to start off with.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.779
EB White, he's the author of Charlotte's
Web, you know the story, the children's book.

00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:42.940
The quote is this, I wake up every morning determined
both to change the world and have one hell of a good time.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.320
Sometimes this makes planning the day a little difficult.

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:53.669
And you know, our desire for you is that that's kinda
the quote for you, is that you wake up as a student

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:59.400
with some great ideas and you want to change the world and,
of course, you want to have a good time in the process.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.570
You're trying to make connections for your
life, you're trying to establish relationships,

00:26:02.569 --> 00:26:07.259
all these kinds of things, and so of course there's the
desire not to just study, you want to have a good time.

00:26:07.259 --> 00:26:10.690
And sometimes, I'm sure, that makes
your lives a little difficult.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.539
But it's definitely a great goal.

00:26:12.539 --> 00:26:16.819
And I want to talk through some of the things
that you can do to achieve those goals.

00:26:16.819 --> 00:26:18.879
And here's the recipe.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.460
You know, if you're going to change the world you need

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.660
to first look at where the opportunity
is that you can maybe get connected with.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.769
The next is you need to learn from
others and be a great citizen.

00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:36.930
And I'll talk about what that means from my
perspective as kind of an old guy compared to you guys.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:43.730
Next, there is some core ingredients on Mac OS X
if you're going to build products for this platform.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.250
And we'll walk through those.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:51.099
And then lastly, I want to help you understand sorta what it
means to focus on the important and give you that guidance,

00:26:51.099 --> 00:26:57.519
that you should focus on the important because it's easy
to get distracted by stuff in this day and age with lots

00:26:57.519 --> 00:26:59.990
of stuff going on and lots of stuff
putting demands on your time.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.880
And then we'll just talk about how to
imagine and then we'll talk about how to do.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.020
So that's kind of the course outline.

00:27:06.019 --> 00:27:08.920
So let's talk about where the opportunity is.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.200
Of course, you're here at WWDC so you get it.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.180
You understand what's going on at Apple.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.160
Apple is on fire.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.720
I mean there's so much going on with this company now,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.460
it's definitely the right place to
be in terms of building products.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.230
If we talk about iPod, we've had
100 million iPods shipped to date.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.610
That's our last public figure.

00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:28.889
Phenomenal growth in that platform, right?

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.500
And you guys know, probably more than anybody,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:37.150
what the impact has had amongst your
peers and on your campuses and such.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:43.320
And just in the last year, the last fiscal year, which
is two quarters ago now, 36 million iPods in one year.

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:45.849
So phenomenal numbers, right?

00:27:45.849 --> 00:27:52.449
Well, there are some development opportunities
for you in terms of that ecosystem.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:28:01.170
You can, whatever you're doing with audio - video pod
casts, or with just audio files of all different types,

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:07.029
those audio files and those video files can
play on the iPod, so don't forget that fact.

00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:12.569
If you're building applications or if you're doing something
with a web solution, and the web solution creates some sort

00:28:12.569 --> 00:28:18.059
of content or archives it or does something with it,
make sure that there's a gateway for that content to move

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:22.250
to the iPod because that's a natural
next step for that content.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:31.210
Think about the opportunity for communicating
information to audiences about things that you know about.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:36.250
So perhaps there's an opportunity for
you on campus to make an audio pod cast

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.930
or video pod cast about what's happening on your campus.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.840
How to move around the campus.

00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:42.669
How to find things.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.470
Maybe it's an orientation for new
students that you put together.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:50.190
And again, whatever you do, that gets iPods
into people's hands, and it's a good thing.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.769
And it helps you establish yourself amongst your
peers and with potentially future employers.

00:28:55.769 --> 00:29:01.269
It helps you establish yourself with them and
show them that you've done something significant

00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:05.180
and you've created something that's
valuable to a huge segment of the populate.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:13.320
So here's some examples of the Museum of Modern
Art's and then another tour of some stuff.

00:29:13.319 --> 00:29:18.519
So these audio video pod casts are a great
way to get stuff out there to the world.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.600
Another way to sort of guide people,
and again, it's a sort of connection

00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:26.219
with the iPod, is through the notes functionality.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.610
So there's an API, or a document which you can get,

00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:32.689
which is that iPod notes reader guide dot
PDF, look for that on the developer website.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:38.920
It tells you how to build notes, documents, that can be put
onto the iPod and then people can just scroll through notes

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.890
and read information about whatever
you want to communicate with them.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:48.230
So it's a real simple way to get content that maybe you
have exposure to, depending on potentially your discipline

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:54.670
of study or something else that you know about, and get
it into the hands of another, wider, bigger audience.

00:29:55.869 --> 00:30:02.289
Again, another development opportunity for you on
iPod is the fact that every iPod can show context,

00:30:02.289 --> 00:30:08.039
it's a reader for context so any thing that's on a v
text format can move to the iPod so if you do something

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:14.289
and since the web design, web solution design or an
application your thinking about and it manages contacts.

00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:17.190
Of course you should enter it with address
book which I'll talk about in a few moments,

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.840
but equally that, those contacts can move down to an iPod.

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:25.039
So always make sure that you've enabled that
sort of on ramp to the iPod for that content.

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:31.649
Same thing with events and calendar activities
a v cal format moves to the iPod and,

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.630
and so the iPhone being the best iPod we've ever made

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.720
of course the opportunity exists for
the iPhone for all of this as well.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:44.559
So don't lose sight of the fact that at Apple there's a
phenomenal opportunity for you to actually develop content

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:51.579
or enable content to the iPod or the iPhone in these terms.

00:30:51.579 --> 00:30:56.789
And lastly in terms of the really healthy
iPod ego system if you're a hardware person,

00:30:56.789 --> 00:31:02.089
I know a few of you are hardware designers or you
know your studying that electrical engineering.

00:31:02.089 --> 00:31:04.709
If your in that space and your thinking
about building something really cool

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:10.610
for the iPod there is a really healthy ego system of
accessories for the iPod and if you've got a good idea

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:15.529
or you've built something send an email to me for iPod at
Apple dot com, because they're the folks that want to know

00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:19.119
about it and they'll help you get that out to the world.

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:25.259
So that was iPod, but of course there's
incredible growth in the Mac side.

00:31:25.259 --> 00:31:31.759
Mac OS X. Corporately we've got sort of a fifty
fifty between music and the Mac right now in terms

00:31:31.759 --> 00:31:39.569
of revenues gross quarter over quarter, year over
year, has been phenomenal on the Mac side we continued

00:31:39.569 --> 00:31:43.039
to increase the number of units that
we're moving on a quarterly basis.

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:45.259
And so in the last couple of quarters we're moving close

00:31:45.259 --> 00:31:50.519
to one point five million Mac's are
going out the door every quarter.

00:31:50.519 --> 00:31:54.750
That's incredible numbers that's a
lot of people who might have interest

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:58.180
in running a solution that your going to write.

00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:06.129
M00:31:56 (silence) M00:32:01 So understand the opportunity,
the opportunity is significant it's phenomenal on Mac OS X

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.650
and in the Apple ego system with Mac OS X and iPod.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.750
Second thing you can do to.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:19.019
To be sort of successful or get the most at WWC
and out of life I guess is to learn from others.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.250
(silence) Excuse me.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:29.369
Inside of Apple there's this really great
sort of dynamic going on and the dynamic is

00:32:29.369 --> 00:32:35.079
such that we build these OS technologies, the Mac
OS X engineering team built stuff in the OS,

00:32:35.079 --> 00:32:41.500
you know pick an API that your familiar with and
will build something in you know that's pretty cool

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.259
and then it gets out there in the next OS
release and third part developers start looking

00:32:46.259 --> 00:32:51.960
at that thinking hum I can do something interesting
with that and they start building on top of that.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.880
And then equally internally we build, rewrite
applications that are built on these technologies.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.310
And so the apps division internally will leverage
these technologies to do something cool and then,

00:33:01.309 --> 00:33:05.519
and then they release the products and then the
OS team looks at what the apps division has done

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:10.329
and says ah wait a second that's an interesting
use of this technology we made previously.

00:33:10.329 --> 00:33:12.699
And they're sort of pushing the limits of it.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:20.240
We can extend it, we could add more capabilities or
equally they'll see the applications group do something

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.740
that isn't built into the OS yet and
they'll take that from the apps team

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.599
and they'll you know sort of reinvent it inside of the OS.

00:33:26.599 --> 00:33:33.799
So there's this great cycle of innovation going on where
everybody is kind of being motivated by the other teams.

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:36.669
And so it's this great, great cycle occurring internally.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:42.310
And that's true in terms of the third
party developer community as well.

00:33:42.309 --> 00:33:48.460
I work with hundreds of companies every year and
its amazing to me how when Apple does something

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:55.340
with an OS release we enable all kinds of new solutions and
capabilities and third party developers are inspired by that

00:33:55.339 --> 00:34:00.009
and they'll see something in the OS and they'll
go oh I can do something with that as well,

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:03.619
I got another idea of leveraging that
same type of technology or what have you.

00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:09.969
And I would encourage you to try to be you know, my
commentary to you for WWDC is do everything you can to stand

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:15.589
in the hallways and listen and try to
catch the vision, try to be inspired.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:20.920
Hang out with people that you think have great ideas and
be inspired by them and hang out with Apple engineers

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:26.159
and run your ideas by them and see if they've
got some cleaver ways of modifying that idea

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.230
so that it really blooms and becomes something great.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:32.860
Be inspired take the opportunity to be inspired by others.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.159
In Mac OS X there's a ton of technologies today
right, if we've got Spotlight, you've seen all of this,

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.339
Dashboard you've seen what's possible
with widgets on Mac OS X.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:49.710
Sync services are really powerful syncing engine
built into Mac OS X that's available to you today.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.090
So that you don't have to write it yourself.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:58.210
We've got Web Kit, which drives, you know it's the
underpinnings of safari and is an HTML renderer

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.920
and a JavaScript debugger and all this functionality
is there ready for you to use.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.800
We have an incredible graphics stack upon

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:11.170
which you can build some fantastic games some
incredible science you know data visualization,

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.539
applications and much more.

00:35:13.539 --> 00:35:18.880
And whole bunch of other stuff and this is just you
know a one screen of dozens I'm sure I can show you

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.180
with technology icons on them, but iChat,
instant messaging and iPhoto integration ,

00:35:23.179 --> 00:35:28.049
iSight camera API so that you can get
things off the camera through image kit

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.430
and you don't have to worry about the details.

00:35:29.429 --> 00:35:34.649
There's a lot of technology built into
Mac OS X that is enabling for people,

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.900
is helping people do some really cool stuff,

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:42.079
because the people doing the cool stuff don't
have to worry about these underpinnings.

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:45.549
They're taking advantage of all the cool
pieces that are already there

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.560
and they're building something great on top.

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:50.230
They're putting there value add on.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.369
We do that, we build a lot of really cool
aps that ship with the operating system,

00:35:55.369 --> 00:36:00.139
but also are sold through are retailed channels
and you know these applications are built

00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:05.339
on these really cool technologies in Mac OS X,
but for you guys its important to understand

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:10.720
that its not just Apple that's using Apple technologies
the third party community is doing some amazing things,

00:36:10.719 --> 00:36:12.109
including students.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.539
Know let me give you some examples.

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.989
Know not all these are student applications
the ones towards the end of the sequence are,

00:36:17.989 --> 00:36:22.949
but third parties are defiantly doing some rally cool
stuff with Mac OS X with these enabling technologies.

00:36:22.949 --> 00:36:25.099
Here's a product that won an Apple design award last year.

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:27.909
It's from a company here in the
bay area called Luxology.

00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:36.589
The application is called modo, it's a volumetric enabling
tool that has sort of mesh, you'd lay a mesh over a model

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:42.300
and then you could manage individual portions of this
mesh to get real fine grain control in what your doing.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:53.410
Super high end modeling application and it toke one person
you know not a lot time to move this over to Mac OS X.

00:36:53.409 --> 00:36:57.469
Incredibly power in this application
and its doing what it doers

00:36:57.469 --> 00:37:01.869
because it takes full advantage of
OpenGL in Mac OS X that

00:37:01.869 --> 00:37:04.059
OPenGL stack, it takes advantage
of Quartz and Quartz Extreme.

00:37:04.059 --> 00:37:07.119
And does some really cool stuff
on Mac OS X and Mac OS X only.

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:09.759
Now it's available for windows,
but it has better performance

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.630
in Mac OS X cause they're leveraging native technologies.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:19.340
You know what do you have, what are some of the ideas
that you've got that need powerful graphics capabilities.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:23.340
So those capabilities are built into Mac OS
ten now really the only challenge for you is,

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:28.240
okay how do you over lay your idea
on top of what's in Mac OS X.

00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:33.089
Another application DataTank written
by one guy entirely in Cocoa.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.250
it's a mathematical analysis tool.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:41.809
You basically inter math functions, complex
mathematical formulas and you can solve

00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:48.409
for you know these crazy equations that I would
have failed at a school if I even looked at,

00:37:48.409 --> 00:37:55.789
but this developer is really sort of changing this market
segment of math software because of this application

00:37:55.789 --> 00:38:01.039
which takes advantage of all the graphic technology
in Mac OS X and leverages spotlight for example,

00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:07.730
so each of your documents can contain multiple formulas and
results and everything and you can just spotlight on any

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.110
of the variables in a formula or an equation.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:16.500
You can spotlight on some of the key results, you can
create QuickTime VR models so that you can rotate around

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.599
or flip around all of your three d models.

00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:23.239
Really amazing software written by one person.

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:28.439
that's the power of Cocoa that's the
power of all of these technologies.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:35.200
ToySight Apple designer award winner from a couple years
ago is a product that was totally, really innovative

00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:41.730
on the platform in its day came from a company
called Free Verse, written by two guys on Mac OS X,

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.400
toke advantage of the graphics technologies on Mac OS X.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.090
integration with the iSight camera in a
way that nobody had up until that point.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:54.550
So basically in front of your machine users can sort
of, users can stand in front of there iMac at the time,

00:38:54.550 --> 00:39:00.430
or now you know any machine with a built in iSight and you
control the game because of some cool algorithms they built

00:39:00.429 --> 00:39:06.359
into the software were the cameras watching you and
you know sort of normalizing with the back round

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.430
and your controlling the game in different ways you play.

00:39:09.429 --> 00:39:13.500
It's kind of like a Wii a little bit in the
sense that your gestures control the game.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:20.460
Great idea really innovated and only possible in Mac OS
ten with that few number of programmers and few lines

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:27.349
of code, because of what's built in Mac OS X.

00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:31.039
Osirix. Another winner
in the Apple designer awards.

00:39:31.039 --> 00:39:40.610
A couple of years ago these guys came out with Osirix,
it's a volumetric imaging tool for medical research

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:45.170
so it takes results of a CT scan
and builds a three d model from this

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:50.680
and in real time your rotating these models around,
but these guys jumped around on top of all kinds

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:56.210
of Mac OS X technologies so that you could
take the results of what this application does

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:02.309
and sort of enable a collaboration between doctors
either on sight together or in remote locations.

00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:06.489
So for example they got connected with
iChat and before iChat theatre was available,

00:40:06.489 --> 00:40:10.329
that's not some thing that we condoned, but
they did it in a cool way so I'll talk about it.

00:40:10.329 --> 00:40:15.610
But they got onboard with sort of iChat theatre before
iChat Theater was there and allowed the application

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:20.110
to push the model that it was rendering
across iChat to another doctor,

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:23.550
perhaps an expert in a particular area in another location.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:29.930
Totally cool way of collaborating in a day an age in
a time when this wasn't really going on in the Mac,

00:40:29.929 --> 00:40:31.779
even though you know video conferencing and stuff.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.470
But this is a couple years ago.

00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:38.559
These guys also integrated with sync services so
that they could take the images that were produced

00:40:38.559 --> 00:40:43.090
by the application, these 3D models
and they could move them down to the iPod,

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:48.630
because then doctors could then take the iPOd and
sit down and do a patient bedside consultation

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.460
and rotate just you know with the thumb wheel.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.970
Goes through all the images with the patient at
their bed side and say hey here's what's going

00:40:54.969 --> 00:40:58.149
on with your heart or whatever the issue was.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:03.430
Very cool, very innovative two guys wrote this application.

00:41:03.429 --> 00:41:08.710
That was an open source component as
well, but Comic Life, Comic Life came out of no

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:15.869
where just a few people writing a Cocoa based application
that decided that you know what there's all of this media,

00:41:15.869 --> 00:41:20.190
all of these images that we've
got in our iLife repositories.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.389
We've got all these videos, all these images.

00:41:22.389 --> 00:41:27.750
Wouldn't it be cool if you could create a comic book,
because comic books are a really great

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:30.090
medium for communication.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:35.980
You can do serious content, you know humorous content,
they're a really great medium for communication.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:40.719
And so these guys out of nowhere came out of
left field and introduced Comic Life as a tool

00:41:40.719 --> 00:41:46.849
for quickly building comic books and they integrated
with iLife, they took advantage of Quartz and Mac OS X

00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:50.569
to do some really great visual
effects and in no time in a matter

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:56.250
of minutes you can put together something really compelling
and then they integrated with dot Mac uploaded

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:02.250
so you could build a web page they synced with
iPhoto so that you could push this stuff out to one

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.500
of the iPhoto hard cover coffee table books.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:10.980
Just a few people had a great idea and jumped
on board of all these cool enabling technologies

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.780
in Mac OS X and came up with something really cool.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.630
Won an Apple design award and just came out of
no where and just sort of made everyone think

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:25.920
like oh that's a great app I want to buy a Mac for
that, you know cause I want to access that application.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:33.630
Delicious Library, a cataloging tool for anything with an
ISP end code, whether it's a book, a DVD, a video game,

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:39.200
a CD you can scan this thing with the iSight camera,
kind of like a grocery scanner, goes out to Amazon,

00:42:39.199 --> 00:42:45.159
retrieves information about the document and lets you
catalog it or organize your library of information.

00:42:45.159 --> 00:42:49.869
Basically written by like two people and the
first release 1.0 came out of nowhere.

00:42:49.869 --> 00:42:52.579
This guys working out of a coffee shop in Seattle.

00:42:52.579 --> 00:42:56.099
They could do what they did because
they took advantage of Mac OS X.

00:42:56.099 --> 00:42:58.759
And they totally changed this market segment.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:06.820
It was traditionally list based kind of boring software
and they just added like bam something really cool,

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:11.220
great UI, all OpenGL driven at the time,
iSight integration, dot Mac integration,

00:43:11.219 --> 00:43:15.480
Blue tooth scanner integration, again very cool app.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:19.130
Only possible because of what is built on Mac OS X.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:24.380
3D Weather Globe and Atlas written by a
company in Ukraine call Software MacKiev.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:30.650
Changing the way teachers in elementary schools
talk about the planet you know the globe

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:35.500
and all OpenGL based, great UI
leverages all the graphics technologies.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:40.610
Got a Dashboard widget, spotlight enabled so
you can search for country names and this thing

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.800
in real time, its just super fast responsiveness.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.870
Your rotating globe run, you zoom in,
high-res NASA photography overlaid

00:43:47.869 --> 00:43:51.409
so you can have were the sun is
shining, you have a day view at night.

00:43:51.409 --> 00:43:57.199
You see these NASA satellite images at nighttime and lights
were there's power, were there isn't power in the world.

00:43:57.199 --> 00:44:02.689
Really, really great app and entirely written
in Cocoa, written by a very, very small team.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:10.710
Here's a student winner of the Apple design awards,
last year, William Thimbleby if I remember correctly.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:16.480
And Will wrote Line Form essentially providing it's
a vector illustration tool giving about you know ,

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:20.990
I don't know fifty percent of the functuality
of Adobe Illustrator

00:44:20.989 --> 00:44:23.659
or other vector freehand illustration tools.

00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:28.659
In one app written by one student
entirely in Cocoa leveraging Core Image

00:44:28.659 --> 00:44:32.500
and Quartz and QuickTime for file imports, export.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:38.789
Fantastic application he was picked up after his design
award by Free Verse and now they're marketing this for him.

00:44:38.789 --> 00:44:42.710
He was at Macworld last year, the
guy's having phenomenal success.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:48.119
A peer student of yours who took a great idea and
said, I think I can do better than what's out there

00:44:48.119 --> 00:44:52.150
and I can do it faster and quicker and all that stuff.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:56.840
Great story, here's an application written
by a student that some of you might know,

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.260
the student might be here in the room today.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:02.490
It's called Picturesque, really great product by a student.

00:45:02.489 --> 00:45:11.899
Its essentially, it's a batch image beautifier so to speak
you take any image of any pretty much any format you drag it

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:17.090
on the main window and then through this transparent
panel, you can adjust whether you want rounded corners ,

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:21.740
whether you want reflectivity and how much,
how long, do you want a glow around the seems.

00:45:21.739 --> 00:45:26.169
You do all kinds of attributes to the image and then
you can save it out into whatever format you want .

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.650
You think well big deal there's lots
of applications that can do that,

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:35.110
well the big deal is for one the UI is really simple
and its dead easy to use, just drag and drop interface,

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:36.980
tweak a couple of things and you save it out.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.570
But more importantly its batch imaging so
you can take two hundred and fifty images,

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:47.680
drag them on the main window screen, set all the attributes
and then say save as, specify the format you want to output

00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:53.379
to because you might have dragged in all kinds of formats
and you want to out put them all as jpeg u save and bum,

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.890
they're all saved in jpeg with all of the
attributes that you specifies in the ui .

00:45:57.889 --> 00:46:06.089
Very cool tool and added Cocoa scripting so that this
thing is entirely scriptable so know its automatable

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.320
through Automator and he's
provided some Automator actions

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.860
so that you can build an Automator work
flow to do exactly what you want.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:19.559
Save the work flow as a double clickable application on
the desktop and now any user of this application can drag

00:46:19.559 --> 00:46:23.070
and drop any number of images onto
that double clickable work flow

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:26.500
and instantly there converted and
saved into what format you want.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:32.949
Very cool great idea, streamlining and automating
something that's been done by lots of apps,

00:46:32.949 --> 00:46:37.019
but not in such a straight forward
cohesive, automatable way.

00:46:37.019 --> 00:46:42.650
A student of your, a pier student of yours
has done something great on Mac OS X.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:51.300
Another student on Mac OS X I know the student is here
this year I saw him last night, Pathway the product,

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.690
if you Google on Safari Pathway
Mac OS X you'll find the product.

00:46:54.690 --> 00:47:04.000
it's a Wiki browser that shows you this the relationships
between links on a page and so you might go into,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.840
you go into pathway and you type a term like Mac OS X
and you hit return and bum and it searches Wikipedia

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:15.789
and it goes to the Mac OS X page in Wikipedia an instantly
just kind of explodes this relationship diagram of all

00:47:15.789 --> 00:47:18.719
of the links that are on Mac OS X Wikipedia page.

00:47:18.719 --> 00:47:21.609
And then you can click you start clicking
on all these things and every time you click

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:28.010
on a link bum it gets parsed and you get another
relationship diagram and it's a really cool way

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:32.680
of browsing content on Wikipedia because you
see relationships that you never thought,

00:47:32.679 --> 00:47:37.859
not that you never thought were there before,
but you know a Wikipedia page is really awesome,

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.730
but sometimes they're really long.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:44.740
Just sort of reading all of that manually
and sort of grocking all of the connections

00:47:44.739 --> 00:47:47.699
that are there you know its not
the most optimal way of doing it.

00:47:47.699 --> 00:47:54.710
Pathway kind of solves that by showing you this graphical
relationship diagram and it is a very cool way of looking

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:59.019
at relationships going oh I didn't know that was
connected there and kind of doing that thing.

00:47:59.019 --> 00:48:03.309
Great student product that's enabled because
of technologies in Mac OS X like WebKit

00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:05.099
and the graphic stack and other things, Cocoa.

00:48:05.099 --> 00:48:16.449
M00:48:07 (silence) M00:48:13 So of course the
challenge to you is what ideas have you got.

00:48:16.449 --> 00:48:20.419
And what are you going to build, you
know how are you going to build them

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.970
and which technologies in Mac OS X are you going to use.

00:48:23.969 --> 00:48:30.839
Alright we talked way back about how you could change the
world and the first thing I said was recognize opportunity.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:37.559
And definitely there's an opportunity with iPod and definitely
there's an opportunity with Mac OS X all the Macintosh.

00:48:37.559 --> 00:48:42.949
And then I talked about some of the technologies you
could leverage using the right ingredients make sure

00:48:42.949 --> 00:48:49.230
that whatever bread you bake so to speak, whatever
software loaf you bake you use the right ingredients right.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:52.849
You could use the wrong ingredients of course,
if you've ever baked something you know

00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:57.150
that you can have the right ingredients, but mix them
incorrectly and you get something that's pretty awful.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:01.099
But equally you could try to you know
improvise and you come up with a crazy recipe

00:49:01.099 --> 00:49:02.779
and it doesn't you know taste good at all.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:08.140
So picking the right ingredients and then
mixing them together correctly is the key.

00:49:08.139 --> 00:49:13.349
Alright third thing you can do to try to change the
world and benefit from your time here at WWDC is

00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:20.759
to be a good citizen. You know social
networking is huge in the younger generation,

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:28.770
which I suppose is a little bit younger than me,
but the guidance that we give you is that you know

00:49:28.769 --> 00:49:34.579
that being a good citizen at WWDC
and terms of the development of the community,

00:49:34.579 --> 00:49:39.519
means sort of honoring the trust that your trying

00:49:39.519 --> 00:49:42.019
to...you know establishing trust with people.

00:49:42.019 --> 00:49:46.429
So for example social networks are great for
socializing and they absolutely have value there,

00:49:46.429 --> 00:49:49.349
but there not so great for business necessarily.

00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:55.349
Because they provide you with a, a pretty large
bullhorn so to speak to tell the world about something.

00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:57.849
and the same is true for blogs.

00:49:57.849 --> 00:50:04.389
In some cases, you know blogs can be, not in
some cases you know blogs are a phenomenal tool.

00:50:04.389 --> 00:50:12.349
But, if your starting to establish relationships with people
who potentially you'll work with or you'll partner with

00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:18.960
or you know anything related to business, you want to
be careful that these tools aren't used incorrectly

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.809
and that you say something that could
potentially come back to haunt you in the future.

00:50:22.809 --> 00:50:23.820
So that's one set of guidance.

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.400
I think related to that is working
hard to earn the trust of others.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.900
You know, you're young, you've got great ideas.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:36.430
A lot of the people walking that halls here at WWDC who've
been on the Mac platform for a long time who have been

00:50:36.429 --> 00:50:43.190
in the industry developing software for a long time, you
know, in some ways you're potentially threatening to them

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.760
because you've got lots of great ideas and lots of energy.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:50.630
In other ways, you know, it's like you're kind of unknown
and what are you going to do with the information I give you.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.130
And these are some of the thoughts that
might be going through peoples heads.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.300
So work hard to build the trust of others.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.990
And not just here at the conference of course.

00:50:56.989 --> 00:51:03.269
But as you sort of step out into your career of development
hopefully and as you step out into your career of sort

00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:08.250
of web content web applications and design,
work hard to build the trust of others.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:13.909
And that means that you need to be careful about
what you say, when you say it and to whom you say it.

00:51:13.909 --> 00:51:17.719
Maybe this next one is, you know, just
my generation or my parents generation.

00:51:17.719 --> 00:51:22.019
But, there's nothing like, there's
nothing better than working with someone,

00:51:22.019 --> 00:51:25.849
who when they say they're going to do something they do it.

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:33.130
And there're definitely people that I work with, you know,
in all aspects of my life in all walks and parts of my life,

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.400
there are definitely people that I'm
connected with that their word is bond.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:43.550
I mean when they say they're going to do something
I can trust them, you know, completely.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.780
And other people where, you know, it's not

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.090
that I don't trust them it's just that,
you know, you're just not sure yet.

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:53.650
You don't have enough mileage with
these people, or maybe once

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:57.260
or twice they said they would do
something and they didn't do it.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.270
And so, make sure that you fall into the former camp.

00:52:00.269 --> 00:52:04.659
Make sure that you, when you give
your word to someone it is,

00:52:04.659 --> 00:52:07.879
it's solid and it's sealed and
you, you know you're good for it.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:14.860
I mean that is going to go so far in you establishing trust
with other people and allowing you to kinda get connected

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:22.890
with people and take advantage of, in a positive sense, you
know, leverage those relationships and go far with people.

00:52:22.889 --> 00:52:25.059
Communicate keep everyone in a loop.

00:52:25.059 --> 00:52:27.400
Of course communication's key everybody talks about that.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:34.420
But I think in terms of, you know, when you start to partner
with people it's so important that you're talking to them

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:37.630
and sharing what you're feeling
and sharing what your ideas are.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:38.990
And, you know, talking about it.

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:42.839
And I think, you know, the social network
in generation's real good about that.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.470
There's lots of blogs that share ideas and that's all good.

00:52:45.469 --> 00:52:49.149
NDA material is NDA whether from Apple or anyone.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:55.430
I mean this goes back to the building trust
but, just because someone tells you something

00:52:55.429 --> 00:53:01.769
about what they're thinking about or what they're working
on, even if it's not secret, it isn't something necessarily

00:53:01.769 --> 00:53:04.380
that is appropriate to share with other people.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:08.700
And I think until such time as the person
who has given you that information, you know,

00:53:08.699 --> 00:53:12.489
gives guidance to talk about to
others, I think a safe assumption is

00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:14.519
that it's not something you should
be sharing with other people.

00:53:14.519 --> 00:53:19.610
And it's just, it's just some guidance,
it's just some wisdom from me to you.

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:24.559
But I think it's really valuable for you here
at WWDC to keep that in mind and I think,

00:53:24.559 --> 00:53:28.369
as you work hard to establish trust
with others it's a real key thing too.

00:53:28.369 --> 00:53:33.789
And be the developer everyone wants to work with, you know.

00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:34.789
Work hard.

00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:37.500
Be the person who does what they say they're going to do.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:44.500
Be the person with energy and ideas and do everything you
can to be the person that everybody else wants to work with.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:54.329
That's going to get you so far in your career, farther
probably than, you know, great academic, you know,

00:53:54.329 --> 00:53:56.259
marks and rankings and all of those things.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:01.410
While all these things are important, at the
end of the day life is about relationships.

00:54:01.409 --> 00:54:07.589
And the more you can do to be someone who is a pleasure to
work with and who is, you know, trustworthy and works hard.

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:11.640
And that's going to take you further,
I think, than a lot of other things.

00:54:11.639 --> 00:54:14.179
And so, I just give you that guidance as well.

00:54:14.179 --> 00:54:18.619
And here at the conference too, be somebody
that's like, you know, a riot to be around.

00:54:18.619 --> 00:54:21.109
I think that's great as you connect with people.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:26.650
Take advantage of core ingredients is another recipe
for being successful on Mac OS X and with your ideas.

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:31.889
And I'm going to move through this list real
fast because you've heard a lot of this today.

00:54:31.889 --> 00:54:34.949
But I want to talk about these technologies,
these core ingredients.

00:54:34.949 --> 00:54:39.399
I showed you how some other third
parties and students were using them.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:44.559
But I want to talk about them in terms of what the
opportunity is for you of making something great.

00:54:44.559 --> 00:54:46.829
Cocoa, you're probably using Cocoa already.

00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:51.949
But Cocoa is the framework, it's the wrap
it up linkage and development environment of Mac OS X.

00:54:51.949 --> 00:54:54.980
Cocoa enables some great products.

00:54:54.980 --> 00:55:02.670
I would say the best of the best new products in
Mac OS X today without a doubt are all Cocoa based.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:06.780
So if you haven't looked in Cocoa yet, look
at Cocoa closely and start to learn it.

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:11.470
Spotlight, spotlight definitely is a
feature that we introduced in Tiger.

00:55:11.469 --> 00:55:12.679
It's available in Leopard.

00:55:12.679 --> 00:55:14.679
Of course you've seen the demos earlier on today.

00:55:14.679 --> 00:55:15.909
And you used it yourself and stuff.

00:55:15.909 --> 00:55:20.629
But think beyond just sort of Spotlight
searching in the finder.

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:26.230
Think about how search can be integrated into
whatever idea you've got that you're going to turn

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:28.909
into a solution in an application on Mac OS X.

00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:33.079
It's not just about making your
file format, you know, searchable.

00:55:33.079 --> 00:55:38.819
But you could do a lot with search inside of your UI
in terms of smart lifts, smart albums, that, you know,

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:42.000
are calling through to the query
API's to find things

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.780
that auto populate these folders
within the UI, within your UI.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:50.510
And there's lots more that you can
do with spotlight and we can talk

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.840
about that one on one if you've got questions about it.

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:59.140
Quicklook, you've seen all the stuff we're doing
with Quicklook it's absolutely critical, you know,

00:55:59.139 --> 00:56:05.929
it's sort of an essential ingredient of all of
the things that you do on Mac OS X make sure

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:08.279
that you are Quicklook ready if you're file based.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.220
And I won't go deeper into that.

00:56:11.219 --> 00:56:17.719
Core animation, you've seen cover flow today, you've seen
the demos that were shown this morning in the keynote.

00:56:17.719 --> 00:56:23.750
Animation is going to take the user
interface on Mac OS X to a whole new level.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:27.320
And we're just beginning to see how it's doing that.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:33.120
If, you know, if you see the experience in cover flow you
get a sense for that, if you look at front row when you sort

00:56:33.119 --> 00:56:39.269
of do the remote controller on the iMac or
on any machine that's now front row enabled.

00:56:39.269 --> 00:56:43.909
You see this mode switch and front row
starts to rotate these icons around it.

00:56:43.909 --> 00:56:48.549
It's a completely new way in a sense, a
very engaging way of presenting information

00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:50.670
to the user or presenting a UI to the user.

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:55.360
And you could start very simply in our app by
adding animation by just simply animating lists.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:59.150
As things come into a list, for
example, like the iChat buddy list.

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:01.730
People appear online and the buddy list opens up space.

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:04.309
And the buddy enters or is added to the list,

00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:07.710
and when the person goes off line they
disappear and the buddy list collapses.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:14.019
That's a very simple use of animation or a simple example of
the use of animation inside of an application to convey lots

00:57:14.019 --> 00:57:17.670
of information to the user in a
very elegant very interesting way.

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:21.360
Front row is a major way of introducing
animation to do a mode switch.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.329
A cover flow is great way of using
animation to sort of navigate information.

00:57:25.329 --> 00:57:30.289
And I'm sure that you guys, when you start
to think about it core animation is going to,

00:57:30.289 --> 00:57:35.539
is going to be one of those enabling technologies that
are going to let you guys create some really great stuff.

00:57:35.539 --> 00:57:40.670
That wasn't possible previously without a lot a lot of code.

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:46.659
Core image and image I/O, again core ingredients, pardon
the pun, that you should be using if you're going to deal

00:57:46.659 --> 00:57:50.909
with anything related to camera images
or file formats or what have you.

00:57:50.909 --> 00:57:57.079
If you want to do any image effect inside your
application don't waste any time writing the importers

00:57:57.079 --> 00:57:58.179
and the exporters.

00:57:58.179 --> 00:58:03.879
Don't waste any time writing these image filters unless
you want to add to what's already in Leopard or in Tiger.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:08.320
But take advantage of these built in technologies
to do all of the cool affects that you see inside

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.350
if iPhoto and some of our other applications.

00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:15.230
They're just calling through the system to do like a
sepia tone or, you know, a black and white conversion,

00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:18.610
or some kind of a pointilization or whatever effect.

00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:24.900
And then built in support for raw camera image format
so that your app doesn't have to worry about the stuff.

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:29.670
It can just bring these image formats
in and it can do what it needs to do.

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:35.480
Image Kit framework, again a really powerful
framework for you to build your cool idea on top

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.969
of because your image kit takes care of all of
presenting the UI for standard image effects

00:58:39.969 --> 00:58:43.000
which in turn go back to core image to be applied.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:49.329
Image Kit presents you with all of the UI you need and all
of the under, you know, all of the plumbing that you need

00:58:49.329 --> 00:58:52.139
to talk to an iSite camera with the picture taker UI.

00:58:52.139 --> 00:58:54.279
So, you don't have to worry about any of that.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:59.550
With like three or four lines of Objective-C code you
can present this UI, take a photo, and your retrieve

00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:02.600
and your given back a photo from the Image Kit Framework.

00:59:02.599 --> 00:59:10.779
And lastly, Image Kit provides you with
standardized UI for slideshows like in iPhoto.

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:15.210
If you've gone to full screen mode in iPhoto
and you've managed your photos in there all

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:17.800
of that UI is provided through image kit.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.870
And so, it's available to you.

00:59:18.869 --> 00:59:23.730
So you can do the same things in your applications
without having to write all this custom code.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.360
OpenGL limited only by the GPU.

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:32.599
The GPU's performance graphics processing unit on the Macs
and in the industry is a whole, GPU performance is going

00:59:32.599 --> 00:59:36.000
through the roof compare to CPU performance.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.699
So a phenomenal increase in power there and
we're doing everything we can on Mac OS X

00:59:40.699 --> 00:59:46.619
to take all the graphic stuff, the entire
graphic stack and put it on top of OpenGL

00:59:46.619 --> 00:59:49.559
and push it through the GPU for optimal performance.

00:59:49.559 --> 00:59:54.920
And if you're thinking of doing some, if you got a
great idea and you want to get on top of sort of how

00:59:54.920 --> 01:00:00.670
to render this correctly in a 3D way and a way=
that's visually, you know incredibly appealing.

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.269
OpenGL's the way to go.

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:06.090
And so you should make sure the visit the
OpenGL or the graphics lab downstairs.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:08.780
Find somebody who knows something
about OpenGL and tell them to sort

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:11.769
of do a brain dump to you about how this stuff works.

01:00:11.769 --> 01:00:17.469
And that's true for all these technologies.

01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:24.779
Quartz compositions, here's an opportunity for you to
do something either in your application or separate

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:29.570
from your application to really get mind share
with people and do something that's very cool.

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:34.330
You can even turn these into products in and
of themselves separate from an application.

01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:41.819
So Quartz compositions, if you didn't know already are
created with a tool called Quartz composer it's bundled

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:48.000
on every, in the developer tools
folder in Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.300
But Quartz Composer lets you build these compositions.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:55.470
And compositions are the sort of, it's a
visual, Quartz Composer provides a visual editor

01:00:55.469 --> 01:00:58.329
where you bring patches in, these little boxes.

01:00:58.329 --> 01:01:04.230
And each patch basically exposes
functionality from an API and Mac OS X.

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:06.570
So, you might be sitting out there going well like what API?

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:08.490
I mean, you know, OpenGL?

01:01:08.489 --> 01:01:14.939
The answer is yes, OpenGL, Quartz, Bonjour,
RSS, all kinds of technologies in Mac OS X

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:19.260
that you might not have learned the API for
and you don't necessarily know anything about.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.300
I mean not everybody in this room
knows how to program OpenGL.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.019
Maybe you don't really want to know how to program OpenGL.

01:01:25.019 --> 01:01:26.130
And that's okay.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:31.760
But you can take advantage of OpenGL through
compositions because you can drag boxes around

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.930
and you can hook lines up in this
visual letter, anybody can.

01:01:34.929 --> 01:01:37.779
And you can create these things that are really compelling.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:45.680
And once you've created a composition you can expose
sort of these values on each of these little patches,

01:01:45.679 --> 01:01:52.250
which expose an API to your application or to
a wrapper application through Cocoa bindings

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.090
because any application can now set these values.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:57.720
So, for example, you might have a shape that has a color.

01:01:57.719 --> 01:02:03.809
You can export and make public the color value and then
a Cocoa binding can connect to a color pallet in the UI.

01:02:03.809 --> 01:02:08.860
And whatever color the user chooses, you tell the
composition hey, this is the color for that value

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.670
and boom the thing automatically redraws in the new color.

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:14.099
That's a simple example.

01:02:14.099 --> 01:02:21.250
The point here is as students you guys might have some
really creative visual ideas of things you want to do

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:25.849
but you don't have the time today right now this
week or, you know, in the course of this year

01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:28.989
to learn everything there is to learn
about programming Quartz or Bonjour

01:02:28.989 --> 01:02:31.639
or any of these API's or even more that I haven't mentioned.

01:02:31.639 --> 01:02:36.429
But you can get on top of these and use them
and leverage them inside of Quartz compositions.

01:02:36.429 --> 01:02:43.059
And you can build a whole library of compositions that
other developers could use or other people could use.

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:45.079
And I'll give you two examples here.

01:02:45.079 --> 01:02:48.460
Here is a let me just see if this
works for a second, if the mike is on.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.769
( Clapping )
No it's not, the mike's not on.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:56.909
So, here's a Quartz composition
that two students in Atlanta made.

01:02:56.909 --> 01:03:01.889
And they use it in the context of a
church that they're participating in

01:03:01.889 --> 01:03:04.579
and in the context of some concerts that they're part of.

01:03:04.579 --> 01:03:07.960
And so, they've put these, this is a
Quartz composition running right now.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.429
They're doing some clever stuff inside
the composition for moving this needle

01:03:11.429 --> 01:03:15.079
in the view meter and they've hooked up some patches.

01:03:15.079 --> 01:03:19.059
They've hooked up one of the patches that's
in input for the audio in on the computer.

01:03:19.059 --> 01:03:25.230
And so, this composition, which isn't working at the moment,
but basically it's monitoring whatever the audio in port is

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:30.250
on the Mac and it's adjusting the U
meter based on the volume of that sound.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:33.360
So if I clap you would've seen the needle, the needle jump.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.829
Well they use these compositions.

01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:36.039
They've got a whole raft of them.

01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:36.940
I won't show you them all.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.460
But they use these compositions in a
contest concert scenario where there's a VJ

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:46.920
in the back doing some really cool stuff on
the front of the, in the front of the concert

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.849
and where they get the crowd all rowd up.

01:03:48.849 --> 01:03:51.750
And so the whole crowd's trying to get
this view meter really high, right.

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:52.869
It's very cool.

01:03:52.869 --> 01:03:56.960
It's very applicable I a particular
context but it's a creative idea

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.690
and there was no programming that went into this at all.

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:01.869
This is simply done with Quartz composer.

01:04:01.869 --> 01:04:04.630
Here's another one that's not going to show
up very well because it's not working.

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:08.250
There's a blue line, anyway I'll tell you very quickly.

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:09.769
But it's a blue line with different thicknesses.

01:04:09.769 --> 01:04:15.219
The same thing takes the audio in read and adjust
the line sort of like a different kind of a meter.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:17.059
And again it's all about applause ometer.

01:04:17.059 --> 01:04:20.150
You know, it's measuring the sound in the room
and it's getting the audience all excited.

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:25.059
And anyway, it doesn't look like much here
but I'll show you on my machine later.

01:04:25.059 --> 01:04:28.820
Another opportunity for you in terms of
core ingredients is Safari and web kit

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.360
You've seen all the news today
about Safari going to Windows.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.890
You've seen all the news I've heard all
the stuff about Safari on the iPhone.

01:04:34.889 --> 01:04:41.009
There's definitely a huge opportunity
for you if you understand, you know HTML,

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:44.130
CSS JavaScript and want to move in that direction.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:50.000
There's a real big opportunity for you to build a presence
in the developer community by being an expert at this stuff

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.300
and getting out to all of those browsers that are there.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.710
Dashboard same thing if you know CSS HTML Java
script you can do some very compelling widgets.

01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:02.849
We got some great widgets that have been
submitted over the past from students.

01:05:02.849 --> 01:05:09.059
And we look to see what else you've got up your sleeve
so to speak, so again another opportunity for you.

01:05:09.059 --> 01:05:14.889
And there are some developers that have created widgets
that they sell and they generate income from widgets.

01:05:14.889 --> 01:05:17.279
And they do quite well for themselves.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.990
So there's a great opportunity for you with dashboard.

01:05:20.989 --> 01:05:24.349
Address book, you guys are big in
the social networking I'm sure.

01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:30.489
Whatever you create, whether it's a stand alone
application or a widget you can link to,

01:05:30.489 --> 01:05:34.879
if it manages people make sure you store
it in the central data base on Mac OS X,

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.160
another great ingredient for your product.

01:05:37.159 --> 01:05:42.739
Calendar store, if your product or your idea relates
to events make sure that you're retrieving calendars

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:48.889
and restoring events into the central calendar store on
Mac OS X Leopard, because that means that whatever you do

01:05:48.889 --> 01:05:54.469
in terms of adding events, creating calendars or modifying
them, any other application that deals with calendars

01:05:54.469 --> 01:05:59.219
on the Mac including iCal and others
can take advantage of that.

01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:03.579
Instant messaging, again you guys are big
into social networking connecting to people

01:06:03.579 --> 01:06:06.539
and IM-ing and texting and such I'm sure.

01:06:06.539 --> 01:06:09.829
And on Mac OS X is a built in message framework.

01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:15.259
It's a great way to build community within your user base.

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:20.310
So, think about, you know, whatever idea you've got that
you've been sort of, you know, letting percolate for a while

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:23.690
and now you're at WWDC and you're thinking
well how do I, how do I do that iChat thing?

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:26.800
Well the answer is instant messaging, the
instant message framework in Mac OS X.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.590
You can indicate presence and you
don't have to do it through iChat.

01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:38.230
Your application can call through to the instant message
framework for any buddy name and get their online status.

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:43.670
And you can show it inside of your application in
with the same kind of UI or slightly different UI.

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:53.639
And even if you were a web solution you could wrap your
web solution in a web view with a thin Cocoa application

01:06:53.639 --> 01:07:00.049
and now that application can talk through the native
API's on Mac OS X like the instant message framework.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:04.680
And then, could pass that information up into the web
view, up to your server, so that your web solution

01:07:04.679 --> 01:07:10.619
which is embedded in this thing, application in a
web view, has awareness of presence so a great way

01:07:10.619 --> 01:07:13.929
to get access to the native system API's for web view.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:19.269
Anyway, the value of knowing if somebody's online
is obvious when you're inside of Mail etcetera.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:25.269
So think about the idea you've got and knowing if
buddies are online or not would be valuable to that,

01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:27.199
and make sure you take advantage of instant messaging.

01:07:27.199 --> 01:07:28.769
iChat theater, you've seen it today.

01:07:28.769 --> 01:07:36.409
it's a great way to just take whatever your ideas, whatever
your application is and push that content out to users.

01:07:36.409 --> 01:07:41.989
And automation, I talked early about how
picture ask, this image beautifying tool

01:07:41.989 --> 01:07:45.639
that the student created is really
compelling because it's automatable.

01:07:45.639 --> 01:07:52.739
It can easily integrate into a bigger workflow
and just be one essential piece of workflow.

01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:56.629
But once it's part of that workflow
no one's going to let go of it.

01:07:56.630 --> 01:08:02.900
So the best thing you can do if you're writing applications
on Mac OS X, whatever the application is to make sure

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.340
that it can be part of an automation workflow.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:13.110
That, somehow some way, through AppleScript or through the
scripting bridge in Mac OS X Leopard, people, other users,

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:17.470
other applications can talk to your app and
get stuff out of it without users having

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:19.699
to launch the app and integrate with the UI.

01:08:19.699 --> 01:08:25.149
And automation has extended a lot of the
aps that we include on Mac OS X today.

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:29.210
And extended those apps in ways that the
original engineering team never even thought

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.909
about and didn't write specific API's for.

01:08:31.909 --> 01:08:37.199
It's just that when you start to call things through the
scripting API's you now can do things in certain orders

01:08:37.199 --> 01:08:39.659
and get additional functionality out of these aps.

01:08:39.659 --> 01:08:44.630
So for example, you know, there's a bunch
of apps on Mac OS X that are enabled

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:47.960
and have a lot more features because they're scriptable.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.369
Don't forget the value of scripting.

01:08:51.369 --> 01:08:55.630
Okay, last couple things to finish
off here and then we'll be done.

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:59.680
So, another thing you can do is focus on the important.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.190
You know all the ingredients.

01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:04.849
You've seen how the third parties
have bundled these things together.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:09.950
You're starting to form partnerships - in the week here
at WWDC and over the course of the next couple

01:09:09.949 --> 01:09:12.269
of years as you get into your careers, and stuff.

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:17.310
But, as you build products it's
not just about the technologies.

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:25.320
What makes some of the best products great is the fact
that they combine the ingredients in the right way

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:26.989
to produce something that's really great.

01:09:26.989 --> 01:09:31.670
Alright, I was talking about combining ingredients
correctly or incorrectly, and one of the best ways

01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:35.850
to combine the ingredients correctly is
to make sure that you focus on the things,

01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:39.850
the attributes of software that are very important for you.

01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:43.020
So, as you walk around the show
today, talk to other developers

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:47.510
and ask them how did you make your
application elegant, if they did.

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:51.920
How did you make your application easy to use, if they did?

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.489
You know, what do you do to make
sure that your app is super simple?

01:09:56.489 --> 01:10:00.699
How did you design your application and focus on simplicity?

01:10:00.699 --> 01:10:04.670
What did you do to make your application
super high performance?

01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:07.869
Well of course they ran Shark and
they use the right API's and you know.

01:10:07.869 --> 01:10:10.559
but there's, focus on these things.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.270
Apps that are defined by these types of characteristics,

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:18.510
sorry these types of characteristics
are the apps that people want to use.

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:22.760
And just take a moment for a second
think about the apps you love to use.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:30.289
They probably embody a lot of the characteristics
that I've got on the screen here, imagine.

01:10:30.289 --> 01:10:34.399
So, we've talked about the technologies in Mac OS X and
I went through a whole raft of ones that are in Leopard.

01:10:34.399 --> 01:10:37.960
And so, this is some of them, you
know, enhanced from the previous slide.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.569
And so, the question of course is what's your app going to do?

01:10:41.569 --> 01:10:45.399
are you going to focus on attributes like
simplicity ease of use, you know, adaptability,

01:10:45.399 --> 01:10:47.109
compatibility and all the things that people want?

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:49.329
And are you going to use the right technologies?

01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:53.989
Because if you do, it'd be really great for me
to be able to talk about you next year or perhaps

01:10:53.989 --> 01:10:57.369
at the Apple Design Awards and go
through here and say, you know what?

01:10:57.369 --> 01:11:04.590
This app from this student uses all of these technologies
and it delvers a really great elegant, you know,

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:08.190
easy to use high performance solution for Mac OS X.

01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:10.239
that's the goal.

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:12.909
So just do it.

01:11:12.909 --> 01:11:14.449
You guys have great potential.

01:11:14.449 --> 01:11:18.840
I've talked to a bunch of you already, not just
today, but over the course of the last year.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.470
I've chatted with a bunch of you who know me.

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:27.000
You guys have time in the sense that you don't have
the same demands on you that sort of working people do.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.649
that doesn't mean you're not busy.

01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:31.989
I'm not trying to belittle.

01:11:31.989 --> 01:11:34.399
I'm just saying your demands are different.

01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:39.349
And for many of you you've got time in ways that other
people don't have to kinda come up with something.

01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:41.039
You have energy you've got access.

01:11:41.039 --> 01:11:42.539
People like talking to young people.

01:11:42.539 --> 01:11:44.420
They like talking to people with great ideas.

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.640
They like talking to people with, you
know, who think, you know who think big.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.470
And students are typically people who think real big.

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:55.510
Lastly I want to end on this.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:12:03.280
There are a lot of great apps on Mac OS X today
that are being written by really young developers.

01:12:03.279 --> 01:12:08.719
Now maybe some of the ages that I'm going to share in a
moment are a little older than you but it's possible.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.140
And there's a whole new generation of applications
of software coming out of Mac OS X written

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.800
by what I would say is very young people.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.460
And you guys can be, maybe some
of you are some of these people.

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:24.109
But you can definitely be, you know, a part of this.

01:12:24.109 --> 01:12:27.689
And a I said some of the best stuff is
coming out of the younger generation

01:12:27.689 --> 01:12:30.750
and these are really great apps that do the right thing.

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:34.850
So let's look at some of the ages of these developers.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:38.260
There's not a single developer who's
written these application that's,

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.489
I mean every one of them is under
the age of 30 if not 28 I think.

01:12:41.489 --> 01:12:44.119
I think the highest number on here is 28.

01:12:44.119 --> 01:12:48.599
So, 28, no 29 here over here in the corner on
the job, but you know, that's not real old.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.680
Some of the guys walking around
here are pretty old, you know.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.710
and they're still doing good stuff.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:13:00.590
so think about what these guys have accomplished, you know,
and what's most exciting to me is all of these apps as far

01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:05.369
as I know, and I might be wrong,
are written by one person, okay.

01:13:05.369 --> 01:13:07.720
They're all written in Cocoa.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.449
They were all written over the last
12 months or 18 months potentially.

01:13:11.449 --> 01:13:13.399
I might be wrong in a couple of cases.

01:13:13.399 --> 01:13:18.689
They're all written by somebody who's young, and
they're all getting great traction on Mac OS X.

01:13:18.689 --> 01:13:21.789
they're seeing success, there's an opportunity here.

01:13:21.789 --> 01:13:26.779
and you guys, I'm sure, have great ideas and it would
be great to see you guys develop a product that shows

01:13:26.779 --> 01:13:33.170
up here whether it's a widget or a web solution
or a double clickable desk top application.

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:38.319
So, here's a quote from Lee Iacocca founder of Chrysler
years and years ago, I love this, I love this quote.

01:13:38.319 --> 01:13:39.619
I want to end with this.

01:13:39.619 --> 01:13:41.180
So apply yourself.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.990
Get all the education you can.

01:13:42.989 --> 01:13:45.750
But then by God do something.

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:49.710
Don't just stand there, or sit
there, you know, make it happen.

01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:51.859
There's so much potential here.

01:13:51.859 --> 01:13:55.259
I love the fact that we got so
many students at WWDC this year.

01:13:55.260 --> 01:14:01.980
And I love just sort of anticipating what's going to  come out
of you guys in terms of productivity tools for Mac OS X.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:07.409
and the key thing, of course, is get
all the education you can here at WWDC.

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:10.019
Milk this place for all it's work.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.380
Don't, you know, hang out.

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.010
Talk to Apple engineers.

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:14.869
Get their ideas.

01:14:14.869 --> 01:14:16.539
Say, hey I'm thinking of doing this thing.

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:17.340
How would you do it?

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.520
What technology would you use?

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.730
How would I make it simple?

01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:21.109
How would I make it high performance?

01:14:21.109 --> 01:14:22.109
How do I do all these things?

01:14:22.109 --> 01:14:26.630
You know, and there's lots of really smart
people here that you can get information out of.
