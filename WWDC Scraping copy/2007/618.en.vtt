WEBVTT

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.920
>> So it is my pleasure to introduce to you the designing
and extending in Mac OS X Blog Experience session.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.050
We have a fun session planned for you this morning,
and we have Melvin Rivera

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.870
from Mammoth Advertising as well as AllForces.com
who will be providing the presentation to us.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.009
So, I'd like to welcome Melvin onto the stage right now.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.409
( Skipped audio )

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.309
>> Thank you.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.820
Good morning.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.840
Good morning.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.970
>> Good morning.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.369
>> All right.

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:43.689
Everybody is awake.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:53.739
My name is Melvin Rivera, and I'm from Mammoth Advertising,
an advertising agency in New York City and today we're going

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.840
to be covering designing and extending
the Mac OS X blog experience.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.280
Specifically we're going to be covering
WordPress, how to set it up, how to customize it,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:17.530
and we'll show kind of a live -- a real live
scenario for Michael Moore's new film, Sicko.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.670
So before we get started, this is some of the things
we're going to cover just to make sure you guys are

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.329
in the right session and it's a
time investment, I understand.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.539
So we're going to cover the benefits
of WordPress as a blog or CMS.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.770
We're going to set-up a local server to run WordPress,

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:45.959
get an understanding of the WordPress loop the template
query logic of WordPress and the template hierarchy.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:54.429
We'll also build a custom WordPress theme and
expand a WordPress blog through the use of plug-ins

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.280
and like I mentioned study a real case
sample of Michael Moore's new film, Sicko.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:10.259
A little bit of curiosity before we get going, are any
of you guys bloggers like active bloggers out there?

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.679
Okay. All right.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.810
That gives me a good idea of who I'm talking to.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.270
Well, this is -- this is a great
introduction session to what blogging is

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.630
in general and specifically through WordPress.

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.560
So the first question we'll start with,
and we won't spend too much time on this,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.210
is what the blog format is and
why has it spread out so much.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.849
I mean, it spread out like wildfire.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:45.810
It really feels more like it's a revolution of our current
-- of -- of our current generation in the Internet.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.770
This is little sample of some of my daily readings which
have changed through the years and now are composed

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.960
of mostly blogs that I follow through the day.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.170
I don't know if you can see top left over
there is one of the founders from Panic,

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:10.339
PhotoMatt over here is the main developer for WordPress.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.469
Blogging really has taken over as kind of
like the primary way of personal publishing

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.120
on the Internet and there's many reasons for this.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:29.969
My personal take on this is that blogging is, you know,
compared to other formats cause there's other formats

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:40.539
like wikies, there's, you know, regular content CMS
applications and there's even static HTML pages but,

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:47.150
specifically, I think what makes blogging
unique is that it's kind of a friendly --

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.900
it's a friendly -- it's friendly application.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:00.140
It's a friendly way of doing this and what I mean is that
it's, you know, blogs like to talk, they like to listen,

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:05.829
and they talk behind your back just like -- just like
real friends, and I explained this really quickly.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:14.530
They like to talk and, if we use an analogy of talking,
then the person talking is the content provider.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:22.069
What's unique about the blogging format is one
of the many ways that you can actually develop --

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:27.139
not develop content but create content for a blog.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.759
You're not tied down to logging
into your specific blog, you know,

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.529
entering a new entry in the browser
where you're connected to the Internet.

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:44.829
You can blog through e-mail; you can blog through your
phone; you can even use a desk application like Ecto

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:49.449
or Marset to submit new entries to your blog.

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:58.969
So it really -- it has changed the way content
is created in many ways, also through interaction

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.920
with other social sites like Flickr and Twitter.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:10.970
I mean I recently installed a plug-in on my blog where
I just used the service of Twitter and I do updates

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.100
through the day and at the end of the day WordPress
goes, gets all my updates and puts is automatically

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.140
in one post without me having to do anything.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.500
So blogging -- blog -- the blog format likes to talk.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:35.220
It likes to listen and, if we continue the same analogy once
the author says something, then there's the listening part

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.750
and that's done through the use of
comments which are very common on --

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:49.759
on blogs where people can go in and comment
on a specific post and interact with --

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.649
with the person who wrote the original story.

00:05:52.649 --> 00:06:02.489
The third part in my theory of friendship is that blogs
talk behind your back and that happens through the use

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:10.090
of track backs and pings which are
very unique to the blogging platform.

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:18.429
For those of you who don't -- are not familiar with
this, I'll give you an example: If I'm blogging --

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:26.610
if I am browsing a blog and I read a story, for example,
about a certain phone that might be coming out in a couple

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:33.780
of weeks and I'm interested in writing about it
I'm totally excited about reading this and hey,

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:38.819
I want to comment on that particular post,
but I don't want to do a comment on that site.

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.730
I want to actually turn it into a post on my blog.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.569
I can grab the URL from that particular --

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:54.449
from that particular website and go to my blog where I have
a specific entry for track backs and I put the URL in there.

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:02.930
When I publish, my blog will automatically communicate
with the other blog and say, "Hey, here's this blog.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.079
It's talking about this particular post."

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:13.300
Sends the information, sends all the data of my post,
it shows up on the other blog as a comment or --

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.920
or as, you know, a referring URL that's talking about that
particular post and the same thing can happen vice versa

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:26.340
where somebody sees a particular entry on my post,
they can track back to me, and it shows on my post

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:29.379
and that's without me having to do anything.

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:35.699
So, blogs talk -- continuing the
analogy -- behind your backs.

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:40.810
So it's a very friendly environment
and I think, in my opinion, that's --

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.120
that's one of the reasons why they've taken over.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:55.430
Another reason is it's a very simple format of posts in
chronological order which is what really makes it a blog.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.199
Where it's kind of solve the case of
how to design a website home page.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:06.370
A lot of designers struggle with getting content, you know,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.280
how to organize content on the
home page of a specific web site.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:17.569
Blogs solve this by, as you can see up here, having posts
in chronological order, so you always have the top one,

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:22.639
you know, the most recent entry at the top and
as you scroll down you see the previous one

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.819
and there's no need to reinvent the wheel.

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:30.500
You have those and you can browse the
archives and you can search the archives.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:38.210
So for those and many other reasons,
we think blogs are quite amazing.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.600
I'll show you one example.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:46.389
We did this site a couple of weeks ago
for Michael Moore's new film, Sicko.

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:54.549
We had about a day and a half to build this from the
initial PhotoShop design 'til we actually delivered it,

00:08:54.549 --> 00:08:56.609
and we used a blog.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:02.129
They wanted a blog, I think just for the
idea of allowing people to communicate

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:04.939
because it's kind of a -- it's a hot subject.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.880
So we set one up.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:14.610
It's not set-up in a traditional blog
format of dates, but it has everything else.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.230
It has all the track backs.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:22.920
We installed a plug-in that allows
people to rate insurance provider.

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:31.740
We have a plug-in that allows you to send automatically
the URL to all these other social websites like Big

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:38.960
and Delicious, so it was very successful and
we were able to set it up rather quickly.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.190
So this brings me to why WordPress.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:48.350
Why are we using WordPress as our blog application.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:53.480
WordPress, if you guys are not familiar
with it, it's -- it's an open source --

00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:00.029
open source software that's available at WordPress.org.

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:11.689
It also has WordPress.com which is a free hosting service
that they added that's very similar to blogger.com,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.990
but today we're really covering WordPress
the actual software that you download,

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:23.169
you install on your server and
you customize it however you want.

00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:28.990
It is based on -- it's -- it's written in
PHP, and it uses MySequel as a database.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:35.870
So some of the reasons why we highly recommend
and love WordPress, of course it's open source.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.560
It has a very active community of developers.

00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:47.469
It gets constantly updated, there's a plethora of
plug-ins that get automatically released almost

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:53.550
on a daily basis, search engines love it.

00:10:53.549 --> 00:11:03.259
Within a week of launching the Sicko website, the blog, it
was listed -- it was on the first page on the top ten of --

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:10.090
on the Google search result and repeatedly, every
time we've set-up a particular site on WordPress,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:16.820
it automatically gets ranked very highly through
search engines and that has to do a lot with the fact

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:24.570
that every time you post, WordPress automatically pings
the specific blog-related search engines, like Technorata.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:32.280
It also has -- also has to do obviously
with, you know, proper XHTML coding but again

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:40.110
and again search engines have loved it, so
our clients are usually very happy about that.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.840
WordPress has a solid core of features and
it's easily expandable through plug-ins.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:55.090
Data can be easily imported and exported through built-in
tools and you can also tap into MySequel database.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:03.480
WordPress also has a multi-user version and by multi-user
I really mean multi-blog where you can actually set

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.899
up WordPress, one installation
of WordPress to run multiple --

00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:14.059
multiple blogs and that's kind of what they do in
WordPress.com so, if you are inclined to setting

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:21.469
up your own kind of social website where
you provide people blogs, it's a great --

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:29.310
it's a great software for this and last it
can be set up in less than five minutes give

00:12:29.309 --> 00:12:31.909
or take a few days for tweaking and things like.

00:12:31.909 --> 00:12:39.879
We're going to cover this very quickly because we have a lot
of things to do covering how WordPress works but just keep

00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:50.950
in mind the architecture of the information, things are very
specific to WordPress, to blogging, things like comments,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:59.620
track backs, pings, RSS and socializing that means new
elements that are visually on the page so you've got to keep

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.720
that in mind as you're designing, you know, your
infrastructure, your wire frame of your website, you know,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.550
are you going to have a page of RSS feeds.

00:13:08.549 --> 00:13:21.519
WordPress automatically creates RSS and Adam Feeds per
category, per author of posts, has a combine post of RSS,

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:26.559
you know, an RSS feed of combined
posts, comments or comments for posts.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:33.969
So it automatically creates all that but
obviously, as a designer, it's up to you what --

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.100
how you organize that information, so keep
that in mind as you're going through this.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:44.940
Here's an example of bringing in some stuff from Flickr and
from Last.fm in the sidebar of this particular site

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:51.930
and then you have searchable objects
and ways of organizing archives.

00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:53.979
This is a sample of one of my favorite sites.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:59.230
He's the guy that designs the default theme for WordPress.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:03.490
Archives are organized like by chronology where
you can see -- you can browse through a year,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.629
month and then you see the date listings.

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:15.500
You can browse through full or you can see the tags that he
uses and as you can see some of tags have different sizes

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.669
and that denotes, you know, how much -- how
much or how much more frequently they're used

00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:25.409
and taxonomy is organized in specific categories.

00:14:25.409 --> 00:14:33.230
So we'll get on -- we're going to switch
to a demo and do a quick little demo

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:43.440
on how to install and -- and run WordPress.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.570
Specifically we're going to do -- all right.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:55.160
Specifically we're going to use MAMP, Headdress, to run -- to run the site locally.

00:14:55.159 --> 00:15:02.029
Now Mac OS X comes with Apache and MySequel
already built in and, if you are so inclined,

00:15:02.029 --> 00:15:04.129
you can tweak things to get things working.

00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:10.419
It requires a little bit more -- more work
specifically if you want to do subdomains,

00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:18.879
if you're dealing with multiple websites but for this
example we've downloaded Mamph which is kind of like an all

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:29.470
in one package of Apache, MySequel and -- and PHP and
the cool thing is that it's all enclosed in one folder.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:36.000
So theoretically you can dump it in your iPod and actually
take it wherever you're going and continue your development,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.320
you know, passing on from computer to computer.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:46.670
We're using Headress specifically for multiple domains
in the case that you're developing multiple websites but,

00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:50.309
if you're only doing one, it's not
really -- it's not really required.

00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:55.979
So, just to show you how simple it is to set up,
I've downloaded Headress and I've downloaded Mamph

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:02.519
and I've downloaded WordPress, the new version of
WordPress which I've installed in the sites folder.

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:10.720
So number 1; we're going to launch
Headress and yes, try the demo.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.290
It's very cheap.

00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:13.829
It's like 20 something dollars; it's totally worth it.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:18.560
So the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to tell --

00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:25.229
we're going to tell Headress that we're
going to be using the Mamph installation,

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.240
so we're going to come over here and link it together.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.649
So open the HTTP file of Mamph.

00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:44.059
I'm going to browse through applications folder, look
for Mamph look for the config, Apache, all right.

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:47.439
Now, if you see over here on the
right you see the little elephant,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.090
that means the Apache config file for -- for Mamph.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:17:00.170
The top one is -- is the one that comes
built in with Mac OS X. All right.

00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:08.170
Once we have that, we're going to add WordPress to
Headress, so we're going to come over here and say add site,

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:13.509
and I'm going to come over here, choose this is my
sites folder and my personal home folder and I'm going

00:17:13.509 --> 00:17:16.539
to select -- that's the WordPress that I downloaded.

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:26.210
You can rename that folder to whatever you want, if you want
to specifically rename to whatever your site, and that's it.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.559
So now we have this set up over here.

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:38.200
Number 3 is we're going to launch this and create
the database, so we're going to launch Mamph.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:47.330
Mamph automatically takes you to
where is this thing -- all right.

00:17:47.329 --> 00:17:55.149
Mamph automatically take you to this kind of starter
page and right from here you can go to PHP my admin page

00:17:55.150 --> 00:18:00.050
to manage the database of Mamph, and
I'm just going to create a new database.

00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:05.220
I'm going to call it WordPress but, if
you're dealing with multiple projects,

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.120
I suggest you label it accordingly
so that you know what's what.

00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:12.399
Okay. So now we have a new database that we created.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:20.240
I'm going to come back here to the start -- to the
start page and this should give us the information

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:27.450
that we're going to enter, database, you know,
host, the user is root, password is chiefs.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.160
All right.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:44.620
So we're going to come over here and launch
the site -- no, actually what am I doing here?

00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:54.259
Okay. Back to the WordPress folder.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:19:05.190
I'm going to edit the config file of WordPress which we do
by removing the sample from the section and launch that file

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:09.370
and we're going to enter the database
information that we got.

00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:13.970
Database name --

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:20.659
Okay.

00:19:28.099 --> 00:19:34.179
Ah. Something is not working here.

00:19:40.609 --> 00:19:45.519
Here let me redo this part right here.

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:54.650
And config from Mamph --

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.730
You guys following?

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.380
All right.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.940
All right.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.750
Why isn't this working?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:13.269
Maybe -- I'm going to restart the server really quick.

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:17.109
You know, I've tried this like
ten times in the last two days

00:20:17.109 --> 00:20:22.299
and this is the first time it doesn't
work so just -- there you go.

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:23.369
All right.

00:20:23.369 --> 00:20:23.449
( Applause )

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:33.710
So you know, if you're working with multiple projects
it's just as simple as going to add site and linking

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:44.779
to a new installation of WordPress and, you know,
just repeating those steps, but we're going to --

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:53.079
oh, something happened here with
my -- maybe reopen the start page.

00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:57.159
Okay. Password root that's what happened.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.910
So I'm going to change the config file of WordPress.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:06.509
Okay. So password is root.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.490
Okay. We got it working.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:26.380
So this is WordPress running and -- ah, cancel
that database -- let's see -- open start page --

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.670
double check that the database is still there, not there.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.130
Okay. Very weird.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.960
Okay. Come back over here.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.319
Okay. All right.

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.099
No, no this is good.

00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:43.559
This is good.

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:52.049
It's seen the database, and it says you haven't installed
WordPress yet because the installer installs the tables

00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:57.389
and database so -- so we got WordPress working,
so all we have to do is click Install.PHP.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.780
WordPress automatically puts all the database
tables and all that, so let's take the first step.

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:07.529
So we take the first step, name our -- name our thing.

00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:15.769
Okay. I'm going to deselect this
particular option and that tells it

00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:21.889
to automatically submit a new post to search engines.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.410
Okay. So now it's done; it gives me a temp password.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:33.090
I'm going to copy that and then go to the log-in
page, admin log-in, and I'm in the admin of WordPress.

00:22:33.089 --> 00:22:39.319
I'm going to quickly go here to
users, and I'm going to change --

00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:50.169
I'm going to come in and change my password
really quick to something I'll remember.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.039
All right.

00:22:51.039 --> 00:23:04.500
And then I'm going to go to options and turn on
permalinks, so are you guys familiar with permalinks?

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:10.289
Yeah. WordPress is a PHP application, if you don't
turn permalinks on, then all your URLs are something

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:17.500
like Index.PHP question mark P equals, you know, something
or other, so permalinks are kind of like pretty URL's.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.240
They're a little bit more contextual.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.990
So I'm going to set-up the date and
name base so, if I write I post on 2007,

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:30.319
June 15th called sample post, then
that will be my actual URL.

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:35.769
All these URL's get redirected to PHP and PHP
automatically outputs the correct one out.

00:23:35.769 --> 00:23:41.089
So I'm going to update that, and I said
I'll give you a quick overview of WordPress;

00:23:41.089 --> 00:23:48.769
dashboard shows latest activity here and gives you some
WordPress news; write is where you would write a new post

00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:58.480
or a new page which is different than a new post,
pages are not tied into the chronological order index,

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:05.069
so a page would be something you would use to do
like a contact page or, you know, a videos page

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:11.319
or an about us page, so it doesn't show
when you're browsing archives through date;

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:19.740
manage view is where you manage posts, you know, pages,
categories and things like that; comments that's where, you,

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:25.390
you know, disapprove all the nasty stuff
that you're guaranteed to get on your site;

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:32.270
blog roll is kind of like the blogging
name used for links and sidebars.

00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:36.569
You can add links and put them in categories et cetera.

00:24:36.569 --> 00:24:44.059
Presentation is where you choose
new templates and plug-ins is

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:47.929
where you activate plug-ins; users
is where you manage users.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:53.670
So it's a -- it's -- it's a very simple
interface that you're dealing with.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:58.860
So that's kind of the end of the
demo of setting up WordPress.

00:24:58.859 --> 00:25:01.919
As you can see it's -- it's very easy.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.350
It took less than five minutes,
I think, give or take a few days.

00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:19.649
That's three Aps we used and this is kind of all the
steps that we took and -- and that was the demo we took.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:25.840
So, again, WordPress on interface is very
clean, very easy, if you actually don't like it

00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:33.519
and hate blue there's a few plug-ins that automatically
change the CSS, makes it look completely different.

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:39.549
There's even a plug-in that allows you to change the name
of the labels so, if you would rather have links instead

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:42.799
of blog roll or if you don't use
that, you can actually delete it.

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:45.339
So it's very extensible.

00:25:45.339 --> 00:25:55.349
This is the file structure of WordPress as you can see
most of the files start with WP at the beginning except

00:25:55.349 --> 00:26:04.779
for the index file obviously and the XMLRPC file but
everything else it's very easy, most of your stuff --

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:11.509
most of the content on your site lies in the content
folder that's where you have your themes and plug-ins.

00:26:11.509 --> 00:26:21.910
So as you're upgrading WordPress you kind of update
everything else except your content and your config file.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:33.269
So we'll delve into how to customize WordPress and it's
theme, the best way to customize a theme in WordPress,

00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:39.389
themes in WordPress are not really called
templates it's really a collection of themes,

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:49.910
every theme is really different because it's --
it's a collection of different files and functions.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.509
You're even allowed to create your own personal, you know,

00:26:53.509 --> 00:26:59.079
some things even come with plug-ins
that come in automatically with them.

00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:09.369
So the best way, if you want to customize a look of a
specific theme, is to duplicate the default theme that comes

00:27:09.369 --> 00:27:16.509
in your themes folder and what you do is you
duplicate it, rename it and then you edit,

00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:24.819
there's a style.CSS style sheet file in that folder and all
you have to do is rename the metadata at the very beginning.

00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:30.339
In this example I named it my custom theme
and, once you do that and you go the admin,

00:27:30.339 --> 00:27:32.919
you will see right here at the bottom left, my custom theme.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:40.259
You just select that and WordPress automatically
starts using that theme as a theme and then,

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:44.309
once you have it set-up, you can
go in and start editing the files.

00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:52.089
I have two lists here, one is the required
files and the other one is a basic template,

00:27:52.089 --> 00:28:00.109
the required files are the requirement
that WordPress has to run a theme properly.

00:28:00.109 --> 00:28:09.969
It only requires those two files, everything else
is a way of easing the process as a developer.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:16.930
The index file is the actual PHP
code that culls the content.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.810
It's the same in every single page.

00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:29.619
I'll show you an example, if you see on the list on the
right, there's a very basic one, there's obviously Index.PHP

00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:35.399
which is the main template the one that's called
template on the right, on the middle that's the --

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.780
that's the page that gets run when you first
hit the home page of a -- of a WordPress blog.

00:28:41.779 --> 00:28:50.359
If you click on a specific post link and you go to
the page where it only shows that particular post,

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:57.109
WordPress will automatically look for Single.PHP
which is a post template that shows right here.

00:28:57.109 --> 00:29:02.919
If WordPress doesn't find that particular file, it
will automatically default to Index.PHP that's why --

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.769
that's why index is required, the
same thing with page template.

00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:19.129
If you create an About Us page when you click on that link,
WordPress will automatically look for the Page.PHP file.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.220
If it doesn't find that, it defaults to index.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.430
So there's other -- other files like that.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:33.380
There is a 44 file in case, you know, they add -- somebody
goes into a link -- a page that's no longer there, again,

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.440
it defaults to index if that file is not found.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:45.809
There's a few other files here on this list for example
header and footer and sidebar, those are split just as a way

00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:51.970
of optimizing their design so that you're not repeating
code in every single -- in every single footer and header,

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:58.380
you know, they just get included in -- in some of the
template files so that you're not redoing the same code.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.990
You just edit it once and that's it.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.910
So how to -- specifically how to customize a page?

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:10.370
Well, we have two ways -- two things you can customize.

00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:15.539
You can customize a particular post, you
know, the post that's tied into the --

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:21.889
into the timeline and then you can customize the page.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:30.770
To customize a post, I'll give an example, if you have
a blog specifically talking about games and you want

00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:38.450
to split it into, you know, PlayStation, you know, you
split it by platform you want to cover PlayStation,

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:44.850
Xbox and Wi then what you do is you have three
main categories, you find the ideas you see

00:30:44.849 --> 00:30:51.319
on the first list here, you find the idea of that category
you can get it by going to the manage categories section

00:30:51.319 --> 00:30:58.779
and -- and get the ID and what you do is you
duplicate the file Single.PHP and you add a number --

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:02.289
that number at the end of the file name, so if you hit --

00:31:02.289 --> 00:31:11.859
if you're browsing a WordPress site and you drill
down to a specific post that's about PlayStation,

00:31:11.859 --> 00:31:18.219
PlayStation happens to be category number three, then
WordPress will automatically look for Singlethree.PHP.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.720
If it finds that it will show that.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:27.779
If not, it looks for Single.PHP and if it
doesn't find that it reverts to Index.PHP.

00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:34.319
So it's -- it's a hierarchy of
trying to find template files.

00:31:34.319 --> 00:31:39.639
It's, you know, once you have that particular
page, you can edit however you want.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.890
You can remove the sidebar.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:48.980
You can have a custom CSS file that's unique
to that specific section so that you can --

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.829
it can be all related to PlayStation et cetera.

00:31:53.829 --> 00:32:03.319
Now pages are handled differently, pages -- you actually
select from the admin menu what template you want to use

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:13.200
and what you do is for the sample we'll duplicate
Page.PHP from the -- from the theme folder, you know,

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:20.250
edit however you want and what you do is you include
a code, a PHP comment that says templatename:videos

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:26.759
which is number three right here on the right.

00:32:26.759 --> 00:32:35.410
So, once you have a page that has that, when you go
to the WordPress admin, you'll see this on the right,

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:42.350
there's a page template section and the name that we
selected over there which is videos in this example,

00:32:42.349 --> 00:32:46.589
will show up over here and you say hey, this
page I wanted it to use this particular template.

00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:56.609
So it's very easy to customize, you know, individual
pages or post pages based on the specific category.

00:32:56.609 --> 00:33:04.819
I'll give you an example based on the Sicko website
that we developed, the trailer page we had to customize

00:33:04.819 --> 00:33:09.629
because we wanted the trailer to be like full
screen; we didn't want any of the sidebar.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:15.160
We didn't want the red column that was,
you know, on the regular post, so that's --

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:30.279
that's what we did we attached a specific class style sheet,
CSS class, that had the parameters of, you know, wide,

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:38.710
you know, angle, center page and
so it was very easy to do that.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:47.150
Another way of customizing templates in WordPress is
through doing custom queries and this is available

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:52.680
in every page of -- of a WordPress theme.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:34:03.140
WordPress provides specific functions that you can use
as a conditional tag and this example the first one

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.690
to show the search field on the
sidebar only on the home page.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:17.269
All you have to do is do a PHP conditional tag that
says, if it's home, then, you know, include this file,

00:34:17.269 --> 00:34:21.719
search form and, if it's not the
home page, it won't show it.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:31.730
Second example shows category, if show category name when
browsing so, if you're specifically browsing a category

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:40.269
so if -- if you go to, you know, your blog, category
and then the category name, then you can say well,

00:34:40.269 --> 00:34:44.980
they're browsing the category let's identify that
and, you know, so we'll use this particular function.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:50.240
If it's category and you're currently
browsing the, you know, category name.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:56.829
I'm going to show you some -- some of
the conditional tags that are available.

00:34:56.829 --> 00:35:04.699
There are author-related -- author-related
tags, so you can have specific things happening

00:35:04.699 --> 00:35:09.369
when a post that was written by a specific person.

00:35:09.369 --> 00:35:20.409
You can have things that show up or hide specifically
on one particular post or one particular page

00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:28.670
or if it's search results is home which we
already saw, if it's category, if it's not found,

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.940
date based if you're browsing by
year, by date, by a month or by day.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:41.760
If it's an archive there's kind of all
these conditional tags that are available.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:47.970
Next this is the index page of WordPress.

00:35:47.969 --> 00:35:53.259
I've kind of trimmed down a little bit on the HTML
code -- the HTML code that comes in the default --

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:59.820
in the default thing just for clarity of this
example, but you'll see that we have a couple

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:07.490
of WordPress functions here, get header, all it
really does is it doesn't include a PHP include

00:36:07.489 --> 00:36:14.419
but just for simplifying we're using WordPress
built-in function that automatically includes that.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.990
So you can include a header, include
a sidebar this is where the content is

00:36:19.989 --> 00:36:23.019
and then you can include the footer at the end.

00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:31.190
The content is kind of where the magic
happens and this is kind of the same --

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:40.250
the same code that's used throughout all
the different WordPress pages and templates.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.179
First it asked if it has any posts.

00:36:42.179 --> 00:36:48.250
If it doesn't have any, then you can have a
custom content, you know, that says not found

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:57.400
or you can provide a search field or even bring in archives,
if it finds, then it goes through the WordPress loop

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:05.930
and the WordPress loop is -- is where WordPress
goes and gets the content from the database.

00:37:05.929 --> 00:37:09.599
There's a few functions that are available for use,

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:14.219
one of them is bring in the title
which is -- this is all PHP codes.

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:20.679
This is very simple -- this is a -- this is a
PHP file so you're mixing in HTML with PHP code

00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:29.690
which is actually very easy for you guys who
are familiar with PHP, if not that's I --

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:35.970
but I have a hunch you guys are into
programming, so it should be pretty --

00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:41.629
this is the one that brings the actual content
and if you see here there's a specific parameter

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:46.670
that says read the rest of this entry
that's because WordPress you can --

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:53.500
whenever you make an entry, you can specifically split
a particular point and say show only this and the index

00:37:53.500 --> 00:38:01.130
and have people, you know, click for more and you
can customize the way the actual text that shows up.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:09.730
There's other ones, you know, like the time, the category
but there's a lot more that you can include that has,

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:15.579
you know, information about the author,
you know, the date, comments et cetera.

00:38:15.579 --> 00:38:24.519
If you want to do multiple loops, there is
just a matter of adding one more PHP code

00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:29.090
which is a query post function from WordPress.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:34.190
Why would you want to do multiple loops, well,
going back to the example of setting up a blog

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:42.889
for different gaming platforms, you might want your
home page to have -- to be split into three columns,

00:38:42.889 --> 00:38:46.159
you know, one for each particular gaming platform.

00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:53.869
In that case all you have to do is specify with
a query post right before the WordPress loop,

00:38:53.869 --> 00:38:58.559
this first one we're showing the last
ten posts of category ID-3 right,

00:38:58.559 --> 00:39:06.820
so if the category with the number three is PlayStation
then this will show the last ten posts of the PlayStation,

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:14.039
so it's very simple, you know, it's category equals three
in this case we're trimming it down to only the posts

00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:22.809
from the year 2004 just for ki cks and then we show the
last ten posts and then on the next example we actually,

00:39:22.809 --> 00:39:30.340
just for you to get an idea, we can show every
single post except category number three,

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.800
so and you do that just by adding a negative three.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:40.130
You can do multiple categories by doing commas, you
could do, you know, category three, comma five, comma 15,

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:49.570
comma negative 4 and here's some example
of the parameters you can use: Category,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:55.690
category name which is the actual full on
name of the category which is not recommended

00:39:55.690 --> 00:40:03.849
because you can always rename that and then screw up
your site; there's, you know, author, author name,

00:40:03.849 --> 00:40:15.509
post number and page ID, minutes,
seconds, it's a lot of freedom.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:24.760
Last we will talk about expanding the blog
experience through plug-ins and widgets,

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:31.720
WordPress built in media support and how
to insert media from other social websites.

00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:46.509
Plug-ins and widgets, WordPress I think it's mostly known
for its amazing plethora of plug-ins that are available.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.250
They get updated on a daily basis.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:53.519
I subscribe to RSS feed of any new plug-ins and it is --

00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:57.900
it's amazing how active the community is
and you can get just about everything

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:04.320
WordPress plug-ins are executed by predefined
plug-in hooks so every plug-in works differently

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:10.390
because it gets executed different parts, there
are some that get executed before any page loads,

00:41:10.389 --> 00:41:18.879
some load after the page load, some are applied as
filters to posts, so there's, I mean, there's --

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:26.930
there's a plug-in for example that
changes comments looking for bad words,

00:41:26.929 --> 00:41:28.889
but it doesn't actually change it on the database.

00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:35.599
It actually applies a filter on the execution
when you're actually viewing the page,

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:40.059
so that it doesn't actually tinker with the actual content.

00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:43.750
So if you guys are interested in
plug-in development, it's -- it's --

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.909
there's a lot of cool things that can be
done just because it's very extensible.

00:41:47.909 --> 00:41:55.129
But some examples of the plug-ins that are
available are, you know, spam checkers,

00:41:55.130 --> 00:42:00.800
there's a plug-in called Akismet
which is made by the developers of WordPress

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:08.490
and that's probably the best spam blocker
available for any blog platform out there.

00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:10.979
It's not only available for WordPress; it's also available

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:16.519
for other blogging platforms, and
it's developed by the same people.

00:42:16.519 --> 00:42:24.199
If you guys don't blog, spamming in
-- on the blog comments in post is --

00:42:24.199 --> 00:42:32.109
has gotten probably worse than e-mail spam with,
you know, casino invitations and things like that.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:40.329
Other things that are available are tagging,
WordPress has very basic tagging out of the box

00:42:40.329 --> 00:42:46.679
or you can just pretty much the title and a
description, but it doesn't really have any metadata

00:42:46.679 --> 00:42:53.889
so there's plug-ins available for that where you can
add key words and descriptions per post or per category

00:42:53.889 --> 00:43:03.589
or globally there's also integration with
sites, external sites like YouTube, Flickr,

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:12.320
there's a mobile blogging plug-ins where you can
allow, you know, it allows you to edit and add content

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:19.130
through your phone and there's plug-ins that
enhance some of the main features of WordPress,

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:28.940
allow you to manage categories better, give you
extra options and extra labels in particular posts,

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:41.070
the way posts work in -- in the -- in WordPress is they have
a lot of options for metadata so a lot of plug-ins use this,

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:47.580
you know, particular option where if, for example, if it's a
plug-in that rates a particular, you know, item and you're,

00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:53.400
you know, for example want to have a site where
you review books and you want to give it, you know,

00:43:53.400 --> 00:44:01.780
three stars or five stars or whatever you can actually roll
out your own plug-in very easily just by adding a metadata,

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:07.260
you know, to that particular post, you know, called rating.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:07.810
It's very easy.

00:44:07.809 --> 00:44:11.309
It's very cool for plug-in developers.

00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:14.949
There's admin enhancements, obviously, like
I mentioned if you want to change the look

00:44:14.949 --> 00:44:19.679
of the admin interface there is
a -- and there's also widgets.

00:44:19.679 --> 00:44:27.739
If you guys know most blogs have sidebars
and the new version of WordPress has widgets

00:44:27.739 --> 00:44:33.919
where it allows the content, you know, the content
creator of the blog to organize their sidebar

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.950
and add widgets and delete widgets and things like that.

00:44:38.949 --> 00:44:42.609
To install a plug-in, it's very easy.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:46.510
You download the particular plug-in you're interested in.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:53.830
You can find them at WordPress.org they have an extend
section where you can find items to extend your blog.

00:44:53.829 --> 00:45:01.259
Download the plug-in and read the instructions
because all plug-ins are not created equal.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.530
Some are a collection of files, you know, in a
folder that you need to put in the plug-ins folder,

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:11.620
some are just one file, some require some extra
steps but pretty much follow the instructions,

00:45:11.619 --> 00:45:17.670
put them in the plug-ins folder, then you go
to the plug-ins tab and you'll see a list.

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:23.510
In this example I'm showing post ratings
which is the one we used in the Sicko blog.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:32.490
It's activated so you have the button
to deactivate right there to disable it.

00:45:32.489 --> 00:45:37.419
This particular plug-in shows me a ratings
tab at the very top of WordPress --

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:46.079
of the WordPress admin where I can change things like how
the rating looks whether it tracks people's API, you know,

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:55.849
IP addresses, whether it allows, you know,
who do you want to be allowed to rate.

00:45:55.849 --> 00:46:01.789
You can say only rate people that have a WordPress
account on my blog or have anybody be able to rate,

00:46:01.789 --> 00:46:07.259
and this is, again, this is the plug-in at work.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.350
It's a very cool plug-in.

00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:15.960
It's a -- it uses AJAX so you can go
in, select your particular, you know,

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:23.579
insurance company to rate it see the little
AJAX magical little progress bar and that's it

00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:29.719
so it doesn't really take you to a separate
page or anything like that can't beat of --

00:46:29.719 --> 00:46:37.389
the bad thing about plug-ins is you need
to keep an eye on them because, you know,

00:46:37.389 --> 00:46:44.019
not everybody is a great plug-in designer and this
particular one brought the site down a few times

00:46:44.019 --> 00:46:51.000
because it was doing way too many access to the database.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:58.900
It wasn't using cache so we had to do some magical work, you
know, in cache all the content on an hourly basis so that,

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:06.920
you know, get some relief to the database of the
site so and other than that there's also, you know,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:15.659
not everybody is great, and not everybody
writes code that's -- that's web standard.

00:47:15.659 --> 00:47:24.069
So it might, you know, you might be very anal about
having your code being very proper and install a plug-in

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:29.870
and all of a sudden, you know, you're no longer up
to standard, and, you know, you might want to --

00:47:29.869 --> 00:47:35.000
every time you install something, you know, go
through it, check what code it actually outputs

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:42.750
You might want to edit, you know, some of the output
code so that it's, you know, up to your standard of --

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:47.860
of, you know, expertise and all that, so.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:54.230
These are what the widgets look like in the admin area.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:48:02.079
Widgets are only available if you specifically
have it set in your -- in your WordPress theme.

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:09.469
You need to actually add a function --
Functions.PHP file that you can see actually

00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:17.449
in the default WordPress installation that says this is
going to be a dynamic sidebar and then you can need to have

00:48:17.449 --> 00:48:26.489
that in the actual Sidebar.PHP but once you have them these
are kind of like what comes with default with WordPress

00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:36.429
and the ones that have the little icon to the right are the
ones that you can actually have a specific options panel,

00:48:36.429 --> 00:48:44.230
you know, for example for Flickr you'll need
obviously a Flickr account in API but, you know,

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:48.630
you can easily just drag stuff over and
rearrange and it redoes your sidebars.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:52.079
So, it's very easy.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:49:04.420
WordPress built in media support, uploading
a certain media into a post out of the box.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:09.800
WordPress has a very basic way of managing media.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:16.180
You can do it as an upload -- an
upload functionality right into the --

00:49:16.179 --> 00:49:20.379
right into the post when you're
writing a post or writing a page.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:26.079
You can upload images -- you can upload
other things -- this is kind of what it looks like.

00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:34.329
I'm not on the upload tab, I'm on the browse tab so I've
uploaded one image here and I can just easily drag it over

00:49:34.329 --> 00:49:40.190
or double click it to get some options like whether I
want to show the thumbnail only or the big, you know,

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:46.849
original image, whether I want it to link
to the big image or link to somewhere else,

00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:51.880
but it's very limited -- it's very limited.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:56.750
You can upload all the images and have them properly shown.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:03.610
You can upload other media like a QuickTime movie or
a Flash Movie and it will show up only as a text link

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:13.070
where you can click and it puts it as a link in your post,
but it doesn't bring in the actual embedded code for,

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:16.590
you know, say a QuickTime movie or a Flash embed.

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:26.769
For that we use pretty cool plug-ins we have available
and also the upload engine it uses PHP to upload

00:50:26.769 --> 00:50:36.980
which has a certain -- out of the box -- it has a certain
limitation of file size, so on my blog I just change

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:43.380
that I just changed the HT access file and
allowing PHP to use, you know, have a --

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:53.210
a higher maximum upload but that's not available to
everybody so that's something that you need to look at --

00:50:53.210 --> 00:51:05.519
so, here you go -- so like I said we can easily
solve this problem by some really cool plug-ins,

00:51:05.519 --> 00:51:12.460
this one in particular brings some
basic video embedding into the site.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:18.079
As you can see it adds automatically
some icons that you guys might recognize,

00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:23.369
YouTube GoogleVideo, iFilm, got MySpace, QuickTime, Flash.

00:51:23.369 --> 00:51:27.679
You click into any of those it give you a
little pop-up window so, let's say you guys want

00:51:27.679 --> 00:51:36.469
to import a specific YouTube video and just grab the -- go
the YouTube page grab the URL from the top, come over here,

00:51:36.469 --> 00:51:42.480
click on the YouTube, you'll get a pop up window,
paste in the URL, click on Okay and that's it.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:53.480

This is an example showing -- showing
Flickr through another plug-in.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:05.030
All I did was put in my user name,
and it automatically brings

in all my string of all my photos and I can just browse.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:15.920
There's a preference pane where I can choose what --
what version of the image I want to bring into my post,

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.269
whether I want the thumbnail, the medium, you know,

It's very simple to expand WordPress through plug-ins
which is actually kind of the most exciting part because,

00:52:32.519 --> 00:52:37.099
you know, once you're all familiar all of a sudden a new
thing comes out and it's like Christmas again, you know,

00:52:37.099 --> 00:52:41.329
you have a new WordPress that can
do magical things, so, that's it.

00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:45.150
We just review some of the stuff we've covered today.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:52.920
We learned about WordPress really, setting up
WordPress on the Mac, dissected how the WordPress loops

00:52:52.920 --> 00:53:04.130
and how WordPress goes about choosing files and how to
customize and we covered how to expand the magical world

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:07.740
of WordPress through some pretty cool plug-ins.

00:53:07.739 --> 00:53:12.639
Anyways this is really exciting stuff and I --

00:53:12.639 --> 00:53:19.639
I encourage you guys to delve into the world of
plug-ins if you have not and it's quite amazing.

00:53:19.639 --> 00:53:21.099
So, thank you very much for your time.
