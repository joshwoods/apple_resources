WEBVTT

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.289
>> Right, so our agenda for this afternoon's session
is I'm going to give a brief overview of what we're doing

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
in the scientific computing for Mac OS X market.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.270
Simon Patience is going to give us a nice presentation
on technology and trends in scientific computing.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.410
You'll also see a few really nice demos from our customers
and developers, which I think you'll really enjoy.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:47.729
We'll do a quick summary and hopefully we'll have time for
Q and A. So please think about some interesting questions

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:54.539
for the presenters while we're going through
the session and we'll get to that at the end.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.229
So it's been a another year since
we've been here last year talking.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.500
And there's been a lot going on in the market.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.519
I wanted to first start out with some
what I think is really good news.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:11.019
And you guys may not see data like this very
often, especially at the developer conference.

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:14.679
We poll the market about once
a year to see how Mac is doing.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.630
And one of the reasons why this is
relevant today is because what's essential

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:21.869
to our success is what you guys are doing for the platform.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.460
And I think you see that what we're doing is really working.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.269
If you look at our total market share growth,
it's gone from 15 percent to 19 percent.

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:35.079
And that may not seem huge, but it actually is a big deal,
because the more we get the more we'll continue to get.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.799
It's really particularly good in, in the
academic segment and in the government segment,

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.519
where you can see our growth is fantastic.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:43.310
Industry we have a little bit of work to do still.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.890
But I'll talk about how we're, in some of our
programs we hope to continue to address that

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.680
and hopefully make some more in roads
there as we continue into the next year.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.780
Another piece of data that I'm showing you
is just how many people use Mac in their day

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.670
to day work, in the lab, for scientific research.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.250
And its really about 45 percent of all
scientists use a Mac on a daily basis.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.530
They don't all own a Mac, but they all use one.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.580
So we're really touching a lot of people out there.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.010
And I really think again that this has so much to do
with the fantastic applications that you all are bringing

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.789
to the platform, especially as we add
features to Mac OS X and to the hardware.

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.349
So how do we partner with our developers?

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.819
I wanted to talk a little bit about this and just some
of the new things we're doing this year as well as some

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.229
of the stuff we do every year, but
I'll just remind you for those of you

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.929
that haven't been here before and heard my, my talk.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.840
Just starting with conferences and trade shows, there's the
standard national conferences and big shows like Society

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.129
for Neuroscience, which we'll be doing this fall.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.719
But what we also do some market specific ones.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.229
And again, looking back at the previous
slide, how do we address industry?

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:52.069
Bringing some of your solutions with our solutions in
front of customers at a conference like Drug Discovery

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.409
and Development which is really focused on
the pharmaceutical and biotech industry.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.859
We also participate in some user group meetings.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.220
And these are specifically ones that you all put on.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.319
So if you have user group meetings that you think
would be valuable for, for Apple to participate in,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.780
please let us know and we'd be happy to think about
it and look at a way that we could play a role.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.710
And another thing we've done are
some institution specific events,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.840
again bringing in our partners
to talk about their applications.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.080
The one I'm showing on the screen is one at
the NIH, they have a training session program

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.469
where they invite industry people to come and participate.

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.500
So we've done that too, really nice audience there.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.570
Another element of what we've been doing this year
are providing more what we call seminars online.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.379
These are available on the Apple dot com
website, at seminars dot apple dot com.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.609
And we're really focusing on more of
a how to element, to bring people in.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.090
The first is about how to build a cluster.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.420
This is simple in so many ways, but it really is helpful.

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.009
So its you know basically how you plug
everything in, how you wrap the servers and so on.

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.319
But we also partnered with the bio team
to talk about their application Inquiry

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.879
which runs on an Apple workgroup cluster.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.039
And the second one is Getting Started
with OsiriX which for those of you

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:10.419
who don't know is a fantastic open
source medical visualization application.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:17.589
And this is a radiologist presenting how you download
and use this application from the get go on a Mac.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:22.879
We're really interested in doing more types of these, so
again, very open to your ideas on what might be useful

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.939
and ways to really reach out and touch this community.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:31.180
Another pretty interesting initiative we've done is
something called the technology immersion program,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.910
getting back to this industrial type customer and
pharmaceutical and so pharmaceutical and biotech industry.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.330
You know how do we get them to
just take a look at our hardware,

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:43.300
take a look at the applications that
you guys are making for Mac OS X.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.490
Because we know that that once they
get it in their hands, they like it.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.220
They want it and they're compelled by it and they
can see that it really is a viable option for them.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.300
And more than a viable option, actually a preferable option.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.910
And so our goal here was to put
these systems in their hands.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.560
Our first area of focus was computational
chemistry, because over the past year

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.110
or so we've gotten some fantastic
applications, put it over to Mac OS X.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.199
So a very nice suite of applications for
making a computational chemistry workstation.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.529
So the customer gets the MacPro
with 30 inch Cinema Display,

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.649
a bunch of apps for chemistry, a
bunch of apps for productivity.

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:24.689
And we leave it to them and their IT group to set it up, get
it started and use it for a few months to see how it works.

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.339
What we get back is we get feedback.

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.269
Is it really all that we think it is?

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:32.240
Is there anything else we need
to do to make it a viable option?

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.819
And we get access to their IT groups.

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.889
So here's a bunch of IT people that may
not have considered even touching a Mac

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.419
or they're completely Windows or
LINUX or both centric, but not Mac.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.740
And they, they engage with the system, the see that it's not
impossible, or even that difficult to get it on the network.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.340
And it's a really, it's a really interesting
program that's working quite well for us.

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.039
This is a very different type of
program, switching gears a little bit.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.410
Our Apple distinguished scientist program.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.490
This is a brand new program that's really
being headed up by our higher ed science group.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.550
And what they're looking at is how do we find
ambassadors out to the scientific community

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.379
for Apple that have more a voice to the customer.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:19.389
And these are really the people who are using Apple
technology for doing hardcore research themselves.

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:26.870
And so the goal here with this program, these
awards, is to find these ambassadors if you will

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:34.259
and learn from them, hear back from them as almost an
advisory group and also have them talk out to our customers

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:42.849
for us about how they use the technology and just represent
Apple in a much more industry, scientifically focused way.

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.979
I want to talk a little bit about our website.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.500
We speak most often through our
website, Apple dot com slash science.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:00.680
And I wanted to spend a few minutes today because we have
recently redesigned this, to take you on a, a quick tour.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:08.139
Some I'm going to go over here and we're going to switch
over to one of these demo systems magically.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:15.379
Hello? Ah ha!

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.779
There we go.

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:17.519
( Laughter )

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:19.769
Now I can't see it, fantastic.

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:22.379
Okay, so, I'll be able to do this.

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:23.759
So this is the new home page.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.000
What we did was we really wanted
to make it more interactive.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.029
And again, have a better way to highlight what our
developers are doing and solutions and focus on solutions

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:34.119
on the platform, not just the hardware and the software.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.720
But what is a scientist going to do with hardware and software.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.190
So some new sections of better sections I should say,

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:43.719
because they all were here before
pretty much, is software for science.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.510
Let's take a look at that.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:53.319
and you can see there's just a, it's much more visually
appealing, its much more engaging and its easier

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.930
to find applications that you're looking for.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.889
And what I really like in addition is you know you can break
it down by discipline here, but also if what they're looking

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:06.349
for isn't right there, they can just click right
there into the Mac Products Guide and do a search.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.350
I'm going to mentioned the Mac Products
Guide at the end as well.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.320
But if you haven't updated your application and
your description or even have your application

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:16.689
in the Mac Products Guide, please put it there.

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:17.939
People do use this.

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:22.469
And if they don't find it there, they just assume
that your application doesn't run on a Mac.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.230
So another thing that I think is pretty
interesting is the science solutions section.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.300
Excuse me.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:37.350
Here we're taking a look at different disciplines
and saying how are people using the hardware again

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.820
and what should they be, what kind of
applications work, what should they buy.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.850
Let's just take a quick look at medical imaging.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.159
I think this is a fantastic example.

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:50.149
What you can see it just goes into a lot
more detail and then there's your partners

00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:57.889
and suggested software applications for
that particular area of focus right there.

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:04.210
And then the profiles page, and the profiles are these
customer profiles we often get great ideas from you

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.470
and we profile our developers, customers,
somebody who's using a fantastic application

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.350
and the Mac to do research, interesting research.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.259
We're always open to new ideas if you've
got suggestions, please let us know.

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:18.909
This is one the most popular parts
of Apple dot com slash science.

00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:20.569
It gets more traffic than any other part.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.140
People love these profiles.

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:32.330
And this is just a much better navigation to search
out different topics and all of these go much deeper.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.620
So we like to keep this up to date and
add new profiles as often as possible.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:45.389
So again, please if you've got some new ideas or customers
you'd like, you'd like to suggest, then let us know.

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:47.230
The final thing I'll talk about is inside the image.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.800
Now this is pretty different, but
it's also been quite popular.

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:55.599
Its our really look at how art meets science.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.950
And we're in this part of the website,
these are small columns.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:06.129
They're interview style where we talk a scientist that
has, that has come up with or used a particular image

00:10:06.129 --> 00:10:15.360
to convey a concept or an idea with scientific base and talk
about how they come up with it, how they made the image,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.009
what went into it, a little of the,
you know the, the art side of things.

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:23.129
And again, it's been really compelling
and we get a lot of information

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:27.149
and discussion about this art meets science idea.

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:29.959
So with that, I'm going to go back to my other slides.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.830
I just wanted to give you a sense of
some of the new elements on the website.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.910
And encourage you to check it out
if you haven't already done so.

00:10:39.429 --> 00:10:43.449
Okay, so let's talk about the communities.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:50.050
Most of you have heard of some of these, but we have three
main areas I think are worth talking about a little bit.

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:54.409
Mac Research, and I'll talk more about that
in the next slide, Mac enterprise dot org,

00:10:54.409 --> 00:10:59.370
which is more focused on the IT side of things as
opposed to the research side of things with Mac research.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.429
And the developer connection.

00:11:00.429 --> 00:11:06.620
These are all areas where you're going to find great community,
great information about scientific computing as a developer.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.840
Mac research is really a fantastic success.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.310
Now this almost, it's about two years old this month.

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:20.349
It started in June of 2005 this was launched.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.600
And today they have over 2000 active users.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.110
They get 30000 unique visitors a month
and over 200000 page views a month.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.970
This is a fantastic place for you to
be talking about your application.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.639
If you have a customer that can write a review
of your application and post it on Mac research.

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:45.610
If you just want to ask the community a question about, about
your application, about functionality, anything like that,

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.740
there's a bunch of people from Mac research here at the
conference, who are going to be at the science connection on

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.960
and off and just throughout you can meet them.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.870
But I encourage you if you haven't
checked this out, to please do so.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:04.220
And I think even nicer is as of I think in a couple
of weeks, shortly anyway, they've redesigned the site

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.840
and it's going to go live with a new look that's much
more interactive and it'll be more user friendly.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:17.330
So I think we'll get even more people using Mac research as
a resource and really fantastic place to focus the audience.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:22.310
So I encourage you to, to make
as much use of this as you can.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:29.029
Okay, finally as I promised, I'm going to talk about the
Mac products guide because we really encourage and want to,

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:33.569
I want to end with this, to encourage you to make sure
that your application description and the information

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.140
about your application in the Mac products
guide is compelling and up to date.

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:46.000
And if you're not in, alls it takes is a quick submission
to get yourself listed on the Mac products guide.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.730
Our customer do use this resource to
find out what applications are available.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.310
So if you're not there you're probably missing out.

00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:56.379
So with that, I'm going to turn the presentation
over to Simon Patience, thanks for you attention.

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:57.009
( Applause )
>> Thank you.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:01.330
Good afternoon.

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:05.539
I'm Simon Patience.

00:13:05.539 --> 00:13:12.370
I'm the vice president of Core OS,
that's the Unix part of Mac OS X.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:20.009
So today I'm going to talk about four
areas that influencing science

00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:22.679
and are driving the direction of scientific computing.

00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:30.589
And the idea is to basically show you the influence
that Apple is having in these various different areas.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.399
So let's start off with the first
one which is data management

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:39.439
( Period of silence )

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.710
So the trends in data management is that
fundamentally there's an explosion of data.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.800
And it's driving scientific computing
in, in various different ways.

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:54.419
A scientist from John Hopkins was
predicting that there will be more data collected

00:13:54.419 --> 00:14:00.759
in the next five years than in all
of previous recorded human history.

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:03.330
So that's a pretty amazing statistic.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.190
Now when you have all this data, you have to manage
it and by manage I don't just mean store it on a disk.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:13.960
You have to find better ways to, to
organize it, to be able to search it,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.769
to be able to find the, the information in there.

00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:23.569
And that creates a new set of challenges for
us and sort new database infrastructures.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:31.340
In addition, we're getting data sources from
increasingly different and diverse places.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.889
Multiple different instruments, but
also different geographic areas.

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:40.149
And so that creates, creates a new set of problems.

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:46.819
And so now it's got to the point where we
have so much data that it's more important now

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:54.810
to find the information that's hiding in that
existing data than it is to get new data.

00:14:54.809 --> 00:14:57.969
( Period of silence )

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.410
So here's an example of the data explosion.

00:15:00.409 --> 00:15:07.039
This is Gen Bank which is a public accessible
central database of genetic information.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:10.099
One of the largest of its type in the world.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:19.000
And in the last few years, last five years, we have grown
from 17 billion to 75 billion entries in the database,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.429
the number of base pairs in the, in the database.

00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:28.299
This is a growth rate of doubling in every 18 months.

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:35.639
So we're basically going exponential
here in the growth rate.

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:41.769
Another source of large amounts of data is the
large Hadron Collider at Cern, Switzerland.

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:47.799
This is a proton proton and heavy ion
collider, so it's a really sort of atom smasher.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:51.829
Its 27 kilometers in circumference,
one of the largest in the world.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.590
40 million collisions per second.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:16:00.899
So this machine, this system can
produce 10 pedabytes of data per year.

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:04.090
That's a huge amount of data to be able to analyze.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.850
This is scheduled to start in September this year.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:15.340
So the next thing is that we've got, you know
when we gather all this data, the next problem is,

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.840
is not only to store this data,
but you know how do you process it?

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.950
And so what we really want is you know your super computer.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:29.040
So what's, you know what sort of computer would
you want to process this sort of information from?

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:32.349
We're not talking about necessarily where you'd store it.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:37.570
But you know to process this information,
you need a decent sized machine.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:43.330
So we look at storage, the memory,
processor and obviously it needs to be MP.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.629
So you know three terabytes of storage
is a reasonable amount to keep your sort

00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:49.649
of working set of data in I guess, you know.

00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:56.709
So 16 gigabytes of memory would be a good amount
of memory to, to be able to process reasonable sets

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:04.940
in you know three gigahertz zones obviously,
that's a fast, fast processor and naturally 64-bit,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.330
large amounts of data, 64-bit processors are essential.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:14.000
And MP of course you need to be able to
build crunch these numbers effectively

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.390
So let's have eight of them.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.060
All right what would this super computer look like?

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:21.220
It looks like that.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.710
Which is pretty amazing that you can get all that computer
power in that box and you throw in a 30 inch displa0y

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:30.660
or in this case a 5 inch display by the look of things.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:38.570
Then it's an amazing amount of power that Apple
can bring into your desk, desk side basically.

00:17:38.569 --> 00:17:42.669
To help you process this huge quantity of data.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:48.860
And to show you what, what we can do with such a large
amount of data, we have, I'd like to Marion Ho up to,

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:58.629
who is a science partnership manager at Apple, to demo a
64-bit OsiriX on a dataset that is pretty challenging.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.870
( Applause )

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:10.819
>> So one of the big problems in medical
imaging its, its actually one of the,

00:18:10.819 --> 00:18:16.460
one of the driving forces is, so just switch over here.

00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:23.779
One of the driving forces in medical
imaging is just the amount of data.

00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:28.970
So what, one of the, one of the, so as we
mentioned, OsiriX is one of the, its one of the,

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.390
its one of the very popular dicom,
what we call medical dicom viewers.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.290
A medical imaging viewer.

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:36.509
If you're looking at data from things like CAT scanners.

00:18:36.509 --> 00:18:41.019
And of course CAT scans, CAT scanners for
those of you in the medical field know they,

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:43.079
we can generate a lot of data out of those things.

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:48.339
Right here we have about 3000 slices,
represents about 4 gigabytes of data.

00:18:48.339 --> 00:18:54.029
And what we're seeing is actually we're seeing
OsiriX here in 64-bit on Leopardd, running,

00:18:54.029 --> 00:19:00.809
running all those street house slices in memory
in a side by side, in a side by side study.

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:02.289
Why is this impressive you might say?

00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:03.829
Well, it's all gray and everything.

00:19:03.829 --> 00:19:08.759
Well, well and frankly, if you think about it, if you
before 64-bit and before we could get, we could do this on,

00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:12.250
on the Mac with OsiriX, you really only had two options.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.799
You, you're dealing with 32 bit, so you
had, you had to use more virtual memory

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:19.539
or you had to down sample your size, your dataset.

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:23.799
And neither of those choices is obviously preferable
with you know with virtual memory you run into a lot

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:27.519
of performance issues and with
down sampling your sample, you are,

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:31.700
you're starting to possibly lose
data, just to put that in perspective.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.769
You know, you're looking seven millimeters slices here.

00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:43.509
You know you start missing every other slice and
you start missing possible nodules or pieces of,

00:19:43.509 --> 00:19:46.500
or cancer regions that are, that are
smaller than that slice you just missed.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.259
So it's really important that we can see all this data.

00:19:49.259 --> 00:19:51.990
And that's really what OsiriX
is showing us here with 64-bit.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.769
Now one of the things though is you
know we have all this data, so lets,

00:19:56.769 --> 00:19:59.410
you know there are other things we can do with this data.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.420
We can also look at it in once we have all this in,
we can actually also look at it in three dimensions.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.550
And that's something that OsiriX does really well.

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:12.069
We can take all this, these 1500 slices and, and compress
them and put them into a, into a three dimensional view.

00:20:12.069 --> 00:20:21.339
And, and what I wanted to show you, actually
is this kind of data in three dimensions.

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:23.879
So let's see here.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.690
Let's do some demo.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:34.140
So we, you know we're in here and
we're looking at some data.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.610
And so we can, so that's taken the slices and
its, and its, we've put it in three dimensions.

00:20:39.609 --> 00:20:42.539
And now we can see the, the model, the anatomical models.

00:20:42.539 --> 00:20:46.450
What we're actually looking at what
is the bottom half of a person.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:53.710
And, and so what you're basically seeing, so what
this really basically shows us is that in addition

00:20:53.710 --> 00:21:00.269
to just seeing the stuff in two dimensions, we
can also you know we can also visually see this,

00:21:00.269 --> 00:21:03.889
this kind of data in three dimensions in a,
in a way that's more intuitive and natural,

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.190
not just to doctors but to average users.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:12.039
And that's really the power of having 64
bit and having this dataset available.

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:16.450
And, and fully available to, to the rest of the programs.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.420
So kind of with that I just wanted to lead
into what Simon is going to talk about next

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.180
which is, is large scale data visualization.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.509
So thank you.

00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:34.829
( Applause )

00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:39.849
>> So that's a brief discussion about
data management and like Marion said,

00:21:39.849 --> 00:21:44.730
we've now gotta talk about you know what you do
when you've got all this data, how do you look at it

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:51.200
and how do you start to see what
information is hiding in there.

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:59.829
So for data visualization you know this, this
data explosion has been basically requiring us

00:21:59.829 --> 00:22:06.449
to get more sophisticated visualization
techniques and so forth.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:11.289
So the trend is been towards realistic
virtualization in 3D models.

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:18.960
The of high performance networking
basically means that we are actually,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.610
we're able to move this data around far more effectively.

00:22:22.609 --> 00:22:25.829
And what that means is that we have a,
a much greater demand for being able

00:22:25.829 --> 00:22:32.839
to have high performance visualization pretty much anywhere
as you have the ability to, to move, move both the data and,

00:22:32.839 --> 00:22:37.439
and the, the visual, visualization around the world.

00:22:39.009 --> 00:22:45.069
And one of the answers to this is, is to use display walls
to be able to use the, this large scale visualization

00:22:45.069 --> 00:22:49.909
of complex data to be to see what is hiding inside the data.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:55.080
Basically looking for the information hiding in there.

00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:59.949
And the difference is that display
walls are high resolution.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.319
We have a big screen here, but this is not high resolution.

00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:09.669
And the, the high resolution walls are really up to
things like 200 mega pixels and they show the big picture.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:15.390
As opposed to just you know the, the wide data.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:21.440
So you can zoom in on the data that you're actually looking
at and find the details that are hidden in that picture.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.690
So the other thing we want to talk about
is going towards 3D visualization.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.200
So this is a picture of, of 2D
data and the interesting thing is

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.660
that you can see a number of different images of 2D data.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:42.050
And the wall provides some insight into what's going on.

00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:50.220
When you see it in 3D and this is the same data by the way
that you saw in those 2D slides, you get a huge improvement

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.160
and insight into what that data is actually hiding.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.900
It's much easier to visualize the problems.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.050
And these are using regular sort of
Apple technology, so OpenGL and,

00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:05.349
and the Mac pro's multi CPU hardware, 64-bits and so forth.

00:24:05.349 --> 00:24:16.339
And that allow you to be able to do this kind of processing,
to produce these images, that give you these insights.

00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:21.579
Display walls are becoming increasingly
more useful and used.

00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:28.669
This one is actually the hyper wall at UC Irvine.
This is a 50, 30 inch Cinema Display wall.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.930
So it has a 200 mega pixel resolution.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:39.150
There are 25 Macs behind this,
Mac pros rendering these images.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:46.759
So basically they're using commodity hardware,
here Apple displays and Apple computers.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:54.529
And the interesting thing about these display walls
is that it's a centralized resource and so scientists

00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:56.980
from various disciplines are sort waiting to use the wall.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:03.779
And they start to collaborate in a more productive way,
sharing ideas from their own disciplines with each other

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:09.200
to create new ways of, of solving their problems
and finding information about their own data

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.100
by using techniques to used in other disciplines.

00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:19.859
The one thing about this though is that you know
it's a, while the hardware is relatively simple,

00:25:19.859 --> 00:25:25.599
you know and commoditized, the software is custom
software and it's a relatively complex task to be able

00:25:25.599 --> 00:25:31.259
to partition your job up and send it out to
these render engines which then display all this.

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:33.569
However, there is a solution.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:43.240
So Chromium is an open source software package
available for being able to run these large display walls

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:51.359
and Tungsten Graphics has announced yesterday
that it's brought enhanced Chromium for Mac OS X.

00:25:51.359 --> 00:26:00.779
So this is a way for you to take your OpenGL programs
without modification and, and Chromium can run many of these

00:26:00.779 --> 00:26:05.799
without modification to put your
data up onto a display wall.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:11.059
We also have Quartz Extreme.

00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:14.490
This is a new feature in Leopard
that allows you to take your,

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.519
your data and with, this is a, not a programmable thing.

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:24.500
This is, this is Quartz Composer that allows
you to, to display your data on a display wall.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:31.329
This is not quite the, as large
scale as, as the Tungsten solution.

00:26:31.329 --> 00:26:40.929
But it also helps you basically more simply get your
data through simple software means to commodity hardware

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:46.019
to high resolution displays to be able
to do the analysis is a much better way.

00:26:46.019 --> 00:26:52.879
So the combination of visualization and the
intermixing of science disciplines as they have

00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:00.580
to use these central resources has produced interesting
results and new techniques in, in analyzing data.

00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:10.349
And so what I would like to do now is to introduce
Alyssa Goodman from Harvard to talk about her experiences

00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:15.509
in new techniques with astronomical medicine.

00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:20.809
( Applause )

00:27:20.809 --> 00:27:23.659
Thank you.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.620
>> Well I'd really like to thank Apple for inviting me here.

00:27:27.619 --> 00:27:33.339
And thank Simon for really giving a perfect
introduction to this short presentation.

00:27:33.339 --> 00:27:39.240
We've started a new organization at Harvard
called the Initiative in Innovative Computing,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:45.120
whose goal is to essentially address all of the
challenges that Simon is talking about today.

00:27:45.119 --> 00:27:51.029
So dealing essentially with the explosion of
data that really is taking place right now.

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:54.460
And with the need to process the
data, store the data, share the data,

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.850
collaborate on the data, visualize the data, etcetera.

00:27:56.849 --> 00:28:02.819
And so instead of giving you a whole talk about the
mission of the IIC, which is very similar to the mission

00:28:02.819 --> 00:28:07.509
of this session, I'm going to talk
just about one project which is near

00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:11.420
and dear to my heart, which is called astronomical medicine.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:19.420
And so let me explain how I got involved in a project like
the IIC itself and specifically in astronomical medicine.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:27.289
So I'm an astronomer and in that capacity I
study how stars like the sun and stars not

00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:31.240
like the sun form all over our galaxy and in other galaxies.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:39.549
And in order to do that, what we wind up doing is taking
a large number of images at many different waves lengths

00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:44.369
that also include spectrally resolved images,
so essentially three dimensional images

00:28:44.369 --> 00:28:46.619
that I'll talk about in a few minutes.

00:28:46.619 --> 00:28:53.279
But we image these very large regions
of mostly our galaxy that form hundreds,

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:56.950
thousands or in some cases millions of stars at once.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:02.660
And what we're trying to do is to pick apart
the physical properties of these regions,

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:08.259
so things like what's the density, what's the velocity
of the material, what's the temperature of the material.

00:29:08.259 --> 00:29:15.170
And what do physical models of how this kind of material
evolves over time tell us about the population of stars

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.810
that could form from this kind of material.

00:29:17.809 --> 00:29:22.490
So what is traditionally done in astronomy or
was traditionally done is that people specialize

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.960
in particle wave length regimes because
this is difficult to do the observations.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.039
And so what's not done as much as it should
be, but it is done increasingly more now,

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:34.889
is to combine the results from
all of these different techniques.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:41.320
So it's sort of in the medical world like combining
CAT scans, MRIs, CT scan, PET scans, etcetera,

00:29:41.319 --> 00:29:45.490
all in the same patient to try to get a fuller
view of what's going on with that patient.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.569
So this patient here is called the Perseus molecular cloud.

00:29:49.569 --> 00:29:54.609
It's about 700 and something light years away from us.

00:29:54.609 --> 00:29:58.969
And its forming thousands of stars that the same time.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:04.750
And what you see here is an image where in the
background you have a historical optical photo,

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:11.990
the colored stuff that you see here is omission from
dust that's taken with the Spitzer space telescope.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:20.400
The color contours of what I'm going to talk about
more in a couple of minutes and the very small,

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.420
those of you sitting in the front can see
all these little red and blue markings

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.250
that are particularly important
so called star forming cores.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:33.200
The point here however is that I was
invited to a meeting a few years ago,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.799
this is just to review here what
the different kinds of data are.

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:40.769
And again, just to emphasize that I'm
going to be talking specifically more

00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:44.059
on the talk about these so called 13 CO contours.

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:45.720
But I'll get to that in just a second.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:53.150
And so I was telling this story about the need to integrate
this kind of data at a meeting that was sponsored jointly

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.840
by the National Science Foundation
and the National Institutes of Health

00:30:56.839 --> 00:30:59.449
at the National Institutes of Health
campus in Bethessa.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:05.180
And it was organized by the graphics and visualization
community in computer science with the premise

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:10.299
that the visualization community in computer science
had quote unquote failed the scientific community.

00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:13.710
And that they had gone off and done
things that were interesting to them

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.670
but that weren't particularly useful for science.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:24.700
And so at that meeting, if I can just go back here for
a minute, I was explaining this kind of data and saying

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.539
that wouldn't it be incredibly nice if there better ways
to browse through all this information and in particular

00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:38.879
that showing a contour map of the particular kind of so
called molecular structural lighting that we were interested

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.610
in was a crime because in fact it was three dimensional data

00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:46.529
and what we were showing was essentially
a smooshing of all of the data together.

00:31:46.529 --> 00:31:51.309
It's not unlike looking at that person you were looking
at before from the bottom and taking the whole bottom half

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:54.579
of their body and kind of adding it
up in that it doesn't mean very much.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:58.439
But that's what the green contours
in this, in this image mean.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.740
So I told you that the premise of the meeting
was Viz has failed the scientific community.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:10.339
That's my friends Hans Peter Fitzer who's now employed
at Harvard at the Initiative in Innovative Computing.

00:32:10.339 --> 00:32:14.139
He also was from Mitsubishi Electric research labs.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:19.220
And then here in the audience today, I don't know
where he is, but is Michael Halle whose there

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.720
at that top and then there's, there's me.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:27.680
And so Mike was in the audience when I was
giving a presentation about those challenges.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.210
And he came up to me afterwards
and he said, oh we can help you.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:31.990
No problem.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:35.849
You know we do this all the time in medical imaging.

00:32:35.849 --> 00:32:38.379
And so he and I started collaboration.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.770
And we said, you know alright, well if this is so easy,

00:32:40.769 --> 00:32:45.759
let's just go get an undergraduate
to do a thesis about this.

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:45.819
( Laughter )

00:32:45.819 --> 00:32:46.700
No biggie.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:52.970
Okay? And so there's the, hey the word
unsuspecting was removed from my slide.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:57.269
Okay that used to say unsuspecting undergraduate.

00:32:57.269 --> 00:33:01.430
Her name is Michele Borkin and
she now works at the IIC as well.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:06.980
And so we said, okay, you know there's some formatting
incapabilities and some problems with coordinates

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.460
and well one's astronomy and one's
medicine, but this shouldn't be that hard.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.559
And she did it.

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:18.679
Okay? And the story is a little bit more complicated
than that, but basically the tools that were available

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:24.019
and the software which, which does all
run on standard commodity Mac hardware

00:33:24.019 --> 00:33:27.960
in particular, made this remarkably easy.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:32.769
And so let me just show you some of the
results and what it is that we learned.

00:33:32.769 --> 00:33:38.829
But before I do that, let me just
explain here just a little bit more.

00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:48.509
If you saw the demo before of, of OsiriX,
you'll know why this is not working.

00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:53.950
( Period of silence )

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:57.019
I, I did click several times.

00:33:57.019 --> 00:33:58.509
Okay.

00:33:58.509 --> 00:34:06.660
( Period of silence )

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.240
Okay, guys.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:07.579
( Period of silence )
Alright, well.

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:14.949
We'll show you in just a second.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:18.659
Now you got it.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:30.960
Okay, the trick is to go several slides forward and then
backward in the presentation should this happen to you.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.159
Okay, so anyways.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:37.489
So in medical imaging you're familiar with
the kind of technique where you scan forward

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:39.659
and backward through slices of someone's head.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.309
And because you have a context of
what someone's head and the inside

00:34:43.309 --> 00:34:45.539
of their brain looks like, this will work for you.

00:34:45.539 --> 00:34:51.420
Okay, but if I show you this movie
here, you're going to say what is this?

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:57.740
okay, and what is this is the inside of that star forming
molecular cloud that I showed you and the different slices

00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:01.729
that I'm scrolling through correspond to
different velocities which roughly correspond

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.630
to different distances in three dimensions.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:11.070
Okay, so those three dimensional, sorry those green
contours I showed you are made up of the sum of all

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:15.890
of those bits of dimension at different velocities.

00:35:15.889 --> 00:35:18.579
So if I show you instead this same image that you saw before

00:35:18.579 --> 00:35:24.940
and then I saw you the movie on
top, which isn't on top anymore.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.639
So never mind, use your imagination.

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:37.289
And in these contours, okay, what you would see is
the filling of those contours by the sum okay of all

00:35:37.289 --> 00:35:40.469
of the emission at all of these different velocities.

00:35:40.469 --> 00:35:44.399
And because I wasn't able to show that to
you on the image, you have a better picture

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.380
of how people usually try to analyze this.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:51.160
Okay? And so what they'll do is they'll
look at those kind of movies and they'll try

00:35:51.159 --> 00:35:55.359
to reconstruct structures in three dimensions.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.970
So what did Mike and Michele and our friends at the ICC do?

00:35:58.969 --> 00:36:07.669
Well, using OsiriX and also other software called
3D Slicer, which are both based on ITK and VTK,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:16.510
we were able to take this and turn
it into a three dimensional movie.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:23.150
( Period of silence )

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.630
I saw it work before when we went through the slides.

00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:30.039
Okay, here you go.

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:32.389
So, thank you very much.

00:36:32.389 --> 00:36:40.779
( Applause )
Okay, so that is very much the equivalent of what you
saw in OsiriX before of taking two dimensional data

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:46.530
and making it three dimensional and things like
being able, by the way just in, in keynote,

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.890
okay to take this transparent movie and manipulate it
like this and try and figure out what 2D structures map

00:36:51.889 --> 00:36:54.699
to what 3D structures is incredibly useful to us.

00:36:54.699 --> 00:36:59.009
And things like this big arch of
material that you see here, okay.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.570
Nobody even knew that that was there.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:04.519
People thought that there were two different clouds
at two different distances that weren't connected.

00:37:04.519 --> 00:37:10.630
And this actually changes our interpretation
of how stars form in this region.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:16.150
So just so that I end on a, on a moderate note rather
than making you think that we have this all solved,

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:22.910
I just want to let you know that the kind of size of
dataset that I'm talking about is roughly what Simon

00:37:22.909 --> 00:37:28.619
and Liang were referring to as a really
large medical image at the moment.

00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:33.719
So you're talking about something like 10
to the 8th foxels worth of information.

00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:39.549
However, we have other projects that we're working
on at the IIC right now where the kinds of solutions

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:43.240
that we have philosophically would
work, but technically they won't work.

00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:49.229
So for example we have one project that has to
do with combining electron microscope images,

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:58.820
slices and then tiling them and building up a 3D volume
of wha=t the brain looks like at 5 nanometer resolution.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:06.880
And if you do that for half a millimeter of brain tissue,
half a millimeter cube, you get 10 to 14th voxels, okay?

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.630
A million times more than the data cube is just showed you.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:13.930
And I'm sorry but that doesn't
fit even in 16 gigabytes of RAM.

00:38:13.929 --> 00:38:17.179
So we need to do something more clever,
there's a challenge for all of you.

00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:20.710
And we also need to be very clever
about what you need to see.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:24.599
So what Simon was alluding to also
is that this data explosion means

00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:26.659
that you can't look at all your data anymore.

00:38:26.659 --> 00:38:33.859
And so you have to be very careful about having tools that
let you browse selectively and informed by the knowledge

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.990
of that particular discipline where
you're looking at the data.

00:38:36.989 --> 00:38:40.759
Just for reference, if you took
the half millimeter of brain tissue

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.500
and tried to do the whole brain,
instead you'd get 10 to the 22 foxels.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:53.400
So the last thing I wanted to show you is that we
actually have released the code for the 3D Slicer version

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.180
of astronomical medicine project
and you can go get that online.

00:38:57.179 --> 00:39:04.869
And then to share the results of our work, we've
actually investigated and are now using a technology

00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:13.159
which I'll show you over here where you can actually take
the results and put them in a regular PDF file, okay,

00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:15.559
so this is just Acrobat Reader open right here.

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:19.360
And then what I'm going to do is click in
this figure, which shows you a portion

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.320
of the Perseus molecular cloud conflicts
that I was showing you before.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.400
And then I'm going to be able to do
something pretty cool, okay.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.300
And so, okay, yeah.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:36.880
Okay, so on my machine that shows it to you in
real time and doesn't disappear while it moves.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:44.090
But in any case, you can manipulate this 3D volume
and see if from any direction that you want.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:51.860
And you can also turn off and on particular
layers that you do or don't want to see.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.150
And so that's inside of a paper.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:40:01.280
So somebody can go to say Nature's website and take
the paper version that looks like that and say,

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.780
oh I really wish I could see that cube from the side.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:09.740
And obviously you could do the same thing
with a medical image or a molecular structure.

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:15.919
So I would just like to conclude and thank the large
number of collaborates only some of whom are shown here.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.970
And turn things back over to Simon.

00:40:18.969 --> 00:40:23.279
Thank you.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.010
( Applause )

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.490
>> Thank you.

00:40:28.489 --> 00:40:30.359
( Applause )
We need slides back please.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.809
So that again goes to show that even
presentations are not an exact science.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.639
Sorry. So data visualization.

00:40:45.639 --> 00:40:52.349
The next thing I'd like to talk about is, is the
collaboration and, and networking aspects of science.

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:55.889
And as we've just seen, you know
collaboration is very important to be able

00:40:55.889 --> 00:41:02.129
to help solve these more complex problems as we get sort
of cross pollination of feeding different ideas into,

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:07.450
to how to address a hard problem in one
domain which is solved easily in another.

00:41:07.449 --> 00:41:11.609
And you know it just goes to show that no
one in as expert in everything and so it,

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.940
we really benefit from, from this collaboration.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:22.909
And the other interesting thing is that you know we have
technologies which are you know now second nature for

00:41:22.909 --> 00:41:27.269
for most people even outside the science
realm, in the kazoomo space,

00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:32.380
you know email obviously everybody's you
know wouldn't, couldn't live without.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.320
iChat is pervasive.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:43.730
And with the advent of high speed networks, you know
in, in our lives, allow you know real time disposal of,

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:48.240
of much more rich information and
also allows more powerful tools.

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:53.859
So we have now video iChat and we have
white boarding in 3D and stuff like that.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:42:01.849
So a combination of this, the online central data
repositories, you know this very large databases that are

00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:10.759
in the world now that are sort of focusing, concentrating
the data into one place for wide spread storage

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.230
and sharing throughout, throughout
the disciplines and things

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:18.210
like the virtual observatories, Gen Bank that we saw before.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:24.630
Is creating a whole interesting,
new environment to collaborate with.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.050
And in fact there is some interesting use of tools.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:33.220
So OsiriX for example is using iChat
Theater to share screen images between,

00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:36.589
between collaborating doctors in real time.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:44.410
Now they've done this by using some sort of in the past
anyway, by using some undocumented capabilities in Tiger.

00:42:44.409 --> 00:42:50.099
Which we've now sort of formalized
in Leopard to become iChat Theater.

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:56.929
So we can see sort of the collaboration increasing
people's productivities as they can sort of share the,

00:42:56.929 --> 00:43:00.289
the data that they have with their
colleagues in other places.

00:43:00.289 --> 00:43:08.590
And this really just sort of emphasizes the, the importance
of being able to do complex technical visualization.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:13.860
So what I'd like to do to, to demonstrate
this and to talk about this, this,

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:19.820
this fascinating technology is
to invite Jay Lyerly up onto stage --

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.730
he's the Senior Macintosh developer
from CEI -- to talk about Insight.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:25.590
( Applause )

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:31.410
Here you go.

00:43:31.409 --> 00:43:33.099
>> Thanks.

00:43:33.099 --> 00:43:38.480
Hi, my name is Jay Lyerly and I'm a software developer
for Computational Engineering International.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.599
We're a small software firm located
outside of Raleigh, North Carolina.

00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:44.690
We make a package called Insight.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.369
It's a, this is Insight here.

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:53.889
It's a package for the visualization and
analysis of both scientific and engineering data.

00:43:53.889 --> 00:44:00.480
Here we have a simple model loaded up this is airflow
over some high electronics and heat flow study.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:06.119
And this is the kind of interface you see when you
bring up Insight on your, a laptop or you workstation.

00:44:06.119 --> 00:44:09.989
Insight also supports clusters.

00:44:09.989 --> 00:44:16.069
We do computational clusters where the, the cluster
nodes do number crunching kind of activities.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:27.140
And we do graphics clusters where all the different
cluster nodes take place in, in distributed rendering.

00:44:27.139 --> 00:44:32.319
Here's a snapshot taken from the super
computing conference last fall in Apple's booth.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.050
This is one of our graphics engineers explaining

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:42.300
that behind this wall there are a half dozen Mac pros
working together to, to render this image in parallel.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.480
And the resulting image is, is completely interactive.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.219
You can spin this around, manipulate the model, do
animations just like you would with Insight on your desktop.

00:44:50.219 --> 00:44:58.079
Now in the past computational clusters and display walls
like this were really the domain of our larger customers,

00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:01.699
the national labs, large industrial customers like that.

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:06.250
One thing we're trying to do with the Mac
platform is to bring these high end technologies

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:09.030
to small groups and even individual users.

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:13.980
To that end we use several Apple technologies on the Mac.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.929
First off we have QuickTime components
for our custom video format.

00:45:17.929 --> 00:45:22.049
This allows users to create high quality
engineering animations in Insight

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.590
and then pull those directly into
things like iMovie and Final Cut.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:31.740
We use Apple Script in Bonjour to make
launching Insight in a closer mode easier.

00:45:31.739 --> 00:45:37.629
This makes, this makes setting up a cluster
much more, much simpler and much more dynamic.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:43.550
You can imagine walking into a conference room where
there's the display wall and dynamically connecting that to,

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.539
to that display wall from, from your MacBook.

00:45:47.539 --> 00:45:50.259
64-bit computing is also very important.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.950
In Tiger we ship 64-bit computational core.

00:45:53.949 --> 00:45:58.230
In Leopard we're extending that to
full 64-bit graphics top to bottom.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:59.860
This is really important for our customers.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.140
They are well into this 64-bit memory space.

00:46:03.139 --> 00:46:10.359
And we're really excited to be able to offer that
competitive big memory support on the Mac platform.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.820
Another new feature we're adding
in Leopard is iChat Theater.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:19.269
And it's going to go a long way to help increasef
the usage of Insight as a collaborative tool.

00:46:19.269 --> 00:46:24.769
I'm going to spend the next few minutes talking
about how we've done that integration

00:46:24.769 --> 00:46:27.789
and what that means for our users and how that's going to work.

00:46:27.789 --> 00:46:30.329
So my background is actually in astrophysics.

00:46:30.329 --> 00:46:33.829
And as we saw a few minutes ago, it's a very visual field.

00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:37.849
Also in astrophysics there's a
lot of collaboration going on.

00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:42.789
You can imagine a theoretician developing stellar
models who wants to share that information

00:46:42.789 --> 00:46:47.309
with his observer colleague, who's
usually at a different facility.

00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:51.860
They really need some software to be able
to do that interactively in real time,

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:59.260
where they can discuss what's going on and look at the
model and see how you know orientation or temporal evolution

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:02.320
of that model effects what's going to be observed.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:08.710
And so this is of course important in astrophysics, it's
important in a lot of other fields, these collaboration,

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.690
these type of collaborations come up all the time.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:14.769
And we've recognized that for a while in developing Insight.

00:47:14.769 --> 00:47:19.119
And even gone so far as to put a
collaboration mode into Insight.

00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:22.769
And we've had sort of varying degrees of success with that.

00:47:22.769 --> 00:47:27.420
So the older Insight collaboration
mode, mode works sort of like this.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.130
I bring up my model, I have it loaded into Insight.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:36.190
I would call my collaborator on the phone, tell
them to launch Insight, give them some information

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:39.409
about what machine to connect back
to, and they would make a connection.

00:47:39.409 --> 00:47:47.819
And if all that goes well, everything works and they can
see what I can see, as I you know go ahead and do analysis

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:52.380
on this model, I manipulate the
geometry, they see that in real time.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:57.470
So, so once this is connected and,
and all running it works great.

00:47:57.469 --> 00:48:03.169
But there are several hurdles that are
kinda nontrivial to get to this point.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.740
First off, both I and my colleague have to have Insight.

00:48:06.739 --> 00:48:11.889
So that's really going to limit the pool
of people that I can collaborate with.

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:18.599
Also usually when you want to collaborate in this fashion,
the person's you know not at your, at your location.

00:48:18.599 --> 00:48:19.849
They're somewhere else far away.

00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:24.880
So they're not on your local network, you need
to worry about IP addresses and host names,

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.710
you need to worry about firewalls and port
forwarding to make sure those connections can happen.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.929
You might have to get your network admin involved.

00:48:31.929 --> 00:48:35.690
And so there's, there's a lot of things
to get right to get this to work,

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.010
so it's really kind of a high barrier of entry

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:41.060
So we want to know, we're looking
for a way to make this easier.

00:48:41.059 --> 00:48:46.769
And to make this simple enough that our
users could do it without really worrying

00:48:46.769 --> 00:48:50.509
about how it works and use it on almost an everyday basis.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.390
So of course last year at WWDC, iChat Theater was announced

00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:57.929
and this seemed you know ready
made for what we needed to do.

00:48:57.929 --> 00:49:00.759
So we started looking into that.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:06.800
iChat Theater of course is geared toward Cocoa
applications, Insight is actually an X11 application.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.450
So we implemented this in a, in a helper
application called Insight Theater,

00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:16.829
yeah Insight Theater in itself is just a little Cocoa
app whose job it is to pull our imagery straight

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:19.909
out of Insight and make that available for iChat.

00:49:19.909 --> 00:49:22.529
So this is how it works from an end users perspective.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:26.769
Start in the same place, I've got my model loaded up
in Insight and I want to share that over the Internet.

00:49:26.769 --> 00:49:30.710
This time I'm going to collaborate with my
colleague Amanda whose somewhere out there

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.849
on the Internet with her Macintosh running iChat.

00:49:33.849 --> 00:49:39.650
So I start up my video conference, there's Amanda,
and there I am in the little Insight preview window.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:43.500
And now I'm ready to start the Insight Theater.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.380
So I click in Insight, launch the helper app.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:46.950
It comes up.

00:49:46.949 --> 00:49:48.949
I hit the start theater button.

00:49:48.949 --> 00:49:53.079
And now my Insight preview has gone away and
it's replaced by the content from Insight.

00:49:53.079 --> 00:50:00.029
And from Amanda's point of view, she sees a full iChat
AV window with the same thing I'm looking at in Insight.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:06.780
And of course this is all real time as I manipulate my
model, do analysis, do animation, she's going to see that.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.760
And we have the voice chat going on in the background.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.370
So this is actually pretty easy.

00:50:12.369 --> 00:50:17.889
We just, you know I brought up my model in Insight,
I've started my iChat AV session and in two clicks,

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:22.809
I'm sharing the imagery straight
out of Insight over the Internet

00:50:22.809 --> 00:50:25.969
to my colleague who all I have to have is a Macintosh.

00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:30.929
So this addresses quite a few of the hurdles we saw before.

00:50:30.929 --> 00:50:38.559
Instead of having to have everybody to have Insight to
do this, I just need the other person to have iChat.

00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:46.750
And so if we think back to the astrophysics example where
the theoretician wants to collaborate with the observers,

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:48.630
observers typically don't have tools like Insight.

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:52.010
It is a real high end computational things.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:55.370
So that was a collaboration that wouldn't happen before.

00:50:55.369 --> 00:51:02.609
So now with this technology, its, its made available you
know as a much greater chance that that could happen.

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:07.059
From a developer stand point from wanting to sell
software, this is really great because every time one

00:51:07.059 --> 00:51:11.960
of my customers uses Insight in this way,
they're basically doing a mini commercial for me.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.030
They're doing a tour of my software.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:17.700
They're showing their colleague how they're using Insight

00:51:17.699 --> 00:51:23.480
in a very domain specific way to
do analysis and do useful work.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.199
And so that's really a plus from a developer's perspective.

00:51:28.199 --> 00:51:31.899
From a practical stand point it also
solves all our network problems.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.410
No longer do you have to worry
about IP address and host names,

00:51:34.409 --> 00:51:37.109
you just have to find your buddy
in the buddy list and click on him.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:40.539
You don't have to worry about setting up
firewalls and port forwards just for Insight.

00:51:40.539 --> 00:51:42.739
This is all piggybacked off iChat.

00:51:42.739 --> 00:51:49.359
So if iChat works and you can do video
conferences, then Insight Theater is going to work.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.260
So we're pretty happy with Insight Theater.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:56.000
It's going to ship in the fall with
our release of Insight for Leopard.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.860
That's the full 64-bit Insight.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:06.360
As far as developing, we've been very happy with how
easy it is to, to interface with Insight Theater.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:10.890
I keep joking that it actually took me longer to
make these slides than it did to do the integration.

00:52:10.889 --> 00:52:15.529
So I think it does really going to be a big boon for our users.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:18.630
Its, it's going to be something they're going to find
really useful and they're going to be able to,

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:23.470
to use in their daily workflow to share their
work where they really couldn't do it before.

00:52:23.469 --> 00:52:30.359
And as, as a user I'm hoping to see iChat theater
in lots of other Mac applications this fall.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:37.680
So in closing, feel free to check out our Insight and
our other applications at www dot insight dot com.

00:52:37.679 --> 00:52:38.509
Thanks.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:48.850
( Applause )

00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:57.299
>> So that's collaboration and networking, being able to use
standard sort of consumer based tools and Apple technology

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.960
to be able to do interesting things
with sharing information.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:05.260
So the next thing I'd like to talk
about is class grids and grid computing,

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:08.180
just in case that you know little
super computer that you bought earlier

00:53:08.179 --> 00:53:18.339
on in the presentation didn't quite do
all the computation that you needed.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.370
So we have this really large datasets.

00:53:20.369 --> 00:53:23.529
You know sometimes that it's just too much for one machine.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:28.840
And these, you still need to find the
information that's finding in that data.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.320
You need to mine it.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.100
We have the high speed networks now that
are able to, to connect machines together

00:53:34.099 --> 00:53:38.339
and this is really what's driving large grids.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.170
We have there's a couple of examples
at different types of grids.

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:45.369
You have dedicated grids, you know single
organization building up racks of machines

00:53:45.369 --> 00:53:48.769
to be able to provide the grid as a service.

00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:52.559
But then we also have a number
of people who have noticed that,

00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:56.480
that they have machines sitting
around and not doing anything.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.210
And they can harvest these bare cycles.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:02.000
And some of these are over pretty
wide scale such as setting at home.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.789
And but other things, states Kentucky and Maine,
have also noticed that they have a huge pool

00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:12.869
of machines sitting in their schools doing nothing at night.

00:54:12.869 --> 00:54:17.859
And so they're sort of getting the spare
cycles out of their K12 Macs to be able

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:21.320
to reuse that as part of scientific research.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.400
And the interesting thing about those things that's sitting

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.780
in the classrooms are actually
there now all multicore and 64-bit.

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:34.230
So they are surprisingly powerful machines sitting
there, that they can harvest these, these networks.

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:38.920
Because almost the entire part line of Mac,
all the four quadrants of the MacBook,

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:46.170
MacBook Pro, iMac and the MacPro are all 64-bit.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:51.610
So here are some examples of some, some dedicated clusters.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:54.210
So we have sort of teragrid.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:59.690
This is a 250 teraflop cluster,
30 pedabytes of data storage.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:05.650
It's the world's largest distributed
infrastructure for open science research.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.750
We also have the open science grid.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:16.519
This process around about 15000 jobs a
day, 30 simultaneous jobs during peak hours

00:55:16.519 --> 00:55:19.820
and has over 50 locations in the global grid.

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:26.079
And finally we have the Mac open grid.

00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:32.139
The interesting thing about this
one is that it's a 100 percent max.

00:55:32.139 --> 00:55:38.210
So 500, 500 node machine I believe, 100 percent max.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:43.789
The last one that I'd like to talk about
is the Kentucky Dataseam Initiative.

00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:49.309
And so I'd like to introduce Brian Gupton who's the
CEO over the Kentucky Dataseam Initiative to come

00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:51.679
and talk about how they build their grid.

00:55:51.679 --> 00:55:52.169
( Applause )

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:56.760
Thank you.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.150
>> Thanks.

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.690
( Applause )

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:04.470
Don't worry, Apple didn't design this.

00:56:05.639 --> 00:56:10.559
Good afternoon, I'm, I'm glad to be here
and talk to you about something that,

00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:14.659
that is very dear and special to me, this program.

00:56:14.659 --> 00:56:21.429
And to talk to you a little bit and share about something
that's going on that really special in the state

00:56:21.429 --> 00:56:27.230
of Kentucky that's not only driving research,
but it's changing the future of many lives.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:29.300
It's saving some lives.

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:33.470
And it's almost bringing additional
opportunity and changing perceptions

00:56:33.469 --> 00:56:38.919
and expectation sets for the citizens of Kentucky.

00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:43.279
So what is Kentucky Dataseam Initiative?

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.890
State wide grid computing initiative,
it was founded in 2003.

00:56:47.889 --> 00:56:50.059
We're based in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:56:50.059 --> 00:57:00.170
We have 47 participating school districts that represent
about 250000 of the state's approximately 600000 students.

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:07.510
The regions you see colored there, that's very important
to the grid because these counties in the state

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:18.460
of Kentucky all are coal producing counties
that is counties that, that produce coal.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:27.860
And coal and tobacco are two of our major
industries in the state of Kentucky.

00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:33.920
We take our name from, from that reasoning.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:43.909
We look at seams of data to bring our, our economy
into a 21st century environment where coal fueled much

00:57:43.909 --> 00:57:47.619
of our economy for, for many, many years.

00:57:47.619 --> 00:57:49.250
So why do we do this?

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.909
Well, three things.

00:57:50.909 --> 00:57:53.250
We want to advance commericalizable research.

00:57:53.250 --> 00:58:01.599
That is research that moves from the theoretical to the
practical and has an opportunity to create a product,

00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:08.360
create a job and to expand our
tax base in the state of Kentucky.

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:16.170
We use that commercializable research as an opportunity
to drive educational advancement within the state.

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:22.510
One of the things that we have a tremendous challenge
of in the state of Kentucky is getting our young male

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:26.300
and female students both to pursue careers in the sciences.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:31.820
And, and many times in the state of
Kentucky we are bringing in students from,

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:37.180
from outside the state who utilize
Kentucky based scholarships

00:58:37.179 --> 00:58:40.279
and stipends to do work in our research institutions.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:47.910
And they often go back home or they go and, and form
companies that compete against Kentucky opportunities.

00:58:47.909 --> 00:58:54.699
And that's a challenge for us in the state because we are
wanting to not only create a critical mass of opportunity

00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:59.169
but a critical mass of understanding
why science is important and how science

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:03.820
and education can directly relate to jobs and opportunity.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:11.720
So as I alluded to earlier, we're looking to drive
and diversify our economic development in the state.

00:59:11.719 --> 00:59:20.039
For many years, our tax base completely subsisted of
some degree of manufacturing but also coal and tobacco.

00:59:20.039 --> 00:59:27.259
And so what we had to do in the state was bring in some
enterprise that was reflective of the 21st century eco!nomy.

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:34.060
And as a part of that, the Cabinet for Economic Development
created a department of commercialization and innovation

00:59:34.059 --> 00:59:40.029
to drive knowledge based jobs in the state and
create knowledge based opportunities for the sons

00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:44.570
and daughters of coal miners and, and farmers.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:51.660
And as a part of that, they created a bucks for
brains program to attract researchers to the state.

00:59:51.659 --> 00:59:52.960
And it's been very successful.

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:59.070
And as a part of a study that we did in 2003, we
looked at our researchers as a traditional business.

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:05.950
And we had to continue to give those researchers
infrastructure to allow their research to grow and continue

01:00:05.949 --> 01:00:08.609
to be successful or those researchers were going to leave.

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:12.890
They'd go to another institution just
like you would any traditional business.

01:00:12.889 --> 01:00:19.519
So and even down to for you history
buffs, in looking at economic development.

01:00:19.519 --> 01:00:27.730
That's a, that's a picture of Lyndon Johnson, he
sited his war on poverty right in Appalachia in one

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:32.159
of the counties that were we're working
in which you saw on the map earlier.

01:00:32.159 --> 01:00:38.909
So, if you take anything away about the program,
it can be summed up as kids, cancer, computers.

01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:44.789
We had an existing base of computers in the state of
Kentucky and as a part of this program to continue

01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:50.690
to drive research and opportunity, we were
able to receive funding to build out this grid.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:56.179
So not only are we looking at grid computing as, as
you all well know grid computing is a tremendous way

01:00:56.179 --> 01:00:58.449
to get more out of what you already purchased.

01:00:58.449 --> 01:01:04.639
But we in Kentucky look at grid
computing as a way to anticipate purchase

01:01:04.639 --> 01:01:07.839
of assets to be able to get that win win.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.079
Big difference.

01:01:09.079 --> 01:01:15.659
So as a part of this, this grid, the
data seam, we have 5100 computers.

01:01:15.659 --> 01:01:19.940
It's the largest 100 percent Apple grid
on the planet from what we understand.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:27.250
It's comprised of G4s, G5s, Intel based iMacs and
MacPros, just sitting in the state's environment.

01:01:28.679 --> 01:01:30.230
So what are we doing with it?

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:36.230
We're working with the University of Louisville, the James
Graham Brown Cancer Center, they're part of the bucks

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:39.019
for brains researchers team that we have in the state.

01:01:39.019 --> 01:01:44.599
They also had a proven track record
of being able to create cancer drugs.

01:01:44.599 --> 01:01:49.409
And the challenge we had when we met
with them originally was that they had,

01:01:49.409 --> 01:01:51.579
they had identified eight different targets.

01:01:51.579 --> 01:01:58.039
But because of their internal computing capacity,
they could only work on two at any given time.

01:01:58.039 --> 01:02:04.289
And so we know that that's, that's a
problem for their funding, being able to,

01:02:04.289 --> 01:02:09.909
to generate additional funding dollars, pursue funding
and grant opportunities as well as move those drugs

01:02:09.909 --> 01:02:12.690
and those opportunities onto the next level.

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:17.650
So the University of Louisville is working on
structure based drug design as you well know,

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:24.059
our next generation of cancer therapies
are those that are cancer specific.

01:02:24.059 --> 01:02:25.639
Not toxic side effects.

01:02:25.639 --> 01:02:32.989
The University of Louisville had, as I said earlier, had
a proven track record in those and actually brought one

01:02:32.989 --> 01:02:39.099
through trials that was 67 percent effective in
stage three patients with no toxic side effects.

01:02:39.099 --> 01:02:46.460
So as a part of the infrastructure that we've brought to
this, to the program, that eight targets has been able

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:50.650
to grow to 20 with a more expansive
investigation of each of those targets.

01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:55.180
And we've been able to increase the libraries
that they're investigating those targets

01:02:55.179 --> 01:02:59.940
against from 300000 to over three million libraries.

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:07.860
So the technology that's involved.

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:11.980
Of course, the Mac OS X environment has been key to it.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:18.449
It's been very easy for our researchers to
recompile applications code that they already have

01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:24.949
on their dedicated assets in that
environment to run on our grid.

01:03:24.949 --> 01:03:28.259
And so there's a tremendous cost
savings there because they're not having

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.650
to go out and assume other types of software.

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:35.389
The Xgrid it's built in and we all know about that.

01:03:35.389 --> 01:03:40.529
The Intel architecture has been key for us.

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:45.760
The move to the Intel chip has allowed the machines
that we're putting in the environment to process

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.700
that research much faster and with better results.

01:03:49.699 --> 01:03:55.869
And then of course with the Apple Remote Desktop
application, we're able to remotely manage that grid

01:03:55.869 --> 01:04:01.239
because as you can tell, not only is our
grid remote, but some of those application,

01:04:01.239 --> 01:04:05.619
or some of those environments in
Appalachia are pretty remote too.

01:04:05.619 --> 01:04:13.980
And, and so that application has been very vital to us to be
able to pick up and, and manage the grid at any given point.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.260
So the future.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:22.250
We've talked a little bit about the research,
but it's, it's important to take pause here

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:27.000
and let you understand the educational
aspects of what we're doing.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.000
To let you, to let you know the types of machines
that we're putting in, it was a C change.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.849
It was big difference in Appalachia.

01:04:36.849 --> 01:04:46.380
To let you know some of the computers that we were
replacing were, were IBM value points running OsiriX.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:51.920
Yeah. And, and they were using
these as educational machines.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.670
And we know that that's not reflective of an environment

01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:59.930
that you're going to send a student upon
graduation out into the world, we hope not.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:06.649
And, and so the technology that's coming in
is very new and very key to helping us raise

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.849
that next generation of scientists and researchers.

01:05:09.849 --> 01:05:14.670
And its, and we're seeing things happen in these
school districts where the teachers, the students,

01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:17.130
they're getting excited about these opportunities.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:24.809
They understand the importance of their role
in doing things to change their communities.

01:05:24.809 --> 01:05:30.549
They understand that it's going to take them
creating those opportunities and understanding

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:34.590
and expectation sets that, that they may not be coal miners.

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:37.130
They may not be farmers.

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:40.849
And science is okay for boys and girls.

01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:43.599
And trust me that's a challenge.

01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:50.269
And, and so part of our message is,
is trying to address both genders and,

01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:55.199
and their role in pursuing scientific opportunity.

01:05:55.199 --> 01:05:59.569
So as we move forward with these
computers in the school districts,

01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:04.090
we've got like I said, 5100 machines out there right now.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:09.890
We're going to be putting another two to 3000
machines on the grid by August of this year.

01:06:09.889 --> 01:06:15.980
As a part of the program, we bring scientists
and researchers from our university as well

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:22.659
as teaching professors from our other partnering
institution, Moorhead State University out to the districts

01:06:22.659 --> 01:06:26.429
to talk to the kids about opportunities in science.

01:06:26.429 --> 01:06:32.889
We give the researchers a chance to start developing
that talent, that one day can start filling positions

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:39.440
in their labs and, and start to grow that critical
mass of opportunity and understanding in the state.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:45.389
As a part, as a part of the program,
as I said, we've got new technology

01:06:45.389 --> 01:06:49.250
and it's very different than, than
what the teachers are used to.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:54.690
We, we've trained 1400 teachers statewide in
the better use of technology in the classroom

01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:59.240
and we'll train another 1000 teachers
by the end of the year.

01:06:59.239 --> 01:07:05.879
As a part of the program, we also have scholarships
and are working with the University of Louisville,

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:12.329
their understanding that once you get these kids excited
for science, you have to give them a path to move on out.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:18.069
And so they've put nearly a half a million dollars
together for data seam scholars for students

01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:25.150
that want to pursue careers in math, science and engineering.

01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:32.269
And of course, since this is a little bit different,
we're looking at other opportunities to expand the program

01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:39.710
in states and countries because while we're not, we're not
the only people that are having this type of challenge.

01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:46.119
And, and we're very excited about the types
of, types of things that are going on.

01:07:46.119 --> 01:07:51.659
I want to conclude with two things
to, to let you know what's going on.

01:07:51.659 --> 01:07:56.719
I brought this up here and as I, as I
said before, Apple didn't make this.

01:07:56.719 --> 01:08:00.459
Jonathon Ive had no hand in, in this bucket.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:07.780
To, to illustrate what's going on in the state
of Kentucky, this is a miner's dinner pail.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.950
And this was high technology for
a lot of folks in our state.

01:08:11.949 --> 01:08:13.699
This was the, this was the tried and true.

01:08:13.699 --> 01:08:15.750
This is what they carried to work every day.

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:21.850
In fact, my father carried this one to work every day.

01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:25.420
This is what I carry to work every day.

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.369
It's very exciting.

01:08:26.369 --> 01:08:29.579
And I want to introduce you, the last
thing I want to do is introduce you

01:08:29.579 --> 01:08:31.899
to some folks that are helping make this happen.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:36.000
We've got some folks here in the front
row and I'd like for them to stand up.

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.510
Second row too.

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:50.619
( Applause )

01:08:50.619 --> 01:08:57.809
These folks that are, that we just gave a hand to
are representatives from our states K12 environment.

01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:05.289
And, and on top of everything else that they have to
do in the course of their day, in their normal job,

01:09:05.289 --> 01:09:09.460
they're setting this grid up for
us, they're keeping it going.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:16.060
And they're helping us change opportunities and
prospects and expectations in their school districts.

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:20.520
And they've been tremendous colleagues
and depending on the challenge

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:25.050
of the day they've been pretty good co
conspirators and they've been darn good friends.

01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:30.180
And, and I wanted to thank them and as,
if you get a chance during the week,

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.390
pull them aside because I'm sure they
have more than one story to tell you.

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:36.510
So thank you very much.

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:43.260
( Applause )

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:50.489
>> So that's our coverage of clusters and grid computing
which actually concludes the section of the presentation.

01:09:50.489 --> 01:09:56.699
So basically what we've talked about is that the data
explosion is, is really driving everything in science.

01:09:56.699 --> 01:10:00.909
And the, the neat thing is that
Apple is basically addressing a lot

01:10:00.909 --> 01:10:03.880
of these trends through the data side of things.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:13.239
Being able to both store your, your data on, on commodity
pricing storage, being able to process it simply with,

01:10:13.239 --> 01:10:20.659
with things like the Mac pro, through data visualization
with the commodity screens and the render farms.

01:10:20.659 --> 01:10:23.539
Through collaboration technology there with iChat Theater.

01:10:23.539 --> 01:10:31.069
And then in clusters and grid computing with large amounts
of actually sort of consumer based products being able

01:10:31.069 --> 01:10:34.630
to take advantage of iMacs in, in
clusters, which is pretty amazing.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:45.909
So at this point, I'd like to turn the, the
conversation back to, to Liz who will finish up for us.

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:50.300
( Applause )
>> Great. So before we go, I just wanted to
quickly go over a few things that I wanted

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:53.699
to highlight at the developer conference this week.

01:10:53.699 --> 01:10:58.000
And I think because of the time we're going to be a little
short for Q and A, so I want to just let everybody know

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.640
that the speakers will be up in the science
connection on the third floor after the presentation.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.240
So if you do have questions for
us or want to have a discussion,

01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:09.579
we probably need to get out of the room as soon as I'm done.

01:11:09.579 --> 01:11:13.949
And so just we don't want to cut off your question, but
you'll probably have to do it in the science connection.

01:11:13.949 --> 01:11:15.059
So it's on the third floor.

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:20.680
So the first thing is the scientific development
poster session, how many people here have a poster?

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.780
Right on and those of you that don't why not?

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.399
( Laughter )

01:11:24.399 --> 01:11:25.979
Okay, there's next year.

01:11:25.979 --> 01:11:27.799
We want more next year.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.949
630 tonight on the second floor corridor.

01:11:31.949 --> 01:11:36.279
Please come, there's some fantastic work that's going to
be shown in these posters, they're just beautiful,

01:11:36.279 --> 01:11:40.559
so please come and support the people
who did present posters this year.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.289
We also have community discussion up in the science,

01:11:43.289 --> 01:11:48.800
right across from the science community,
science connection area listed here.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:54.079
Today we talked about collaborative technologies, we have
high performance computing, graphics computing tomorrow.

01:11:54.079 --> 01:11:57.039
And some community discussion on Thursday.

01:11:57.039 --> 01:12:01.560
On Friday there's a very specific, I think
we have this at the end, so let me wait.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.360
Apple design awards are tonight as well.

01:12:04.359 --> 01:12:09.250
And in the science connection, if you have an app that you
want to demo, we have systems up there that you're welcome

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:13.810
to load on to the system and demo for
anyone that's interested in seeing it.

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:17.950
Here's some sessions, I'm just going to skip this,
you guys know what you want to see here hopefully.

01:12:17.949 --> 01:12:21.119
I want to talk for a minute about the display wall at WWDC.

01:12:21.119 --> 01:12:24.779
If you haven't seen this, this is the graphics in media lab.

01:12:24.779 --> 01:12:29.279
We, special thanks to Tungsten Graphics
for an incredible job importing Chromium

01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:32.960
over to Mac OS X, in incredible, I think record time.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.449
Its being shown every morning.

01:12:34.449 --> 01:12:38.329
You can go see it, potentially play with it.

01:12:38.329 --> 01:12:39.800
Every morning this week.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.520
The afternoon we're going to be showing
the cords composer elements.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:49.200
Cords Composer, the application they've built for the
show is now available in your Xcode developer tools.

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:51.630
So that demo app is now in Xcode.

01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:54.350
So it, Cords Composer is the afternoon.

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:58.210
The Tungsten Graphics version of Chromium is in the morning.

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:02.010
On Friday we're also going to have a discussion section

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:07.510
with the Chromium Tungsten Graphics
rather engineers also during lunch time.

01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:09.770
So that'll be our fourth lunch time session on Friday.

01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:12.630
It's not on the calendar, so if you're
interested, make a note of it please.
