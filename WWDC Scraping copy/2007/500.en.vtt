00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.890
>> Thank you, and welcome to the IT State of Union.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.010
Today, I'm going to talk about
trends in IT, and more specifically,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.770
one specific trend, which is the consumerization of IT.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.210
So, what I'm going to do is we're going
to go through four different areas,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.380
and we'll look at how consumer products
have changed the face of IT and the way

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.580
that we work, and we'll start off with storage.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:58.030
So, storage is the growth in storage is not
just limited to back-end service anymore,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.719
and in fact the back-end storage is very expensive,
so this is creating some interesting problems.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.150
Gardener, actually, in a recent survey, said that
93 percent of corporate data is now at the edge.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.190
In addition, corporate data, the data types
that we're using, is becoming consumerized

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.819
as we're introducing more complex kinds of data, the
use of video, complex presentations, and so forth.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.479
So, the data itself is becoming consumerized,
and because all this data is out on the edge,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.079
we now find that work critical and life critical
data is often residing on the same system.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.870
Now, with a large growth of data, easy
access to this data is crucial, and in fact,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.960
we see that your market response time is actually
proportional to the amount of time it takes

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:57.179
to access your data, so therefore accessing the data quickly
is becoming increasingly important for your enterprise.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.860
The other interesting feature that is going on with
storage is that with traditional storage systems,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:12.729
the cost of maintaining those storage systems frequently
exceeds the cost of replacing them, and so the whole picture

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:17.329
around the TCO of your storage system is changing.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.219
Now, this is actually the storage that's being purchased.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.789
This is not the existing storage.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:28.849
So, this is just a graph of the growth of storage,

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.079
and some customers that we see are easily seeing 100
percent growth per year on their storage requirements,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.110
and these are people like, you know,
the video post production, broadcasting,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.820
print and publishing, people who
are dealing with rich media.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.009
Now, the other interesting thing is that costs are
going down, and this is due to people like Apple,

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:57.819
who are introducing consumer or commodity based products
to be able to have a significant decrease in costs,

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.129
and in fact, not only are we driving the costs of
storage, but driving the industries cost of storage

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.199
down because we're using sort of consumer like drives.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.930
Excuse me.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.440
Now, I talked about content.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.310
There are many different data types, and the data that
we're using in storage is getting more and more complex.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.340
We start off with simple email, although that
is even, even that's sort of become richer.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:35.659
We're going from plain text to html kinds of things, words,
photos, podcasts which starts including video and QuickTime,

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.590
Keynote actually is a very rich
medium, so that data type is expanding,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.259
and then high definition movies,
which is the largest of that set.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:51.719
And the interesting thing is that with all this
consumer data size exploding, even the small data,

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:59.000
such as your email, is now carrying a lot of this other
stuff as a payload, so even that is exploding also.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.620
And enterprise data is really following
suit as IT users become more creative

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.879
in the way that they present corporate data.

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:19.480
As an example, we have NFL films, and their network where
they were trying to make all their live footage available

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.569
to their live shows from the various different games
to their live shows immediately as it happened,

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.800
and they had an old infrastructure that just couldn't scale.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.470
And so they installed XN on a 54 terabyte ApplTe
storage system, and they're expecting that to double.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.160
So, we provided a scalable system at a commodity
kind of pricing that made it affordable for them.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.630
In addition, they used the QuickTime formats,
which are available on all platforms,

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:51.839
so they had this ubiquitous format that
they could then distribute their data with,

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:57.929
and for extensibility with Final Cut Pro, the xml project
exchange allowed them to merge things like game stance

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.819
with the media as it was being distributed, and then
make it immediately available to their TV programs.

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.800
So, you can see how this consumer based
technologies, or consumer oriented

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.449
or driven technologies can turn an enterprise solution,
and make it cost effective and rapidly deployable.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.870
So that's storage.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.730
Now, you have all this storage, what do you do with it?

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.210
We need to consume it.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:33.750
And that's what distribution is about.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.629
So, what we're talking about is not publishing, right,

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:42.949
and so today we have multiple different
devices to consume this data.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:52.920
Data is richer and bigger, we've got movies, we have
music, we have photos, and we have to deliver it

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.819
to multiple different devices, whether
that's your iPod, whether it's your computer,

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:06.290
whether it's the large screen TV, and time from
receiving this data to distribution, is shrinking.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.280
You cannot wait and sit and process this data
and sit on it, you have to be able to send it

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.750
out to the people that need to consume it.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.860
And this is true regardless of whether it's a
consumer, or whether it's in your enterprise.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.590
Now, this is an interesting little graph, to show you
what I mean by the explosion of the rich data types,

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:30.349
this is the amount of data that it takes
for a human being to consume in a minute.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:37.000
So, text we have about 1 K, audio is a couple
of megabytes, video, standard video is,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.629
a QuickTime kind of movie is 5
megabytes, a standard definition TV,

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.709
10 megabytes, and high definition TV, 25 megabytes.

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:55.370
So, you can see that as we put greater demands on the
quality of the information that is delivered to us,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.699
we also have a similar problem with the
amount of data that that actually consumes.

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.120
And a good example of this is podcasting.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:14.680
When podcasting was starting in iTunes, we had Car Talk,
or something like Car Talk, which is an audio podcast,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:23.250
and then the initial podcasts and video were sort of like
standard definition and so they were bigger, but not huge,

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:29.649
and now we've seen the trend go towards high definition
podcasts, so we are having to be able to push large amounts

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:34.639
of data, and the trend is always towards a bigger scale.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.840
So, we have this big content distribution problem.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:41.089
We have massive amounts of data.

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:44.509
It has to be in a human consumable format.

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:51.539
People don't want to have large pieces of data,
they want to have information that comes out of it.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:00.860
We have to distribute across large geographic areas because
that's where enterprises are, and we have multiple formats

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.960
because you need to be able to consume it on the
device where you need it, whether it's your iPod,

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:10.159
your computer, and one format just doesn't work, right?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.460
It has to look good everywhere.

00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:15.560
So, someone must have solved this problem.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.870
Well, it just so happens, it's us.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.870
It's Apple.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:29.149
So, in iTunes we believe we've solved a significant
amount of the distribution, content distribution problem.

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:30.439
We have a massive amount of data.

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:32.769
In iTunes we have over 5 million songs.

00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:35.289
We have 350 TV shows.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.789
500 movies.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:44.029
We have an ability to mine this data with
an easy to use interface with iTunes

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:49.079
It allows you to find exactly what you want very quickly.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.520
It's available in 22 languages.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:53.909
We have iTunes stores throughout the world.

00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:59.669
And the interesting thing is we
can support multiple formats.

00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:04.319
With iTunes, when you get a video, you have to know whether
you're going to be watching it on your desktop, your iPod,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.160
Apple TV because you need different
formats for the different destinations.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:17.730
So, we believe we've solved this content
distribution problem, and so we have iTunes U

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.519
which is really solving this content
distribution problem for education.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:29.039
We replace the music content with education content, we
keep the same easy to use interface to be able to navigate

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:32.759
and find the information that you want out of this data.

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:38.769
It's available in the U.S. and Canada, and again,
we have to tailor it, the distribution delivery,

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:46.909
to the media that it's going to be presented on, the various
different formats that you need for desktop, iPod, Apple TV,

00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:55.279
etc. And so it brings me pleasure to invite Adrian
Sannier up here from Arizona State University

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:57.370
to talk about their experiences with iTunes U.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:57.960
( Applause )

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.030
>> Well, thanks very much Simon.

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:03.519
Hey, it's really exciting to be here today.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:08.389
My name is Adrian Sannier, and I'm here
representing Arizona State University.

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:10.360
I'm the University Technology Officer there.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.100
Arizona State University is one of the nation's
largest and fastest growing universities

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.519
with 65,000 students in the Valley of the Sun.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:26.120
Now, with the leadership of our president, Michael
Crow, we're pursuing a new vision for higher education.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.070
A vision founded on increasing excellence, access,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:34.000
and impact that defines a new standard
for what higher education would be.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.730
An education, an educational institution that prides
itself on who it includes, not on who it excludes,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.360
and that judges itself by the quality of its
output, and not just the quality of its input.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.810
Now, this is a pretty healthy mission for us to undertake.

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:59.109
And so what I want to talk to you about today is how
Apple, with iTunes U is helping us to meet that goal.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.930
There was a time when universities were technology leaders.

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:08.459
Now, I know, especially given how exciting today was,
that that time is maybe a little hard to remember,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.340
but I know there are people in this
audience today old enough to recall

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.780
when you didn't get your email address
from Google or Yahoo or Hotmail.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:21.929
The first time you got an email address was when you went
to university and somebody gave you a dot edu address.

00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:30.219
Ethernet. The biggest networks were on campuses,
between the buildings where IT staffs dragged cables

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:35.180
that they had twisted with their
own hands to connect people.

00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:41.269
Some of the earliest self-serve applications were
designed to get students out of registering in the gym,

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:46.889
and also to help them find books
by bringing card catalogs online.

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:55.379
So, that's what our innovation curve has
looked like, but those days are over.

00:11:55.379 --> 00:12:04.799
The accelerating consumerization of high technology is
putting university leadership completely out of reach.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:07.139
Completely and totally out of reach.

00:12:07.139 --> 00:12:13.159
The kinds of innovations that powerhouses like
Apple can do, the scales at which they can work,

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:18.509
dwarf the capacities of universities, and so
we've gone from the front seat to the back seat,

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:22.879
and without a change in strategy, we're very
soon going to find ourselves standing by the side

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:27.639
of the road watching consumer technologies
leading edge disappear into the sunset

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:30.039
with our students riding along with them.

00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:33.319
Because that's where their expectations are being set.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:40.210
And so how is it going to be that a university is
going to be able to match this consumer experience.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.000
Well, we think the answer is to
shift our focus from context to core.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.080
Now, Jeffrey Moore, of Crossing the Chasm
fame, he describes context to core as this.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.500
Core activities are the ones that
distinguish your institution.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:03.299
They're the ones that, in the case of a university, bring
students to our school instead of the University of Arizona.

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:05.929
They're the ones that help our students succeed.

00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:08.679
They're the ones that attract world class faculty.

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:16.279
Beyond that, if an activity doesn't directly correlate to
that, it's context, and yet, and I'll bet there's a few

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:22.149
of you in this room, we spend most of our
effort, most of our time, providing context,

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:27.990
and very little of our time applying world
class solutions to our core problems.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.930
We do this because what was once core, has become context.

00:13:32.929 --> 00:13:37.889
You used to be able to differentiate yourself with
your own internal IT, you can't do it anymore.

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:46.309
And so our only chance is to move our
focus away from context toward our core,

00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:50.899
toward the application of leading edge
consumer technologies, to our core missions,

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:55.939
to make learning more fun, to make
research to do and easier to collaborate on,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.590
we have to spend that time, but
where will our context come from?

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.740
This is the major challenge.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:12.480
Now, our strategy, ASU's new strategy relies
on working with technology leaders like Apple.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.460
It relies on the idea that they will
be able to create infrastructure,

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.440
and deploy that infrastructure at a scale that dwarfs ours.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:27.500
The Economist in the holiday edition last year featured
ASU's technology strategy, and in that article I was quoted

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.570
as saying that working with technology giants
like Apple, these consumer powerhouses,

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:37.800
is like receiving technology from an advanced alien culture.

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:43.740
Now, all of you know what I'm talking about
because whenever you hear about these innovations,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:50.750
I know what it's like to be a developer, and when you
watch the unbelievable power of this, of this enterprise,

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.559
and you see it, oh, you're desperate in the next
18 days to go and write an app for the iPhone.

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:58.959
I know you are, because I am too.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:05.680
But that platform that's being provided is what's so
extraordinary, and there's no better illustration of that

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:16.689
than iTunes U. With iTunes U, ASU has been able to skip the
part where we try to emulate a world class infrastructure.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.960
You know the deal, we get a whole bunch of developers
together, we get a whole bunch of money together,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.759
we have an overly confident reliance on open source
software, we whack and craft for like a year,

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.779
and we have a big demo, and at the end of
the day, people go, hey, that's really great,

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:32.209
that's almost as good as iTunes was last year.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.650
Instead of a pale reflection, we
go right to the head of the class.

00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:42.059
We go all the way onto the big show, using the same
infrastructure that all of our students are already thinking

00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:49.929
about when they think about rich media distribution,
and that means we can focus on its use, on its value,

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:54.469
and so our whole community has a new outlet.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:16:01.410
For example, our administration now has a channel,
using the world class iTunes infrastructure

00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:05.600
to communicate the progress of this experiment
we've got going on down in the desert,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.399
and so everybody who's interested can track what it is
that we're doing in this new American university odyssey

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:14.480
to try to change the face of higher education.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:20.750
We also have an unprecedented opportunity
to reach out to middle school students.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:25.100
These are the students who are making a decision
about whether they can go to school or not,

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.460
and many of them are making the wrong decision.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:33.050
This gives us an opportunity to use the same
infrastructure where they find their music idols,

00:16:33.049 --> 00:16:39.779
where they interact with cinema stars to also interact
with world class educators who can give these kids an idea

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:44.649
of what the world is like, and
what their place could be in it.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:52.620
So, then finally, a deeply integrated
experience for our faculty and students.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:58.669
Totally integrated into our brand, totally
integrated into the flow of our course definition,

00:16:58.669 --> 00:17:05.940
and then delivering podcast content,
lecture material, all sorts of supplements

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.910
that only grow as this rich media expands.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:15.529
All of that through a familiar infrastructure that our
students already come to school knowing how to use.

00:17:15.529 --> 00:17:21.389
So, this idea is extraordinary for us.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.420
It's allowed us to skip the part where we try

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.860
to pretend a world class infrastructure,
and instead focus on what this means.

00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:36.689
We're doing our part, we are focusing on the content,
focusing on training our students and our staff

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:42.370
and our faculty in the use of this stuff,
and deploying networks sufficient to the task

00:17:42.369 --> 00:17:45.939
of distributing this content and making it available.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:54.380
Apple, ASU, and iTunes University, working together
to help redefine what the new American university is.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.590
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Apple
for its help, and turn it back to you, Simon.

00:17:58.589 --> 00:17:59.259
( Applause )

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:08.259
>> Thank you.

00:18:08.259 --> 00:18:09.920
Oh, wrong way.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:13.129
So, thanks.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:20.430
So, this is really just an example of how consumer driven
technology can solve enterprise distribution problems,

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.060
but in a very human friendly way.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:30.600
So now I'd like to move onto presentation, and what I
mean by this is, you know, how do we develop applications

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:36.969
to present the data in a way that is accessible to people?

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:43.799
So, in presentation there are a number of
ways which you can develop your applications.

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:47.879
We can do a traditional desktop
application that we've done many of,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.950
and these are quite incredible applications
that can produce a very rich experience.

00:18:54.369 --> 00:19:01.679
Or more recently there's the web application, the
Yahoos, the You Tubes, that provide a different view

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:10.000
of the application through a browser that would view the
application that's residing on a server somewhere else,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.410
and then more recently still, we've had this sort of
hybrid view, which is where you have a desktop component,

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:24.580
and a web service, and that provides you with things
like, you know, Google, Street View as an example,

00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:31.789
or Colloquy which is an internet chat client which
basically uses a lot of the of the standards, IRC, SILC,

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:36.579
and ICB for Mac OS X, and provides
you with a desktop experience,

00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:42.329
but basically is using web services
as a form of presentation.

00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:50.139
And so if we look at sort of the old web 1 dot oh kinds of
applications, that was really about connecting computers,

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:56.240
and making the information available between
computers, but web dot two dot oh is really

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:02.690
about connecting people, enabling
collaboration between people.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.230
It's all about participation.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:11.720
So, we'll have a little look at the Web 2.0
ecosystem, in particular around participation.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.250
One of the interesting things to note is that of the
non-participants, the 52 percent of these non-participants,

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:24.759
the average age is 50, so clearly,
the future is with the participants.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.990
So, if we then look at the participants
and break that down a little,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.480
we can see they come into various different factions, right.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.779
So, we have the collectors.

00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:44.879
These are basically the people who create
the metadata, they create pages of links,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.920
and thinks like that to be able
to redirect and collect knowledge.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.850
We have the joiners.

00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:55.219
These are people who participate in things
like Facebook, they read and publish blogs,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.880
and interestingly they're the youngest
of all the participators.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:10.610
Then we have the critics, these are people who make comments
on blogs, they post reviews, things of that nature.

00:21:10.609 --> 00:21:14.319
We then have the spectators, a big group of people.

00:21:14.319 --> 00:21:15.559
They're the audience.

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:20.190
They're the people who are actually
consuming this experience.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:25.620
And then finally, of the categorized
group, we have the creators.

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:29.619
These are the people who are actually generating
content, and they're, it's interesting,

00:21:29.619 --> 00:21:36.469
because they're the younger group and they're
pretty evenly split 50-50 male to female,

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:42.370
but the other interesting fact is that
they are twice as likely to be Mac users.

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:48.359
So, Mac users are twice as likely to create
content on the web than any other user.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.470
Now, some of these Web 2.0 apps are actually
dominating their category, even so for example Wikipedia,

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:07.259
the hits outnumber on Wikipedia a more
traditional encyclopedia application like Encarta,

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:10.589
three, almost three and a half thousand to one.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.130
And Web 2.0 is really just exploding, right.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:24.410
It's twelve percent of all the U.S. web activity,
and has an almost 6X growth, 670 percent,

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:28.160
over 6X growth in the last two years alone.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:36.519
If you look at something like YouTube, 18 to 24
are the age group of the most people who view,

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:40.109
and the people who upload are in the age group of 35 to 45.

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:46.659
So, this is the younger end of the spectrum,
so clearly Web 2.0 is the future.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.059
So, for presentation, what are the challenges here?

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:55.419
We have a number of different development models.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:02.380
We're trying to maintain developer productivity, we
want to keep our administration costs under control.

00:23:06.369 --> 00:23:12.809
So, we clearly have traditional desktop applications
providing a great experience we want to leverage the web,

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:17.960
and so hybrids are really a very
interesting direction to go.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.370
Using standards like AJAX, css, and
basically everything that's in WebKit.

00:23:22.369 --> 00:23:27.049
WebKit is a great supporter of
all the Web 2.0 standards.

00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:33.599
Which basically means that WebKit is the target platform,
which actually means that you'd have less testing, right.

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:38.509
You're not writing an application for Windows
and porting it to the Mac or vice versa

00:23:38.509 --> 00:23:41.750
and what do you do about Linux and so forth.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.000
You have WebKit as the platform.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.730
Your deployment is simpler.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.630
It's a patching.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:52.880
You have a web server anyway, and so these
hybrids create a really interesting scenario

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:59.280
where they have a desktop experience
with a web app development ease,

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:05.639
and so this allows you to get greater developer
productivity, and your hosting services already exist.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.750
You already have an Apache server, a MySQL,
more than likely in your enterprise anyway,

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.869
and so you're leveraging your existing infrastructure.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:22.690
So, to talk about hybrid application development, I'd
like to invite Dale Jensen onstage, who's the co-founder

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.660
and Chief Executive Officer of
Ntractive, who will talk about elements.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.540
( Applause )

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:32.940
>> Thank you, Simon.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:40.299
Well, I happen to be here this afternoon to talk about
Elements SBM, a project that's in development at Ntractive.

00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:46.359
Awhile back, my friend Justin came to me with an
idea that he said was for a killer application.

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:53.959
As a long time developer, you know, I'm accustomed to people
coming with ideas they want me to write a program for them,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:25:00.460
and in the end in turns out to be a good idea for them
and a few other people, but this really was a great idea,

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.789
and I'm really happy to be involved with it.

00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:05.170
So, what is it?

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:10.660
Elements SBM, the SBM stands for Small Business Management.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:18.290
Now, I know that doesn't sound very interesting or exciting,
but what we put together, and how we did it really is.

00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:24.740
What we did is we took all of the pieces the
Small Business uses to manage the company,

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:33.029
and all of the data that the small business generates,
the knowledge that's generated, whether it's in sales,

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:41.210
marketing, finance, product development, and we
brought all those together in a real time application.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:47.680
The resulting is that you get consolidated
information flow for real time reactivity.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.539
What does that mean?

00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:55.089
It means that your business, you can make
decisions on it based on what's happening today,

00:25:55.089 --> 00:25:59.959
not based on what's happening on the report
from a month ago that your accountant gave you.

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:04.440
We created a multi use collaborative system.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.920
You set up your employees as users in the system, use
access control lists to give them access to the parts

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.710
that they need, they generate the data, the
data flows together, and you can make decisions,

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.250
and it's available anytime and any place.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.549
Well, when we were working through the scope of this
project, we thought about how are we going to go

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:32.319
about doing this, and again, I'm a Mac developer with about
20 years of programming experience, so my first thought was,

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:36.000
let's do a client server desktop application.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.839
Well, you know, one of the problems of small businesses
is that oftentimes they don't have the infrastructure,

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:47.169
the people, that's required to support a network
application, and as we thought things through,

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.970
we thought, oh, maybe there's another way.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.950
So, we went onto something else.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.450
We thought, how about creating a web application?

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.190
Right out of the gate, that solves
a lot of the problems that we had

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.870
with the desktop application, but
it introduces some new challenges.

00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:06.989
Well, we thought we're up for them,
so we decided to go ahead and do that.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:11.120
We decided to create software as a service.

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:16.019
Now, to be honest with you, software as a
service is becoming kind of an overused buzzword.

00:27:16.019 --> 00:27:21.059
It seems like anybody who takes a database and puts it up
on the internet, and gives you a web page and some fields

00:27:21.059 --> 00:27:26.149
that you type into, and then charges
you for it, is software as a service.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.690
That's kind of boring though.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:32.410
We're Mac guys, we want to do something
exciting and innovative and fun.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.670
So, we approached it from a different angle.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:46.150
We decided that we would create a web application
that looks and feels like a desktop application.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:51.130
That's quite a challenge, because in a
traditional browser, that's not very easy to do.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.870
So, we came up with a hybrid implementation.

00:27:54.869 --> 00:27:57.509
What is that?

00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:02.200
It's a custom browser written in Cocoa, using WebKit.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.970
It's a rich Web 2.0 application
running over the Internet.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.839
Combine the two, and you have Elements.

00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:13.679
And what does that look like?

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.380
It looks like this.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.540
This is Elements SBM.

00:28:16.539 --> 00:28:20.389
Now, you'll note some traditional desktop features.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.170
It's running out of the dock.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:28.580
It has menus, windows, help, preferences, but all of the
content, everything that you see in the windows there,

00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:31.789
is dynamically generated over the internet.

00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:36.250
This is a web application in spite of what it may look like.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.430
It's a hybrid, desktop plus web equals Elements.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.400
We have tight integration with Mac OS X.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.960
By doing this hybrid, we can take advantage
in a web app of features and functionality

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.880
that were previously only available on a desktop.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:59.200
The result is a web app that works, looks,
and feels like a true desktop application.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.330
Present a unified user interface.

00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:07.689
That means there's no scroll bars, no resizing, your
data's not hidden, it's presented to you logically,

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:12.840
there's no web browser, you don't
access this through Safari, or Firefox,

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:15.619
it's all run through the Elements system.

00:29:15.619 --> 00:29:19.969
And that's Elements SBM, it's a
new way to look at your business.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:27.400
What are the advantages to this system for
our target user, the small business person?

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.430
Clearly, the ease of use.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.850
Because of the familiar nature of this
application, you're going to have lower support,

00:29:33.849 --> 00:29:37.559
lower training costs, lower cost of ownership.

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:38.679
It's a complete solution.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.279
Again, we pull pieces form sales and marketing
and calendaring and in out and finance,

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:49.480
and bring them all together, and it's a
web service with all that that entails.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:55.430
It doesn't matter if your employees are generating data
whether they are in Minneapolis, and you're in California,

00:29:55.430 --> 00:30:00.529
you can, within a few seconds, log into the system
and see the current health of your business.

00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:10.750
And it was designed on a Mac, built for the Mac, and
served from a Mac, or a lot of Macs as the case may be.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.930
What about Ntractive?

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.700
What was the benefit to us?

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.799
I can't emphasize enough the benefit
of writing for a single target.

00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:26.960
It doesn't matter if Internet Explorer supports CSS 3,
or if Firefox renders fonts differently than Safari,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.319
we write to one target, WebKit, and
it's universal across the board.

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:35.919
There is no convoluted code, it's all consolidated.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.720
And we have security and control that's
unprecedented in a web application.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.660
There's no forward, backward buttons that
people to use to navigate through the system.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:52.110
They can't open up this bit of the window over here and
resize it, or go into the URL and monkey around with it.

00:30:52.109 --> 00:30:58.339
We have control of an environment, and
the result is a definable, predictable,

00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:02.699
and stable interface in a web application.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.500
How do we build it, what do we put it together with?

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.690
I'll pop up some icons here, some familiar
faces, Xcode, TextWrangler, Transmit,

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.529
the middle line there, that's the core of Elements.

00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:18.240
MySQL on the backend, Apache on the front end,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.569
and Lasso for Lassosoft is the middleware
piece that pulls the two together.

00:31:22.569 --> 00:31:28.299
The business logic is written in Lasso and JavaScript,
and so as you can see there, there's not a lot of tools,

00:31:28.299 --> 00:31:31.859
and there's not a lot of cost associated with that either.

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:33.899
Where do we go from here?

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.710
We're currently finishing up development of the product.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.960
We're expecting a beta later this year.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.660
If you would like more information about Elements,
or would like to sign up to participate in the beta,

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:49.130
you can come to our website at NTeractive
dot com, and we'll be here at Mosconi

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:52.950
in January 2008 for the official launch of the product.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:56.430
So, thank you very much, I'll turn it
back over to Simon, and have a great day.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.810
( Applause )

00:31:56.809 --> 00:32:00.539
>> Thank you.

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:09.940
So, you can see that you can build
beautiful desktop looking apps

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.470
by using web based services, and that's the presentation.

00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:18.950
So, finally, we're going to look at infrastructure.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:24.410
At how consumerization impacts
what we build in infrastructure.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:31.550
So, the problem is that, you know, IT costs
are growing, but slower than requirements.

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:32.389
You know what that means.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:37.460
There's a lot of expectations put on you, and then
they don't give you the money to back them up.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:42.110
So, the solution is really to try and
leverage consumer products, which, you know,

00:32:42.109 --> 00:32:44.849
have a different cost structure to reduce IT costs.

00:32:44.849 --> 00:32:49.959
This is probably a trend that you're all very familiar with.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:57.329
This is the growth of expenditure in IT, so
this is not matching what people are asking you

00:32:57.329 --> 00:33:01.000
to do, so that's really the nub of the problem.

00:33:02.839 --> 00:33:07.539
So, let's look at some of the problems here and
how we can solve these with consumer products.

00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:09.559
So, we're talking about content creation.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:16.289
So, this is basically the information
that you are moving around your company.

00:33:16.289 --> 00:33:20.629
How to manage systems across a
network, remote administration.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:25.770
How to keep software up to date, you know, and how to
make sure that people systems are running smoothly.

00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:29.680
And finally, this is a mobile world,
and is getting more mobile.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.810
We actually sell more and more mobile products
than we do static products, and with the iPhone,

00:33:35.809 --> 00:33:38.139
it's going to become dramatically more mobile.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:47.259
So, this kind of, in our scenario, with wireless networks
being ubiquitous in your environment is very important.

00:33:47.259 --> 00:33:50.029
So, let's start with content creation.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:57.829
So, professional products are available for these
things, but, you know, by and large, they're expensive,

00:33:57.829 --> 00:34:02.789
they're hard to learn, so there's a
training cost element to this, you know,

00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:04.980
and they're not available in the box to go off and buy them.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:10.679
So, you have to purchase them, train
people, and it's time consuming.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:20.519
With products like iWork, with Keynote, and Pages, and
iLife, it's, you know, video, iMovie kinds of editing

00:34:20.519 --> 00:34:28.480
and so forth, you have a lot of the tools available on the
system to allow people to be able to create the content

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:35.179
that they need in the work environment, and the
other advantage is that they're all easy to use.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:39.649
They're designed for people who don't
want to know how to use a computer.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.550
They don't have a huge learning curve.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:50.620
So, this reduces the costs in your infrastructure,
both in terms of purchasing, and in terms of training.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:58.820
For remote administration, excuse me,

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:04.570
so remote administration is really
important, and we have Apple remote desktop.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:14.820
This is a powerful, enterprise critical application, but
we've leveraged Apple's consumer sensitive UI expertise,

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:21.430
which basically means that we can administer
hundreds of machines, but in a very simple fashion,

00:35:21.429 --> 00:35:26.839
because we're very careful about how we
design the control systems in the product

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:33.920
so that it's a product that's simple enough for
teachers to use, for example, in this particular example

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:39.700
of managing ranks of machines which move through classrooms.

00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:46.029
So, there's another example of how consumer
viewpoint is changing the products to reduce costs

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:50.390
because now the teachers can manage the systems.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.460
Self service management.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.619
The solution here is Mac OS X.

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:03.889
The reason that I say that is that Mac OS
10 is a consumer product, fundamentally,

00:36:03.889 --> 00:36:09.879
which means that many administration tasks
are done automatically by the system itself,

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:18.329
and end users can also be self sufficient enough to be
able to do a lot of basic system management themselves.

00:36:18.329 --> 00:36:19.920
Software update for example.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:28.930
It's a very simple program, it's very reliable, there's no
fixing the system after you do it, and as a consequence,

00:36:28.929 --> 00:36:33.899
this frees your IT staff to focus on things
that are more valuable for the business,

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.130
which is the core services behind in the centralized system.

00:36:40.579 --> 00:36:45.759
Finally, wireless network setup.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:51.930
We have Airport Extreme, another product that's designed
for the home, powerful enough for your business,

00:36:51.929 --> 00:36:58.829
and therefore simple to administer, even if you're
administering one or you're administering a hundred,

00:36:58.829 --> 00:37:04.980
because they're designed for people who neither
know about networks or want to know about networks.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.079
So, it's a very simple set up cost.

00:37:09.239 --> 00:37:13.069
Now, what does this do to, for
example, your infrastructure costs,

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.910
in terms of the number of people that
you need to support your business?

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.780
So, this is actually Apple.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.890
We've taken to this to an extreme.

00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:27.609
We have nobody to administer your desktop systems.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:31.170
We're all responsible for administering our own systems,

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:35.430
to keep our software up to date, and
to install packages that we need.

00:37:35.429 --> 00:37:44.500
So, we have moved the IT focus in Apple away from
the desktop, back to the centralized services.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.570
This allows us to do some really
interesting things, which is,

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:51.670
as well as needing fewer people to
do this, we can actually consolidate.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:57.470
You do things like consolidation of fragmented
services, because we're now focusing on the core.

00:37:57.469 --> 00:38:03.669
So, for example, Apple used to have 5 different HR
databases that needed all sorts of maintenance and support.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:11.320
We now have one because instead of updating everybody's
system, we now can focus on adding value to the business.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.870
And so this allows us to reduce costs even more.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.510
So, we've can use consumer products
to reduce costs in multiple ways.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.010
We can get cheaper hardware.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.290
We can reduce training costs by using simpler products.

00:38:29.289 --> 00:38:35.809
We don't have to waste time on administering machines that
are complex to machines, because those machines are simpler.

00:38:35.809 --> 00:38:43.409
We have much more consumer oriented pricing
structures, which is saving money there,

00:38:43.409 --> 00:38:50.639
but also at the same time we get increased productivity,
because the clients can be able to update their systems

00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:54.289
when it's suitable for them, and they can do it themselves.

00:38:54.289 --> 00:38:57.059
There's less down time to them.

00:38:57.059 --> 00:39:02.199
IT is now allowed to focus on the
things that bring value to the business.

00:39:03.269 --> 00:39:11.780
And so we're now using better tools to produce faster
results to make the organization more efficient as a whole.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:17.650
But you know, it's not only Apple,
we have other people doing this too.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:25.079
And so I'd like to introduce Dr. David Aucoin,
who's from VCA to tell us their experiences

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:26.759
of using Apple's products in their business.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.390
( Applause )

00:39:27.389 --> 00:39:28.579
>> Thanks, Simon.

00:39:28.579 --> 00:39:29.059
Appreciate it.

00:39:29.059 --> 00:39:36.989
Hi. I'd like to thank Simon and Apple for both
the invitation and the opportunity to speak

00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:43.469
about a multi year project which we're in the
first phase of between Apple and VCA Antech.

00:39:43.469 --> 00:39:46.289
So, I want to tell you something about our company, VCA.

00:39:46.289 --> 00:39:51.500
Also about our IT problems that occur in
a rapidly growing company such as ours.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.039
The solutions that were provided by Apple
professional services, and then finally,

00:39:56.039 --> 00:40:00.849
why did we choose Apple as an IT
enterprise solution provider.

00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:03.239
So, first, let's just talk about VCA.

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:06.359
Well, we're Veterinary Centers of America.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.990
We are the world's largest provider
of veterinary health care.

00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:12.039
Certainly in the United States.

00:40:12.039 --> 00:40:14.550
We are in fact a growth company.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.280
That is what our foundation is.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.490
Currently at three business units.

00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:22.519
We started our company in 1986 with a single hospital.

00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:28.619
We have grown from a little of 2 million in revenue
in 1986 to this year over 1 billion dollars.

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:37.029
We currently have 12,000 employees, and our hospital
division has now grown to over 400 hospitals in 37 states.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:43.269
This year alone, we will see something
like 6 million unique pet patient visits.

00:40:43.269 --> 00:40:46.969
We also have a laboratory division, Antech Diagnostics.

00:40:46.969 --> 00:40:49.989
Antech Diagnostics, the largest
provider of clinical laboratory

00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:56.959
in the United States has 26,000 diagnostic customers,
veterinary clinics throughout all 50 states,

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.949
and this year we'll process something in the
area of about 300 million laboratory results.

00:41:02.949 --> 00:41:10.559
The new addition to the family has been Sound Technologies,
a hardware and proprietary software imaging provider,

00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:19.049
providing pack solutions for medical imaging,
primarily in ultrasonography, and digital radiography.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:25.550
We currently have about 600 clinics and growing rapidly,
and the disc storage for that alone is a terabyte per month.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:35.570
We are a rapidly growing, heavily datacentric company that
has IT challenges, with the typical IT challenges you find

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:39.300
in all companies that are spread
across a large geographical area.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.250
We do have multiple organizations, multiple configurations.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:51.179
Each of our business units has its own infrastructure,
LAN, WAN, as well as its own operating system and hardware,

00:41:51.179 --> 00:41:57.629
and they function independently, meaning responsible for
their data acquisition, as well as their data distribution,

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.289
and they do a fairly good job about doing that

00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:07.860
It is difficult, though, to scale on these processes without
increasing cost, i.e. we can't leverage the infrastructure.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:14.789
Now, and interestingly enough, although they all do data
acquisition and distribution, the integration component

00:42:14.789 --> 00:42:22.800
of our businesses is really poor, and it's surprising
because VCA Animal Hospitals are consumers of, in fact,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:28.470
the laboratory data, as well as the imaging data, but
the can't in fact integrate to those two business,

00:42:28.469 --> 00:42:33.869
and primarily it's because their acquisition software,
their practice management software was actually built for us

00:42:33.869 --> 00:42:39.190
in the 1970s, and until a few years
ago, was still running on green screens.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:45.389
Now, still running just on terminal emulators, either
on PCs or on Macs, so not only did it lack the tools

00:42:45.389 --> 00:42:51.000
for integration, but even if it did, it
couldn't render graphics, no less multi media.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.059
It was just impossible.

00:42:52.059 --> 00:42:58.940
And then also, each of our hospitals acts as data
islands if you will, responsible for their own systems,

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:04.369
so backup is done by an office manager coming in and putting
in a tape, hopefully she remembered and it backed up.

00:43:04.369 --> 00:43:06.139
Ooh, what if the backup didn't go very well?

00:43:06.139 --> 00:43:08.210
Well, hopefully the system doesn't crash.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:14.579
So, high availability, disaster recovery, not
exactly a part of our infrastructure and game plan.

00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:17.299
So, data acquisition, data distribution,

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:22.539
and data integration were the challenges
that we gave Apple to come back with.

00:43:22.539 --> 00:43:26.670
So, how they addressed those challenges is literally
that for the acquisition they were going to come

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:31.369
up with a new patient management system for
us, and it was important when we told them is

00:43:31.369 --> 00:43:35.109
that we did not want an Apple only proprietary product.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:41.400
We wanted them to bring us industry open standards
so that we were absolutely OS and hardware agnostic.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:47.369
And distribution was one of the coolest things they built
for us, is actually an ability, in almost near real time,

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:50.250
for any synchronous transactional
data transfer back to corps,

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.639
and I'll show you some of the neat things
that that allows us to be able to do.

00:43:53.639 --> 00:43:58.779
And then finally, the integration, by
using just a beautiful acquisition system,

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:05.300
to take advantage of some standard messaging systems such as
web services, that allow us to integrate to our laboratory

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:11.950
and our imaging, and then of course all on
beautiful OS X run hardware with iMacs,

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:18.389
where an average VCA clinic will have
about 15 iMacs in a single Xserve.

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.609
Introducing Woofware.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.800
Yeah, I know.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.580
Woof is our Nasdaq symbol, okay?

00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:34.159
Our CEO has a very weird sense of humor, okay, so
Woofware is in fact a beautiful application brought to you

00:44:34.159 --> 00:44:37.710
by the fellows at Effogen who have
done just a marvelous job.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:44.320
What it is, is primarily an open standard, open
source solution, a Web 2.0 application built

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:53.370
on a high customized Mozilla Gecko engine browser,
customized using Zule and sprinkled very heavily with AJAX,

00:44:53.369 --> 00:45:00.019
so literally the responsiveness is like a client server
desktop application, and not very much like a web, however,

00:45:00.019 --> 00:45:06.650
the web functionality was very important to us, and the
back end, a single Xserve running on the application server

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:13.349
with the container of Tomcat and Jboss as its server
itself, and connecting to the only shrink wrap product

00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:16.909
of our application, which was Sybase's iAnywhere.

00:45:16.909 --> 00:45:22.049
We chose that because as a full relational
database, it also was self-tuning, and self-managing,

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.680
an important part of our criteria for a low IT management.

00:45:26.679 --> 00:45:28.730
So, literally this thing is beautiful.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:33.409
What it does though, with a single point of
failure, with one Xserve in the background,

00:45:33.409 --> 00:45:39.730
is that with the asynchronous transfer, which we do by
using Mule as an enterprise service bus and JMS services.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:46.000
We use a publish and subscribe model, so that all the
data from the hospital is almost replicated at corporate.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.619
If the server fails, the application just points to a
new URL, and the hospital goes on like nothing happened.

00:45:52.619 --> 00:45:58.210
When the local systems come back, the data synchronizes,
and it repoints back to the local system, and second of all,

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:03.990
and a really cool feature, is that every client who
is in fact entered into any of our hospitals anywhere,

00:46:03.989 --> 00:46:10.449
gets published, and then all the subscribers are all other
hospitals, so one patient now is in all the hospitals

00:46:10.449 --> 00:46:16.059
across the country, so if our customer or client
moves from one city to another, across the state,

00:46:16.059 --> 00:46:18.849
or even across the country, and they
go visit another of our hospitals,

00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:23.349
all their patient medical records are there,
and that was accomplished by this thing.

00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:27.900
So, Woofware starts out in the fall.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.780
We're just finishing up phase 1 development now.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:37.720
Goes to pilot later this fall, goes into production late
in 2007, early ?208, and it'll be in southern California

00:46:37.719 --> 00:46:41.699
with our hospitals there, and then we're going
to spread like a virus, which is interesting,

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:49.039
considering it's Mac OS X, across the United States,
literally going into 400, 500 hospitals by the time

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:56.429
that we finish in order to be able to literally get us
on one hardware platform and to really accomplish this.

00:46:56.429 --> 00:47:01.710
Now, why did we choose Apple, and
in our enterprise solution?

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.840
Well, the commercialization of hardware
and software is an interesting thing to us.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:10.450
I mean Mac OS X is a commercialized
product, but it's a perfect platform,

00:47:10.449 --> 00:47:14.759
because people forget that it's a Unix based
operating system, and it has all the features

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.960
and functionality regarding service, reliability,
security that any good Unix system has,

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:27.159
plus the open source technologies that are bundled in with
it, just really let's us use this as a beautiful platform.

00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:33.690
Plus, the active GUI that is available in the
integration of its application allows a training module.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.470
We have 10,000 employees we have
to train on this new platform.

00:47:37.469 --> 00:47:39.579
How are we going to do that an easy way?

00:47:39.579 --> 00:47:45.269
Effogen's created a really new interactive training
tool as incorporation as part of this application,

00:47:45.269 --> 00:47:49.009
utilizing the content creation ability of Apple.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:52.310
So, we can get professional content
without using professionals,

00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:56.929
and leverage the multi media functions within OS X.

00:47:56.929 --> 00:48:01.799
And then finally and not least of
all is the OS X Server technology.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:07.750
At the end of this, we'll be having over 500 servers and
over 5000 iMacs that Pwe're going to have to maintain.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:13.929
Now, the licensing model alone in OS X Server is an
excellent, believe me, we're all about ROI in this business,

00:48:13.929 --> 00:48:19.289
and that's a perfect model for us, but again,
their software, their software update server,

00:48:19.289 --> 00:48:22.989
their desktop management tools, allow
us to be able to literally leverage

00:48:22.989 --> 00:48:26.649
for the first time our IT infrastructure
as we continue to grow.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:29.700
So, I'd like to take, thank you all for listening.

00:48:29.699 --> 00:48:32.799
I'm going to turn back over to Simon, and
hopefully learn more about OS X Server.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.720
( Applause )
>> Thank you, so much.

00:48:40.409 --> 00:48:42.920
That was amazing.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:48.349
Okay, that really sort of sums up what I have
to say for these, on these four subjects.

00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:54.900
What I'd really like to sort of draw attention to
is, is that you know, there's a traditional wisdom

00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:01.730
that enterprise technologies trickle down into consumer
products as the consumer products become more powerful,

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:08.179
but in fact, what we're really seeing in this new world
is that consumer simplicity is really sort of trickling

00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:15.139
up to the enterprise to be able to make the
enterprise problem set a lot easier to manage,

00:49:15.139 --> 00:49:21.279
and there's an example of a product that actually does
this which is a server based product that has taken

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:26.440
in the culture of consumer simplicity,
and that makes a really powerful product.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.440
And so, to talk about Mac OS X Server,
I'd like to ask Greg Burns up on the stage

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.809
to tell you what's coming in Leopard server.

00:49:33.809 --> 00:49:34.320
( Applause )

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:34.780
>> Thank you.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.230
Thanks, Simon.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:45.980
So, I'm going to talk about some of the great new features
that we're introducing in Mac OS X Server for Leopard,

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:51.490
and how we've really made it simple at the core, while
still adding these new features, but first I'd like to talk

00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:57.149
about another product which is Xsan, and today we're
announcing a new release of Xsan which is Xsan 2,

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:04.170
and with Xsan 2 we are introducing several new features.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:06.320
The first is we have greatly improved the administration.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.210
We have a brand new administration app, so again
this is example of keeping simplicity at core,

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:20.280
in addition to Xsan 2 can also manage, optionally, your users
groups and network settings for all the systems on your san,

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.560
so this is great if you have a small san for video
editing, for instance, where you want to set it up

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:30.559
and manage it very easily, you don't want to fiddle with the
networking, open directory, etc. Xsan can do it all for you.

00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:36.469
Of course, you can still work with open directory, all that
functionality is still there, or you can let Xsan manage it.

00:50:36.469 --> 00:50:42.500
We've improved performance, we've optimized the data
layout on disc to improve performance for streaming video,

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.289
and we have several presets that really
optimize performance for different workloads

00:50:46.289 --> 00:50:49.750
so you can get the best performance out of your san.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.710
We also have a new feature called multi san.

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:57.559
If you have multiple controllers on your san, you can
have individual volumes hosted on a particular controller.

00:50:57.559 --> 00:51:02.500
This is really important when you have critical volumes
where you need the reliability, uptime, and performance,

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.690
you can designate them to an individual controller.

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:10.300
And finally, we've integrated Spotlight into
Xsan, so now all the functionality you expect

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:15.650
from Leopard Spotlight works transparently
on Xsan for all your clients on the san,

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.280
to indexing rich text queries, everything just works.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.510
So, that's Xsan 2.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:26.200
It will be shipping this fall, and we
have a seed that's available today.

00:51:26.199 --> 00:51:29.169
This seed is available to Apple developer
connection members and you can check

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:32.280
out the website that will be posted sometime today.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.180
So, Xsan 2.

00:51:34.179 --> 00:51:36.440
So, now, let's get onto Leopard.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.460
So, Leopard Server, we've put a lot of new
features into Leopard Server, and of course,

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.849
again, trying to keep it simple at the core.

00:51:42.849 --> 00:51:46.909
One thing we've done is we've made
Leopard Server much easier to manage.

00:51:46.909 --> 00:51:54.000
We have a new application called server preferences which
is great for managing a server in a small environment,

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.559
and small organization, and also
workgroups within larger organizations.

00:51:58.559 --> 00:52:02.460
This application looks, coincidentally,
a lot like System Preferences.

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:08.840
It lets you manage the users and the services of the server,
and so it's very easy to set up, very easy to manage,

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.539
but if you manage large numbers of Macs, if you're in a
large organization and you're wondering how this would work

00:52:13.539 --> 00:52:16.579
for you, it also lets you set up the server as a workgroup.

00:52:16.579 --> 00:52:21.480
You can still assign account from Open Directory, you
can still integrate and can use the advanced tools

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.090
to monitor the server, so it's
great for setting up workgroups

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:27.340
in a larger organization, as well as small organizations.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:31.710
So, we have really made it a lot
easier to manage Leopard Server.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:38.309
In addition to workgroups, Leopard Server has the power to
scale, so as you've heard, and I'm sure many of you know,

00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:44.719
it's Unix at the core, and we have put a lot of
effort into improving the performance in Leopard.

00:52:44.719 --> 00:52:50.789
We've improved the performance of the kernel in terms of
the process schedule of the kernel, as well as locking,

00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:54.029
and you can see how this translates into server scalability.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:53:00.330
Here's an example of benchmark of AFT, and you can see now
on a quad zeon Xserve that we have linear scaling of AFT,

00:53:00.329 --> 00:53:07.190
and this translates into real end user performance, so
here we have two file server benchmarks, cifs or smb,

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:13.200
and that benchmark just by upgrading the Leopard
server on the same hardware, 42 percent fasteBr,

00:53:13.199 --> 00:53:20.279
and AFP home directory workload benchmark, 73 percent
faster on Leopard Server, just from an upgrade from Tiger.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:27.430
We've got great performance improvements in Leopard Server,
and with Leopard being 64-bit across the whole OS.

00:53:27.429 --> 00:53:32.960
We've taken advantage of that as well, so now
you can leverage the performance from the upside

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:39.500
of addressing larger memory, and we are shipping
Apache, MySQL, and many other services 64-bit native

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.409
in Leopard Server, and there's no downside.

00:53:42.409 --> 00:53:48.230
It's the performance is on par and it enables you
to take advantage of the larger memory spaces.

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:53.670
Leopard Server, in addition to the core, is
built on a lot of open source technologies.

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:57.550
We've taken these many, many technologies and
integrated them tightly into Leopard Server

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:04.030
to provide the core services, and we've made
several updates across the server in this release.

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:05.940
So, the first of these is Mail.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:10.030
With Mail, we've added clustering for
increased performance and scalability.

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:15.220
On the web, in addition to updating the existing
apps that are there, we've added Ruby on Rails,

00:54:15.219 --> 00:54:19.659
Mongrol and Capistrano to make it a
great platform for hosting rails apps.

00:54:19.659 --> 00:54:25.399
We've added iChat Server 2 which does server to
server confederation, so it allows you to chat

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:29.730
with other users on Jabber servers such as Google Talk.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:35.920
With a Spotlight server, you can now search and
have the search queries performed at the server,

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:40.760
and with TimeMachine Leopard Server can serve
as a backup host for TimeMachine clients,

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:47.370
and we can control the TimeMachine settings and policy
with worker manager for all of your Leopard desktops.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:58.190
With Open Directory, we've added radius authentication to
integrate authentication of AirPort Extreme base stations,

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:01.289
and we have a lot of advances is system management,

00:55:01.289 --> 00:55:06.179
but one key one there is we've completely rewritten
the system imaging utility, added automator sport,

00:55:06.179 --> 00:55:10.719
and enabled us to image, added Bootcamp support as well.

00:55:10.719 --> 00:55:15.119
So, we've got a lot of updates there, but
there are a few more I'd like to highlight,

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:19.159
and there are a few innovative services that
we've added that are new in Leopard Server,

00:55:19.159 --> 00:55:22.199
and the first of these is Podcast Producer.

00:55:22.199 --> 00:55:29.639
Podcast Producer lets you capture, process, and deliver
high quality podcasts automatically with Leopard Server.

00:55:29.639 --> 00:55:34.460
We have a new app in the client called Podcast
Capture, lets you capture video or audio.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:39.789
You can also capture screen recordings with audio, which
is great for capturing and turning Keynote presentations

00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:43.769
into podcasts, or you can take a
pre-existing file and submit it.

00:55:43.769 --> 00:55:46.150
This gets uploaded to the server where it's processed.

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:54.380
You can automatically add headers, trailers, layer
on titles, watermark images, you can do transitions,

00:55:54.380 --> 00:56:00.480
and compositions with Quartz Composer, all of this happens
automatically, and then the Podcast is published to the web.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:05.490
You can publish it as podcast, you can stream it, but
most importantly you can also publish it automatically

00:56:05.489 --> 00:56:11.899
to iTunes U, so now in Leopard Server, you can automatically
capture high quality podcasts and publish those

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:20.960
to iTunes U. So, the next feature
we've got going is the iCal server.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:29.950
iCal and iCal Server provide standards based
group calendaring in Leopard and Leopard Server.

00:56:29.949 --> 00:56:36.489
This is open, you're no longer locked into proprietary
system or proprietary client for group calendaring,

00:56:36.489 --> 00:56:39.739
and we've been working with a standard
called CalDav, which is being promoted

00:56:39.739 --> 00:56:41.919
by the CalConnect organization to enable this.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:47.039
This is a great standard that's gaining a lot of traction
for calendaring, and Apple's been working with them

00:56:47.039 --> 00:56:50.610
to help promote this over the last 18 months.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:55.019
And we've been working with them, but it's not
just us, it's also a host of other major companies

00:56:55.019 --> 00:56:58.349
and universities have been working
to really push the standard forward.

00:56:58.349 --> 00:57:04.230
Many of these groups are working on applications
that work with CalConnect and work with CalDav,

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:08.389
and so we see this really taking
off and to encourage it as well,

00:57:08.389 --> 00:57:12.489
we've released the entire source base
for the CalDat server on Mac OS Forge.

00:57:12.489 --> 00:57:17.059
We've released that as open source, and so now in Leopard,

00:57:17.059 --> 00:57:20.779
with Leopard Server group calendaring's
got all the features you'd expect.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:28.600
Full scheduling, free, busy, availability, everything you'd
expect from a group calendar service in Leopard Server.

00:57:28.599 --> 00:57:32.339
And finally the third product I'd
like to highlight is Apple wiki.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:36.940
Apple Wiki is something that we've been
using internally for the past 18 months,

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.450
actually within the team developing
the Leopard Server project.

00:57:40.449 --> 00:57:46.839
We use wikis quite extensively throughout Apple, and this
project is one that has been very beneficial to us as well.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.970
It's a great, high quality wiki
that's included in Leopard Server.

00:57:49.969 --> 00:57:53.089
It's got all the features you would
expect of a modern web app.

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:59.480
Its dynamic page updates, it's got editable
content, no markup language required, and basically,

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:06.530
in addition to editing the text and the pages, obviously
its rich text, so we have images, media, you can include,

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:12.800
embed web widgets, links, you can get
full revision history of your content.

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:17.280
All of the content is searchable, you can
tag all of the content across the wiki,

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.990
you have RSS feeds of all the content
changes across the week,

00:58:20.989 --> 00:58:24.269
and its calendar events are also
integrated into the wiki as well.

00:58:24.269 --> 00:58:28.800
So, that's the Apple wiki, we've been using it
internally, it's been really productive for us in terms

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.580
of unstructured collaboration within the group.

00:58:31.579 --> 00:58:35.880
And in addition, in terms of collaboration,
we have another app called Directory App,

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.190
which ties the directory app in with wiki.

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:44.340
Here you can define workers for collaboration, you can
also define shared contacts and resources that exist

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:49.550
within Open Directory, which are used by
both the wiki and calendaring services.

00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:50.670
So, that's Leopard Server.

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:52.119
We have a lot of new features coming.

00:58:52.119 --> 00:58:57.699
That's also scheduled to ship this fall in October,
and we have another session right after this,

00:58:57.699 --> 00:59:00.429
where we'll be going into a lot more details
and demos, so I hope to see you there.

00:59:00.429 --> 00:59:02.169
Thank you.

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:06.389
( Applause )

00:59:06.389 --> 00:59:09.849
>> Great, thank you.

00:59:09.849 --> 00:59:11.289
Thanks, Greg.

00:59:12.489 --> 00:59:15.329
So, that wiki is an amazing product.

00:59:15.329 --> 00:59:21.079
The Mac OS X Server as a whole, actually
this time is just, will blow you away.

00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:23.090
It has so much innovation in it.

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:25.210
It's an incredible product.

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:32.890
So, to sum up, the consumerization
of IT is not just about cost.

00:59:32.889 --> 00:59:36.069
Clearly there are cost savings,
but that's not the only feature.

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:40.300
It's basically changing how IT gets done.

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:46.740
It allows you to bring sort of human quality of
information to your clients, to your end users,

00:59:46.739 --> 00:59:52.109
and throughout your business, and
basically give a richer experience.

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:53.840
It's also about productivity.

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:59.100
It allows you to get things done faster,
both entirely inside your IT organization,

00:59:59.099 --> 01:00:04.650
and also amongst your organization
as a whole, your business as a whole.

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:06.730
So, that's our talk.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:10.349
I'd like you to enjoy the rest of the conference.

01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:15.889
There are over 30 sessions her0e associated
with IT, whether it's best practices sessions,

01:00:15.889 --> 01:00:21.029
some sessions on system management,
some sessions on deployment.

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:25.490
Importantly, there's over ten labs,
including Mac OS X Leopard Server.

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:27.349
You can meet the engineers.

01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:33.589
There's a four to one ratio of attendees to engineers,
so the chance of you being able to bump into an engineer

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:38.750
and find out the answers to your questions are very
high this year, and there are hands on tutorials,

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:43.780
so you can be able to learn a lot more
about the technologies that we have.
