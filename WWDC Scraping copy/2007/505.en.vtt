WEBVTT

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.589
>> Michael: Good morning.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.280
How are you guys doing today?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.970
Good? Good.

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:24.339
We were a little worried about
competing with the iPhone session.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.370
But we're fine.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.220
We've filled the room.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:30.009
The line's out to the escalator.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.010
That's really good news.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.480
My name is Michael Lopp.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.539
I am the manager of the Management
and Collaboration group here at Apple.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.629
And we're going to talk about Wiki and Group Services today.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.800
That's my name.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.329
I'm going to give you guys a little
bit of history of the Wiki,

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.850
kind of give you a little context about why you need a Wiki.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.890
You're all here so you probably know,
but I'll give you a little bit more data.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.469
Give you some of the challenges surrounding what Wikis that
are out there right now and then what our design goals were

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.820
for the Wiki that we put into Leopard Server.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.609
And really the balance of this session
is going to be demos, demos, demos.

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:11.989
We're going to be showing off all of the hard work that
we've been putting in the Leopard Server for the past year.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.509
And also we're going to give you little bit
more technical details about under the hood.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:24.620
And we're going to do some Q and A. So, a good friend
of mine, constantly says this to me about Wikis -

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.320
that Wikis are for nerds, and being
a nerd I'm okay with that.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.459
But this is not true, and what you'll see
is as we go through the session today is,

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.599
why we developed a Wiki that's really for everyone.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.879
I want to give you guys a little
bit of a history of the Wiki.

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.679
This is a nerd.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.730
He's a very important nerd as well, his
name is Vannevar Bush and in World War II,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:57.730
he was responsible for about two thirds of all
the physicists working for the United States

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.450
and this guy did some pretty amazing
things with the people worked

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:09.080
with him they developed radar, sonar, the atomic bomb.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.200
So they did all these amazing things and
what happened was that at the end

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.659
of the World War II all the physicists they all left.

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.740
They went back to their universities, they went back

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.080
to wherever they were working and
Vannever was kind of bummed out.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.860
Because remember this is pre-internet and what was going

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.210
on when he had all the people together
was they were incredibly productive.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.860
They were developing all these brand new technologies.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.560
All these amazing and not so amazing things.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.979
But what was really neat about it
was they were really productive.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.489
So he wrote this paper called 'As We May Think'.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.540
And what it was as he explained what the advantage was of
having all these bright people together, working together,

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:52.429
sharing ideas when Bob wants to know something for
electrical engineering, he could send Bob over to the guy

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.849
who was a preeminent electrical
engineer over here in another building.

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:03.189
So it was really interesting to see what he talked about
in this 'As You May Think' paper, which I have right here.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.280
It's a great paper.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.719
There's a quote in here, it says - A record if it
is useful to science must be continuously extended,

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.680
it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.590
This paper defines a lot of what the
Internet is and what the Wiki is.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.610
And what he talked about was this thing called the memex.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.630
And what the memex was this desk.

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.409
And it was full of microfilm.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.889
Because he didn't have the Internet.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:37.819
And this microfilm through some weird,
bizarre mechanical way to organize it was,

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.180
gave a lot of different access to
a lot of different information.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.719
There's a huge amount of information inside of this desk.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.020
But also what it allowed him to do, it allowed him
to associate different pieces of information to you -

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:55.070
document A and document B. So whatever he was doing was
just he was really bummed about the lack of collaboration.

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.769
This paper influenced a lot of different people.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.280
Anybody remember Hypercard?

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:12.169
This is a Bill Atkinson's work and this without
the internet was based off what the memex was.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.509
The ability to associate information.

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.170
Associate information.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.939
I've got information piece A, information piece B,
if I put them together they're actually bigger than A

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:27.699
and B. Hypercard also influenced a little
thing called the Wiki, by the Ward Cunningham.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.060
This is the bus in Oahu, called the wiki, wiki, wiki.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.189
Which someone told me means quick.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:41.060
Again this was based on the idea of being able
to easily edit, and associate information.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.220
So, let's get to know you guys a little bit.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.630
How many of you have been to Wikipedia?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.590
Shocking. Alright, see if we can get harder here.

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:53.799
How many have used a Wiki?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.579
Actually edited information inside a Wiki?

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:57.789
Little bit less.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.830
Okay. How many of you have actually installed a Wiki?

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:05.149
Okay, it's an IT crowd.

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:11.469
Okay. How many of you think Twitter is totally useless?

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.810
Oh. How many of you love Twitter?

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.740
Ah, can't really...

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.449
Okay, so pro-wiki, ambivalent on Twitter.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.240
Got it. Okay.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.629
So welcome to the knowledge party.

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.219
What we are going to be doing here is talking about
all the different applications that we had as part

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.180
of Mac OS X server, and I want to talk a little about some
of the applications we have right now, and what we think is,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.560
these are great applications, but we think is
something that is actually missing from these.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.870
So Spotlight, iChat, Mail, iCal and Safari.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.230
These are great applications but there's
something missing from this picture.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.140
And if you were in my session yesterday, you'll
know what it is, but I'll still explain it.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:54.829
What's missing from here is all of these applications which
are great, are actually communications between you and me.

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:58.729
Right? I send a mail to James, James sends a mail to me.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.490
It's a great thing.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.490
We have mail.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.340
But the problem is that this information that
we're sharing is just between James and I.

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.549
Or iChat between me and Wendy is actually
just now chatting between the two of us.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.050
And that information in business
actually could be useful to someone else.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.670
So what's missing from this picture
is one to many communication.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:25.069
Information which is shared with everyone and Vannevar
Bush tells us that maybe a wiki is a good idea for that.

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:31.050
The reason that we're seeing a lot of
wikis around here, is the more idea,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.660
the more eyeballs that serve an idea, the better it gets.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.730
This is collaboration.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.960
This is brainstorming.

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:44.000
Collaboration increases the value of
information and the reason we know

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.360
that wikis are valuable is every group at Apple has a wiki.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.290
Every group has them.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.830
They are created because people want to share
information they want it to be more valuable.

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:58.050
There are some challenges to wiki.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.710
The first challenge is we have the same problem
as the Internets of 5 or 10 years ago, which are -

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:07.759
wikis are this place where good information goes to die.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.189
So how does information die?

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:17.889
Well, it's posted and it's only useful
if people actually know that it's there.

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:19.430
Then only, if they can find it.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.110
If they don't what happens is, it becomes out of date.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:30.540
And loses credibility and then there's no incentive to
return and it's just another stale page on the Internet.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.460
This is a vicious lack of collaboration
cycle is what I'd like to think about it.

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:40.989
The other problem we have with
wikis is rampant, rampant nerdering.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.829
I'm a fan, but we've got to make wikis for everybody.

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:49.709
So, the problem is, or the best
example I can think of this is -

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:54.310
which of the two pieces of content would you want to edit?

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.209
There's number one here.

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:59.409
I looked at this as an engineer, I go, Uhh...

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.110
this is parsable, I can totally parse this.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.290
It's really easy.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.490
But what I really want, somewhat back.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.210
Right? This is the problem with wikis.

00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:14.439
A lot of the syntax is really confusing and
editing it is a sort of text based experience

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:18.040
and what you want is a rich experience for you content.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:24.050
So, rampant nerdering and wikis
is that syntax could be troubling.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.939
This is...

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:30.209
collaboration is just a space of
screaming for great interaction design.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:33.990
Whether it's the organization of
information or the association

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.769
of different pieces of information or the editing.

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:37.149
And you've seen our demos here.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.659
How we've innovated there.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.519
Wikis also have another feature which is version control.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:44.039
I don't want to lose my information ever.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.089
This is why we're doing time machine.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.980
And with a lot of people checking
in different pieces of information,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.940
we have this great technology called version
control that keeps all the information around,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.390
but normal human beings don't actually
know what a version control is.

00:08:55.389 --> 00:09:00.769
We have a lot of different challenges to take this
great technology and make it applicable to everybody.

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:04.710
Wikis were designed for the Internet, which is a good thing.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:11.290
But they weren't designed necessarily
for IT or for business or for schools.

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:17.669
We want to make a Wiki that is really friendly to IT
friendly to the end user and we want it to integrate

00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:20.019
with your existing infrastructure
and your existing investment

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:22.509
for your access controls or what, everything else.

00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:29.100
So, all of these challenges give
us an opportunity to innovate

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.170
and fortunately I know just the company
that can actually do this and that's us.

00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:39.769
So what we've done is we've created a product
called Wiki Appple Wiki and a group services.

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:42.289
This is a set of integrated services.

00:09:42.289 --> 00:09:47.809
Now first off we have an application called directory.app
which allows you to call for applicationships

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:51.039
as part of the OS and as part of the server.

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:55.419
This allows you to create groups,
edit, create groups, create Wikis.

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:57.610
Its also an amazing directory viewer.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:06.389
Wiki is also a set of different services that we've included
and integrated that's Wiki as well as blog and podcast.

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:07.230
Calendaring.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.340
Web based calendar for the groups,
mailing lists and across all

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.080
of these integrated services we've got tags we've
got RSS search and directory and you'll see this all

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.280
into the demos we're going to be doing for you guys.

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:23.879
Our design goals were it's that we want to
make it easy to manage, we want to make it easy

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:29.360
to contribute, edit, and organize for everyone.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.590
Everybody should be able to contribute to the conversation.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.980
It should, we want to keep the
bar as low as possible in terms

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.850
of adding new information, which
means it's gotta just sing.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.690
We want to make it easy to customize, extend,
and integrate against the wiki as well.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.650
So easy to manage is wikis that
are developed for the work group.

00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:52.769
We love Wikipedia and you love Wikipedia, but again
we are designing it for a smaller group of people.

00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:59.509
We scale and perform phenomenally but we
also are designing for a smaller population.

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:05.740
Again, we want to create, we can only make it easy
for anyone to create these and to relieve IT burden.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.710
It shouldn't be a phone call to IT
to get involved in creating a Wiki

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.180
and again integrating with existing infrastructure.

00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:18.909
Easy for everyone to contribute, edit, and organize.

00:11:18.909 --> 00:11:21.759
WISYWYG? One would have that as we saw.

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:24.279
We want to give people reasons to come back.

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:27.559
We want them, remind them that there's
great information inside of this wiki.

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:30.289
We want to make it easy on the eyes.

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:34.559
We've got some great themes that you'll be seeing
here that are applied to the all the different sort

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:36.699
of businesses that we are expecting to use the wiki.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:43.340
Tags as a means of organization which we'll see
in the demo, search, and again RSS everywhere.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:48.399
And again customization, integration, and extension we'll
be talking about some standards here in a little bit

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:54.289
about how we can actually, and you guys can actually develop
themes, third party authentication, as well as XML-RPC.

00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:57.250
Again we are going to go into all
of these as part of the demos.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.190
So let's start with, Where's Chris?

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.650
Let's start with easy to manage.

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:05.779
So what we've done here, we've done here is
we've created three scenarios, Where is Chris?

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:07.189
He's coming, okay.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.900
Three scenarios, we've tried to
pick three different companies

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:12.090
that we think are going to be actually using the Wiki.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:19.950
The first one is an ad agency and we are going to talk
about ease of setup, our integrated services, basic WYSIWYG

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:25.259
and the themes and I would like to bring for the demo,
first demo of three Chris LeCroy who is an Engineering Manager

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:27.759
for the collaboration team to give us a demo.

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:29.220
Chris?

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:39.769
>> Chris: Alright, so Michael mentioned that we've added the
grid, okay now I want to show you how easy wiki art of setup

00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:45.090
and then we've got a bunch of other demos coming
up after that so we'll dig into more detail.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.960
So, as Michael mentioned, we've got a scenario
where we are an ad agency and we do...

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.259
I'm sorry?

00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:53.000
>> Michael: No, no on video there Chris.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.840
That's old school.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.600
There you go.

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:04.189
That's good.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:13.360
>> Chris: See Mr. AV man.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:24.480
Okay, if you look guys want to
come and gather around the machine.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.850
Okay?

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.250
>> Michael: Say again.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.399
>> Chris: Hey no problems.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:31.669
>> Michael: There we go.

00:13:31.669 --> 00:13:31.860
Oh.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.930
>> Chris: Should this computer be on?

00:13:37.929 --> 00:13:40.479
>> Michael: Yes it should be on.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.620
Not yet.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.879
>> Chris: Let me try.

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:51.850
Display is preference.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.590
>> Michael: It's coming up there.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.120
>> Chris: Oh, there we go.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.779
>> Michael: We're good, perfect.

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:00.899
Okay so this is system preference, okay.

00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:05.240
>> Chris: Okay so what were we talking about?

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.710
Anyway, let me show you how easy it is to set up a Wiki.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:13.120
So creating Wiki starts off at a new application
that lives on your client installed called directory

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.190
and it's a directory browser so I am browsing
through the LDAP directory of an organization,

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:25.350
but I'm not the system administrator I am just a normal
person at the company the IT department has made it possible

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:34.529
for me to create Wikis so go down to the plus menu into a
new group and if I said the ad agency here works primarily

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:39.019
with pharmaceutical companies so what they do is they create
Wikis for each of their ad campaigns and so I am going

00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:48.079
to create it, I've got a new campaign for a drug called
Randsien. It's a drug that apparently helps with NADD,

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:54.070
Inside joke for those of you who have no idea what I am
talking about, go buy "Managing Humans" at Amazon.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:15:02.750
So I am going to put the title of the
group in, give it just a quick description.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:10.269
If I wanted to, I could add a picture to the group got
some access control on whether other people are not allowed

00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:12.319
to see the group where they are allowed to add themselves.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:19.260
I would like to make this one that people can add themselves
to so that I don't have to as the owner, we're gonna add some people,

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:27.409
to the group just drag them over, so I've now got a
group, I've got some members and I am going to pop

00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:33.329
over to the services tab, or a panel of the group
and you'll see they've got some services here first

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:41.520
of all mailing list, wiki and web blog, web calendar, and
the mailing list archive, and I'm going to enable all of those

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:46.289
and as Michael mentioned we provide lots of access
control so I can define who is allowed to see this things

00:15:46.289 --> 00:15:53.299
who is allowed to write to them, I'm going to say that
I'd like anyone to be able to see this Wiki and I'm going

00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:57.129
to say only group members are able to
write to this Wiki and to this blog.

00:15:57.129 --> 00:16:05.000
So once I'm done with that I click save and I
now as a non-IT person have created a full wiki

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:16.250
for the Randsien ad campaign so let me click on the wiki
link and you'll see I've got a brand new Wiki there

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.639
with a very basic theme and let me show you
a little bit about the WISYWYG editing here,

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:26.470
but actually before we do that, so you'll see I've got a
Wiki, I've got a blog configured, I've got mailing list,

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.700
web archive configured, and the calendar, let me go
over to the calendar and show you a little bit of that.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:38.710
I have written a very nice AJAX calendar so I'm going
to create a, I have to log in because as I mentioned,

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:53.000
this writing is only allowed by group members so I am going
to create a staff meeting, whoops, at 7 a.m. because that's

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.830
when I prefer to have my staff meetings as you can
see I can move them around very easily and the other thing

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:14.910
about this is it's very dynamic and very AJAX driven
so if John decided, if he wanted to move a meeting around

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:23.240
or add a meeting to watch, and you just move,
he wants it later, I just still want it earlier,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:29.349
anyway so you can, it's a new video game we've invented called Dueling Colleagues

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:37.589
so better, let's just forget about this, I'll delete
the event and it goes up in a poof of smoke, it's very cool.

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:43.209
Let me show you a little bit of the Wiki though, I am
going to show you some of the, the WISYWYG editing,

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:53.000
so I will click on the new page button here and
I'm going to entitle my page Randsien description

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.099
and I've got a new page, it's got some placeholder text.

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:10.689
I'm going to copy some text out of another document that
has completely the wrong drug band, but that's okay,

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:17.490
you'll notice that all the text formatting remained
intact, I can change text formatting, maybe highlight,

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.880
make this one red, I can make this
paragraph italic, sort of thing.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:31.350
If you look at the toolbar, we've got the ability to do,
change from the paragraph styles, the, we can do bullets

00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:37.939
and indenting, lots of text formatting,
links, which John will show you later,

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.850
and we've got a table editor and some other attachments.

00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:44.980
I am going to, we also allow you to add attachments
onto pages and so I am going to show you what it is

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:54.339
like to add an image by clicking insert media and I'm going
to choose a file from my desktop and I've got a picture

00:18:54.339 --> 00:19:03.529
of some pills that I will insert click upload it uploads
to the page, I can drag this image around if I want to

00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:10.470
or change the alignment on it, click save or
actually no I want to show you there is a little bit

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.259
of nerdering we have left in here, so if you do want to view
things in markup link which we do have in HTML normally,

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:17.279
I mean you can go in and edit the HTML directly.

00:19:17.279 --> 00:19:21.529
That allows you to do things that we just don't
allow you to do in the WISYWYG portion so...

00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:23.470
so you can still kind of get your nerd on that.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:28.730
And so I've done that and I've got a beautiful Wiki page.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:36.079
And the next thing I wanted to show, for this
is a very basic theme kind of a default theme,

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:40.789
I want to show you some pages from other wikis that
have been created with some of our shipping themes

00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:48.779
for some other drugs so got a drug named Oestan
and nice red theme and in this case we've not,

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:59.119
the creator of this wiki changed the picture to have some red
pills on it, got a drug called Emessen, a very basic theme,

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:09.279
less real estate, a drug called Ipodiclone
nice green kind of library scientific-looking theme.

00:20:09.279 --> 00:20:21.190
And one last one called Zunesta, which is a
sleeping pill and it's very orange French fries

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.029
or maybe they are popsicle sticks I am not sure.

00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:25.430
There were a few that the themes we are shipping.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:30.430
I think that we ship with like 18 themes and some
plus you can actually edit and create your own themes,

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.810
so that's all I've got and then I'm going to get off stage

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:35.599
and then we've got some other demos
going into more depth after I'm done.

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:36.549
Thanks.

00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:38.250
>> Michael: Thank you Chris.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:48.610
So I call it WISYWYG within reasons, so you saw
that we've got WISYWYG but the idea here is,

00:20:48.609 --> 00:20:53.509
is not every piece of thing that you can
change in HTML it's a very reduced set

00:20:53.509 --> 00:20:57.230
so you don't end up with like content chaos on your wiki.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.470
One page kind of looks like the other but
again you can theme it and you can really.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.829
And you saw you can actually edit the raw theme
on HTML so you can go as crazy as you want.

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:11.980
Okay, so contribute, edit, organize for everyone this
is an all new demo that we didn't show you yesterday.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.849
This is a company, we are going to show, we are going to
bring John Anderson up here, he is going to talk a little

00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:21.980
about how to organize content with a Wiki, we are going
to get a little bit more advanced with our WISYWYG

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.700
and we're going to do some content kung fu.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.539
We are going to show you instant image
galleries and also the collaboration features.

00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:34.170
The thing to remember about the Wiki is that any given
time there is a bunch of other people editing content,

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.550
which is an interesting interaction problem
and John is going to talk about that.

00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:39.639
John is a member of the engineering team as well.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.060
Come on up John.

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:47.240
( Applause )

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.940
>> John: Thank you Rance.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:54.250
He offered us free drinks if we
worked that into a sentence somewhere.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.490
So as Michael mentioned, wikis are a
place where good information goes to die.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:03.529
And there are several things that we
can do to prevent that from happening.

00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:08.129
And there are essentially two ways that
people are organizing the pages on sites.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:13.040
One of them is a hierarchical system
which as you know, where you have the sort

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:15.639
of JavaScript menus that pop out, and stuff like that.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.660
The big problem with that is that it doesn't
really lend itself well to collaboration.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:27.060
You have a kind of one person that is essentially assigning
things to a folder and things could be within one folder.

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:28.509
So that's kind of a mess.

00:22:28.509 --> 00:22:33.609
But on the other hand if you look at
tags and you look at how that works.

00:22:33.609 --> 00:22:36.569
There's a lot of proven cases where it works extremely well.

00:22:36.569 --> 00:22:37.970
del.icio.us, Flickr, and Gmail.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.430
Gmail of course calls them labels but same difference.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:48.480
But they are a great way to organize huge amounts of
information that are free flowing and edited by many people.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.059
So we've gone with tags as a way of organizing things.

00:22:52.059 --> 00:22:56.419
And you'll see that in several
cases when we go through this demo.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.130
So the first thing we're going to
do is go to a knowledgebase wiki.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.250
So this is a company called PharmKnowledge.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.740
They manage a wiki server that's
basically a knowledgebase of drugs.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:12.000
And first thing I am going to do is go into the Oestan page.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.910
So we've mentioned this earlier as
a page that's already been edited.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.470
Okay so. Pay no attention to the man behind
the curtain here as I delete some stuff here.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.690
Okay, here we go.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.380
So, I have some changes to make here, on this page.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:38.080
One of them hass already made here, withdrawal
symptoms include sweating, psychosis and stuttering.

00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:39.899
You can see that here.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:47.530
And so the first thing I'm going
to do is attach a file to this.

00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:53.730
Now one of my personal pet peeves with the web and
with wikis is this sort of unexpected download.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.839
So you think about this and you think about the
fact that, you know, you click on some link here,

00:23:57.839 --> 00:24:03.750
you're expecting a page and all of a sudden you have some
little present on your desktop that you have to go and find.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.029
And so we work around this pretty cleverly.

00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:10.660
And you'll see that here, so I'm going
to go ahead and attach a file here.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.670
And I'm going to pick a PDF, about Oestan.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:25.940
And what it's going to do here, it's actually going
to composite together an image that links to it.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.700
So you see it is actually taking a finer icon of the image

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.980
and composited the graphic together
with analog download icon.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.289
Looks really nice.

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:37.309
I am going to go ahead and get rid of that, because
I'm not really concerned with that right now,

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:40.649
but the big thing that we want to do here is a movie.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.370
So, if any of you use QuickTime Publisher,
you know that you can kind of use

00:24:44.369 --> 00:24:47.639
that to put images online, or movies
online, make them on the web.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.290
That's great.

00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:53.659
That's something you can actually do straight
from the wiki so you can insert this media.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.269
We'll go ahead a pick a movie.

00:24:57.289 --> 00:25:02.569
And what this is going to do is grab the poster image from
the movie and include that as a thumbnail for the movie

00:25:02.569 --> 00:25:07.079
and then link it to an embed tag for the movie as well.

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:11.609
So I'm going to go ahead and save this.

00:25:11.609 --> 00:25:14.689
Unfortunately the poster image for
this is the first frame so it's black.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:23.570
But we'll go ahead and click on this
and you can see the movie playing.

00:25:23.569 --> 00:25:25.759
( Laughter )

00:25:25.759 --> 00:25:36.170
We had to work it into another
presentation somewhere, you know.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:41.490
( Laughter )

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:47.250
So of course another thing that
makes pages distinct on the wiki

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.799
versus you know, just a word processing page is linking.

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:55.470
I mean, essentially that's at the heart of linking.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:01.000
And like you said, this page has already been edited so
I'm just going to go ahead and unlink some stuff here just

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.700
to get us back to the starting point here.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:14.559
Oops. And so the first thing we want to link
is we are going to link to an existing page.

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:19.079
Now if any of you have used a wiki you know
that there's two different ways you can link.

00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:26.009
A markup or there's something called CamelCase
or StudlyCaps, where you are linking to something

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:27.750
which is like a bunch of words jammed together.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.789
And you have to know what the name of the page is,

00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:34.369
you have to know where it is beforehand,
which is not usually the case.

00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:37.439
So in this case what I'm going to
do is link to an existing page.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.500
I know there's a page on here about Allegra,
so I'm going to go ahead and click on that.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.759
So you see that any pages that I have visited
recently will show up automatically in that,

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:49.049
so I could just click on Allegra here but
I'm going to go ahead and do a search.

00:26:49.049 --> 00:26:53.440
And we'll see that it automatically populates
with this and here's Allegra right here

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.430
and so I can click on that and it's linked.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.590
Piece of cake.

00:26:56.589 --> 00:27:02.259
( Applause )

00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:07.490
Next thing I'm going to do that's important in wikis
as well, is you want to continue working on your page,

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.509
but you know you're going to write other
pages that are related to this one.

00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:11.519
So you're going to write this.

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:15.970
You're going to keep writing this page, you know
like I'm going to make a page on such and such later.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.019
And that's easy to do in here as well.

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:20.680
Again no CamelCase, no anything like that.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.799
All I have to do is, let's see...

00:27:23.799 --> 00:27:26.480
So I'm going to make one which says, take your doses.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.180
Weird name for a page but whatever.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.240
And I'm going to click here and say new page.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.880
You've seen this yesterday in the demo.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.690
It just comes up with automatically populated, hit create.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.970
And you notice up here in the right
hand corner it says page created.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:44.259
So its gone off in the background and made the page
and linked to it and that's all you have to do.

00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:45.680
So I'm going to go ahead and save here.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.560
So this page is saved.

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:50.960
It's got everything on it.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.090
So let's go ahead and go to our
new page that was just created.

00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:59.279
And I'm going to show you a really
cool feature something that...

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:08.740
show you a really cool feature something that we've just
added in the most recent beta and this is really neat.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.410
So what happens in the earlier is of course,
within Apple we're starting to live on that,

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.620
starting to use this in exchange for the
media wiki use mod stuff that we've got.

00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:24.629
And somebody actually approached me and said, I've
got 15 images to upload and on the web that's a pain.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:29.670
And if any of you have used Flickr, anything like
that to upload these images from the web it is a pain.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.310
Upload images.

00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:31.470
You have to pick a file, upload it.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.809
Pick a file upload it.

00:28:32.809 --> 00:28:34.639
So we've added a really neat feature here.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.860
Which is something that basically
allows you to take a bunch of images

00:28:38.859 --> 00:28:41.369
and make a zip file of them and upload them all at once.

00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:44.709
And it will make a gallery of those images instantly.

00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:46.709
Some of that...

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.289
I put some fake content in here.

00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:54.500
And you'll notice here, if I open this
up, I've got this folder of PIL images.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.349
So I could of course do just do insert image
add  the image, insert image add the image.

00:28:58.349 --> 00:29:03.039
But what I'm going to do is I'm going
to make an archive of that folder.

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:06.349
So here I have PILimages.zip.

00:29:06.349 --> 00:29:15.179
So if I just do insert media, and upload that zip file...

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.310
So it's going to search through that
zip file and find all the images,

00:29:18.309 --> 00:29:20.649
turn them into thumbnails and make a page based on it.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.370
So let's save it.

00:29:22.369 --> 00:29:24.369
There's my images, thumbnails, everything.

00:29:24.369 --> 00:29:29.319
All in one step.

00:29:29.319 --> 00:29:39.029
So I've saved that and I have this gallery of images and I'm
going to go ahead and add a tag to this page and I'm going

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:42.730
to tag it as needing review and we'll
see where that shows up in a second.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.190
So I'll just say, needs review.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.430
You see it fills in for me.

00:29:49.349 --> 00:29:52.409
So the next thing I am going to do
here is go back to the group home page,

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:57.440
and we'll see that is shows up in
the side bar underneath review.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.910
So the side bar is actually a custom sidebar, which has
been set up specifically for this group linking to a tag

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.500
and anything that gets tagged with a need
review tag, shows up in the sidebar here.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.359
And I'm going to have my man behind the curtain here.

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:11.149
If you look at the sidebar, I mean I have
my man behind the curtain at Allegra,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.080
and you see it shows up right there on the page.

00:30:13.079 --> 00:30:15.019
No reloading.

00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:17.769
So, most of you saw that yesterday and it's pretty cool.

00:30:17.769 --> 00:30:22.259
So I'm going to look at this Allegra
page and why does this need review?

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:24.160
What has changed about this page?

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.660
What's different?

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.340
And I'm not entirely sure.

00:30:28.339 --> 00:30:32.459
So these are the questions that
somebody will ask when they come to you.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.850
And they are basically saying, I want version control.

00:30:34.849 --> 00:30:35.990
Where's my version control?

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.410
But they're saying what's changed about this, you know.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:43.070
And so, what I can do here is, next is modify data.

00:30:43.069 --> 00:30:48.079
Click this icon and in this case somebody has
actually provided a good comment for the save.

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:52.859
I'm guilty as anybody at not providing
a good save comment for that.

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:57.849
And so what you can do is you can click on any of these
versions, see what they look like at any given time.

00:30:57.849 --> 00:31:04.109
At any given point and time, and at this point
I'm not sure what different so I can click compare

00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:08.329
and I can see exactly what's changed
for this particular version.

00:31:08.329 --> 00:31:15.269
( Applause )

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:21.339
Now not knowing of course why it was changed
and anything like that, I will scroll down.

00:31:21.339 --> 00:31:25.899
Now of course we're looking at something that's
already been changed so I can see a comment from myself

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.440
which I guess, I'd forgotten about already.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.970
This says doctor, shouldn't we say health care provider?

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.700
I'm just going to go ahead and add another comment to this.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.660
So you can see what this is like.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:43.470
Me too. Save it.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.529
So that comment's saved, pages reload anything.

00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:47.799
It's really cool.

00:31:47.799 --> 00:31:50.319
And so with that I'll go back to Michael.

00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:50.970
>> Michael: Okay.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:57.140
( Applause )

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.500
Alright, so that was a bit more of the advanced features
of the WISYWYG features that we have as part of the wiki

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.119
as well as some of the content
management features we have in there.

00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:10.419
It's really important to remember it's a great way
to organize other kinds of content besides HTML.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.620
PDFs, images, videos, whatever you have.

00:32:12.619 --> 00:32:16.989
You can organize it because we have this great tag
metaphor that we wrap around all of our content.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:18.370
So what are you going to do with this?

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:19.089
I don't know.

00:32:19.089 --> 00:32:20.609
But there's more things that you can do with it.

00:32:20.609 --> 00:32:26.139
And to talk a little bit about how to customize, integrate
and to extend, I'm going to bring Doug Whitmore up here.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.560
But first, I'm going to talk a little bit about standards.

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:32.369
There's a funny thing about standards.

00:32:32.369 --> 00:32:36.349
Is when you develop against standards,
everybody comes to the wiki party.

00:32:36.349 --> 00:32:37.409
Its awesome.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:45.310
When you develop against HTML and CSS, standards compliant
HTML, CSS you get all these browsers you can support.

00:32:45.309 --> 00:32:50.009
We support Safari on the Mac and on Windows, wow!

00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:55.940
Anyway also, Firefox 1.5, 2.0, any of the Gecko
based browsers, including Camino, IE6, and IE7,

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:01.220
which you don't really need because you got Safari now.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:07.250
Also we support the Atom publishing and Meta-Weblog
APIs so if you have other tools that you actually want

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:12.069
to get content in like MarsEdit
or Acto, we support that as well.

00:33:12.069 --> 00:33:16.149
RSS again, we have RSS all over the place.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.509
Version history.

00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:18.549
Search results.

00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:20.629
Every page has RSS on it.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.680
These are great ways to find out
how content is changing inside

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.529
of this great content repository
of information that we call wiki.

00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:32.559
So, now we bring up Doug Whitmore and he's going to
give us a little bit more detail about the technology

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:36.529
and some of the ways that we bleed
we can actually go and extend a wiki.

00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:38.950
Doug. There you are.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:39.759
>> Doug: Thank you Michael.

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:42.009
( Applause )

00:33:42.009 --> 00:33:46.460
As Michael said, I'm going to talk to you
about the extensibility about the wiki.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.650
The first thing I'm going to talk about are themes.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:54.280
Themes are the ways that we define
the look and feel for the wiki.

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:58.149
You saw the themes that Chris showed just a minute ago.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.000
And we're going to talk about how
you can make your own themes.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.700
One of the things that we wanted to do with HTML
that we're generating is we wanted to make it

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.240
as close to CSS Zen Garden as we possibly could.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:12.069
That means everything has a class, that
means that its really made for styling.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:18.559
Anything that you want to do, we want you
to be able to do using just CSS styling.

00:34:18.559 --> 00:34:20.730
We do ship a wire frame theme.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.349
The idea behind that is that it's
a good base for you to start with.

00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:29.409
It's a way for you to go in, look at the
selectors that we've already got and figure

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:32.739
out how can I tweak it to make it my own?

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:38.809
One of our big goals is we want you to be able to do
everything you want to do by just tweaking the CSS.

00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:45.250
However that's not always possible so we'd also allow
you to include custom JavaScript in your themes.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:49.159
Any JavaScript you put in the
theme will be included in each page.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:54.519
We also give you the ability to add custom
sidebar content as we on the various themes.

00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:56.730
They've all got the same sidebar.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.920
We have a way to change that.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:06.000
Next thing I want to talk about, third
party authentication and authorization.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.489
For our server, for wiki server we implement
authentication and authorization as a plug-in.

00:35:11.489 --> 00:35:12.919
What does that mean?

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:19.590
That means it's possible for you guys to go out and create
your own authentication and authorization mechanism based

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:26.260
on something like Shibboleth, OpenID, whatever
it is that you happen to be working with.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.790
I am going to take a quick aside and talk
about authentication versus authorization.

00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:33.710
Authentication is you are who you say who you are.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.470
Authorization is you can do what
it is that you're trying to do.

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:43.099
I bring it up because for something like Shibboleth, it's
pretty simple, it does authentication and authorization.

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:45.750
For something like OpenID it only does authentication.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:51.280
So you're gonna have to figure out a way to do your own
authorization mapping underneath all of that.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.960
It's implemented as a twisted plug-in.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.809
To learn more about twisted, please
visit the twisted matrix website.

00:35:58.809 --> 00:36:04.130
And that'll give you a good head start on how to do this.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.400
Next thing I want to talk about is XML-RPC.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.480
It's what our web client uses to talk to the server.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.599
What is XML-RPC, basically the simplistic view
is, it's a way to speak to the web service,

00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:21.079
make it even simpler, it's the "X" in AJAX.

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:27.610
Basically it's very simple, it's
client service, request, response.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:30.519
And the request or response is XML
which makes it very parsable.

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:34.480
When you have something that this easy,
everybody wants to create a library for it.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.300
Everyone wants to do the easy work, right?

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.150
So we have lots of libraries for doing XML-RPC.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.389
In Cocoa, there's web sevices core.

00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:47.679
AppleWcript has lots of libraries
for doing XML-RPC JavaScript.

00:36:47.679 --> 00:36:49.279
There's Dojo prototype.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.620
Lots of different ways of doing it.

00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:53.219
Python, Perl, .Net.

00:36:53.219 --> 00:36:57.009
You name it, it's probably got an XML-RPC library.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:01.410
And again it is what our web client
uses to talk to the wiki server.

00:37:01.409 --> 00:37:04.629
So all of the fancy...

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:12.250
when Chris and John were changing meetings around, and
when things were showing up in the list automatically,

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.920
that's all done using XML-RPC calls in the back end.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:22.130
And now I'd like to show you a
little bit of what it looks like.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.630
We can go to the demo machine.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.000
Go and close that out.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:39.489
So last week our engineers worked on a demo theme.

00:37:39.489 --> 00:37:40.629
I'd like to show it to you.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.950
Oh, there it is.

00:37:42.949 --> 00:37:43.659
It's pretty simple.

00:37:43.659 --> 00:37:46.899
Basically it's a folder with wiki theme extension.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:53.849
The printout CSS is basically going to
show you style of the page for printing.

00:37:53.849 --> 00:37:57.989
The screen.CSS has all the styling and layout.

00:37:57.989 --> 00:38:02.969
We've also added some JavaScript to show that every page

00:38:02.969 --> 00:38:08.659
that gets loaded using this theme
will have the JavaScript included.

00:38:08.659 --> 00:38:10.440
And last we have this themed up plist.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.880
This is all of the metadata that is on a theme.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:22.160
So it's things like the name of the theme that shows
up on the list, also version and also extra content.

00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:25.879
In this case we have for this theme we have extra sidebars.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.940
Which I will show you in a moment.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:34.360
Let me go ahead and load a page that
hasn't had the theme placed on it yet.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.000
It's a very simple, simple page.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.099
We are using the default theme
through the Actevex campaign.

00:38:42.099 --> 00:38:45.650
You can see we got some pictures, we have some comments.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:49.269
I want to go ahead and change that.

00:38:49.269 --> 00:38:52.489
So I'm going to go ahead and click edit.

00:38:52.489 --> 00:38:55.099
I'm going to log in as an admin.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.769
I could log in as the owner of the group, but
I'm going to log in as an admin on the machine

00:39:00.769 --> 00:39:07.679
and I get this group settings pane and
I'm going to choose the theme, WWDC Demo.

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:08.829
Click OK.

00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:15.679
I'm going to hit save which will refresh
the page and boom, we have our new theme.

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:17.690
You can see it looks very different.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:21.170
This is all done just last week by our engineers.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.309
I think it looks really good.

00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:26.099
Let's go ahead and go back to the page we're looking at.

00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:30.239
We can see, some of the differences that we've seen here.

00:39:30.239 --> 00:39:33.389
So now we have the comments on
the side, they look different.

00:39:33.389 --> 00:39:34.329
Tags are to the side.

00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:38.960
You can also style the edit bar.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:45.360
Basically we allow you to style just about everything.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.030
Next thing, last week we also created a widget.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.620
We were busy last week.

00:39:52.619 --> 00:40:01.210
Top of our XML-RPC APIs, and here it is.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:02.949
Dashboard's loading.

00:40:02.949 --> 00:40:03.609
There we go.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:08.849
Okay. What this widget does is that it takes
the username that I put in on the back.

00:40:08.849 --> 00:40:10.489
I'll show you in a moment.

00:40:10.489 --> 00:40:16.589
It takes the username, figures out what
groups I am in that have wikis on this server.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:21.070
For each of those groups it grabs all of
the entries that have the hot tag on them.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.840
Basically it's like the what's hot sidebar.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.010
Only it's a...

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:31.470
I have all of my groups that I'm in.

00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:35.669
If we look in the back, basically I'd say
this is the server I want to go to.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.309
The username the password, I clicked on it to log in again.

00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:46.489
Refresh. Hopefully you'll see that
things come in asynchronously.

00:40:46.489 --> 00:40:53.250
And, this is all done fairly quickly
using dash code and all that.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.800
Alright, let me go back to the slides really quickly here.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:02.570
So I can show you a little bit about
what the code I had looks like.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:03.789
It's fairly simple.

00:41:03.789 --> 00:41:08.730
Basically I created a proxy to the server
object which I cleverly named server.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:13.300
The first thing I want to do is
do log in on the server object.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.970
And I want to take a quick moment to
note that this is a clear text log in.

00:41:17.969 --> 00:41:19.389
We also have a digest login.

00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:21.089
I wanted to use this one for clarity.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:26.100
Because digest is you know, couple of extra
steps and I wanted to keep it fairly simple.

00:41:26.099 --> 00:41:30.059
To the login method we pass the username and password.

00:41:30.059 --> 00:41:35.860
If we get returned to dictionary, it that's a
success, then we grab the session ID out of that.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.130
We're going to use that later on.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:40.430
First thing I...

00:41:40.429 --> 00:41:43.839
the next thing I do is called
server.groupsForSession.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.400
That's going to grab all of the groups that I'm in.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.849
Now it knows my username because it's part of the session.

00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:55.110
For each group in that list I'm going
to do server.search.getEntries.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:58.390
Search is one of our XML-RPC services.

00:41:58.389 --> 00:42:01.029
We have a few other services that do some different things.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.660
In this case we're doing search.

00:42:02.659 --> 00:42:04.069
Pardon me.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.170
You pass at the session ID.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.019
Again that says I can do what it is that I'm trying to do.

00:42:10.019 --> 00:42:17.980
I pass at the group that I got from the group list
and the last thing that I have is the search query.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.909
This is done as a dictionary.

00:42:19.909 --> 00:42:21.230
Basically I'm passing it...

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:25.990
I'm saying, I want everything that has the tag of Hot.

00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:29.909
And then for each entry that we get
back we do whatever it is to the code.

00:42:29.909 --> 00:42:32.019
And that's all we had to do to make that widget.

00:42:32.019 --> 00:42:33.840
It was pretty simple.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.960
And that's my talk on extensibility in the wiki.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.070
Back to you Michael.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:44.880
( Applause )

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.550
>> Michael: Okay, so are wikis for nerds?

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:52.860
Well, Doug's demo with some code and some of the technology,
but I think what you saw in the first two demos was

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.329
that we're really developing wikis for everybody.

00:42:56.329 --> 00:43:00.159
We want wikis to be accessible to everyone
because we know that every eyeball that looks

00:43:00.159 --> 00:43:03.230
at a piece of information makes it more valuable.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.940
So, that's why we spend a lot of time on interaction design.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.200
ON the look and the feel of making it really just sweet.

00:43:09.199 --> 00:43:10.460
But what we want...

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.039
you can go crazy with AJAX.

00:43:12.039 --> 00:43:14.079
There are a log of crazy AJAX sites out there.

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:15.469
We've tried to be elegant about it.

00:43:15.469 --> 00:43:20.409
We've tried to be intelligent about how we've landed
the interaction model and make it really work for you.

00:43:20.409 --> 00:43:23.639
Because they want wikis to be for everybody.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:30.420
The other thing that I want to just leave you with, before
we get to Q and A is that we want to get out of your way.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.000
The wiki server, all of these services, we want to get out
of your way and we want to give you tools with potential.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.590
We want to give you tools that you are
actually going to build something with.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.640
We don't know what you're going to build.

00:43:38.639 --> 00:43:41.239
We're just going to give you tools to actually do it.

00:43:41.239 --> 00:43:46.449
So that's what I hope we've done and I hope
we've shown you as part of this presentation.

00:43:46.449 --> 00:43:50.059
So with that, what I'd like to do is talk
a little bit about the labs that we have.

00:43:50.059 --> 00:43:53.920
If you're wondering how we did some of the cool
WISYWYG stuff that we did, there's a great web kit,

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.940
theAJAX application session, this Wednesday at 2.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.929
We're going to be all over the labs, all week.

00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:00.569
The team will be there.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:01.780
You can chat with us about that.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.540
I think the first one is today at 2, is that right?

00:44:05.539 --> 00:44:08.210
Yes. There's one on Wednesday as well.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.340
Podcast Producer.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.380
We didn't go into this as part of our session.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.980
The Podcast Producer uses the wiki as a landing spot.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.170
So that's another great session this Wednesday to go to...
