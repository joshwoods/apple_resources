WEBVTT

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.589
>> Welcome, everyone, to the Leopard Server Overview.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.000
So those of you who were here in the last session, you heard
about some of the great new features in Leopard Server.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.250
And we're going to go into a lot more depth in this
session, and also we've got some great demos for you.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:42.939
So as some of you heard, Leopard Server is built on
a 64-bit sold foundation; Unix foundation of Leopard.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:48.030
We have a lot of open source services that are
integrated together and we've made them very easy to use

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.649
with the management applications of Leopard Server.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.719
And we're got some great new applications,
like the podcast producer,

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.960
the iCal server, and the Apple wiki.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.310
So to start off, we're going to go into detail about
the OS foundations and some of the Core services.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.500
I would like to welcome to the
stage Kazu Yanagihara

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.510
senior engineering manager from the Mac OS Server team.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.800
( Applause )

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.409
>> Welcome to network server.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.140
So we have lots of good stuff.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.829
So I hope you'll stick around.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.709
Let's start with this.

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.459
So -- we have tons of changes in Leopard.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.489
Let's see.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:31.829
Foundation.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.379
So if you look at about 18 months ago, or past
18 months, we have tons of changes in hardware,

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.719
we started with Intel transition
and then moved to 64-bit Intel.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.150
And most recently moved to the multi-Core systems.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.180
It was tons of work for the OS engineers, but it was also
a great opportunity to make key changes within the OS.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.930
And we did take the opportunity.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.790
So what I want to do is go over some of those
changes and see how that helps the server platform.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.630
One of the key focuses is multicore capability.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:13.069
So to start with, we have a brand new scheduler, smart cache
and CPU management, which means you can now on the threads,

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:20.049
basically bounce around between
different cores and blow away the CPU cache.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.090
We also have TCP input processing distributed
across multiple cores.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.530
Which means that if you have a server that's under load.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.650
It can respond much better.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.819
Thank you.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.739
( Applause )

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.219
>> The use of global locks are
also needed for most system costs.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.639
Which means that you can now execute a bunch of different
stuff in parallel, and really take advantage

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.709
of those extra cores, which in general
brings up the whole server performance.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.150
And the list goes on and on and on.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.569
If you look at general enhancements,
we now have support for send file.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.439
Which means we can move the bit from fast
system to networking much more efficiently.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.969
We have a spot for the POSIX spawn which has much
lower overhead when you launch an application.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.609
So it's great for things like Apache
and Samba (assumed spelling).

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.520
Deployments of our 10GB Internet (Inaudible) more
than doubled, and close to tripled since Tiger's server.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.570
So that is a great accomplishment.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.840
And so on.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.289
And all these changes really paid off.

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:26.840
So you've seen in previous presentation, our
scalability story is working really, really good.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.710
And in general, the performance
of different services as well.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.580
Here, the e-mail server is using internal bench mark.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.090
This measures the number of messages the server can send
and receive, (Inaudible) server and latency timeframe.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.259
So we are really happen with the foundation
right now and the progress we have made.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.789
And we still have a few months
to tweak and optimize this OS.

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.799
So just a quick update on the foundation.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.100
But I want to move up to a level higher to services and talk
about some of the great stuff that is in Leopard Server.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.710
As Greg mentioned earlier, a lot of our services are
based on open source standards and open source projects.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.860
And we have lots and lots and lots of services.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.230
I didn't even get to list everything here.

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:19.480
So what I'm going do today is spend 10
or 15 minutes on each of these services

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.680
and go over the key features -- just kidding.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.959
We don't have time for that.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.979
( Laughter )
>> So the point is we have a lot of services.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.560
So what we're really going to do is spend maybe
10 minutes to talk about 4 or 5 key features

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.680
of Leopard Server within different server market context.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.930
And let's start with I top server
information (assumed spelling).

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.829
So this is a feature where you can connect
the attach server to another attach server.

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:45.569
And why would you want to do that?

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:46.560
An example.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.610
A small business environment.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.129
So let's think about company network
with my network server there.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.219
It works great.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.260
People can chat in a secure fashion.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.789
Have all this new great features of Leopard.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.200
But for -- if you work with another company and if
you have a chat with employees from that company,

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.750
you can feather these two servers,
and with that the employees

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.100
from both companies can now chat
freely across the public Internet.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.580
You can even make a secure, and have
every single message encrypted as well.

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:18.879
And you can do all of this without
any changes to the client's side.

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.569
You don't have to add any additional
accounts or connect an additional server.

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.540
It just works.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.930
And you can also feather it into a server in
the sky, such as Google Talk if you want to.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.019
So employees can talk to their friends and
family all day long, instead of doing their work.

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.269
( Laughter )

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.469
>> So -- and we made this one really easy to use.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.840
So if you have basic server administration,
as just a single click.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.539
Or if you want to fine-tune the options
you can do so in Advanced Panel.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.180
So that's iChat Server Federation.

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:53.600
Next, timing back up server.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.470
So you've been hearing great things about this new feature.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.530
So let's see how it works in the server environment.

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:02.799
Let's see if you have a 1,000 employee company.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.720
And you want everybody to backup their data.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.740
You could buy 1,000 hard drives and distribute everybody
and tells them this is how you are to back it up.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.730
And that may work.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.720
But like herding cats probably it would not work.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.330
So with Leopard Server what you
can do is push the preferences

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:22.740
for the Time Machine from the center of open directory.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.530
And then have all the clients back
up to a set of centralized servers.

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:31.439
That way the IT department has a much better
control over the process of backing things up.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:36.899
And of course, with Xsan run out of
space just keep throwing hardware at it,

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:40.709
and Xsan can automatically expand the volume for you.

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:45.750
And as your company grows you can
keep adding server hardware as well.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:53.180
So -- and here is the workgroup manager GUI for
configuring Time Machine backup options.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.200
So that's Time Machine.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:58.579
Next, Spotlight server.

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:02.819
Such -- Steve mentioned and we now have the ability

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:07.329
to search multiple volumes just
like local volumes transparently.

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:13.050
So if you work in a publishing work group you can
do searchs on a server corroborating with others.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.550
And you can use all the features of Leopard,
such as QuickLook, or the cover flow.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.920
Everything.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.780
It just works automatically.

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:25.259
Or you can also use existing features
like smart folders,

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:30.920
so it can interpret this whole process
into your work flow for your group.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.300
And on the server side, there is
no configuration there also.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:40.920
Just out of the box, every single shipment is
automatically indexed and able to be searchs.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.710
In this bonus, you also have a patch module that
let's you do search remotely from a Web page.

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:52.169
So if anybody wants to come up with Spotlight front end
for iPhone there's an opportunity right there.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.659
Next up is RADIUS Server.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.260
So this is the best kept secret of Leopard Server.

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:05.980
So anyway, this feature's great if you're
managing lots of airport base stations.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.410
And here's how it works.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.990
Let's look at the university as an example.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:16.180
So a lot of company -- universities -- have open network
where anybody can just walk up and join the network.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.290
But I just want to protect the network and require
authentication.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.310
With RADIUS feature what you can
do is point all the base stations

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.769
to the authorzing Open Directory server who's RADIUS
enabled.

00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:30.889
So when students go up to the base station to

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:34.819
or they need to authenticate, goes to Open
Directory server and they get an access.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.210
The same password that they use for the mail application
when (Inaudible) out of the institutional level.

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:46.370
And this is based on the open soucre software called
Free Radius.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.259
And we even added Setup Assistant.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:58.269
So all you have to do is go through four different panels
of this assistant and you can configure the whole network.

00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:00.299
We also made a change to the Server Admin.

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:05.299
So now from within a Server Admin you can
browse and add different base stations.

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:09.939
And the Server Admin knows to authorize on
directory talk to the base station and configure it

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.100
to use radios and point to the right directive server.

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:21.600
So if you are managing a wireless network it's
something that you want to take a look at.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.370
And the last thing it the Web platform.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.169
So we have clearly set up tools that
you can use for the Web development.

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:35.949
We, of course, have all the basic stuff, such as Apache,
MySQL, PHP, all integrated, and it's all now 64-bit.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.610
And as Greg mentioned earlier, we
also have Ruby on Rails now as well

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.680
as over 20 gems prebundled and all configured.

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:47.769
So that should make life a lot easier for a lot of people.

00:09:50.169 --> 00:09:55.269
And of course have other familiar technologies, like the
Perl, Tom Cat, WebObjects, (Inaudible) as well.

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:59.419
And again, most of these components are 64-bit now.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:08.659
So, you have -- we have services for everyone from small
businesses to corporations to higher educational sites.

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:14.230
And just like desktop site, there is no standard
edition or advanced edition or small business edition.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.490
All of these services are in a single package
of Mac OS X Server that you can buy

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.180
and then you get to pick which services you want to use.

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:24.339
So that's services.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.899
Now let's move on to other administration.

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:31.500
So one of the key goals of Leopard Server
was to make it super-easy for people

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.899
to deploy and manage all these great services.

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:38.949
And what we did was we kind of stepped
back and asked ourselves the questions.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.330
So for our Admins, and how are they using --

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.550
what context are they using our server and
what are the issues that they are having.

00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:50.439
And we came up with three different
scenarios under which servers are being used.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.120
And of course, corresponding Admin types.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.159
The first one was for small businesses.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:58.879
So this is a place where there
is no IT staff that's educated.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:03.980
So whoever happens to know the most about the
computer, the computer guy needs to be at Admin.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.070
And what he or she does is go out and buy some books.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:07.220
( Laughter )

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:13.769
>> And try best to set up server and
configure all the client's user server.

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:16.259
Kind of scary.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:22.350
And -- but all they want to do is just set up
all the basic services without much tweaking.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.820
Just the basic settings.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.930
And once it's configured, they will hardly
ever touch on the unless they need to add new users

00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:31.370
or do something unless they absolutely have to.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.590
So the first challenge, really,
was to help out these people.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:42.320
The next step was department of service,
within institutions and corporations.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:48.530
So a lot of people do want to deploy their servers
independent of what's provided by the IT staff.

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:54.209
For example, you might have the departmental web
site, or the HR department may have their own file server

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.060
to keep confidential information and so on.

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:02.079
And typically, just configure maybe
one specific service, or maybe two.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.480
Not a whole bunch of different stuff.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.470
But one thing they do want to do is they want to integrate

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.600
with the direct infrastructure that's provided
by the institution or the corporation.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.800
So you have the single user password and
you have to manage separate user accounts.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.340
But it's often difficult to do that for a lot of people.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.070
So typically what ends up happening is
either they create separate users and groups,

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.060
try to manage it, an then quickly become out dated.

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:36.569
Or they call the IT staff for help and they have to come out
and set up the server for them, set up the clients for them,

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.530
bind them to the server, introductory server and so on.

00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:43.419
So extra work that gets created for the IT staff.

00:12:43.419 --> 00:12:48.969
So for these people our goal was to really come
up -- again -- real easy way to deploy the server,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.870
but integrate it into the infrastructure that's
provided by the corporation or institution.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.519
And we off load the extra work from the IT staff.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.570
Then the third one is just basically
the rest of administrators out there.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:10.020
We want to advance people who want to specialize
deployment, or just want to use advanced tools.

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:13.559
Probably a lot of people in this
audience fall into this category.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:16.679
So these are people who know what they are
talking about, and they know what they are doing.

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:20.659
They know what IPP stands for; what IPFW stands for.

00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:23.449
And they read the writing books
for fun before they go to bed --

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.620
( Laughter )
>> -- and other stuff.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.500
And so we've been talking most directly and
indirectly, quite a lot of different feed back.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.629
And we've got a lot of good ones.

00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:37.480
But in particular, a lot of them on it have the
ability to better manage a large number of servers.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.830
The tools we have today is not really scaleable.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.320
So that's one of the biggest feed back.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:49.830
So we took all these ideas and feed back and went off and
did some engineering work and came up with a few things.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.889
The first thing we did was stream line the server system.

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:55.240
The server set up application.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:01.480
So now when you launch it, the first thing it's going
to ask you is to pick one of the three concentrations,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:08.060
either standard, work group, or advanced, which
maps to those scenarios that we talked about.

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:11.779
And then if you pick standard we
will try to do everything for you.

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:12.980
All right.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.710
So you don't have to set up anything.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:20.860
For example, if you have a configuration like this and
it's an Airport base station router, we talk to it directly

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:26.490
and then all configure not port forwarding, so
things like iChat Server Federation or mail server,

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:31.190
or anything that goes out to the Internet
just works, without any further configuration.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.020
( Applause )

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:35.759
>> And it is all in Server.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:38.710
All in one server configuration that's preconfigured

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.950
and enabling all the key productivity
and corroboration services.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:52.400
And we will include the VPN server, so even the small
business employees can work even after they go home.

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:54.529
( Applause )
>> Next, worker configuration.

00:14:54.529 --> 00:15:00.039
So if you pick this configuration it's
really for the department servers.

00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:00.829
Here's an example.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.000
At Alpo (assumed spelling), we
have centralized director server

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.320
and different departments have all
their servers managed by themselves.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.210
And this one really cool feature called easy Kerberos.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:18.050
What this does is if you select worker configuration, and
if that open directory server is also a Leopard Server,

00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:24.839
we do some magic underneath it, and we automatically
Kerberize all the services on that departmental server.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.970
And without any IT involvement in this at all,

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.149
which means anybody in the department can easily
manage, deploy these servers and manage it.

00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:36.269
And also there's a benefit to the clients, which
is if all this department's servers are pointing

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:40.679
to the service directory, all the clients can
take advantage of single signing programs.

00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:44.379
So they won't have all different passwords
for different departmental servers.

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:50.669
So that's some of the cool things we did here.

00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:55.059
And here are the services that's
enabled for the worker configuration.

00:15:57.429 --> 00:16:00.939
Now, once the server's set up, you need to manage it.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.180
Adding new users, maybe tweaking the
Spam filtering, sensitivity, and so on.

00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:09.359
So we looked at and see how can we make
work book manager and server much easier

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.690
to use without penalizing advanced people.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.810
And we reached the conclusion that we cannot.

00:16:14.809 --> 00:16:18.959
So what we did was we created a brand
new application that's really optimized

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.150
for the basic usage for those novice Admins.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:27.240
And we're going to demo this in a little bit, so
I won't go into too much detail.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.810
We also have this brand new widget, so anyone on the
Internet you can have instant access of the status

00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:34.489
to the server, just in, check it, and out.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.000
( Applause )

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:45.970
and if you do want to do some minor tweaking or minor --

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:51.810
detailed tweaking of certain preferences or enabling of
additional services, the advanced tool select Server Admin

00:16:51.809 --> 00:16:56.039
and work group managers are available for
both standard and work group configurations.

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:57.179
It's hidden; but it's there.

00:16:57.179 --> 00:16:58.979
And we don't prevent you from using it.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:04.809
But we do bring down the sheet saying,
hey, do you know what you're doing?

00:17:04.809 --> 00:17:05.909
( Laughter )

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:06.190
>> All right.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:11.440
So another cool feature that we've
implemented is called automatic client set up.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.259
So -- so if you have a standard work
group server, the client users don't have

00:17:17.259 --> 00:17:19.579
to do any manual configuration of the applications.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.720
So you don't have to go into the Mail app
and go to the preferences and type

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.430
in your server name or authentication type.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.769
Same thing for the iChat
iCal -- all of those.

00:17:27.769 --> 00:17:30.069
It just automatically happens.

00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:35.470
So what I'd like to do now is invite Jeff Michaud
the manager of server admitting,

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.769
and Mike Thole, one of the
engineers to the stage and give us a demo.

00:17:39.769 --> 00:17:45.670
But before we start that, I have to give you a warning.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:51.300
About three hours ago the network went down on that
server machine, and somehow hosed the boot for you.

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:55.730
But luckily we have a back up volume, so we
booted it, and did some quick configuration

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.130
and did some stuff, and it looks like it's working.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.880
So it's a 50, 50 chance but --P which says a lot.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.540
( Applause )
>> Thanks a lot.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:05.980
Hey folks.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.210
So Mike and I are here

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.090
So I manage the Admin HI team here at Apple.

00:18:16.089 --> 00:18:17.839
For Mac OS X Server.

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:19.569
Mike is an engineer on the team.

00:18:19.569 --> 00:18:23.859
And for the purpose of this demo we're
playing the roles of two grad students

00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:27.659
at a fictitious school called Apple University.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.150
And we're in the biology department.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.190
I have just gotten permission from
IT to set up a work group server.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.230
And it just requires a static IP address.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.970
That's pretty much it.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.920
Everything else I can do myself.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.000
And Mike is here and he's going to
join his computer up to the network.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.900
So let's see how that looks.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.840
>> So like Jeff said, I am Mike Thole, and I am
playing a biology student at our fictional university.

00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:57.230
I just got my shiny new department computer today and I'm
going to try to set it up using our university services.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.829
So you all know how you would do that.

00:18:59.829 --> 00:19:02.019
You would open Mail.app and
go through the set up assistant.

00:19:02.019 --> 00:19:08.170
Enter your e-mail address, probably enter some more
obscure things, like your SMTP host, your port, et cetera.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:14.480
If I was going set up iChat to join the iChat
server, we would go through its set up assistant.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.289
I am a biologist, not a computer nerd.

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:20.359
I don't know which account I would pick here.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:23.599
I don't even know what a Jabber I.D. is.

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:28.750
And I would go through of the same process, like
bind for the directory, set up iCal, et cetera.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.329
This seems like a big headache for me.

00:19:31.329 --> 00:19:35.089
I am busy with lots of other things, so it
seems like we should be able to make it simpler.

00:19:35.089 --> 00:19:37.220
>> So, I think we can, with this new server we set up.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.490
It's got a bunch of great features for collaboration.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.789
For example, I guess you probably do some
work with others around the department?

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:46.480
>> Right. So I collaborate with
three or four other researchers,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.849
and it would be great if we had a few things.

00:19:48.849 --> 00:19:53.279
I would really like to see some way to schedule
meetings on the Internet for group work.

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:58.039
Some way to collaborate on line, and a way to share
files, because we have a lot of research data.

00:19:58.039 --> 00:19:59.960
>> Yep, so this server has all that.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.350
It's got a wiki.

00:20:01.349 --> 00:20:03.919
A team wiki can set that up.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.460
It's got a shared calendar, it's got file sharing, and it's
real easy to set up, so I can get you going now if you want?

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.430
>> Yeah. Show me how it works.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.549
>> So as Kazu mentioned,
we've got this new app called server preferences.

00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:15.349
Probably looks a little bit familiar to people.

00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:17.699
Looks a bit like System Preferences.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.809
It's got account information up here.

00:20:19.809 --> 00:20:28.200
I can either create accounts right on the server or I
can import accounts from the institutional directory.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.680
And in here it's got services, it's not
-- controls for just the basic stuff

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.220
that I care about as someone who's a non-ad man.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:41.839
Right. So if there's a problem with the server, you
know, people like you are going to be around to come

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:44.829
and look at the server and figure out what's
really going on using more advanced tools.

00:20:44.829 --> 00:20:50.549
And also down at the bottom here I've got
some basic status information, such as graphs.

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:55.779
You know, it's been sitting here idle for a couple
hours, so you can just see that the server's healthy.

00:20:55.779 --> 00:21:01.619
So I am going go ahead and I'm going
create an account for Mike here.

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:04.279
>> Spell my name right.

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:09.269
>> If I can type.

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:17.309
And -- I will -- set your password to be test, for now.

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:21.409
So he's created -- and now when he -- he's
going to get a welcome e-mail from the server

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.820
that explains all the services that it provides.

00:21:24.819 --> 00:21:26.269
And here I'll go into group.

00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:31.039
So to set up the shared services like the wiki
-- the way to do that is to set up a group.

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:33.210
And so I'm going to create a group for Mike.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.529
And I think you're in the research group, Mike?

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:37.029
>> That's right.

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:41.019
>> So we'll go ahead and create that group.

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:43.470
And we'll edit the membership.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.279
And I think you'll work with some familiar faces here.

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:49.039
Forest, Jason, Shell.

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:51.269
Of course, you, and Nathan.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.700
Is that right?

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.160
>> That's right.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.960
>> Looks good.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.710
So that's your group.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.880
So now you can see, we've got a new
wiki here called the research wiki.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.750
And we've got some shared set ups.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.500
So it looks like we've pretty much ready to go.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.630
>> So, we've already got a lot of biology data.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.020
Is there any way we can use this server to share that to us?

00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:11.779
>> Yep. No problem.

00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:17.069
So you can just go into Finder here and find your data.

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:20.189
And this looks like some interesting stuff going to here.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.950
So we'll -- is this the one you're interested in

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:22.420
>> Yeah. That's right.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.560
The research.

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:25.269
>> So we can just drag that over there.

00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:30.470
And we'll close that.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:36.150
( Applause )

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.190
>> And we can just set permission for that group.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.240
Does that work for you?

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:39.940
>> That would be great.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.230
But can we also add Eric Firestone to that list?

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.440
I'd like him to be able to access
one of those folders in there.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:45.940
>> No problem.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.509
I know Eric.

00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:49.730
Good guy. So there you go.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.130
And I think we're ready to go.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:57.020
So why don't we flip over to your machine and --

00:22:57.019 --> 00:22:57.930
>> I'll log back in.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.750
Is there anything I need to do to
start this configuration process?

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.490
>> Oh, well, I guess something's happening already.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.839
>> So it looks like it has found the biology server, right?

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:08.339
>> Yep.

00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:10.730
>> And it's providing me a few services.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.819
I'm going to begin set up.

00:23:12.819 --> 00:23:18.210
And it looks like you need to enter the user
name and password you just created for me.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.170
And my own password on this machine.

00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:24.839
And it authenticates to the server.

00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:28.789
And now it's asking if I want to
auto configure my applications.

00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:33.440
That's exactly why I want to do this, to
save me all the hassle of doing this myself.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.170
So I will do that.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.160
And what's this about Time Machine?

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.380
Maybe I should have paid more attention
to Kazu's speech.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.740
But I thought I had to have a FireWire
drive connected to use Time Machine?

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:49.240
>> No. One great feature of the server is that you can
configure Time Machine to backup to the server, which has,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.569
you know, as much disc space as we want it to have.

00:23:51.569 --> 00:23:55.059
And you don't have to be tethered to
a hard disk right on your desk there.

00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:56.450
>> So let's do that.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.100
That sounds great.

00:23:59.619 --> 00:24:04.449
Okay. Now I just need to log out and log
back in for everything to take effect.

00:24:11.299 --> 00:24:15.460
And -- we'll start off in Mail and
see if anything happened in there.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.410
So, I've already got an e-mail account set up.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:26.400
I didn't before.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.210
( Applause )
>> And I have my first welcome
message explaining some basic steps,

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.100
showing me different services that the server provides.

00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:40.189
One other thing I could do is it looks like
I can also e-mail people directly from here.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.200
So it remembers their e-mail addresses, so I don't have to.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.460
( Applause )

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.059
>> I have to see what else we have here.

00:24:46.059 --> 00:24:46.940
A group wiki.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.269
Let's check that out.

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:55.759
Log in. Cool!

00:24:55.759 --> 00:24:58.450
So -- it's the research group wiki.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:59.980
Nothing there since we just created it.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.990
I'm sure we'll see more of that later in the session.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.700
Let's see.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.420
And I see there's a Mac OS Scientific
Computing State of the Union tomorrow at 2.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.220
That sounds great.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.430
So I will add it to my iCalendar.

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:18.509
And let's go check out iCal.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.000
As you can see, it already has the biology server added.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.950
And there's some assignments that I just created
using that cool data detector feature in Leopard.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.870
And finally, let's check out Chat.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.360
Well, I see I've got everybody in the
biology department already on my list.

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:41.539
And I see Jeff's on line.

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:50.029
So, say hey.

00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:59.200
( Laughter and applause )

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.130
>> So anything else you want to show us, Jeff?

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:10.770
>> Yeah. So, we've got this new cool Dashboard
widget that Kazu mentioned, so it runs remotely.

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:15.019
So obviously, you can, you know, run through
the network, you can run it from anywhere.

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:21.819
See, the basic health of the server, again, disc space,
check basic services, make sure things are working okay.

00:26:21.819 --> 00:26:23.389
And that's a widget.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.350
That's the demo.

00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:26.409
Back to you, Kazu.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:33.730
( Applause )

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.039
>> Okay. What a relief.

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.079
( Laughter )

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:42.470
>> I have to -- after the fact
sacrifice to the demo God later

00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:44.970
All right.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:49.289
So if you pick another configuration,
the third one is advanced configuration.

00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:54.319
And this is ready for the advanced
administrators who want to use advanced tools,

00:26:54.319 --> 00:26:59.220
or who want to do some special deployments such as
mail across string or (Inaudible) across string,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.950
deploying Xgrid, and Podcast Producer and so on.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.700
And we did make a number of enhancements to
the tools that's used by those Admins as well.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:12.190
For example, we have a tiered Admin in
both workgroup manager and Server Admin now.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.430
The real one that works.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:17.990
And also we made a few additional
feature enhancements to Server Admin

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:22.960
so we can much more easily manage a large number of servers.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.660
And we have a few assistants for configuring
some of the services that are more sophisticated also.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:34.380
And lastly, we did redesign the
interface for the Server Admin.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:40.140
And actually, we -- last year in the
session we showed a prototype of the design.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.509
And some people after the session came up to
us and said, it looks great, it looks great.

00:27:43.509 --> 00:27:44.950
And you can navigate much faster.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:45.529
We love it.

00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:51.109
Even more people came up to us and said,
oh, I don't know, I kind of don't like it.

00:27:51.109 --> 00:27:51.899
Maybe like it.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.120
I don't know.

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:57.649
This one guy actually came to me
and said I really, really hate it.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.269
I'm going to come get you.

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.400
( Laughter )
>> So --

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.330
>> ( Laughter )
>> So we listened to people's feedback and I changed it.

00:28:03.329 --> 00:28:09.189
So we have another design that I want to show it to you.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.000
But I don't want to show it.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.910
So I am going to have Jeff come up to the stage
again and give you the demo of Server Admin.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:14.240
( Applause )

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:20.549
>> Thanks again.

00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:26.849
So I'm just going to give a really
short demo of some of the productivity

00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:29.279
and scaleable features that we've put into Server Admin.

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.329
We've put a lot into it.

00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:34.689
There's a lot of service level stuff that
we just don't have time to go into today.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:40.390
But I just want to show a new things to whet your
appetite and you can check it out on the seed.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.980
So here I am pointed at my biology
server from the last demo.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.900
We've got a nice new overview here.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:51.930
Shows, you know, hardware, software,
services that are running and basic status.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:59.600
And one thing we added that's pretty cool is we've added the
ability to save and restore preferences from Server Admin.

00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:02.799
Preferences being, for example,
the server list that shows up.

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:10.269
And I've got to know if anyone can see, but there's a
rack over there with about ten excerpts or so in it.

00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:13.289
So let's say I want to administer that.

00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:19.859
So -- let's go in and find my deco wreck.

00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:21.029
And there they are.

00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:24.809
Boom. As Steve Jobs would say.

00:29:24.809 --> 00:29:31.159
Oops. So I've got a nice list overview
here of all my servers.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.660
I don't really know what they are, because, you know,
when I set this up I just typed in the IP addresses.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.210
I can step through them here and see that
there's an OD server, a Web server --

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:43.950
looks like this is stuff for the podcast demo later.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.160
So this looks pretty cool.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.990
But I'd like a way to organize this.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:52.230
So one thing I can do is I can create a group.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:30:06.950
And let's say I want a group of my
-- oops -- it's not cooperating.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.759
Let's create another group.

00:30:13.299 --> 00:30:15.399
Of my OD servers.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.730
And I think this was one of them.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.509
And can drag that in.

00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:23.619
And there's a replica.

00:30:23.619 --> 00:30:26.889
So there I've got my utility servers.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.230
That's kind of a pain.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.420
And I don't want to manually create groups every time.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:36.960
So we've got this other feature called Smart
Groups, which works like Smart Playlist in iTunes.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.380
( Laugher and applause )

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:48.520
>> So what I can do with this is I can
look, for example, at the CPU usage, right?

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:55.609
And I can create a Smart Group that dynamically updates,
for example, with peg servers -- servers that are pegged.

00:30:55.609 --> 00:31:00.409
In this case I just want to see
my -- for example, my X spreads.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:08.620
So we'll create one called jeans.

00:31:08.619 --> 00:31:09.409
There it is.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.160
Looks like I've got three of them.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.500
And there they are.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.559
So a couple features from Server Admin.

00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:16.409
There's a whole lot more.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.220
Check it out in the seed.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:27.980
And back to Kazu.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.180
( Applause )

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.380
>> Okay. So that's the scoop on administration.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.720
We have the three configuration options now backed

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.980
by a handful technology innovations
for people to deploy and manage servers.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.970
So next, let's talk about Podcast Producer.

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:46.490
Some background information.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:51.420
You look at it, the popularity of pod
casting is growing at a significant rate.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:57.080
Today there are more than 3 billion downloads
of podcast episodes every week -- 3 billion.

00:31:57.079 --> 00:31:59.919
And it's increasing.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.480
And Apple is fully embracing this technology and
integrating into all different product lines.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.170
For example, iTunes Music Store has it right there.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.620
And it's one of the most popular destinations in the app.

00:32:10.619 --> 00:32:16.289
And of course it's the essential component of
new initiatives, like iTunes U. And of course,

00:32:16.289 --> 00:32:20.909
once you have a podcast downloaded to your
application, you can sync to the device of your choice.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.710
So you can sync to your iPod and watch it on the go.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.880
You can watch it on a big screen TV in your living room.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.640
Or you can watch it in 18 days on your brand new iPhone.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.509
Maybe -- if you start standing on line tonight.

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:44.619
So -- and which there are hundreds of millions of
copies of iTunes out there, and over 100 iPods,

00:32:44.619 --> 00:32:48.659
people are really -- there's a demand on the client side.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:54.140
And lots of large organizations are starting to
realize the power and attractiveness of podcasting.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:33:00.670
It's a very effective and economical way to distribute
information like lectures or training materials.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:05.120
A marching person was telling me that the military
personnel are interested in creating podcasts

00:33:05.119 --> 00:33:08.729
for different schools, graduation,
high school, junior high and so on.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:14.559
So the overseas personnel can actually
watch their kids graduating via podcasting.

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:18.309
So there are people ready to consume.

00:33:18.309 --> 00:33:19.539
And then there's a demand there.

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:23.170
There's a desire to actually produce on the producer's side.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:28.390
And there's one problem and that is we
do have some cool tools like Garage Band

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:32.420
and iWeb that let you create and publish podcast.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.289
But these are all for individuals.

00:33:34.289 --> 00:33:39.099
And we really don't have a tool that's
designed for the organizations out there.

00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:42.899
And organizations need something
that's automated and scaleable.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.810
So imagine Stanford University, they
probably have over 100 lectures a day.

00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:49.849
Then you don't have the money to
create podcasts out of those lectures.

00:33:49.849 --> 00:33:51.219
And of course it needs to be secure.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.900
And it needs to be integrated into the
infrastructure, networking, directing, and so on.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.530
And needs to be customizable, because
different people have different needs.

00:33:59.529 --> 00:34:02.369
So there's a big hole right now, right there right now.

00:34:02.369 --> 00:34:05.539
And then Podcast Producer's going to fill that hole.

00:34:05.539 --> 00:34:14.650
So we have a brand new application called Pod Cast
Capture, which let's you remotely control camera.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.840
You can start and stop and so on.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.470
And when the recording is done, the file is
getting pushed up to the server automatically.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:26.329
And the server, in turn, dispatches
it to the work flow engine.

00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:30.769
And each work flow knows exactly what
processing to apply to that media file.

00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:34.329
It may actually do according to
different file format or screen sizes.

00:34:34.329 --> 00:34:40.829
It may append the copyright notice for the
organization, or do water marking and so on.

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:44.509
And each work flow knows how to or
where to actually publish to.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:49.680
To iTunes U, or simply saving to the disc so
it can preview it before you make it public.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:57.529
So it's a really complete intense application that
let's you capture, process, and deliver podcasts.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.810
Now let's double-click on each one of those.

00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:07.519
Capturing. The podcast Capture ships as part of Leopard
disc, the OS, so it's all installed and ready to go.

00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:10.019
In the application utilties folder.

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:16.090
And it does more than just remotely controlling
cameras, such as screen scraping and a bunch of stuff,

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.559
which we are going to show in a demo in a few minutes.

00:35:19.559 --> 00:35:25.789
And also all the functionality of applications are
actually implemented in a command line tool underneath it.

00:35:25.789 --> 00:35:31.340
Which means that you can come up with your front
end by building on top of that command line tool.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:37.180
( Applause )

00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:38.659
>> And we will have a man page.

00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:44.429
So when we have done installing actually, on the client
client side you can do the man P cast --

00:35:44.429 --> 00:35:47.779
P-C-A-A-S-T -- and you can take a look at it.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:53.720
We may change the name to something else before we
ship, but that's the name we have right now on the DVD.

00:35:53.719 --> 00:35:55.219
So that's capturing.

00:35:55.219 --> 00:35:56.369
Processing.

00:35:56.369 --> 00:36:05.109
Oops. So we ship with 18 default work flows that are
useful out of the box, but we do expect most people to come

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:11.140
up with their own custom work flows that
meet the exact needs of their organization.

00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:15.809
And at the core of the work flow engine is an
Xgrid cluster which means if you have lots

00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:18.059
of podcast programming at the same time, generally
you can do so in parallel.

00:36:18.059 --> 00:36:25.059
And one cool feature we added is integration with Quartz.

00:36:25.059 --> 00:36:28.900
So with that you can actually use Quartz
Composer to compose different compositions.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.910
And then you can apply that to different
media files that you actually captured.

00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:36.429
Which we're going to demo that in a few minutes.

00:36:36.429 --> 00:36:38.769
And this whole system is really scaleable.

00:36:38.769 --> 00:36:42.009
So if you run out of the CPU horsepower
because you have too many podcasts,

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:45.090
add more excerpts to the -- to the Xgrid cluster.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.850
And if you're running out of the disc space,

00:36:48.849 --> 00:36:53.059
Xgrid knows how to expand the volume
dynamically so just buy more hardware.

00:36:53.059 --> 00:36:57.389
So you can start with just a few machines, and
then as your needs grow you can keep adding stuff

00:36:57.389 --> 00:36:59.089
to it until you have something like this.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:36:59.860
( Laughter )

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.519
>> So, some great stuff for us

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:05.190
It's kind of funny.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:08.289
When we talk to our sales people
and say listen and after we explain it.

00:37:08.289 --> 00:37:13.380
And they start to realize the potential of
this technology they get really excited.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.960
And when you get to the scalability portion with
all these hardware things the eyes start to shine

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.079
and you see dollar signs in there and all that stuff.

00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:21.619
( Laughter )

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:24.839
>> Anyway -- delivery.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:32.750
So our default 18 work flows knows to publish to
iTunes and iTunes U to sync to different devices.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.090
You can also deliver to different services.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:43.059
Blog server, QuickTime streaming server, or just dump it
to the Web folder so you can do Web downloading as well.

00:37:43.059 --> 00:37:46.320
And it's also integrated with any mail system,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.130
so you can send an e-mail notification
to users when the podcast is available.

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:54.050
So, nice formatted text with the
link to the podcast.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.410
And of course you can just simply archive to a disk as well.

00:37:56.409 --> 00:38:00.679
So it's a complete system.

00:38:00.679 --> 00:38:05.029
And what I'm going to do now is invite two of
the engineers who are working on this project,

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.130
Kjell Bronder (assumed spelling) and
Nathan Spindel (assumed spelling).

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:16.890
And give us a demo.

00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:17.099
( Applause )

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:18.039
>> Hi. I'm a professor.

00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:20.949
>> And I'm a student.

00:38:20.949 --> 00:38:23.699
>> I really love Podcast Producer,
because it makes it super-simple for me

00:38:23.699 --> 00:38:26.809
to record my biology lectures and
share them with my students.

00:38:26.809 --> 00:38:28.179
Let me show you.

00:38:28.179 --> 00:38:32.699
So I'm walking over to my podium lecture machine,
and I click on Podcast Capture in the dock.

00:38:32.699 --> 00:38:39.059
I clicked on Podcast Capture in the dock.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.990
Here I type in my campus log in and password.

00:38:42.989 --> 00:38:48.799
It's backed by Open Directory, and it's the
same password I use for my e-mail and wireless.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.470
And I click connect.

00:38:49.469 --> 00:38:53.980
And here's I am presented with four
different types of podcasts to make.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:58.210
For now we'll click video, and I'll
come back to this pane in a little bit.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.110
So here we chose which camera we want.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.559
Today I'm lecturing in Mission, so let's choose Mission.

00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:07.289
It's actually a camera connected to Mac Mini right here.

00:39:07.289 --> 00:39:10.230
So now I'll click record, and it
gives me a timer count down.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.750
And I'll begin.

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:20.230
Podcast Producer makes it really easy for
professors to create high quality video podcasts

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.949
of their lectures and share them with students.

00:39:24.289 --> 00:39:26.679
Now we click pause.

00:39:26.679 --> 00:39:29.819
And we have -- a little slip up.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.700
And I'll click publish.

00:39:31.699 --> 00:39:33.829
And here I choose the work flow to publish to.

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:35.599
These are already set up on my T guide (assumed spelling).

00:39:35.599 --> 00:39:37.250
These are three bio classes that I teach.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.090
So I'll type in the title.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:44.050
Which is Rocket Fuel For Your Podcasts.

00:39:47.579 --> 00:39:51.619
Podcasting, WWDC -- and I clicked done.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.210
And at this point my podcast has been submitted.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.630
I can walk away from the podium machine.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.099
I have been automatically logged out.

00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:03.429
In fact it's processing right now
on that Xserve grid over there.

00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:06.179
So let me come back to the screen I showed you before.

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:07.089
I'll click new podcast.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.680
And as I mentioned before, I was already logged out.

00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:15.489
So these are the four types of podcasts
we can make with Podcast Capture.

00:40:15.489 --> 00:40:16.319
The first is video.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.960
As I showed before, we did a remote recording, but you can
also do local recordings from your built in iSight.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.309
Second, is audio.

00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:26.559
Which is audio only podcast for some of the lecture halls

00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:31.199
at Apple University don't have video
facilities , but we can still do audio podcasts.

00:40:31.199 --> 00:40:31.449
Third is screen.

00:40:31.449 --> 00:40:32.659
Screen is really great.

00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:36.609
It's a recording of this Mac's video -- this Mac's display.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.280
So I can record a full scale Keynote
presentation with my voice over it.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:40.410
( Applause )

00:40:40.409 --> 00:40:52.589
>> And finally, File -- we already have
them a movie clip, maybe a TV spot or a clip I made

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:55.300
in an I movie I want to share with my students.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:00.010
So now I'll turn it over to my student Kjell, who
will show you how to consume the podcast I create.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:04.960
>> So as a student I really love Podcast Producer,
because it let's me watch my lectures really easily.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.619
So as most of my other students, we
already have iTunes on all our Macs.

00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:17.949
Most of us have iPod, and I even have an Apple TV in
my dorm room, so I can watch my lectures from my room.

00:41:17.949 --> 00:41:21.649
And for sure, when that new iPhone comes out, I will
be watching my lectures from all over campus with it.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.829
( Laughter )

00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:26.409
>> So I've got this biology lecture
coming up next week -- final -- sorry.

00:41:26.409 --> 00:41:29.149
And I want to prepare for it.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.860
And we went over something this week in this
week's lecture that I want to watch again.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.750
So how do I get that podcast.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.849
I'll show you in Mail.

00:41:39.849 --> 00:41:43.869
I got a new episode notification here.

00:41:43.869 --> 00:41:45.730
So let's click on that.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.960
So I have my new e-mail, Rocket Fuel For Your Podcast.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.050
And it has a little link here saying
that I can get it in iTunes.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:42:06.690
So let me click on iTunes U. So this will bring you straight
to iTunes U. And here I can see all my different classes.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:10.829
So the class that I need to prep for biology 105, Big Cats.

00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:14.610
So let me click on that.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:19.900
And as you can see here, I have all the
content that has been posted for that class.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:24.579
I am not subscribed to this podcast, so
I am going to click Subscribe up here.

00:42:24.579 --> 00:42:26.880
And you'll see it shows up in downloads.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:32.110
And it should show up in -- if it's done downloading
it will show up here in my podcast library.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.070
Let me click here.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:37.370
So now I don't have to up load -- I don't have
to worry about going to iTunes U any more.

00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:41.099
Each time a new episode becomes
available I will automatically get it.

00:42:41.099 --> 00:42:43.480
So let's take a look at this podcast.

00:42:47.389 --> 00:42:51.509
>> Podcast Producer makes it really easy for
professors to make high quality video podcasts

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.010
of their lectures and share them with students.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.580
( Applause )

00:42:55.579 --> 00:42:58.659
>> There you go.

00:43:05.469 --> 00:43:07.719
So you saw the video quality and the
production quality is pretty high.

00:43:07.719 --> 00:43:12.609
I've got this intro video with these nice transitions
and the outro had the title that was overlaid.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.160
And I got the water mark.

00:43:14.159 --> 00:43:15.799
That's all done using Quartz Composer.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.380
So we have this little other example to show you
some crazy ideas you can use -- you can do --

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.300
with Quartz Composer and the power of Quartz Composer.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.880
So let me get that video for you.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.099
>> So here we go.

00:43:28.099 --> 00:43:32.500
Let's play it back --

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:32.769
( Multiple voices speaking )

00:43:33.039 --> 00:43:38.449
>> So you'll see here that we can do some crazy effects that
you might not -- it's really fun, and -- just a lot of fun.

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:41.879
But there's a lot more practical things
that you can actually do with it.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.760
So here we have a little old-style effect.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.200
We have the sepia effect.

00:43:47.199 --> 00:43:49.389
And we can even do some focus corrections.

00:43:49.389 --> 00:43:51.839
So here, since this was in focus, we blurred it to show you.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.590
We can do some color correction.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:44:00.910
We can even do some exposure correction, or do like a glow
effect, if you guys are familiar with the Tiki bar podcast.

00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:02.529
And that's all done post processing --

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.960
( Applause )

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.500
>> So that's how easy it is for us to consume as a student.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:13.019
So just to wrap it up, I really think that Pocket Producer
is really awesome, both for professors and students.

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:18.650
Because for professors, it makes it really, really easy
for them to create high quality podcasts of their lectures.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:23.710
And for students, it's really easy to consume because
they already know how to use iTunes and their iPods.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:24.679
So, back to you Kazu.

00:44:24.679 --> 00:44:37.159
( Applause )
>> Now let's quickly talk about the opportunities here.

00:44:37.159 --> 00:44:38.690
And there are a lot.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:45.610
So if you look at it, when we captured the movie
what we do is actually create the file and send it

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.980
up to the server via P Cast Tool,
which means there's nothing

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.079
that prevents the application from doing the same thing.

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:57.110
From P Cast Tool you can do things like get list of work
force that's available or a bunch of different things.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.440
So you've got a lot of flexibility there.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.179
In fact, we worked with the QuickTime team.

00:45:01.179 --> 00:45:07.199
So now in Leopard, if you go to the QuickTime Player,
there's an option to publish to the Podcast Producer

00:45:07.199 --> 00:45:09.609
and be intreated in, like, a couple days.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:17.430
Another opportunity there is the custom work flows
and tools, and that's probably the biggest area.

00:45:17.429 --> 00:45:21.469
So this is just simply something
that the expert can execute.

00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:25.359
So you can easily come up with a bunch
of different stuff; something creative.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.700
You may want, for example, to take the
audio track and do the voice recognition,

00:45:28.699 --> 00:45:33.679
and then do the captioning, or whatever you want to do.

00:45:33.679 --> 00:45:37.500
And of course you can send it to any
destination you want by writing custom work flows

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:41.849
so you may want integrate into a system or your own platform.

00:45:41.849 --> 00:45:44.630
There are a lot of opportunities here.

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:52.059
And the one thing I should point out is that although this
is called Podcast Producer, and primarily for Podcasting,

00:45:52.059 --> 00:45:56.469
or podcast producing, this really
has nothing to do with podcasting.

00:45:56.469 --> 00:46:02.159
It's a general work flow engine that's
highly scaleable, secure, and customizable.

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:06.029
So if you want you can just pass in
a PDF file and do color separation,

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:10.150
or do DNA sequencing or OCR or anything.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:18.630
So be great if you guys can basically take this technology
and come up with some creative ideas on top of this.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:23.990
So this is a ten minutes summary of Podcast Producer,
it's a complete engine solution,

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:29.629
it's highly scaleable and it's highly
customizable and extensible by people like you.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:33.269
And we have a couple sessions dedicated
to this technology this year.

00:46:33.269 --> 00:46:36.780
The first one, Introducing Podcast
Producer starts at 9 o'clock.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:42.710
So in this session we're going to talk more about -- more
details about what it is and how it works behind the scene.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:46.179
And immediately following that, we have
Deploying Podcast Producer where we are going

00:46:46.179 --> 00:46:49.579
to show you how to create your own custom work flows.

00:46:49.579 --> 00:46:53.139
And we also have a couple of guests from
higher education institutions who are going

00:46:53.139 --> 00:46:56.029
to tell us how they plan to use this technology.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:02.610
So, that's all I have today, and what I'd like to
do is invite Michael Lopp to the stage who can tell us

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.550
about even more features of Leopard Server.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:05.430
Thank you.

00:47:05.429 --> 00:47:12.199
( Applause )

00:47:12.199 --> 00:47:12.569
>> All right.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.800
How you guys doing today?

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.510
That was a very aggressive demo.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:17.810
There were a lot of moving parts there.

00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:18.909
That was incredible.

00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:22.099
I don't know if I can compete; but I think I've got game.

00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:26.269
My name's Michael Lopp, I'm the manager
of Management and Collaboration.

00:47:26.269 --> 00:47:30.949
And we're going to talk to you about management
products, give you a little status report there,

00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:34.529
and then we're going to talk about
iCal server and wiki server.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:37.430
So let's get started.

00:47:37.429 --> 00:47:42.879
So every year whether we have new features
or not, we have these management sessions.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.970
And they're always packed.

00:47:44.969 --> 00:47:47.489
Even if there's no new products, they're always packed.

00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:48.989
And the question is why is that?

00:47:48.989 --> 00:47:52.839
And the reason is we're all managing Macs.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:58.530
Now there's people here who are managing, like, the state
of Maine, bazillion portables, and then there's this person

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.880
up in the front row who's got a G5 and a MacBook.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.940
He's managing it as well.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:10.110
Unfortunately we've got a lot of different management
products that apply to all of the different scenarios.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.760
We've got Apple Remote Desktop, which
we're going to talk about briefly.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.620
We have the system imaging tool, NetBoot,
and then we've got workgroup manager,

00:48:18.619 --> 00:48:22.759
which includes Manage Desktop, or
N C X. So status here really quick.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.800
So A R D -- A R D 3.1 came out in October.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:31.980
The enhancements included Bonjour
Scanner,

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:35.909
Lights Out management support as
well as, even smarter, Smart Lists.

00:48:35.909 --> 00:48:38.309
A lot more options on the Smart List.

00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:43.789
3.2, the agent which ships as part of
Leopard is an updated to support Leopard.

00:48:43.789 --> 00:48:46.670
And it also is included at part of Leopard.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:48.619
So if you have Tiger you have the two agents.

00:48:48.619 --> 00:48:50.940
Now you've got the three agent there.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:55.300
We've also spent some time working in
an adaptive codec as part of this agent.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.220
And the target here is DSL connections.

00:48:57.219 --> 00:48:59.969
We wanted to make it really, really good on DSL connections.

00:48:59.969 --> 00:49:04.779
The technology, which is part of ARD;
the same thing in iChat screen sharing,

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.890
it's the same thing in the screen
sharing utility, which is in the OS.

00:49:07.889 --> 00:49:10.449
These all interoperate.

00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:11.730
There's no competing standards here.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.690
It's all of the C technology.

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:19.670
And then we have system imaging.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:24.990
System imaging -- System Image Utility has a sordid history.

00:49:24.989 --> 00:49:29.949
So I threw it away.

00:49:29.949 --> 00:49:33.819
And built a brand new system of image utility.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:41.630
( Applause )

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:44.550
>> There are two users that we
see for the System Image Utility.

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.680
The beginner user, or the basic user.

00:49:46.679 --> 00:49:49.859
The person who wants to get in and
get out, and just build an image.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:50.880
So sort of a wizard work flow.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.950
You get in, you get out.

00:49:51.949 --> 00:49:56.460
Then we use the Automator technology
to allow you to allow you to develop work flows

00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:00.019
to actually allow you to build more complex images.

00:50:00.019 --> 00:50:02.090
It's just like building a work flow inside of Automator.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:04.390
So we'll be talking more about this later this week.

00:50:04.389 --> 00:50:08.619
The other thing we did inside of NetBoot
is actually give you status back

00:50:08.619 --> 00:50:10.650
for the images you're installing inside of Admin.

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:12.360
So it's no longer this black box of what's going

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.860
on with NetBoot you're actually
getting status back in there as well.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.250
( Applause )

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.510
>> Thank you.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.900
>> All right.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.110
More status.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:23.680
Workgroup manager.

00:50:23.679 --> 00:50:31.480
So, application launch restrictions is a feature
that's been in Manage Desktop for a long time.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:36.380
But eager young minds found very easy ways to get around it.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:43.030
So what I'm happy to report is part of Leopard, we
have very robust application launch restrictions.

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:49.330
What this is, is if you're using a managed desktop, we have
a requirement to not allow certain applications to be run.

00:50:49.329 --> 00:50:50.949
We now block at the kernel level.

00:50:50.949 --> 00:50:55.509
This is going to be really, really tricky.

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:56.430
( Applause )

00:50:56.429 --> 00:50:57.839
>> To get around it.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.970
It's not a test or anything -- we did a good job.

00:51:00.969 --> 00:51:06.939
Trust me. We also have hierarchal
management as part of Manage Desktop.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:12.829
If you're using Manage Desktop you can set preferences as
part of a user, as part of a group, as part of computers.

00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:17.630
What we do now is you actually stack them
hierarchically so we can get really sophisticated

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:20.480
about the different management
policies that you want to construct.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.420
So go crazy.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:27.550
We also now have as part of Manage Desktop, command
line tools to actually get information out --

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.769
( Applause )

00:51:29.769 --> 00:51:31.590
>> -- you guys love the command line tools.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:36.289
Always a round of applause on that.

00:51:36.289 --> 00:51:36.789
That's awesome.

00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:38.059
So, yes, we've got that as well.

00:51:38.059 --> 00:51:41.590
And you can get all the information about
what's going on in mcx. As always,

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.670
we're adding new high level plug-ins in the Manage Desktop.

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:48.909
We now support -- by high level I mean new
plug-ins that you see in workgroup manager.

00:51:48.909 --> 00:51:54.869
We now support Time Machine, all the
Dashboard widgets, Front Row as well.

00:51:54.869 --> 00:52:00.059
And over in portable home directories land, we actually
now allow you to actually do external accounts.

00:52:00.059 --> 00:52:03.590
You can have accounts on external
storage, which is sort of interesting.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:05.670
And we'll talk about that later this week.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:09.260
As well as one step File Vault, and more
(Inaudible) portable home directories.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:12.390
You can actually use File Vault as part of that.

00:52:12.389 --> 00:52:14.000
Again, I'm zipping through all these features.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.679
There are sessions later in the week on
this, but we've got a lot to talk about.

00:52:18.679 --> 00:52:26.899
Speaking of sessions, so -- this Thursday at 9 a.m. the
ARD team is going to be here in one of these rooms.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:30.250
They're actually going to be building
on ARD technology and showing you how

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:33.170
to actually use ARD technology for even larger deployment.

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.389
It's going to be a fascinating session.

00:52:35.389 --> 00:52:40.940
Also, Friday at 2 o'clock we've got
Managing your Client.

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.110
So this is going to be all of work
group manager, and NetBoot as well.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:45.789
So a lot of sessions going on.

00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:47.179
I am sure they will be packed.

00:52:47.179 --> 00:52:49.149
All right.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.740
So that's the management update.

00:52:51.739 --> 00:52:53.309
Let's talk about iCal server.

00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:55.920
We talked about -- we brought this in last year.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.610
And we've been working on it for another year.

00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:59.380
And it's -- sweet.

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:04.030
I want to talk a little bit about what our goal is here.

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:07.620
And I want to talk about it from the Microsoft perspective.

00:53:07.619 --> 00:53:12.109
Which -- in the Microsoft world with calendaring
you've got exchange server in the middle.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:16.780
And if you want to use -- if you want to use
a client you've got Outlook for your desktop.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:18.200
You've got out look for the Web.

00:53:18.199 --> 00:53:20.259
You've got Outlook for phones.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.500
This is terrific.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.460
If you want to use Outlook.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.590
( Laughter )

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:28.690
>> I don't want to use Outlook.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:31.900
So, this is how we view it from an iCal server world.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.269
You've got iCal server in the middle.

00:53:33.269 --> 00:53:38.119
And if you want to use iCal, which
is what I use, you can use it.

00:53:38.119 --> 00:53:44.190
But if you want to use Mozilla's Sunbird, or Mozilla's
Lightening Extension as part of Sunbird -- is that right?

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:46.159
Whatever. You can do that.

00:53:46.159 --> 00:53:48.769
If you want to use Outlook, you can.

00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:50.300
And I'll tell you about that in a second.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:53.890
Or you can use a Web-based browser.

00:53:53.889 --> 00:54:00.920
Or -- this isn't an Apple product, this is Marware's
project X. They're actually using it for project management.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.780
Project management?

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.340
Calendar server?

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.789
What's going on here?

00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:06.230
Think about what project management software needs?

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:07.119
It's got people.

00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:09.469
It's got events, it's got time.

00:54:09.469 --> 00:54:13.799
This sounds like something that
you want in a calendaring system.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.970
What they're using is they're using iCal
server as a repository for their information.

00:54:17.969 --> 00:54:22.819
And this is a great proof point to show what you
get when you build a server on open standards.

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.990
Think of the other applications that can be developed

00:54:24.989 --> 00:54:29.099
when there's no longer this big black
wall around your calendaring information.

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:32.909
That's you get with Exchange server, not with iCal server.

00:54:32.909 --> 00:54:37.389
We get this because we're built on CalDAV.

00:54:37.389 --> 00:54:43.109
This is a standard that we've been working with
-- a company -- organization called CalConnect.

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:45.120
And I'll talk about them in a second.

00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:48.960
What we liked about CalDAV, and we
said this last year, is that it's --

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.150
first off we wanted to see wide-spread vendor support.

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:55.660
But it also doesn't necessarily reinvent all of the wheel.

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:57.960
Just a protocol stack that it builds up CalDAV.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.010
Now at the bottom there's HTTP.
Which we're all familiar with.

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.780
And you've got WebDAV, which has been around a while.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.100
And you've got iCalendar, we use for our accounting file.

00:55:06.099 --> 00:55:07.599
That's an existing standards.

00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:11.170
On top of that still in purple we've got iTip,
which we use for notifications.

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:13.750
And then on top of that we've got CalDAV.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:17.969
CalDAV is a basically WebDAV extensions
for all the scheduling that you need to do.

00:55:17.969 --> 00:55:19.689
Reoccurrence, read busy reports.

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:21.420
Stuff like that.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.389
All the purple's done.

00:55:22.389 --> 00:55:22.969
It's been there.

00:55:22.969 --> 00:55:23.669
We're using it.

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:27.860
We don't have anything new out, but it's doing CalDAV.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.099
So -- so we're working really closely
with the CalConnect folks.

00:55:31.099 --> 00:55:34.420
I'm really happy, as you'll see in
a demo here in a second, with iCal.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:40.280
I really believe that iCal server and iCal is by far the
furtherest along in terms of adopting these standards.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.960
But there's lots of room for everyone to get involved.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.980
This is the kitchen sink slide while
I tell you that what you're getting

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.719
with iCal server is a featured
competitive solution with an exchange.

00:55:51.719 --> 00:55:55.230
I am not going to read all these features, but I
want you to know is we're using this at Apple now.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:58.940
We've got several large engineering
organizations actually on iCal server.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:02.889
And that's a testimony to being
a really rich-featured product.

00:56:02.889 --> 00:56:04.000
It also scales nicely.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.389
It's got to if they use it at Apple.

00:56:06.389 --> 00:56:12.039
Whether you're just using it as a single server or as you
grow and you add more servers, or you add DNS,

00:56:12.039 --> 00:56:17.809
you add more servers, then you put Xsan you're
buying a lot of hardware, this makes us really happy.

00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:21.829
ICal server does a really good
job of scaling and performing.

00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:23.090
So enough of me.

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:26.570
What I would like to do is actually
show you iCal and iCal server.

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:30.240
We've got will Wilfredo Sanchez from the Calendaring team.

00:56:30.239 --> 00:56:38.250
( Applause )

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:40.289
>> You hear me now?

00:56:40.289 --> 00:56:40.779
Here we go.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:46.130
Okay. So as with many server things, the best
way to show it to you is to start with a client.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.430
So we're going to show you iCal here.

00:56:48.429 --> 00:56:49.750
Let's get that launched up.

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:54.400
And as with Tiger, you can have
local calendar information here.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:57:01.410
You can see I go to Tommy's every Monday for tequila,
watch TV, and I'm going to Bourbon and Branch later in the week.

00:57:01.409 --> 00:57:05.190
But up in this middle area, this is all
blanked out because this is my work time.

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.650
And really what I want here is my work calendar.

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:11.889
And my work calendar I need a much richer
sort of interactive environment here.

00:57:11.889 --> 00:57:14.690
So why don't I just go up and bring up iCal preferences.

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:18.750
And as you can see there's a new accounts tab up here.

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:21.360
And I'm going create an account.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.530
Just be unimaginative and call it server calendar.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:33.550
Enter my user name and my password.

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:36.960
And notice that there's some information
-- room here for some server information.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:40.780
But I am not going to bother with that, because iCal
speaks to open directory, as it's actually going to look

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.320
up that information based on the user name I gave it.

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:48.000
And sure enough, when I get this out of the way you can see
that now all of a sudden I've got some information up here.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.039
Now if I were a brand new user to
this, you would see a clean slate.

00:57:51.039 --> 00:57:54.610
Because I've use this at work and
I've already schedule some meetings,

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:58.890
I'm pretty booked up for lunch this week
and I've got a team meeting on Tuesday.

00:57:58.889 --> 00:58:01.789
Now let's set up a theoretical situation.

00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:05.800
Let's say I just buy an expensive house in
San Francisco, you all know they're not cheap.

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.570
And I work for this guy named Michael who you just met.

00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:11.000
And I want a big fat raise.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.519
So I am going to set up a meeting with Michael.

00:58:13.519 --> 00:58:16.579
I am going to select the calendar
I want to schedule it against.

00:58:16.579 --> 00:58:19.769
Set up time for some coffee.

00:58:19.769 --> 00:58:22.809
So it's -- edit this event.

00:58:22.809 --> 00:58:23.869
Call this coffee.

00:58:23.869 --> 00:58:27.460
Won't really make a mention of
the whole raise thing just yet.

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:32.670
Now if I were using Tiger, you know,
like, I'd call him up and say hey Michael,

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:35.889
you've got any time 10 o'clock tomorrow,
can you block that out on your schedule?

00:58:35.889 --> 00:58:37.359
I've got it on mine.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.539
But that's like, so Tiger.

00:58:38.539 --> 00:58:39.289
( Laughter )

00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:43.309
>> And we want to use something cooler.

00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:49.500
So I'm going to go to the attendees field here
and I'm going start typing in Michael's name.

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:53.849
And you can see, again, using opportunity
directory, iCal's finding his information.

00:58:53.849 --> 00:58:57.099
And hit return.

00:58:57.099 --> 00:59:00.380
And let's see if he's available.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:08.680
So I can see -- oh, I actually started
at 9 a.m. here's a head's up view.

00:59:08.679 --> 00:59:11.429
The gray areas here indicate that he's not in the office.

00:59:11.429 --> 00:59:12.980
And obviously I am not either.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:16.230
If there were 12 people in the meeting,
obviously, this would be a taller stack.

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:18.750
He's kind of busy at 10.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:22.110
9 a.m. -- I'm a slacker, I don't want to get up that early.

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:23.970
So let's try tomorrow.

00:59:23.969 --> 00:59:25.189
Looks he's free then.

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:27.150
So let's go ahead and book that.

00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:31.230
I'm going send him this invitation
and send him this dialogue.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:33.460
So there you go; I've scheduled a meeting with Michael.

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:39.780
( Applause )

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.460
>> Let's go ahead and switch users here.

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.920
Let's say that I'm now -- I'm Michael.

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.539
And here's my calendar.

00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:47.820
You see a much busier schedule than mine.

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:51.890
But -- let's see what's going on.

00:59:51.889 --> 00:59:56.159
And sure enough here's a notification
for an invitation to go have some coffee.

00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.339
Michael likes coffee.

00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.809
He's got some free time.

00:59:58.809 --> 01:00:00.570
He replies, and now it's on his calendar.

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:01.610
And viola.

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:03.530
That's how you schedule meetings using iCal in Leopard.

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.930
( Applause )

01:00:03.929 --> 01:00:12.739
>> All right.

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:14.799
Back to the slides.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.620
Please. Thank you.

01:00:17.619 --> 01:00:20.710
So -- great demo by the way.

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:21.429
No raise.

01:00:21.429 --> 01:00:22.569
>> Oh!

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:25.070
>> I am kidding.

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:28.440
It was a great demo.

01:00:31.809 --> 01:00:35.619
Anyway -- so CalConnect is a standard
organization that we're a part of.

01:00:35.619 --> 01:00:37.480
And as you can see there is a lot of names up here.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.849
And this is called a NASCAR slide,
because there's ads everywhere.

01:00:41.849 --> 01:00:44.589
And in the middle of this we've got Apple.

01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:46.570
We're working really closely with all this.

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:49.700
And what I really want you to know is
that there's a lot of different companies

01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:53.149
and universities are a part of CalConnect.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:57.740
As we said last year, Darwin Calendar Server
is an exact duplicate of the iCal server.

01:00:57.739 --> 01:01:03.149
And if you're interested in being a part of the open source
effort you can go to Mac OS forge and you can contribute.

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:05.280
When we check in code, it's showing up there.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.750
So you're on the tip of the tree if you're on Mac OS forge.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:12.400
I also teased you with the idea of Outlook and CalDAV.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.280
There's an open source project called OpenConnector.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.920
Which we've been -- we were aware of.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.789
And this is actually full CalDAV
support from within Outlook.

01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:26.219
It's a fully open source and it works along side Exchange.

01:01:26.219 --> 01:01:30.039
Meaning if you're going exchange an account
you can also have a CalDAV account as well.

01:01:30.039 --> 01:01:33.059
And it's also tested against Outlook.

01:01:33.059 --> 01:01:35.380
Outlook 2002 and Office 2007.

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:40.119
So if you're got concerns about integrating iCal
7 in your world, there's projects like this,

01:01:40.119 --> 01:01:42.409
and I'm assuming there's other ones as well.

01:01:42.409 --> 01:01:47.980
Which exist because -- because
of CalDAV and open standards.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:54.650
So if you want to see more, Wilfredo's going to be up here
demoing and trying to earn his raise Wednesday at 5 o'clock.

01:01:54.650 --> 01:02:01.610
They're going to really get into technical detail, it
is going to be -- it is going to be a great session.

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:05.160
Segue. So you saw a wiki here a little bit earlier.

01:02:05.159 --> 01:02:05.789
Love this icon.

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:10.590
Let's talk a little bit about why we need wikies.

01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:17.650
We've got some great applications as part of Mac OS X.
We've got iChat, we've got Mail, we've got Calendaring.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:20.980
So what is the common thread between
all of these applications?

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.500
The common thread is that it's
between me and it's between you.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.550
I send you mail, you mail it back to me.

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.090
I have an iChat with you, you chat with me.

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:31.700
This information's great, but it's between you and I.

01:02:31.699 --> 01:02:33.829
It's sitting on my hard drive and
it's sitting on your hard drive.

01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:38.279
Of the common thread between all these
applications is that they're one to one.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.540
And the information that we might be having during
the course of a day might be useful to someone else.

01:02:43.539 --> 01:02:46.710
What we want is a one to many application.

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:48.920
And that's something that we think
a wiki is really, really good at.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.269
So that's why we developed the Apple wiki.

01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:56.769
We also developed another application called directory
which is a Cocoa application which ships as part of the OS.

01:02:56.769 --> 01:02:59.800
It's part of the desktop and it's part of the server.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:05.340
This is a great -- not only is it a great directory
viewer, this is something you can actually set up wikies,

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.030
anybody can set up wikies, you set up access controls.

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:11.920
And we'll take a look at that on the demo here in a second.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:19.710
When I say wiki or the product formerly known as teams,
I'm actually talking about a bunch of different services.

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:28.619
I'm talking about a wiki, I'm talking about -- camera's
still on -- I'm talking about blog and podcast.

01:03:28.619 --> 01:03:31.769
I'm talking about calendar, I'm talking about mailing list.

01:03:31.769 --> 01:03:35.530
All of these services are part of the wiki server.

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:37.170
And they're all integrated to work together.

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:41.400
So when you're sitting there in a blog you're
using the same interface that you're using

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.360
as part of wiki, so it's nicely integrated.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.570
So as part of these services, we have tags, we
have RSS, we have search, we have directory.

01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:52.670
So there are a lot of different
ways to use this application.

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:53.710
The design goals are pretty simple.

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:55.059
We want to make it easy to manage.

01:03:55.059 --> 01:03:57.699
Anybody should be able to set these up.

01:03:57.699 --> 01:03:59.079
We shouldn't have to call IT to get them going.

01:03:59.079 --> 01:04:02.429
It should be easy to contribute
and edit, and organize content.

01:04:02.429 --> 01:04:08.669
And it should be easy to customize and
extend and integrate with the server.

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.159
So let's quickly go through the goals.

01:04:10.159 --> 01:04:12.210
This is wikies for the work group.

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:13.800
We love Wikipedia.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.110
But we're trying to target a wiki
for a smaller group of people.

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:18.539
That's a different design challenge.

01:04:18.539 --> 01:04:20.079
We scale and perform great.

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:22.889
But again, we're trying to make
it -- a wiki for a smaller group.

01:04:22.889 --> 01:04:25.849
And I'm picking up speed because
we're running out of the time.

01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:27.619
Again, we want anyone to be able to create them.

01:04:27.619 --> 01:04:31.829
So we don't have any IT costs every time Sally wants a wiki.

01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:34.219
And also we want to integrate with existing infrastructure.

01:04:34.219 --> 01:04:38.359
We want it to integrate with existing investment.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.990
Easy to contribute, edit, and organize.

01:04:39.989 --> 01:04:42.559
This is really where we innovated a lot with the wiki.

01:04:42.559 --> 01:04:43.940
It's WYSIWYG .

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:47.200
Meaning that you go and edit the content, it's rich.

01:04:47.199 --> 01:04:51.500
It's -- we don't want you to think we spent a lot
of time on the interaction design of the wiki.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.269
And you'll see that on the demo.

01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:55.809
We want to give you reasons to come back to wiki.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:58.210
We want to give you reasons to remember
that there's great content in there.

01:04:58.210 --> 01:05:03.269
So we sprinkle a little RSS all over the place,
the search results, the history, all of this.

01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:09.440
In RSS whether you're using it in mail or Newswire,
it's a great way to keep track of information evolving.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.869
Easy on the eyes.

01:05:10.869 --> 01:05:11.730
Lot of themes.

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.070
Lot of Apple-style themes.

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:15.650
Tags that we'll see in a second.

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:17.079
And again, search and RSS.

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:20.619
Lots of goals.

01:05:20.619 --> 01:05:23.650
Easy to customize, extend, and integrate.

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:24.869
Based on standards.

01:05:24.869 --> 01:05:26.219
Of course.

01:05:26.219 --> 01:05:28.219
Themes -- these are just HTML and CSS.

01:05:28.219 --> 01:05:33.679
If you want to role around because you're a
school or a business or whatever -- go for it.

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:35.319
Third party authentication.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.960
We heard you loud and clear.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.730
You've got a lot of different authentication
schemes out there.

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:43.030
So the plug-in architecture to actually go and
allow you to use whatever authentication you want.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:46.660
( Applause )

01:05:46.659 --> 01:05:47.829
>> And then XMLRPC.

01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:52.429
This is -- we'll talk about this more
at our session tomorrow at 10:30.

01:05:52.429 --> 01:05:55.739
But this is a means to get data in
and out of -- in and out of the wiki.

01:05:55.739 --> 01:05:59.289
So -- it's better to see it than talk about it.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.219
So I am going bring Chris LeCroy,
the engineering manager

01:06:01.219 --> 01:06:04.239
for the collaboration team to give
us a quick demo of the wiki

01:06:04.239 --> 01:06:09.389
( Applause )

01:06:09.389 --> 01:06:09.940
>> Thanks Michael.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:18.220
So as Michael mentioned we've -- we've added a bunch
of new collaborative features to Leopard Server.

01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:24.689
I'm going start off showing you directory app, which is
kind of the starting point for much of the wiki stuff.

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:26.090
So here's directory app.

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:27.490
Launch that.

01:06:27.489 --> 01:06:29.659
And what directory app is, is it's a directory browser.

01:06:29.659 --> 01:06:34.899
So what I'm browsing is my actual LDAP directory.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.340
So it's kind of an address book for LDAP.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:44.690
We support -- and I'm kind of operating here in -- as
an imaginary ad agency called Zero Balance Advertising.

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:48.269
So this is the directory for Zero Balance.

01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:54.190
In support -- we support a few different
record types, people, of course.

01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:55.730
We support regular users.

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:58.590
You can also add shared contacts,
anybody can add shared contacts.

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:03.370
So if you've got an organization that has lots of
outside vendors you can add those into the directory

01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:06.559
and everybody can get to that information
easily from wherever they're at.

01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:09.179
We support groups.

01:07:09.179 --> 01:07:09.949
Support locations.

01:07:09.949 --> 01:07:11.399
This is important for calendaring.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.019
You need to have rooms for meetings, and
this hooks directly into iCal server,

01:07:15.019 --> 01:07:20.579
we support maps so you
can see where a room is located.

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:20.960
And resources again.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.929
This is more for calendaring.

01:07:21.929 --> 01:07:29.529
So you can do things like check out a digital
camera or overhead projector for your meetings.

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:31.420
It;s all very searchable.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.710
Pull up my record here.

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:35.750
Oops. Learn how to type.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.159
So here I am.

01:07:39.159 --> 01:07:41.289
It's got all my contact information in it again.

01:07:41.289 --> 01:07:42.289
We have maps there.

01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:45.639
You can see my very, very small office.

01:07:45.639 --> 01:07:48.279
Actually, if I can do that there,
that's the actual size right there.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.190
( Laughter )

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:54.650
>> And go over to the organization tab.

01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:57.230
You can see who my manager is; who I report to.

01:07:57.230 --> 01:08:00.719
These are all clickable and you can
navigate through the organization that way.

01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:03.859
And you can also see the groups that I belong to.

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:07.809
Which leads me to the most important part of the demo.

01:08:07.809 --> 01:08:09.779
I want to talk about groups.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:14.310
So as Michael mentioned the directory
app is where you create wikies.

01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:15.730
So let me show you how easy that is.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:18.710
So I'm not a System Administrator.

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:23.500
I am just an average person at that
-- Zero Balance Advertising -- I've --

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:27.460
we specialize as an ad agency in pharmaceutical companies.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:31.569
And so I'm going to -- and what they do is they
create a separate wiki for each of their ad campaigns.

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:33.009
And that's how they track all of their data.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:34.670
And then the entire project.

01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:41.079
So I've got a new drug coming on that
I need to create an ad campaign for.

01:08:41.079 --> 01:08:43.760
So I just go in, and I do new group.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.340
Name of the group is Dozing.

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.470
As you can guess, it's a sleeping pill.

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:52.990
Give it a name.

01:08:52.989 --> 01:08:55.090
I can give it a description.

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:59.140
I can specify some access controls on this group.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:01.740
I want everybody in the company
to be able to self add themselves,

01:09:01.739 --> 01:09:05.979
because I don't want to have to
manage the entire group for them.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:08.579
I can -- add a few members to it.

01:09:08.579 --> 01:09:13.569
Which will be -- luckily they're
all very alphabetically in place.

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:15.139
So that's good.

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:19.000
Go over the ownership tab.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.159
The ownership -- an owner of the
group is a person who owns that group.

01:09:22.159 --> 01:09:25.019
Like I said, I'm not a System Administrator,
I'm just the guy who created the group.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:27.970
I can also make somebody else the owner
if I want them to manage the group.

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:35.180
But they have the ability to change the configuration of
the group and some of the settings on the wiki itself.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.690
But most importantly, the services panel.

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:43.169
So, over in the services panel I can define
which services I would like this group to have.

01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:52.149
So you've got a mailing list, wiki Web log, a
Web calendar, and a mailing list Web archive,

01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:55.739
which is a Web archive of the mailing
list, so that information is not lost.

01:09:55.739 --> 01:09:58.269
It's kept forever.

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:02.060
And then below that I've got some access
controls I can add onto the group.

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:06.750
So sometimes you want wikies to be completely open,
sometimes you want them to be completely closed.

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:08.560
And we -- provided for that.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.789
So I'd like this wiki to be open to anyone.

01:10:11.789 --> 01:10:16.890
And I would like anyone with the
company -- make it only group members.

01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:18.289
I can make it only authenticated user.

01:10:18.289 --> 01:10:20.949
I am going make this one totally open,
so I don't have to authenticate too much.

01:10:20.949 --> 01:10:23.619
And then I can specify who I would like to be able to write.

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:26.430
And I am going say only group members can write.

01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:28.500
(Inaudible) click save.

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:32.720
And I've already created a wiki.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.720
I didn't have to call the IT department.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.240
There's a wiki.

01:10:35.239 --> 01:10:38.389
And let me show you what that looks
like by clicking on wiki.

01:10:46.739 --> 01:10:47.659
So there's my new wiki.

01:10:47.659 --> 01:10:50.220
It was that simple.

01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:52.850
So I also got as you can see here a blog.

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:55.430
A mailing list.

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:57.470
And let me quickly show you the Web calendar for the group.

01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:00.960
We have a nice -- not sure how
we got a staff meeting already.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.579
Anyway -- oh, from prior demo.

01:11:04.579 --> 01:11:13.380
Got a nice Ajax-based Web calendar where
I can click and drag, create new events,

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.060
like this group is only allowing
members of the group to write.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.700
So I have to authenticate.

01:11:19.699 --> 01:11:26.460
Uh-oh. You know, my demo went perfectly yesterday.

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:30.470
Okay? Okay.

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:33.199
Create a new event.

01:11:33.199 --> 01:11:35.439
Let's do a team lunch.

01:11:37.079 --> 01:11:38.079
Click Okay.

01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:38.789
I can pick that up.

01:11:38.789 --> 01:11:40.970
I can drag it around.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.869
Sorry. I can -- hmm.

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:49.050
Learn how to type or learn how to click.

01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:54.060
I need the iPhone -- click delete.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.070
Goes away in a puff of smoke.

01:11:55.069 --> 01:11:56.019
( Applause )

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.650
>> So that's the calendar.

01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:06.140
I want to go back to the wiki though and
show you that, show you some of the editing.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.320
Let's say I want to create a new page.

01:12:07.319 --> 01:12:08.289
Make it very simple.

01:12:08.289 --> 01:12:11.340
Click the Plus button or New Page button.

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:16.220
And entitle this page Dozing Description.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.070
And click Create.

01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:20.059
So now I've got a new page.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.300
Doesn't have any content in it yet.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:29.310
Rather than make you suffer through my typing
even more, I've got some precanned texture.

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.210
Open that up.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.659
So I'm going paste that in.

01:12:35.659 --> 01:12:39.479
And you can see that all of the
text style has been retained.

01:12:39.479 --> 01:12:41.619
If you look above here you see a tool bar.

01:12:41.619 --> 01:12:52.140
I can do things like make text red, I can select
the paragraph, make it italic, for example.

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:56.140
You know, basically what you would
expect in a native word processor.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:01.800
We've also got very easy ways for you to
do things like add attachments for images.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.779
The wiki can take any kind of an attachment, but
you can imbed things like movies and pictures.

01:13:06.779 --> 01:13:09.219
So let me show you what imbedding a picture looks like.

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.869
I'll click on the media up load link.

01:13:12.869 --> 01:13:15.729
I will go select my file.

01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:17.789
There it is already.

01:13:17.789 --> 01:13:19.350
Got a nice picture of some blue pills.

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:22.440
I am going to keep that centered.

01:13:22.439 --> 01:13:24.889
Click Insert.

01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:33.579
Through the magic of Leopard wiki, it up loads to the server
and has got a nice image there that I can also pick up

01:13:33.579 --> 01:13:37.130
and move around, I can change the word
router alignment on it if I want to.

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:42.829
And then the last thing for editing that
I want to show you is move management.

01:13:42.829 --> 01:13:48.840
So I don't know if you can see it back there, but
I've got a phrase here called Better Bed Rules.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.449
And I'd like to create a link to a new page.

01:13:50.449 --> 01:13:55.880
Most wikies allow you to do things, allow you to
create pages that you're going to fill out later by --

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.069
by putting them in square brackets, for example.

01:13:58.069 --> 01:13:59.920
We've got a more of a whizzy wik way of doing it.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.390
So I select the text.

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:03.840
I click on the wrong button.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.369
Then I go back and click on the right button.

01:14:07.369 --> 01:14:08.640
I've got a few different ways I can link.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.110
I can do new page, I can search for
pages, I can enter a URL directly.

01:14:12.109 --> 01:14:12.929
I want to enter a new page.

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:15.720
So it happens -- oops, I'm sorry.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:19.960
I'm going have to reselect my text
after clicking the wrong button.

01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:23.269
Click Link.

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:24.930
New page. Already got a title in it.

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:26.230
I click Create.

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:30.769
That page I've already created, you can
see I've got a link down here to that page.

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:34.100
And I'll save my page.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.070
Here's the full page.

01:14:35.069 --> 01:14:37.389
I can click on this new link.

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.340
Takes me to a page that I can fill out later.

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.869
Looks pretty easy.

01:14:41.869 --> 01:14:45.689
And I would say show you a little bit more about wikies.

01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:46.689
This is a very empty wiki.

01:14:46.689 --> 01:14:49.819
So I'm going to move over to one
that's already got some content in it.

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:56.329
So this drug is called Oestan.

01:14:56.329 --> 01:14:57.649
( Laughter )

01:14:57.649 --> 01:15:02.449
>> And you'll notice the theme change, like Michael said.

01:15:02.449 --> 01:15:06.420
We ship with a bunch of different themes,
and you can create your own as well.

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:09.630
I want to show you history.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:16.159
So I'm going go to a P H that's got lots of changes in it.

01:15:16.159 --> 01:15:18.579
The OS X side effects list.

01:15:20.359 --> 01:15:21.989
So you want to look at the history of this page.

01:15:21.989 --> 01:15:23.069
I want to see what's changed on it.

01:15:23.069 --> 01:15:25.210
I'm going click on the history button here.

01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:27.149
And make this a little bit bigger for you.

01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:30.229
And you can see that there have been changes made.

01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:33.849
I can click on each of these to see the page as its changed.

01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:35.190
I can make it a little bit easier.

01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:44.969
I can compare and see what was changed on the page itself.

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:46.329
( Applause )

01:15:46.329 --> 01:15:50.789
>> If I decide that I -- that a change is
not relevant or somebody completely screwed

01:15:50.789 --> 01:15:54.939
up the page I can click on that and click Restore.

01:15:54.939 --> 01:15:57.759
Which will cause that version of the page
to become the current version of the page.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.920
So the point here is you really can't mess anything up.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:03.600
This is all versioned in -- controlled through history.

01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:10.690
Next thing I want to do is show you
sort of the main page of wikies.

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:14.640
So I'm going to go back to the homepage.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.829
So every group has what we call a group homepage.

01:16:16.829 --> 01:16:18.949
And it's basically a special wiki page.

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.349
You can't delete it.

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:23.660
It's got some area over here where you
can add basically some welcome content.

01:16:23.659 --> 01:16:26.300
But on the right it's got what we call a dynamic side bar.

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.869
And it's got three sections in this one.

01:16:28.869 --> 01:16:33.010
The What's Hot session at the top
which shows things that people --

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:34.010
( Music )

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:35.010
-- ( Music ) --

01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:35.390
( Applause )

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:42.320
>> It looks like she's holding a statue.

01:16:42.319 --> 01:16:46.049
( Laughter )

01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:49.430
>> Okay. Can somebody turn the music down please?

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:52.610
So What's Hot are things that are people have
marked as hot is important in the company.

01:16:52.609 --> 01:16:54.049
If you watch, I am not touching anything.

01:16:54.050 --> 01:17:02.050
Michael is making changes to a page and dynamically
it's updating in the Web browser -- below that it's

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:06.480
( Applause )

01:17:06.479 --> 01:17:12.239
>> Making changes which shows you things that
have changed recently, and then up coming events

01:17:12.239 --> 01:17:15.809
that are on the calendar that are coming up.

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:18.450
We've got one more thing I want to show you
-- before they kick me off stage --

01:17:18.449 --> 01:17:25.859
>> I want to show you tagging.

01:17:25.859 --> 01:17:27.559
So every page can be tagged.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.970
And the way Michael made that page hot was a
special tag called Hot but tags are very easy.

01:17:32.970 --> 01:17:38.670
So I am going to tag this page with -- whatever I want.

01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:40.350
So side effect of the tag has already been used.

01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:43.579
So that shows up in the little pop up.

01:17:43.579 --> 01:17:46.420
Needs review is one that has already shown up.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.460
Never been tagged.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.680
That one will be here.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.220
That's how you can add tags.

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:58.030
Again, if the tag doesn't belong there you
can drag it off; get rid of it that way.

01:17:58.029 --> 01:18:01.059
( Applause )

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.570
>> Then the important thing about tags
is it allows you to organize things.

01:18:04.569 --> 01:18:06.389
So it's great that now I've got tags on things.

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.860
Now what do I do.

01:18:06.859 --> 01:18:12.359
Well, I can just click on Needs Review
and I can get a list of all the pages

01:18:12.359 --> 01:18:16.159
that have been tagged and I can do more
fine-grained searches.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:19.239
And so anyway, we've been using
it internally at Apple for months.

01:18:19.239 --> 01:18:22.899
And it's become critical to how we get things
done in the software engineering organization.

01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:35.609
And we're looking forward to how other comapnies are
going to use it. It's very powerful -- thanks.

01:18:35.609 --> 01:18:35.969
>> Thank you, Chris.

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:36.570
( Applause )

01:18:36.569 --> 01:18:38.069
>> All right.

01:18:38.069 --> 01:18:39.159
This (Inaudible) aside real quick.

01:18:39.159 --> 01:18:42.000
We're going to keep you here like 30 more seconds.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.869
Slides, please, thank you.

01:18:44.869 --> 01:18:47.079
Just real quick.

01:18:47.079 --> 01:18:48.319
We've got lots of different themes.

01:18:48.319 --> 01:18:50.399
We're going to talk a lot more
about wikies tomorrow at 10:30.

01:18:50.399 --> 01:18:54.509
There's a session, there's a huge amount
of demos, and we'll talk a lot more.

01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:57.900
Standards -- we support Safari on Windows.

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:01.670
Who knew. Firefox and IE 6 and 7.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.609
Firefox 1520, any of the Gecko browsers.

01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:05.869
And publishing a meta Web log.

01:19:05.869 --> 01:19:09.500
We'll go into a lot of other details on how
to get content in and out of the wikies.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:10.970
RSS everywhere.

01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:13.970
And also come to the session tomorrow morning at 10:30.

01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:17.190
We're going to be up here talking a lot about wikies,
we're going to give you guys a little bit more ideas

01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:18.729
about what you can build with this stuff.

01:19:18.729 --> 01:19:20.539
We're going to give you demos, demos, demos.

01:19:20.539 --> 01:19:26.130
And with that I'd like to bring Greg Burns
back up, who might give me a raise sometime.

01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:29.880
>> All right, thanks everyone.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.699
So I've got one important thing
to mention here before we wrap up.

01:19:32.699 --> 01:19:36.149
So -- but first of all we're going
to be shipping Leopard Server.

01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:38.750
It's schedule to ship this fall in October.

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:43.640
And the important thing is that we have a Server
feedback forum which on your calendar was scheduled

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.520
for Friday, but we do want your feedback.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.640
So we have moved it to Tuesday

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.250
So it's --

01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:51.069
( Applause )

01:19:51.069 --> 01:19:54.329
>> It's tomorrow at 5 p.m. so don't believe the calendar.

01:19:54.329 --> 01:19:56.000
Just check the displays outside tomorrow.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.520
I think it's going to be in the Marina Room.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.250
But again, just check the displays.

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.779
Also, we have the IT lab going on all week long.

01:20:01.779 --> 01:20:06.319
We have special sessions for all the services you have seen
here, as well as Apple Remote Desktop and system imaging.

01:20:06.319 --> 01:20:08.099
So we hope to see you there.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:13.660
And if you have any feedback you can contact our
Server evangelist, at macosxserver.apple.com.

01:20:13.659 --> 01:20:14.059
Thank you.
