00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:20.960
( Applause )

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.019
>> My name is Mark Whitmore.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.609
I'm the Engineering Manager for Apple Remote Desktop.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.960
And this is session is on extending Apple
Remote Desktop for large scale deployments.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.469
This is what we're going to go over today.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.739
I know some of you are probably actually new to
Apple Remote Desktop so I'm going to talk a little bit

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.650
about where we are right now with
the Remote Desktop 3.1 update.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.350
Some of the things that we've got coming for Leopard.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.179
And also we've got a lot of feedback from folks
about things that they would like to see extended

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.329
in Remote Desktop especially for large scale deployment.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.420
So we've got several things that we've
tried to do to extend the product.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.280
Just as it is today to help meet some of those needs.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.030
So let's talk about 3.1.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.989
So that came out in November of 2006, last yea r.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.049
And some of the things that we added are a Bonjour
scanner to make it a little bit easier to find machines

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.090
on local network, make it a little more reliable.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.130
Lights out management support for those Xserves
that you could now power on remotely.

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:20.929
Restart notifications after package install
so you're clients out there won't be surprised

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.600
when they're machine restarts after you do your install.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.089
Yeah, that's, that's good.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.020
And also some more Smart List comparators so you can not
only do a match to see when a criteria does match in order

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:37.259
to create a smart list but also
when something doesn't match.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.020
So 3.2, we're working on this
just like we do with every OS release.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.789
We match a compatibility update for Remote Desktop.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.790
This is going to be a free update that's
going to ship the same time as Leopard.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.630
And just like we did with Tiger where we
put the version 1 of the client in the OS,

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:56.689
we're going to put version 3  - version 3 is
going to come with Leopard automatically.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.849
And one of the things that we're adding to one of the
additions to the client is going to be an adaptive quality,

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:09.849
screen sharing codec and this is primarily for low band
width connections so that you get much better response

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.409
when you're just moving windows and things.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:16.159
It'll be, the image will be low resolution as you're
moving things, but you'll get immediate response.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.680
And then as soon as you stop moving things, it,
the image fills in and sharpens and looks nice.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.260
So this is all going to be available in
October 2007 when we release Leopard.

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:32.629
Oh, also I should mention the, the screen
sharing technology is also going to be

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.129
in a separate screen sharing app that's going to ship
with Leopard and you can fire this up either by looking

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.319
on the sidebar under the shared section in the finder.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.729
You'll see the, where the machines listed there.

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:49.019
You can select one and they'll be for all the machines that
have the screen sharing service turned on, you can select

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.580
and just do a screen sharing, so to set basic
functionality remote desk top that a lot

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.590
of people like and that can be built in Leopard.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.099
And also the iChat screen sharing feature,
that's also Remote Desktop under the hood.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.419
Okay, so again for those of you
who are new to Remote Desktop,

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.339
I just want to go over the terminology just a
little bit so you're, so you understand where I'm

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.140
at when I'm talking about various things.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.049
First thing is the clients.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.310
These are the machines that you've
got out there that you're managing.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.420
Then the administrator console, this is the machine
that you're going to run remote desktop dot app on.

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:24.849
And add all your clients to computer lists
in there and perform actions on them.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:33.280
And the test server, the source of some confusion for
some folks is a separate, it's basically the same software

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.680
that runs on the client, but it serves as a process to take
some of the task execution of the shoulders of the remote,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.909
of the remote desktop dot app running
on the administrator console.

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.930
And the client that it works with
right now is install package.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.560
So you can delegate the install
package task to the task server machine

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.949
which is another license copy of Remote Desktop.

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.669
But you don't need to have the admin running on
it, you don't have to have it on the computer list.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:04.949
You just run the admin once, set up a serial number,
indicate this machine is going to be remote task server,

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.839
and then point your administrator console in
the preferences to use this other machine.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.650
And now you can use that when you
want to do a delegated package install.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.990
And the administrator console can then go
offline and the other advantages of that,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.340
the clients can be offline when you set up this task.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.589
So whenever they come online, they'll
connect in, check in with the task server

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.139
and see if there is a package they need to install.

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.379
The other thing that a remote task server does is

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.129
that when clients build report caches,
they upload it to that task server.

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.990
So if it's on all the time, you have a much higher chance
of getting those report caches collected so that later

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.290
on when you run the administrator console,
you could run your reports against it

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.960
and you'll have all your report data there.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:44.609
The other thing it's good for too is for
tracking machines whose IP addresses change.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.939
So if you have a lot of clients on DHCP and they're
moving around a lot, every time they get on the network,

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.139
they report to the task server and
tell it what its new address is.

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.969
So when the administrator console launches, it
checks in with the task server and says, oh, okay,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.580
all these machines changed their IP
addresses, here are the new IP addresses.

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:07.560
If you ever get machines that aren't online anymore, you
gotta scan for them again or their IP address go to 0 0 0,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.870
then if you use a task server, you've a much
less likely chance of that ever happening.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.360
Because that's going to keep track of
where your clients are moving to.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.290
Okay, here's how everything ties together.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.629
The administrator console can send
commands directly to the client.

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.600
It also receives status back from the client
and task progress back from the client.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.700
it also communicates with the task server when its
going to delegate a task to it or if its running report,

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.490
it communicates with the task server and gets the report
results and then clients communicate with the task server

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.670
when they're building their report caches
and sending them up to the task server.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.620
Or if the task server is going to do
install packages against the clients.

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:51.000
Okay, so when I talk about all the features of remote
desktop, I like to break it down to be six different areas

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.620
of software distribution, asset management, remote
administration, remote assistance, automation and set up.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.350
And we're going to go through each one
of these things and talk about a way

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.770
in which we've extended this for a larger scale deployment.

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:06.339
So we're going to start off with software distribution.

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.439
And the first thing I want to do is just
briefly go over what some of the aspects

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.060
of software distribution are in remote desktop.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.720
First you have package install from
installing end packages on the machines.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.480
Then you have file copy for copying files and
folders out to any location on the hard disk.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.050
We also have some preset locations like
a user's desktop folder or fonts folder.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.199
You can delete files, you can run reports like
file search reports or spotlight search report

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.219
and select the files in there and perform a delete.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.140
And auto install, that's the feature that I talked

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.250
about where you can delegate a package
install to a task server machine.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.329
And when they wrote this in 3.1, we made some
significant performance enhancement for file copies.

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:52.829
Its actually 11 times faster then previous, then version 2.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:59.959
So Doug is going to do a brief demo here of, of just how you
use the task server of a delegated installer right now.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:04.269
He's going to have one machine that's offline, its
sleeping right now and one machine that's online.

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:06.289
He's going to perform the package install against it.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.000
It will complete on the first machine.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.759
When he wakes up the second one, it'll
contact the task server in a few moments and,

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.379
and the package installer will initiate on that one.

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:19.589
>> So you can see my machine called
Downing is offline and Abby is online.

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:21.329
I'm going to do an install.

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:23.109
Select a package that's on my desktop.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.170
It's a QuickTime security update.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.000
( Period of silence )

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.339
I'm going to use the task server on this computer.

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:35.029
When I run the install, you'll see that on
Abby it starts up right away and on Downing,

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:37.000
its not doing anything because its offline.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.500
So what I'm going to do is wake up Downing that's
sleeping right now, you can see it over there.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.569
The screen is off.

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:44.550
( Period of silence )

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.879
And I'm going to wake it up.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:48.279
( Period of silence )

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:54.509
And as soon as it wakes up you'll
see that this will start to go.

00:07:54.509 --> 00:08:01.279
( Period of silence )

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:02.589
How we doing over there?

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:07.909
>> Yeah that machine wake up.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.770
>> Is it waking up?

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:12.279
( Laughter )
Hello?

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.549
( Whistling )

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.810
( Laughter )

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.079
( Period of silence )

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:21.529
Is it awake?

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.759
>> No.

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:23.449
( Laughter )

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:24.269
>> Oh you know what?

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:26.299
I might have actually shut it down instead of.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:26.379
>> Oh.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:29.050
>> So we're going to have to bring that one online.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.379
( Laughter )

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:31.699
( Applause )

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:32.559
Did you start it up?

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.869
Yeah, I think I shut it down.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.940
I mean to do sleep, you know.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.190
So I might want to point out that there's two options.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.870
You got a shut down and you got a sleep.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.960
>> I don't have one of these.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.280
Where's the power button on one of these?

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:48.459
I don't have one of these.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.410
( Laughter )

00:08:49.409 --> 00:08:49.879
>> Oh yeah.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.179
>> Is there power on too?

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:52.439
>> Oh, there is goes.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:09:00.890
I'd also like to point out, there's a
power on, could be helpful at this point.

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:03.029
( Period of silence )

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:05.629
So this handles the offline situation.

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:08.189
Whether it's asleep or powered off.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.440
( Period of silence )

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.910
>> This is much better when it happens quickly.

00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:17.309
This is somewhat anticlimactic with this long.

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:17.789
( Laughter )

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:18.179
>> There we go.

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:21.239
>> Okay there we go.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.139
So its.

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:22.710
( Applause )

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.000
>> Thank you.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.990
>> Something similar happened to me
last time I demoed this too last year.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.009
Like okay, great.

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:31.830
So if we can go back to the presenter
machine here, go back to the slides.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.100
( Period of silence )

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.420
Thank you.

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:42.319
So this is, this is basically the
scenario that we just had right here.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.460
You have your administrator machine, in
this case, in this particular example,

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.590
the administrator machine is using its
own local task server, not a remote one.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:56.210
And it delegates those packages to
that and it installs it on the clients.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.950
But let's say you have a lot of, a lot of
machines or a lot of geographic locations

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.460
and you want to have multiple task servers.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.560
You want to be able to distribute the installation
of those packages to all those other task servers

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:16.359
because it's inefficient use of your bandwidth so you
don't have a very fat pipe to of your other locations.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.850
Here's an example of what it is we want
to, this is what we actually want to achieve.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.100
We want to have one top level administrator
who's going to be able to delegate

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:30.610
copy that package out to these other administrators in these
other locations like London, Tokyo, and our example here.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.289
And those machines take care of
installing the packages onto the client.

00:10:34.289 --> 00:10:40.879
So you don't have to do this package install from the
top level administrator to all those other clients directly.

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:48.929
And I'm going to use the term delegation servers in this
example here instead of task servers and what I'm talking

00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:53.729
about in this case is actually another machine
that is running a copy of remote desktop dot app

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.720
because as you'll see in a minute, how we're going to do
this is actually going to require the actual admin running

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.769
on each of those delegation servers.

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:07.850
( Period of silence )
Okay. So how do we do this?

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:14.450
We're going to use Automator to get those packages from the
top level administrator to each of the delegation servers

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.320
which are just other machines that have a
copy of the remote desktop running on it.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.440
So lets quickly go over this script here as to
how we're going to get those packages distributed

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.050
to those other machines.

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:30.699
So first we've got just a little UNIX shell script that
when we, this is going to be a drag and drop Automator action.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.850
So you can just drag a package onto
this Automator action and it'll go ahead

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.350
and install it out to those other machines.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:39.870
So the first thing we do is we take that package
name and we stuff it inside of a temp file.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:47.090
And we echo the name of that package
to our next ARD copy items action.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:54.120
This is  going to take that package and it's going to use
your local copy remote desktop at the top level machine

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.659
and perform this Automator action to copy
that package out to our delegation servers.

00:11:59.659 --> 00:12:04.839
And in this case, what we have is
a list called delegation servers.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:12.480
And that's where our other, that's the list containing the
name of the machines that we want to copy the package out to.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:12.680
( Period of silence )

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:18.549
Okay, step three then is we actually need to copy that
little temp file itself out to all those other machines

00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:24.079
so that they can read it in later with an AppleScript and
figure out which package it is they're supposed to install.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.610
( Period of silence )

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.740
And so then the next item, okay so the next
item is, is to actually copy that temp file out.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.690
So that's the next copy items action.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.760
So now we've got the package in this little
temp file that contains the name of the package

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:41.600
on all of, on all of our delegation servers.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.810
( Period of silence )

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:51.299
Okay, second to last step is the AppleScript
that's going to tell each of these machines

00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:56.370
to perform the delegated package install
using their own local task servers.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.950
So that's going to get each of those sub
delegation servers performing package install.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:07.640
And lastly, we just clean up those temp files.

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:08.120
( Period of silence )

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.529
So that's fine for getting the packages
down and getting the install started.

00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:15.730
But what we really want is to get all that task progress.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:20.360
Because right now, those package installers
are occurring on those delegation servers

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.120
and that's who can see the task progress.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.049
Not the top level machine.

00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:26.329
So the question is how do we deal with this?

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:32.800
And to do that we wrote and application which
we're going to introduce today and make available

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:35.049
through the remote desktop website shortly.

00:13:35.049 --> 00:13:40.269
We're going to actually make not just the application, but
also the source code available too, so you'll be able

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:45.159
to take this, tweak to however you want, customize
it, probably do some other interesting things

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:47.829
that we haven't thought of or didn't have time to do today.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:53.690
So the application is called Remote Desktop
Assistant and in the case of the package install,

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.330
we also have a process called task monitor agent.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:01.540
So let's just take a look at the interface for this.

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:08.449
So this Remote Desktop Assistant is going to display
an entry for each of those delegation servers.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.550
And it's going to display the tasks
that are running under each of those.

00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:16.559
So in this case we've got a distributed package
install and it gives you the data point ramp.

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:18.989
It also gives you a little icon
to indicate success or failure.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.799
And if you select that task you get on
the bottom table, the list of the machines

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:25.659
that were part of that task as well as their status.

00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:28.709
So this is, this is a task status that's coming

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:36.620
from a different remote desktop administrator that's being
shuttled back up to your machine or to some other machine.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.090
( Period of silence )

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.710
So this is an overview of how all the communication works.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.780
So we have the task monitor agent
process that you install and run.

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:48.669
We're going to document all these stuff so you
know exactly how to get this stuff installed.

00:14:48.669 --> 00:14:53.069
And we're going to, Doug's also going to kinda
demo this too so you can see how this goes.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:58.690
We have the task monitor agent that gets
installed on each of the delegation machines.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.150
And as the, as the package is getting installed
and the cache project is going up there,

00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:09.610
that process monitors for changes in the preference
list, the P list files for remote desktop dot app

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.139
and also for the task server that's running on it.

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:16.179
It pulls that out and sends that
up to the top level administrator.

00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:20.379
And the Remote Desktop Assistant which is
running up there is also monitoring for changes

00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:22.070
that are coming from those other machines.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.660
Then it puts it up in the UI.

00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:26.059
( Period of silence )

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:27.559
So here's how we get things started.

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:33.069
We want to transfer everything securely, so we're
going to set up an SSH connection between each

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.040
of our delegation servers and our top level administrator.

00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:38.039
In this case we're probably at San Francisco.

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:44.449
And we have a little register admin application
that goes ahead and sets up this SSH P pair

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.150
so that you can have an automatic SSH
connection between all these machines.

00:15:48.149 --> 00:15:49.470
( Period of silence )

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:54.860
So I'm going to hand it over to Doug again and he's going to
go do a demonstration of how all this stuff works.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.710
>> Right. So the first thing I'm going to show
you is how to configure the registration app

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.350
to tell your delegation server that it
needs to talk back to your top level server

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.800
which in this case is this little laptop I'm running on.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:10.059
So you can see I have a list called delegation servers, and,

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:13.559
which is important because the Automator
workflow references this list name.

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:16.609
And you can change that in Automator
workflow whenever you want.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.930
So I'm going to copy a, the registration app.

00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:25.839
( Period of silence )

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.800
Over to one of my delegation servers.

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:29.689
Let's see.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.240
( Period of silence )

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.899
Have it open when it copies.

00:16:33.899 --> 00:16:38.980
I'm going to take control of this and now what I'm
going to do is enter the information to point back

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.360
to my top level admin which like I said is my laptop.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.509
So the host name is San Francisco.

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:56.740
( Period of silence )

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.110
Registered.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:03.460
Now I'm going to, I've already configured my
other delegation servers, so I bore you with that.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:11.380
And now what I'm going to do is drag that same
QuickTime package onto the workflow drop box.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.920
And, oh shoot, I was supposed to start this up first.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.460
( Period of silence )

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.200
There we go.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.279
So now you can see the task progress
on each one of those servers.

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:23.839
So it's idle on this one.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.519
It's idle on this one.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:28.849
And in a moment you'll start to see it install.

00:17:28.849 --> 00:17:34.059
( Period of silence )

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:35.609
Mac minis are a little bit slow.

00:17:35.609 --> 00:17:37.119
So that one is done.

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:38.809
Let's see if this one is finished.

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:40.250
And that one is finished.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.740
That's it.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.769
( Applause )

00:17:46.769 --> 00:17:48.519
>> Okay, let's go back to the slides.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:53.980
( Period of silence )

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:59.309
Okay so there you saw an example of how we're able to
distribute that package out to those other machines

00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:02.409
and each of those took care of installing
it and set that progress and we're able

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.529
to monitor it using the remote desktop assistant.

00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:08.740
So lets move on to asset management.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:14.319
With asset management, we have with Remote Desktop
the ability to run reports, which I talked about earlier.

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:19.149
Those reports get stored in an SQL database
which you can access remotely or locally.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.910
We also have a remote Spotlight search.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:29.160
You can search across any number of machines, you know
using the Spotlight interface which you're familiar with.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.690
We've got hardware reports and user
history reports, application reports.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:40.410
And you can do all this stuff if you built up the cache
and get it uploaded or if your clients build up the cache

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.080
and they upload it to your task servers, you can
do all this while the machines are offline as well.

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:46.349
( Period of silence )

00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:50.730
So Doug's going to do a quick demo of just
reporting so you can see how it works right now.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:51.980
>> So this is regular reporting.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.460
I'm going to select my delegation servers
and just run a quick report on them.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.440
There you go.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.980
>> Okay. So very simple, just select a bunch
of machines, run your report, get the results.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.589
So I'm going to go back to the slides for a moment.

00:19:05.589 --> 00:19:08.659
( Period of silence )

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:15.380
So again, just like the case of installing the package,
each of these machines is kind of in their own little silo.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.550
They, the administrator only works against
one task server and all the clients,

00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:24.169
you know any reporting they want to do is
only going to come from that one task server.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.080
Let's say you've got lots of task servers out there

00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:30.529
and lots of clients sending their
report results up to those task servers.

00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:33.809
And what you would rather have is something like this.

00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:37.859
Where you've got one top level task
server, bunch of other sub task servers

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:40.339
where clients are sending their report caches up to.

00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:45.849
And you want to take that report data and bring it up to one
top level administrator and have that administrator be able

00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:48.559
to run reports against there against all those clients.

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:51.970
You can imagine in a school district situation
where they might have something like this

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.600
where each school has a task server that's getting report
results and then you a top level administrator office

00:19:56.599 --> 00:20:01.799
which is going to pull all those from
each of those task servers.

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:03.220
So here's, here's how we do this.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:09.910
on, in the case where you want to actually just sort
of pull the, the report data from each of your sub,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:18.450
your other task servers, we have a PHP script that's going
to run and using the post SQL command its going to connect

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.360
over the network to each of the other
machines and pull out the report data

00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:28.389
and merge that into the top level task servers database.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:34.240
Now that would be fine but lets say your top level
administrator isn't going to have all those other clients

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.319
in it, or you know each of the schools is taking
machines away and they're adding new machines and,

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:44.589
you know it'd be too much of a burden to expect the
top level administrator to keep their list in sync

00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:47.500
with all the other changes going
on in all the other locations.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.980
So we've got another script that's going to run and
look at the database and create computer entries

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.509
in your remote desktop computer
database for any new machines

00:20:57.509 --> 00:20:59.829
that got added as a result of running these reports.

00:20:59.829 --> 00:21:05.490
So if we run a report and there's five new machines
at another elementary school, we run this script,

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.259
a computer entry is going to be added
to that top level remote desktop app.

00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:13.650
And you know the very least get reporting access to those.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:18.150
You won't have credentials, but you'll
be able to run reports against it.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.950
So Doug's going to do a demo, showing us how that works.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.660
>> Alright, so here's my, those delegation servers.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.970
Those are going to be my report caches also.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:38.230
And this one is using PHP script so it doesn't look quite
as nice, but these are also available, will be available.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.079
So the first script I'm going to run is called aggregate.

00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:46.649
And what that's going to do is grab all the
caches from my delegation servers and bring them

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.720
up to the task server running on my laptop right here.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.799
>> And there's, you have configuration file right?

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:57.779
>> Yeah, there's a configuration file that
defines all the servers to connect to.

00:21:57.779 --> 00:21:59.649
It's called config dot PHP.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:04.750
So you can see it's processed my three
task servers, Tokyo, London and LA.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:10.109
And but I still don't have the
computers in my all computer list.

00:22:10.109 --> 00:22:13.049
So what I need to do is run another
scripts called add computers.

00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:16.369
And now if you have a remote task
server, I need to point out one thing.

00:22:16.369 --> 00:22:22.250
The aggregate script runs on the remote task server,
but the add computer script runs on the machine

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.039
that you're running the admin client from.

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:26.329
So I'm doing both on the same machine.

00:22:26.329 --> 00:22:32.699
When I run add computers, I get an error right there
that tells me I need to quite Apple Remote Desktop.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.740
Because I'm going to modify the computer database.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.269
So I'm going to close that, run add computers again.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:46.430
Now when I restart Apple Remote Desktop, my
all computers list has a bunch of entries.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:51.310
And you'll notice, I don't have user names and passwords
for all of them, but I can access their report data.

00:22:51.309 --> 00:22:53.980
So I'm going to click on those, run reports.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.970
( Period of silence )

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.799
And then there's the reports for all the computers.

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:00.579
( Applause )

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:01.859
>> Alright, thanks.

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:06.949
( Applause )

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.940
Okay, let's go back to the slides.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.100
( Period of silence )

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:16.709
Okay, remote administration.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.319
So here we have the send use command
which is a very, very popular command.

00:23:20.319 --> 00:23:26.319
Remote desktop lets you execute just about any kind
of UNIX script against a bunch of machines at once

00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:28.779
and get the results back from that script.

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:36.829
Setting start up disk lets you set all your machines
up to a net install server or net boot server.

00:23:36.829 --> 00:23:41.480
Then there's various power management
features like sleep, wake, restart,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.039
power on if you have the Xserve,
locking and unlocking screens.

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:53.440
As well as being able to log out users and
open files on, or open files and applications.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:24:00.309
So I'm actually, Steve Hayman is going to
go ahead and do a demo of send UNIX.

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:07.049
>> So without a doubt, the killer application of
Apple Remote Desktop is this send UNIX command button.

00:24:07.049 --> 00:24:07.669
Who's with me on that?

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.900
( Applause )
Alright. I thank the engineering team for putting that in.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.040
And PHP, who knew that PHP was for
than just you know iPhone apps?

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:16.879
Isn't that amazing?

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.330
( Laughter )

00:24:17.329 --> 00:24:22.210
So those of us who come from a command
line background find this very exciting.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:26.690
You can take a list of computers like this and
execute UNIX commands on them and capture the result.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.970
This has been in ARD for a while.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.890
I just want to show you a couple of simple examples.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.540
I've picked a list of computers.

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:33.950
And we'll run an extremely boring command, date.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.069
I'm just typing in the command name
here and you, if you haven't seen this,

00:24:37.069 --> 00:24:42.490
you have the option of running the command as the user who
is logged in or you can even say that user root if you want.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.049
That will run the command as root,
even if nobody is logged in.

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:46.419
Very handy feature.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.470
So we'll run the exciting command, date and all the output
of the date command comes back into this little window here.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.610
( Cheering )

00:24:51.609 --> 00:24:52.349
Oh, stop.

00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:53.949
( Laughter )

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.200
Now there, there are more interesting commands than that.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.970
I wrote a little command a while
ago called big honking text.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.779
>> All right.

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:03.490
>> Yeah.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.309
( Applause )
>> And big honking text will do a variety of things.

00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:09.529
One of the things it can do is to take
the output of another command like this.

00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:12.970
So this is a command, its not, you can get,
well we're going to make this available to you.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.769
This is already installed in these computers,
so I'm going to run the date command and pipe it

00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:19.710
into big honking text and see what happens.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.829
I'm watching all the machines over here.

00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:22.829
They're all putting the date up on their screen.

00:25:22.829 --> 00:25:26.869
I find this to be incredibly useful
and not only that, incredibly annoying.

00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:31.299
Because if there's work going on in the
labs, I can do, I can do this sort of thing.

00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:36.569
Big honking text also has a dash H option
which with do an authentic Canada goose honk.

00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:36.889
( Goose honk )

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:37.200
( Laughter )

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.700
Very handy.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.309
So.

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:42.759
>> (Unclear)

00:25:42.759 --> 00:25:48.170
>> That's the Canadian thing, man, it's the Canada Goose.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.810
So there's a lot you can do with that, but.

00:25:51.809 --> 00:25:54.389
>> We can go back to the slides for a moment.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.090
>> But there are a couple of limitations.

00:25:56.089 --> 00:25:59.919
That sort of requires that all the
machines be actually online right now.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.070
Send UNIX command sends the UNIX command that
you want to execute to all nine of the computers.

00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:06.569
It does not use the task server.

00:26:06.569 --> 00:26:09.859
So our first though is well what,
what can we do to work around that.

00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:12.869
The task servers as you just saw works great with packages.

00:26:12.869 --> 00:26:17.139
You can install a package on a computer
that happens to be asleep or even off.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:23.270
And once your colleagues figure out how to turn the
computer back on, the package will be installed correctly.

00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:29.220
Well what if we took a package that didn't actually have
any files in it but it has a post installation script?

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.569
That's a feature of packages.

00:26:30.569 --> 00:26:33.200
They contain files which you see here.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.740
And they contain, they contain an
optional script called post flight.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.190
And the post flight script will
run after a package is installed.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.580
There's other, there's other scripts you can put
in the package, a post install and a post upgrade.

00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:50.220
The advantage of post flight is it runs every time,
even if you've installed the package 17 times in a row.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.029
So what would happen if we make, were to make a
package that didn't actually have any files in it

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:57.089
but had one of these post, post flight scripts.

00:26:57.089 --> 00:27:01.429
We could use the task server and this
as a way to execute UNIX commands

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.920
on a whole bunch of machines, even those that are down.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.690
And there's a lot of sophisticated system admin
things you might want to do only to find out that one

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.640
or two of the machines in your lab were down.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.800
Now you can package up those commands
in a package like this.

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.269
I'm going to show you one little idea here.

00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:17.660
If you can go back to the demo
machine here for a sec please.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.580
( Period of silence )
I'm also nothing if not a big Automator fan.

00:27:20.579 --> 00:27:23.559
And I have a little workflow I want to show you here.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.960
Create a payload free package.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:36.370
This is a simple combination of existing Automator
actions that starts out by making an empty folder,

00:27:36.369 --> 00:27:37.919
make temp, might not even know about that one.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.680
Makes an empty folder.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.410
And then it passes that folder to
the existing create package action

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.720
which is something that comes with Automator.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.150
That makes a package out of the previous files
and folders of which there are none in this case.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.090
And that passes the path of the package to the next action.

00:27:55.089 --> 00:28:00.230
So this next action is a little bit of shell script
that takes the package from the previous action

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.690
and adds one of these post flight scripts to it.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.900
I wrote a little template post flight scripts.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.040
So this sticks a post flight script in the package.

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:13.200
And then at the very end, it actually
opens the package, that line there,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.860
in your text editor so you can change something on it.

00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:19.519
So if we actually run this here,
it's going to ask me to create package.

00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:23.500
I'll call this PFP5 and you have all these
options here that you don't need to set.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.410
But it's a nice feature of Automator
in that it will, if you like,

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:31.060
display one of these actions live when the workflow runs.

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:32.079
We'll hit continue.

00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:34.809
That's actually building the package here.

00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:39.329
It's opening up this post flight
script that it added for me.

00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:41.529
It's jumping up and down, I'll make it go away in a second.

00:28:41.529 --> 00:28:45.069
And I get to type my exciting command here.

00:28:45.069 --> 00:28:49.299
How about SC util dash dash get computer name.

00:28:49.299 --> 00:28:54.970
We'll type that into big honking text dash h dash.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.519
You can all think of much more
exciting scripts than this one I'm sure.

00:28:57.519 --> 00:29:01.250
Maybe you want to make a folder or remove
something or change the permissions on a file.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:08.210
If I save that, that's now saved this package on
my desktop with that script right there in it.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.799
Yeah I put that in alright, so yeah.

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:13.700
So we've now got a package that we
can install on a bunch of machines.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.190
Now you know I have found, I'm just a field
guy, but I have found in preparing this session

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.940
with these fine ARD engineering team that they are able

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.660
to implement my secret wishes without,
just by the pure power of thought.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.200
It's incredible.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.210
We were practicing this yesterday and I said, I
said to Mark, wouldn't it be cool if you could,

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.370
you know having selected a list of
computer, just drag a package on them.

00:29:35.369 --> 00:29:38.389
That would be a great feature you
should add in the next release.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.370
And Mark said, you know did it
occur to you to actually try that?

00:29:41.369 --> 00:29:41.639
And he.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:41.950
( Laughter )

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:47.630
And he thought hard for a second and I dragged
it and I dropped it and it takes a moment here,

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:52.890
but that will open up the package install action.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.630
I have my emergency back up joke I may
have to go into here for a second here.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:02.200
( Applause )
So, yeah, I was telling you before that there's a
Canadian and an Iranian went to a German restaurant.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.309
( Laughter )

00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:09.460
And the Canadian guy says to the
Iranian guy, What are you having?

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.480
And the Iranian, oh its back, sorry.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.450
( Laughter )

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.150
so this is when I'll take that package and actually
install it and run it on all of those computers

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.970
and hopefully it will display all
of their, display the host names.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:22.009
We'll watch all of them here.

00:30:22.009 --> 00:30:23.069
There they go and they all honked.

00:30:23.069 --> 00:30:27.970
And because that's a package, I won't do it here,
but that would work with the task server as well.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.589
It would wait if machines were off until they
came back and then execute those commands.

00:30:31.589 --> 00:30:34.709
I think you might find this a very
handy addition to your bag of tricks.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.380
We're packaging this Automator, workflow
and big honking text up and it will all be

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.070
on the remote desktop site as, as Mark said earlier.

00:30:42.069 --> 00:30:43.079
So could we.

00:30:43.079 --> 00:30:44.949
( Applause )

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.870
Could we go back to the slides for a moment?

00:30:46.869 --> 00:30:47.479
Oh it's you, that's right.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.529
We have about one slide for you to do right now, don't we.

00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:50.389
Timed this perfectly.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:50.890
This is brilliant.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.530
Watch this.

00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:52.990
Watch how smooth this is.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.990
>> Remote assistance, the next
feature set of remote desktop.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:03.349
We've got observe and control, very popular feature,
remote observe which you saw Steve kind of demo there,

00:31:03.349 --> 00:31:06.980
also being about to share your screen now
is very good in the educational scenario.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:11.339
Guest access if you, so if someone doesn't want
you to just be able to control their screen,

00:31:11.339 --> 00:31:13.669
you can request access to control their screen.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:21.640
We've got text messaging, there's a widget also that
you can have for just sort of quick viewing a machine.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.170
With drag and drop file copy in the
control window as well as being able

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.840
to send the contents of the clipboard back and forth.

00:31:28.839 --> 00:31:31.250
And also curtain mode.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:37.630
If you need to control a machine but you don't want someone
whose passing by to see what's going on on that machine

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.600
or be able to use the keyboard and interfere in what it
is you're trying to do, that'll just bring a lock up on

00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:47.750
that screen so you can go about
your business and get things done.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.740
So back over to Steve.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.289
>> All right, here's the exciting demo,
can we have the demo machine please here.

00:31:52.289 --> 00:31:55.240
The exciting demo of control screen.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.039
Well, you pick a computer and you go control.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:31:58.299
Okay?

00:31:58.299 --> 00:31:58.669
( Applause )

00:31:58.670 --> 00:31:59.039
( Laughter )

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:01.210
>> Ta da!

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.740
>> Well right, who cares?

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.690
But if I could go back to the slides for a
moment, I'll tell you why we care about that.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:10.880
The way that control works is it talks to
a specific TCP port on the remote computer.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.420
Port, who knows?

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.160
Who can tell me the port?

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.660
5900, that's right.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:21.650
Now, that does not work in a lot of situations.
I like to help my father out from time to time.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:25.320
My father is a great guy, retired civil engineer.

00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:29.169
Dad and I often have a discussion about
the different between a file and a folder.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.560
This is where we are right now.

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:33.549
Actually Dad, Dad actually has a good point.

00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:39.930
He, in his business, the thing that you put
into a filing cabinet with pieces of paper

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.840
in it, each of those is called a file, right?

00:32:42.839 --> 00:32:44.240
You put those in a filing cabinet.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.480
And yet we come over here and we call them folders.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.710
I don't know if we can fix this here right now, but
I'm thinking about my Dad right at the moment, so.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.680
I'd like to help Dad with his computer.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.259
Here's the problem.

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:58.950
Dad's got some router that he bought who
knows where, configured who knows how

00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:59.860
It happens to work.

00:32:59.859 --> 00:33:01.649
How he got it going, I don't know.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.100
And I would like to control his
computer from time to time to help Dad.

00:33:05.099 --> 00:33:08.409
This is me over here, Dad over there.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.570
And the first problem is Dad is 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 2.

00:33:11.569 --> 00:33:14.889
In the TCP world, that is an unroutable address.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.490
It's a network address translation, is a great feature,

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:21.309
but it means you can't get directly
to that address from the outside.

00:33:21.309 --> 00:33:24.829
So if I were to naively try to observe
the computer at 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 2,

00:33:24.829 --> 00:33:28.849
those packets really have no where
to go, they're unroutable.

00:33:28.849 --> 00:33:35.469
The classic solution to this is to try to figure
out Dad's, the address of Dad's mystery router.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:41.319
I don't know if I could get Dad to tell me that piece of
information or the brand of the router or the location

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:42.939
of the router, where he bought the router.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.970
I'm not sure I can get any of this
information out of my Dad.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:49.410
And even if I could, trying to observe
port 5900 on that router is not going to work

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:54.860
because it's not the router itself is not
running the Apple Remote Desktop client.

00:33:54.859 --> 00:34:00.009
Now the standard solution to this is to
figure out port forwarding on the route.

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:02.190
We've all done this for our parents.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:07.250
This is the parental control feature of MAC OS X.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.519
( Applause )

00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:16.980
So if you could, if you could some how talk Dad through
configuring his mystery router to forward port 5900

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.179
from the router to his computer, I would be very impressed.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:27.449
But then you could observe port 5900 on Dad's mystery router
and if of course you would be talking to Dad's computer.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:28.779
I bet you a lot of people have done this right?

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.590
This is a fairly common thing.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:35.200
Honestly though, I think that all though this
would work, the chance of talking someone

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.439
through this on the phone is fairly slim.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.179
And eventually, you just get to the
point and say all right, I'm coming over.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.549
I will be there in a couple hours, just hang on.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.680
But what if you could do this?

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.139
Let's assume you know what you are doing.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.170
( Laughter )

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:55.769
Let's assume for instance that you are sophisticated
enough to locate the power button on an iMac.

00:34:55.769 --> 00:34:59.360
I have a little trouble with that, but.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.099
And let's supposed you have SSH turned
on on your computer, on your computer.

00:35:04.099 --> 00:35:06.089
You have inbound remote log in turned on.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.559
And let's suppose you have their public IP address

00:35:08.559 --> 00:35:12.320
or you have your own mystery router
configured to port 22 back here on the machine.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.559
A lot of us have that right?

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:16.509
We want to be able to do a SSH back to our home computers.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:23.110
If, and this is a big if, if you could
do a clever port forwarding thing,

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:27.950
you can take advantage of a little known feature of
ARD in that you can observe not just an IP address

00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:31.199
but a combination of an IP address and a port.

00:35:31.199 --> 00:35:34.909
If you add local host on your computer,
to the computer list in ARD.

00:35:34.909 --> 00:35:41.079
You can actually edit where it says 127 dot 0
dot 0 dot 1 and tack on a port number at the end.

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:45.409
Let's just say for the sake of argument you're
going to set it up so that ARD will have port 5800

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:49.659
of your local computer on its computer list.

00:35:49.659 --> 00:35:53.369
If you could get you do to do this.

00:35:53.369 --> 00:35:54.619
okay, Dad type this.

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.789
( Laughter )

00:35:56.789 --> 00:36:00.960
I'm going to set up an account for Dad up on my computer.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.130
I'm going to tell him the password.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.320
There are a lot of ifs here.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.640
This does not require me to know
anything about the password.

00:36:10.639 --> 00:36:11.139
Oh this, sorry.

00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:14.129
This is the IP configuration on Dad's
computer, we're starting on Dad's computer

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.269
and we're using features of SSH where it can tunnel ports.

00:36:17.269 --> 00:36:22.710
It can take a port on one computer and encrypt it
via SSH and attach it to a port on another computer.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:28.519
With a command like this, you can set up a pipeline between
the ARD port on Dad's computer through the mystery router

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:31.340
and the inter web to port 5800 on your computer.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:37.769
5800 is just a number that we made up and then
if you said observe 5800 on your local computer,

00:36:37.769 --> 00:36:41.050
it will be tunneled through net properly.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:46.670
You have to stare at the SSH command for a long time before
you figure out whether you've got it in the right order

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:51.329
or not, but there's a little syntax for saying
a port here or a port there, hook them together,

00:36:51.329 --> 00:36:53.630
all encrypted nicely over the SSH protocol.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:59.780
I think I am going to have a hard time talking Dad though
locating terminal application let alone typing SSH.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.960
But it would work.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.349
I'm going to suggest if you want to try this,
you might wrap a little script around it.

00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:06.949
Dad trust me, click on this.

00:37:06.949 --> 00:37:10.480
Let's assume that the problem is
not that his mail is not working.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.519
But in, maybe we send Dad a script.

00:37:12.519 --> 00:37:14.800
Dad, if you were to click on this,
here's a little AppleScript

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:20.230
that would tell the terminal program
to run that SSH command in a window.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:25.610
Its using do script, which is a verb you
can send to terminal in AppleScript.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.170
Note that this is different from do shell script.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.460
Do script tells terminal to go
and run something in a window.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.320
Do shell script does things in the background.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.630
But we want this to hang around,
so we say do script like that.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:39.960
That would pop up a terminal window and Dad
can fill in some passwords and it might work.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.990
There's still a lot you would have to
set up to get this to actually work.

00:37:42.989 --> 00:37:44.159
You would have to have ARD configured.

00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:45.719
We would have to configure the SSH.

00:37:45.719 --> 00:37:50.289
I want to to point out scripting solves all
problems in the world and the programs

00:37:50.289 --> 00:37:52.909
which are scriptable are inherently better
than programs than are not scriptable.

00:37:52.909 --> 00:37:53.299
( Applause )

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:58.580
And that you could, you could write a
script, and when say you, I don't mean me.

00:37:58.579 --> 00:38:00.710
You could write a script that would solve this.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.820
Actually when I say you, I mean Nathan Fischer.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:09.430
If you look on the archives of the Remote Desktop mailing
list from last month, Nathan has put together a nice package

00:38:09.429 --> 00:38:11.409
of scripts that automate this all for you.

00:38:11.409 --> 00:38:14.129
If you go to lists dot apple dot com,
even if you're not on the remote desktop.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.890
But you should probably should be.

00:38:14.889 --> 00:38:16.900
Who's on the remote desktop list?

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.650
Nathan Fischer are you in the audience?

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:20.309
Oh that's too bad.

00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:21.320
I had a big prize here for him.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.289
That's a shame.

00:38:22.289 --> 00:38:26.579
But Nathan's written a lovely package that you can
configure with the IP address and it gives you a thing

00:38:26.579 --> 00:38:28.849
to tell your Dad and run and hooks
up the ports and everything.

00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:31.889
I'd encourage him to go find, I did not
want to give out his address here today,

00:38:31.889 --> 00:38:34.289
but go find that posting on the list and drop him a note.

00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:36.380
Take a look at his script or feel free to write your own.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.210
There are plenty of other variations
of this sort of thing lurking around.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:43.260
Alright, I'm going to toss it back to Mark.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.110
>> Okay, thank you.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:52.579
( Applause )

00:38:52.579 --> 00:38:56.889
Okay, second to last feature area
is automation for remote desktop.

00:38:56.889 --> 00:39:04.739
And here we have a some what rich AppleScript
dictionary for being able to various tasks.

00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:06.219
You've seen Steve use some of that stuff.

00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:08.619
You seen Doug use some of that stuff.

00:39:08.619 --> 00:39:16.349
Automator actions as well, task templates, so that you can
preconfigure a set of arguments for a task and save that,

00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:21.009
so when you select a set of machines you can
apply that task template to that set of machines

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.470
and get your argument set up real very quickly

00:39:22.469 --> 00:39:29.259
It's very especially useful for a send UNIX and also
for certain package installations and file copies

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.660
where you've got a specific set of
locations where you want things to go.

00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:34.349
Last thing is scheduling itself.

00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:39.119
Remote desktop allows you to schedule most of the commands.

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:41.900
And we've seen lots of Automator demos already.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.010
And we're going to see one more and then.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:48.350
( Laughter )
>> We have the demo machine over here.

00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:52.319
>> You may have noticed that ARD, pardon me, ARD
includes a whole pile of Automator actions here.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.800
I don't know how many of you have ever used this, so just
bear with me if I give you a brief example of the basics.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.170
One, one, could do this sort of thing.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:07.260
Let me just create a folder on my desktop, drop here
and I could build a little workflow in Automator

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:14.320
that says get the selected finder items and then
use one of the existing remote desktop actions.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.190
Copy items to computer list and I could
say I want to copy to my WWDC list.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:24.639
And then after the copy is complete,
we would like to open the items.

00:40:24.639 --> 00:40:31.009
And if you were to save this, it would
just be a workflow that anyone could run.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:35.200
A nice feature of Automator is
you can save things as plug ins.

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:39.589
I can save I want to save this as
let's say a folder actions plug in.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.500
Copy and open.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.019
And if you save something like that as what did I save that?

00:40:46.019 --> 00:40:47.679
I didn't mean to do that.

00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:49.389
Pardon me, there are several different ways.

00:40:49.389 --> 00:40:53.089
I meant to save it as a finder, did I save
that as a finder or folder action figure?

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.900
I meant to do this, okay, open seriously.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:57.539
( Laughter )

00:40:57.539 --> 00:41:04.210
This is a finder plug in now which means you can take
things in the finder and you can control click on them

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:10.110
and you get this Automator menu down here that includes
these workflows that you saved to the Automator.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.880
How many people didn't know that?

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.200
That's kind of neat, huh?

00:41:13.199 --> 00:41:16.029
You can give for instance are they K12 people here?

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:20.330
You can give a teacher in a simpler scheme a folder
where they could drag and drop something and it would go

00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:22.440
to all the student's computers and automatically open.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:28.490
They could even drag and drop the URL
out of Safari and drop it in there

00:41:28.489 --> 00:41:31.489
and suddenly every student's computer would
open the same page they're looking at.

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:35.159
This is pretty powerful and I think
honestly under used technique.

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:35.679
But those are.

00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:37.889
I'm not going to do it because it is just
going to make all the machine honk again.

00:41:37.889 --> 00:41:39.429
I'm getting a little tired of that.

00:41:39.429 --> 00:41:40.859
( Laughter )

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.360
But that's one.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:41.970
Here's another one though.

00:41:41.969 --> 00:41:43.230
I wrote this one.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.300
This one that was kinda missing from the kit.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.530
Install packages on computers.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:53.880
So this is the same general idea of copying things over
except it will optionally install things if you like,

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.539
via the task server so I can save this same
workflow and say I want to copy to that, that list.

00:41:59.539 --> 00:42:01.449
I want to run this from the task server.

00:42:01.449 --> 00:42:02.710
I'll save this again.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.800
Wow, holy mackerel.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.990
( Period of silence )

00:42:07.989 --> 00:42:12.459
Install package via task server.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.840
And another feature of this is that if you like and
you click this option thing here, there's a secret box,

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.410
show action when run that many Automator actions have.

00:42:21.409 --> 00:42:23.179
Good idea to check that.

00:42:23.179 --> 00:42:28.409
Because if you, if you're finished with this workflow
now, and I've saved it as install package via task server.

00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:29.440
I can do the same kind of thing.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.639
I can click on something, Automator,
install package via task server.

00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:39.480
And I think I forgot to do what I said, whoa!

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:39.920
There it goes.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.360
But I think I forgot to do what I was talking about.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.220
Just a minute.

00:42:42.219 --> 00:42:43.209
Show action when run, yeah.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.090
Let's try that again.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.720
Sorry. Did I not save?

00:42:46.719 --> 00:42:49.329
That'd be just like me not to save.

00:42:49.329 --> 00:42:52.099
Install, darn it.

00:42:52.099 --> 00:42:54.779
One more time here.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.869
Show action when run.

00:42:56.869 --> 00:43:00.880
Automator installed, I tend to build up a lot of
these because I never get them right in the first try.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.900
This little piece of the UI will pop up,
so you got that little mini application

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:08.349
where people can choose what action they want to do
whether they want to do it via the task server and so on.

00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:10.639
And Automator will take over and go install it.

00:43:10.639 --> 00:43:15.379
I'd like to point out that this one actually remembers
the selected computers that you chose in the workflow,

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.690
which I think a couple of the others maybe don't.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.500
We're going to, we're going to work on that.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:25.690
So I think you'll find all these things a great
way to extend the capabilities of Automator to,

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.559
to make your life a little bit simpler by
building workflows for these common things.

00:43:28.559 --> 00:43:30.719
And in a lot of cases, given the number of users.

00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:32.569
( Period of silence )

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.970
>> Back to you now.

00:43:33.969 --> 00:43:36.289
>> All right, should I actually install it?

00:43:36.289 --> 00:43:38.059
You want to hear one more honk, here we go.

00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:41.630
>> Oh, we don't have time, we don't have time.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:42.309
( Laughter )

00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:46.130
We've only got 31 minutes left1,
we don't have time to do that.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.760
(Unclear) All right, can we have the slides?

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.340
Hurry, hurry the slides, hurry.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:56.140
( Applause )

00:43:56.139 --> 00:44:00.460
>> Okay, so the following area I want to
talk about is set up of the remote desktop.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.070
And I guess have to tie something together here.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:07.600
And labels so you can select machines
and apply different labels to them

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:10.610
and you can create smart lists
based on those labels as well.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.370
You can create smart lists based on a variety of criteria.

00:44:13.369 --> 00:44:15.739
You can create user defined list views.

00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:18.519
So this is, you can add various criteria to your list.

00:44:18.519 --> 00:44:23.960
You have a, you're looking at a computer list, you
got a set of standard columns that are in there,

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.190
but you can also customize that as well and add
other criteria that aren't in there originally.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.190
You can create groups to help organize your sidebar area.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.639
To put various save tasks in there
or schemes that you create.

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:43.000
There's also task history windows that you
can view, things that have gone on before.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.090
There's a user mode for remote desktop so you
can run remote desktop in an unprivileged account

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:53.420
and you can reduce the set of commands that they're
allowed to access, that the user is allowed to access.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:58.400
There's scanners for finding machines as I mentioned
before, we added a bon jour scanner to 3 point 1 update.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:05.450
You've got directory based authentication so you set
a, a key on the client machines and then they'll point,

00:45:05.449 --> 00:45:11.029
then they can use whatever directory server the
client is bound to and you can authenticate that way.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:14.050
And then task lists as well.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.269
( Period of silence )

00:45:16.269 --> 00:45:22.820
So Doug's going to do a quick demo of just basically
creating a list and adding machines to it.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.470
A very common task in remote desktop.

00:45:25.469 --> 00:45:27.939
>> Alright, so here's my scanner with all my machines in it.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.579
>> I think we're actually on the wrong demo machine.

00:45:31.579 --> 00:45:34.789
If we could switch to the second demo machine.

00:45:34.789 --> 00:45:36.699
>> Did I just flip this?

00:45:36.699 --> 00:45:38.719
>> Okay. Great.

00:45:38.719 --> 00:45:40.589
( Period of silence )

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:45.190
>> Right, so I think that I want to control Steve's
computer and mess it up before he has a demo.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:49.599
So I'm going to add that to my all computers list.

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:51.179
Oh I don't know its name, never mind.

00:45:51.179 --> 00:45:53.460
( Period of silence )

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.490
Oh wait, I remember what I was going to do.

00:45:55.489 --> 00:45:56.989
>> You probably want to create a list.

00:45:56.989 --> 00:45:58.409
>> So here's the computers I want.

00:45:58.409 --> 00:46:01.000
I can make a list called my list.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.420
And you can see there they are.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.340
That's it.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:04.850
>> Okay.

00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:05.630
>> Great.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.800
>> So.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.370
( Laughter )

00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:07.819
Real simple.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.809
This is the set up for what's coming up next.

00:46:09.809 --> 00:46:11.259
So if we can go back to the slides.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.360
>> Wait. Someone's been in my machine.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.470
( Background noise )

00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:24.559
>> So this is fine, you create your list, but let's say
again you've got a large organization and you've got a lot

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:27.079
of people who are all managing the same set of machines.

00:46:27.079 --> 00:46:31.739
And you're each going through the effort of creating
these lists and adding machines to them and someone,

00:46:31.739 --> 00:46:36.219
maybe whose a little bit more on top of it, someone else
is keeping that list up to date a little bit better.

00:46:36.219 --> 00:46:40.859
And currently the way that you would you know
share this information if someone were to share it

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:46.930
from a remote desktop is to use the export list command and
you've have to email the results of that to someone else

00:46:46.929 --> 00:46:49.750
or you put it up on a file server
and that person would take it down.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:50.909
And then import that list.

00:46:50.909 --> 00:46:52.789
But the problem is that there's no credentials.

00:46:52.789 --> 00:46:57.920
So its fine if you're using directory based, you
can select all those machines, do a multi get info,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.710
add in your directory based authentication.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.900
But if you're, if you're using local
accounts, it's a little bit more of a hassle.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.789
Plus if you didn't necessarily want to share
that user name and password with someone else,

00:47:06.789 --> 00:47:11.000
you'd rather that credential information just
gets shared over that so they have access

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.909
but they don't necessarily have the user name and password.

00:47:13.909 --> 00:47:16.960
So how are we going to solve this?

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.929
we're going to use the same application that we saw earlier
for the task progress, the remote desktop assistant,

00:47:21.929 --> 00:47:27.119
and its got a second tab if any of you
didn't notice that before for sharing lists.

00:47:27.119 --> 00:47:33.119
And now what you can do is from, you could run this
application on each of your other administrator machines,

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:39.289
and you can configure it to use a machine which
we're just going to call a list sharing machine.

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:41.670
It doesn't have to be running remote desktop software.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.240
It can just be a machine that you've
got set up in a closet some

00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:47.729
where that's always on that you want to use for this purpose.

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:53.949
And what you're going to do is select, run this
application, you know set up an SSH connection to your,

00:47:53.949 --> 00:47:56.359
so you're going to register it to your list sharing machine.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.860
Then you're going to select the list that you want to share.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.360
And then you publish those lists.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.570
And then conversely, you're also going to see all the
lists that were published by other administrators

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:11.120
and you can select those and sync them to your
remote desktop app so the next time you write it,

00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:13.889
you're going to have a fresh copy
of those lists and the clients

00:48:13.889 --> 00:48:17.319
and most importantly the credentials for those clients.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.090
So let's take a brief look at how we get this thing set up.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:27.250
So on each of our machines running remote desktop dot app,
we're going to run this little, um, we're going to run the app

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:30.360
and within it I believe there's the
registration aspect of it, right,

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.300
for getting it connected up to the, to list server.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.860
So if you're, in this example you see that
we type in the list server address on each

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.340
of these machines and that gets it registered.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:46.140
And then each of these admins selects which lists it
is that they want to share and then they publish those.

00:48:46.139 --> 00:48:50.920
So Doug is going to do a demo of how we do list sharing.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.300
>> Right. Alright, I'm going to switch back
over to the remote desktop assistant.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.910
First thing you have to do is configure the list
repository which I've already done, just like Mark showed.

00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:02.460
( Period of silence )

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.590
Gathers the shared list and then when
I flip over to the list sharing tab,

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:10.820
I already published some lists
from my Tokyo and London machines.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:16.539
And if I go through here, I can see the different
computers down below that are in those lists.

00:49:16.539 --> 00:49:20.980
So before I do that though, I'm going to publish my lists.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.610
So I have this one called delegation servers.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.329
I publish it and at that point it
would be available to either London,

00:49:27.329 --> 00:49:29.679
Tokyo or anybody else who's participating in my sharing.

00:49:29.679 --> 00:49:33.589
So I'm going to switch back over to
remote desktop real quickly.

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:37.579
And just to look at my all computers list, I got
three computers that I have configured right now.

00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:42.119
I have one with delegation servers, one with my list.

00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:46.269
I'm going to go back to remote desktop and
I think human resources is the one I want.

00:49:46.269 --> 00:49:49.389
So there's two unpronounceable names down there.

00:49:49.389 --> 00:49:51.049
And I'm going to sync up on that.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:55.310
Right, it's going to tell me remote desktop is
running, just like the aggregator demo earlier.

00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:58.039
It can't be running at the same time when it does the sync.

00:49:58.039 --> 00:49:59.829
So I'm going to turn off remote desktop.

00:49:59.829 --> 00:50:00.349
Sync again.

00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:04.389
Now I want to go back to remote desktop.

00:50:04.389 --> 00:50:09.449
I have the human resources list
that has those two computers in it

00:50:09.449 --> 00:50:13.039
that you noticed didn't appear
before in my all computers list.

00:50:13.039 --> 00:50:23.820
And I have the credentials, I can
observe them and do whatever I need to.

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:24.030
( Applause )

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.170
>> Okay let's go back to the slides.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.630
( Period of silence )

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:35.500
Doug and another member of our team, Brian worked very hard
on those applications, so I just want to say thanks a lot

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.500
of that hard work and they put all
that together, very, very quickly.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.880
( Applause )

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:48.090
So just in closing, we've got the remote desktop 3
point 2 updates coming out when Leopard comes out.

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:52.230
And also the client itself is going to
be, is going to come with Leopard.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:57.369
So we've shown you how remote desktop can be extended to
provide some of the functionality that you've requested.

00:50:57.369 --> 00:51:00.069
We've gotten a lot of feedback and
we're keeping all this stuff in mind.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:04.100
And what you've seen today is, is a clear
indication of the things that we're aware of

00:51:04.099 --> 00:51:06.980
and that you know we're going to focus on in the future.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.349
As I said, also, these applications, all
the scripts, everything you've seen today,

00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:13.759
we're going to make available, hopefully very soon.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.830
You're going to be able to find it linking from this URL.

00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:19.259
We don't know exactly where it's
going to live, but they'll be up there.

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:23.120
All the source code will be there and
we just kinda showed you a brief bit

00:51:23.119 --> 00:51:25.329
of what you can do in terms of extending the product.

00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:27.190
When you take a look at the source code,
you're probably going to be able to figure

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:28.650
out some other interesting stuff you can do.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:33.720
And we're also going to be in the IT lab this afternoon
at 330 and we're going to be able answer more questions

00:51:33.719 --> 00:51:36.369
and maybe even be able to demo some
of this stuff a little bit more.

00:51:36.369 --> 00:51:37.699
>> Wait a minute, I forgot something.

00:51:37.699 --> 00:51:38.939
Wait, give me this machine again.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:40.059
Wait, you know.

00:51:40.059 --> 00:51:42.019
>> Sorry, go back to Steve.

00:51:42.019 --> 00:51:46.280
>> Don't we usually do some completely
pointless and stupid script in this session?

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.420
>> Yeah, yeah I guess so.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:48.869
( Applause )

00:51:48.869 --> 00:51:51.799
>> That makes like all the drive
or the open and doing the wave

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.870
or the marching band comes out on the iMax or something.

00:51:53.869 --> 00:51:54.190
>> Yeah.

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:55.309
>> Do we have time?

00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.789
Do we have time.

00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:56.699
>> Yeah, we got time.

00:51:56.699 --> 00:51:57.679
( Laughter )

00:51:57.679 --> 00:51:59.789
>> I, you know.

00:51:59.789 --> 00:52:00.630
( Period of silence )

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:03.200
I'm from Canada.

00:52:03.199 --> 00:52:05.009
I'm from Ontario in fact.

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:05.860
I'm from southern Ontario.

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.940
And southern Ontario is home to the world's
greatest classical Shakespeare Company,

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.360
the Stratford Shakespearean festival.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:11.860
( Applause )

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.610
And, well we have a few actors in the crowd here.

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:19.120
The, and they put on a, every year they
put on all your Shakespeare classics.

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:22.929
They put on your Macbeth, they put on your
Hamlet, they put on your Cats and your Oklahoma

00:52:22.929 --> 00:52:27.000
and all the other good Shakespearean numbers.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:27.110
And.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.500
( Laughter )
I used to get dragged to those
things when I was a kid, you know.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.650
You're in grade seven and you're studying
you know the King Lear or something.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:38.289
So you go to the play and watch the guy getting his eyes
gauged out and try to follow along in your little book.

00:52:38.289 --> 00:52:39.969
But computers are kinda cool.

00:52:39.969 --> 00:52:47.139
I came across this website that actually has the
complete works of Shakespeare, but marked up in XML.

00:52:47.139 --> 00:52:50.480
And here, for instance, here's, here's Macbeth in XML.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.280
And you can see it's all broken out
into parts and speeches and so on.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.280
I think he wrote it this way.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:56.820
I'm not sure.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:58.530
( Laughter )

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:05.170
So when I, when I see something like that and I realize I
got a rack of computers of here, and I, they're scriptable.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:10.909
What if we had a little script that lets
you pick a play off the list, and I'm going to,

00:53:10.909 --> 00:53:12.420
oop, sound, sound on this machine please.

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:13.170
( Laughter )

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:18.320
What if you could pick a, pick a play off
the list and then have AppleScript look

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.570
at all the parts and assign to different computers.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.980
( Laughter )

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:31.139
>> The Apple remote desktop playhouse presents, the
Tragedy of Macbeth, Act 1, Scene 1, a desert place,

00:53:31.139 --> 00:53:33.619

00:53:33.619 --> 00:53:34.420
>> Here they come, the witches.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.800
>> When shall we three meet again in thunder?

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.900
(Unclear)
>> That will be that.

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:48.240
>> Zarvox, zarvox is third witch,
the two and the four are performance.

00:53:48.239 --> 00:53:49.719
Through says first witch.

00:53:49.719 --> 00:53:52.329
Vicki is the second witch.

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:54.049
Zarvox is the third witch.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:55.630
>> Come gray mocking.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:59.470
>> There's only about another 90 minutes of this.

00:53:59.469 --> 00:53:59.559
( Laughter )

00:53:59.559 --> 00:53:59.659
>> (Unclear)

00:53:59.659 --> 00:53:59.750
( Applause )

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:03.429
>> Oh, wait, hang on.

00:54:03.429 --> 00:54:07.309
Scene two, wait, wait.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.579
>> Enter Duncan, Malcolm.

00:54:12.579 --> 00:54:13.789
>> Here comes some more guys.

00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:14.259
>> Lennox.

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.340
>> I had to watch this in grade 10.

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:15.890
You should too.

00:54:15.889 --> 00:54:18.619
>> Meeting a bleed Sergeant.

00:54:18.619 --> 00:54:19.539
( Laughter )
>> Oh Agnes is Duncan.

00:54:19.539 --> 00:54:20.050
She's great.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:22.470
>> He can report and seen that by his.

00:54:22.469 --> 00:54:25.089
>> All right, all right, enough already.

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:27.059
All right, let's leave that running.

00:54:27.059 --> 00:54:29.880
>> You know, I think we, we something

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.000
I wanted to do something for the
English department this year.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.159
So.

00:54:33.159 --> 00:54:33.819
>> All right.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:43.000
>> This would be a marvelous opportunity
for some Q and A, so.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:52.039
