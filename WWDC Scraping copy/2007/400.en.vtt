00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.700
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Senior Director,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.800
Interactive Media Group,
Peter Graffagnino.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.780
Hi.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.960
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.540
I know it's been a long day,
a lot of interesting and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.120
exciting announcements today.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.420
But this is the last session.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.380
I promise you it'll be worth
it that you stayed here for

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.180
the last session of the day.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.780
So let's get started a little bit.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.750
We talked a lot about Leopard and
all the innovations this morning.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.190
But we in the system software
team have been busy on a few

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.240
other projects this year as well.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.060
Both Apple TV and iPhone contain a lot
of the media and graphics technologies

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.820
that we work on in Leopard as well.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.480
And so, if you look across Apple's entire
product line from Macs to iPhone,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.420
iPods, and Apple TV,
we really have a broad opportunity for

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.930
you guys in a number of different areas.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.920
And I want everyone to kind of
think beyond just addressing

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.540
the desktop and thinking about
some other platforms as well.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.000
So,
one way to kind of look at this universe

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.400
of evolving Apple products is to
think about kind of desktop platform,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.180
the web platform, and the media platform.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.680
And these are, you know,
not unique to Apple.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.900
Everyone out there is sort of
talking about these things.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.300
And a bunch of people think that,
you know,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.460
these are their forces at work and
these are all going to become one thing.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.860
It's going to be a grand universal
runtime to rule everything and it's

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.000
going to play your media and do your
desktop computing and your web computing.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.790
And I guess my take on all that,
and maybe I'm just old,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.860
but I don't think that's going to happen.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.870
I have an analogy for this
just from thinking about,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.420
you know,
how we go about our daily lives.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.620
My desktop, at least my laptop,
I kind of feel is like my home.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.660
I mean, it's my stuff.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.560
The people I, you know,
people I let into my house,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.510
I know I kind of treat them a
little bit differently than someone

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.160
I might just meet on the street.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.890
The web,
I kind of think like the... of the pub or

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.440
the Village Green where it's very social.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.890
You go there, you may meet an old friend,
you may find a new friend,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.010
you may do a little
business with the bank.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.100
But you're kind of out
and social and connected.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.350
And it's a great platform for that, but,
you know, it's not where you live.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.610
Although I guess some
people live in the pub,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.900
but...

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.560
Not everybody.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.340
The media is like a very different
kind of modality for people.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.440
You sit in a, you know,
in a movie theater and all the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980
chairs face the same direction.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.910
You watch the screen,
it's kind of a very passive experience

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.340
where you're transported by a story.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.720
And so I think that these are, you know,
for all time have been

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.320
kind of three different,
different ways we are.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.440
So I think that it's unclear to me that
these platforms are all gonna merge.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.160
It's also unclear for
some technical reasons.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.250
Let's look at the desktop.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.010
The desktop is really all about
performance and responsiveness.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.560
You have your hard disk
drive with lots of storage.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.160
You've got 64-bit computer.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.930
You've got all of the power of the GPU.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.790
You've got potentially
fiber channel connections.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.310
You've got multiple core CPUs.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.690
All of this power is really there
to drive the user experience and

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.260
make the tool or the task that the
user is doing with the computer

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.500
be performant and responsive.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.080
And so there's a big difference when
your data is kind of microseconds

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.060
or milliseconds away than when it
might be minutes or hours away.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.900
Device connectivity.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.600
This is another thing where the
desktop is really essential for

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.080
dealing with things like scanners,
printers, MIDI keyboards,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.730
cameras of all kinds.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.170
So again, you need rich frameworks to
be able to take this data in,

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.000
use it, and put data out again.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.430
And trusted execution.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.660
The desktop is an environment where
it is your stuff on your hard drive,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.520
and the applications you run you trust
to help you to manage your life and to

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.140
build your tools in your personal thing,
just like you might take

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.680
care of things in your house.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.330
So let's talk about the web.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.670
The technical aspects of the web
that I think make it unique are,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.760
for one, its connectedness.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.440
I mean, it is a big cloud out there.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.920
Every site can connect
to every other site.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.850
It's very linked.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.960
It's interconnected.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.420
It's always on.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.500
Again,
it's like a social environment where

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.810
people go to meet and communicate.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.610
The other important thing about the web,
and this is critical to the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.770
web in order to meet that
need of being a social place,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.780
is it's really platform independent.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.340
It doesn't matter if you're
running Windows or Mac or your

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.340
iPhone or Linux or whatever.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.890
You can get on the web.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.890
You can take care of business.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.890
You can meet people.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.600
And also an important leg of
the whole ubiquity of the web

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.770
is that it's based on standards.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.600
So you can have an implementation
that runs on a device or a

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.090
desktop or multiple browsers.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.900
Content Media

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.260
So this is a platform
that has the widest reach.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.860
There's a wide variety of devices
that can play back content and media,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.530
come in all form factors
and different trade-offs.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.990
Form factor, performance, battery life,
connectivity, and all of those things

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.090
make it practically any form
factor device can play media.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.440
And media's really a
narrative experience.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.100
So it's usually a storytelling thing.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.960
You sit back, you get transported,
you go where the story's going to go.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.840
And you're in a different receptive mode.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.770
You're not participating.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.950
You're really being moved by the story.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.710
And lastly,
it's really limited interactivity.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.470
I mean, people tried to do interactive
storytelling with CD-ROMs

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.970
and things like that,
and people didn't really want that.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.680
You really just want to take
where the director and the

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.980
storyteller wanted you to go.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.920
So maybe you can time shift or play,
pause, stop, those kind of things,

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.290
chapter navigation.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.260
But really, you turn it on,
and you just want to be entertained.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.620
So those are some of the
reasons why I think that,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.560
yeah,
we'll see a little blurring of the lines,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.660
but basically these three
platforms remain distinct.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.620
And obviously, they remain critical
to Apple on all fronts.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:17.450
So for example,
in the world of Apple devices,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.160
you could have a great
app on OS X on Leopard.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:24.130
Then you could develop a website,
which would be great on OS X,

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.020
but that website would work
just fine on Windows as well,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.210
especially with WebKit on
Windows now and Safari on Windows.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.200
Or that website could work on your phone.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.170
You saw from Scott today how
great the phone is in being real

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.190
high-fidelity web experience.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:55.400
( Transcript missing )

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:02.060
So all of these platforms
form an ecosystem for content,

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.270
for the web experiences,
and for desktop experiences.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.820
So in summary,
platform richness is really an

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.120
area where the desktop wins because
it's closest to the hardware.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.780
The web is pretty rich,
and Darren's going to have some

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.080
great demos later of web experiences.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.780
And of course,
media is everywhere but not as rich.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.780
Platform connectedness is
really where the web excels.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.090
Desktop is pretty connected as well,
but there's not as much of agreement

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.900
on the protocols that people use for
file sharing and things like that.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:46.890
Media is typically not
a connected experience.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:46.890
People are playing with this area,
but frankly,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:46.890
I'm not sure that's what I want
to do when I'm being entertained.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.470
Now, if you really want to talk about
hitting that broad variety of devices,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.140
whether it's DVD players or your
home theater system or an iPod,

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.860
then media is really everywhere.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.310
And so that's where media really
has an advantage in terms of reach.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.200
So those three platforms are
the way I set up the talk today

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.880
to talk about the desktop,
we're going to talk about the web,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.850
and we're going to talk about
the media and kind of how all of

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.560
these things create opportunity
for you and your applications.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.780
First up is going to be the desktop.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.690
We're going to talk about
Mac OS X Leopard and all the graphics and

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.810
media technologies we have for you there.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.660
And to do that,
I'd like to invite John Stauffer

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.170
up to the stage to take you through
making great desktop applications.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.000
Thank you, Peter, and welcome.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:47.300
So today, I'm going to be talking about
making great desktop applications.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.960
And more specifically,
I'm going to be talking about

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.730
something more dear to my heart,
which is making great desktop

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.360
applications using graphics and
media technologies inside of Leopard.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.820
So let's get started.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.740
So the technologies that
I wanted to highlight,

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.360
that I wanted to encourage
you to learn more about,

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.030
that we wanted to have you look
at in integrating into your

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:17.580
applications is Core Animation,
ImageKit, Core Image, OpenGL,

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.080
and QuickTime.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.590
These are the technologies
that we're going to talk about.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.880
We're going to run through some demos.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.000
We're going to look at some examples.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:32.050
And what's important to understand as
we walk through and we talk about these

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.600
is that these technologies not only
are for enhancing your application,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.040
for enhancing the user
experience of your application,

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.360
but they can perform the heavy
lifting of your application.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.060
They can do a lot of the work that
your application needs to get done.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.590
So to start with, I'm going to read a
quote from a developer,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.660
Will Shipley of Delicious Monster.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.800
And Will has had the chance to use
Core Animation since we seeded it,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.170
and here's what he has to say about it.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.400
"The revolution coming from
Core Animation is akin to the one that

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.410
came from the original Mac in 1984.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.290
We're going to see a whole
new world of user interface

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.180
metaphors with Core Animation."

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.170
summarizes how we feel about it,
and that is that it brings -- it

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.470
enables you as the application
developer to rethink and refactor

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:31.790
your applications to build new
capabilities into your application.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.980
So let's talk about it a little bit.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.030
So at Apple,
we've been doing exactly that.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:47.130
We've been rethinking our applications,
our user interfaces, and--

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.460
We wanted to bring
that capability to you.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.000
We wanted to expose it in a
way that you could do the same.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.900
And that's why we built Core Animation.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.680
We built it for you to do the same
kinds of things we're doing at Apple.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.830
So Core Animation is a
layer-based framework.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:09.300
And what that means is that it's -- a
layer is 2D planes arranged in 3D space.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.990
And Core Animation handles
the animation of those planes

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.840
So Core Automation comes with
a very easy programming model.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.350
It makes it easy for you to leverage it.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.020
Core animation supports
transparencies in these layers,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.730
and it supports all the filter
effects that come with Mac OS X,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.580
all the filter effects that
are part of core image.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.260
It supports multiple media
types in these layers,

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.620
such as text, 2D graphics,

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.680
OpenGL can be embedded
on a layer and animated,

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.300
and the same can be done with QuickTime.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:53.770
So a layer is a fairly
expressive type of media.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.580
And Core Animation is
GPU-accelerated and multithreaded,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:02.090
so it gives you the performance you need
to handle the most demanding animations.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.210
It's a very powerful API.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:11.640
So Core Animation is built to deliver
high production value experiences.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.590
That's what we built it for.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.800
So Time Machine is a great
example of using Core Animation.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:26.280
Time Machine takes what normally would
be a mundane task of backing up files

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.390
and makes it into an interesting,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.900
and usable application for a user.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.410
It takes the content,
it takes the function of that

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.130
application and makes it foremost.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.400
It makes it the thing that everyone,
that the user is focused on.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.440
It makes it clear to use.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.540
So it's a good example of
the type of rethinking,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:48.540
refactoring you can do
with an application.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:55.600
So let's do a demo of Core Animation,
and let's show some examples of

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.460
diving into it a little bit more.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:09.400
So many of you have seen
this demo in the keynote.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.980
But what I want to do is I want
to talk about the mechanics

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.430
behind it a little bit.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.290
So we talked about layers and space.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:22.170
So as you can see,
these are just layers arranged in space.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.240
And the power of core
animation is in its animation,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:27.730
right?

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:33.290
So as I type a search key,
I see that these layers are animating.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.090
And what's important to understand
here is that LayerKit is

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.470
handling that animation for you.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.360
The application is defining
the beginning and the end

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.460
state of those layers in space.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.580
And Core Animation is
moving them there for you.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.530
It's animating those layers in space.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.140
That is all just part
of Core Animation and

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.800
free with Core Animation.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.890
So we also talked a little bit
about different media types

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.680
that can be put onto a layer.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.040
Let's look at that a little bit closer.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:10.700
So we see video here,
but we talked about still images.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.430
So it can handle still images.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.430
It can handle text.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.310
But what's interesting here is
there's another layer behind this.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.560
There's another nugget
of functionality here.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.310
And that is that Core Automation
can handle levels of detail as well.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.320
So I can sit here and zoom into
this PDF that has text on it.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.910
And what happens is Core Animation calls
back to the application and

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.890
asks it to redraw this text.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:40.590
at full resolution.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.200
So as I zoom in,
I'm getting full-quality text,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.810
even though I'm zooming in on a document.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.070
And I can zoom back out,
and Core Animation, again,

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.370
is handling the level of detail.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.380
So, you know,
the same thing can be done with

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.910
other types of PDFs or rendering.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.830
You know, so here's a map.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:00.900
I can zoom in on this.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.060
And again, you can see I'm getting
full-quality rendering.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:12.400
So let's go back to slides.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.940
So that's Core Animation.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.930
So at Apple, we've also been building

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.840
robust image viewing and
thumbnail viewing capabilities

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.440
into our applications and
into the operating system.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.080
And this also led us to build ImageKit.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.080
ImageKit,

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.580
is built for you to be able to do
that same thing in your products,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.250
your applications.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:53.910
So ImageKit is a Cocoa framework that
handles your common image handling tasks.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.260
It has a robust image
view for viewing images,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.140
but it's not just for viewing them.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.800
It handles common editing
tasks like rotate,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.140
crop, scale,
and it can also apply all the

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.020
filter effects of core image.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.780
So you can take the image and
you can perform a whole wealth

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.340
of operations and filtering
tasks on that image in the view.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.210
It also comes with a
high-performance browser,

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.640
thumbnail browser,
and we've spent the time to

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.580
optimize this such that it can
handle a large number of images.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:34.290
In fact,
it can handle up to 250,000 images,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:34.290
so that no matter what
your user is doing,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:34.290
if they happen to

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.160
If you pick their iPhoto
library on their file system,

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.750
your application won't all
of a sudden come to a stop.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.250
It'll actually handle it
robustly and manage that.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.530
It comes with a slideshow and
a picture taker for giving your

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.780
users full-screen picture viewing
and integration with the camera.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.100
And it leverages Core Animation.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.920
So this is a technology that
layers on top of Core Animation for

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.240
some of its functionality.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.410
So let's go back and let's
look at a demo of that.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.510
So here we see a fairly
basic application.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.030
On the top, where the fish are,
that is the image view.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.510
The bottom section of the screen,
where the thumbnails,

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.290
that is the image browser.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.790
So as I said, you can perform basic
operations like rotates.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.180
You can perform scales.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.340
And that's all just built in.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.900
At the bottom here,
we have the thumbnail browser.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.910
And you can see that it
gives you smooth scrolling,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.540
but it handles other
types of tasks as well.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.180
For instance,
if I select some images and I move them,

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:59.070
the image browser automatically handles
the animation and the reordering,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.070
so it gives you a smooth,
polished look of

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.070
managing your thumbnails.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.500
So right now I have 46 images in here.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.570
Let's throw another 5,000 in there.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.960
Just drag it and drop it in there.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.670
You can see very quickly
it imported those.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.540
They're very responsive.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.140
And again,
I can sit here and just scroll these.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:22.290
And as I scroll quickly
through these thumbnails,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:22.990
ImageKit is off building
the thumbnails for me,

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:22.990
building the thumbnails
and displaying them.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.410
But what it can also do is,
let's say I scale these thumbnails.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.050
Core animation, I'm sorry,
ImageKit is off building the

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.440
thumbnails at the new resolution.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:41.900
So it's all very easy for you
to have this kind of capability

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.760
built into your application.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.970
OK, let's go back to slides.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.230
Core Image.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:06.100
So Core Image is not new for Leopard,
but it's a technology that we

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.560
have continued to invest in.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.060
It's a technology that we
feel is a key technology,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:19.130
and it is the backbone of image
processing inside the operating system.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:27.900
( Transcript missing )

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.520
We've made it extensible through
custom image units so you can

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.900
write your own effects and extend
the capability of core image.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.060
And it's based on a full
floating point implementation,

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.650
meaning that you get professional-grade
image processing in your application.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.070
Like our other technologies,
we spent the time to GPU accelerate

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.430
and multi-thread core image.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.720
And Core Image, like I mentioned before,
it is used by some of

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.100
our other technologies,
like Core Animation and ImageKit.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:05.240
It is the filter effects
technology in those APIs.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.660
So new for Leopard,
we've added 25 new effects.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.590
We've added 64-bit support for
handling those large images.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.900
And we've enhanced performance.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.140
In some cases, we've enhanced performance
by as much as 10x.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.880
So we've been investing
and improving this,

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.680
and it's going to be a great
technology for Leopard.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.300
OpenGL.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.530
So OpenGL, we look at it as the bedrock
of graphics on Mac OS X.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:40.690
It is the harder abstraction
layer at which you access the GPU.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.490
It is that lowest level API.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.340
Many of the technologies that
we've been talking about,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.480
and many others, directly or indirectly,
leverage OpenGL to accelerate

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.120
through the graphics processor.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.540
So OpenGL is an industry standard.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.340
Apple works with companies like NVIDIA,
ATI,

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.780
and Intel to continue to further OpenGL,
make it better for developers,

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.230
easier to leverage functionality,
more efficient, but also to expose new

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.680
hardware functionality.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.940
We make it such that as
new hardware comes out,

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.120
we work with the standards
body to get that exposed

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.690
functionality in the standard.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.820
New in Leopard is OpenGL 2.1,
and that includes GLSL 1.2,

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.200
the high-level shading language.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.880
And like many of our other technologies,
we've spent the time to multithread it

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.750
to make it efficient on your system,
optimized so that it runs

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.320
at maximum performance.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.430
We've also built a 64-bit version,
so you can integrate this

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.380
into your 64-bit applications.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:47.320
And part of the new shader language
is what we call Generation 4 shaders,

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.050
and that includes geometry shaders.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.940
So now we have a new functional
programmable block on the pipeline,

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.800
which is geometry shaders.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.980
And we've improved the tools.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.040
We've spent the time to
improve OpenGL Profiler and

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.120
OpenGL Driver Monitor for debugging
and optimizing our applications.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:11.480
And we've improved Shader Builder
for building your shader effects.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:20.600
So some of you have probably
seen John Carmack's technology

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.960
demonstration in the keynote.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.290
This represents his--

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.400
Fifth-generation game engine.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.390
And we think this is a really
good example of what can be

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.400
done with the power of OpenGL.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.990
We think this is a great
example of building an immersive

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.030
3D cinematic application.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:44.100
And this is the kind of applications
that we hope are around the corner,

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.830
that we're going to start seeing more and
more of on the platform as the graphics

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.400
processor and the APIs to drive that
get more flexible and more powerful.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.660
So let's talk about QuickTime.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.020
QuickTime is another key technology
that we invest in at Apple.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:06.180
We've been investing
heavily in improving.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.960
An area we've been investing in is QtKit.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.480
QtKit is the Cocoa framework for
accessing QuickTime functionality,

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.750
and it makes integrating
QuickTime functionality

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.790
into your application easy.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.880
It also supports core animation.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.650
Like I had mentioned before,
you can embed a

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.940
QuickTime movie onto a layer,
allowing you to perform animations.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.940
And we've added some new
API in QtKit for Leopard,

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.760
and that is it supports device capture.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.390
You can capture video from iSights
and many USB and FireWire cameras.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.160
And it also supports 64-bit.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.240
This is the only way to
get QuickTime support

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.400
in a 64-bit application.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.650
So let's look at a demo.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.240
And to do that,
I'm going to invite Geoff Staahl,

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.000
the 3D graphics engineering manager,
up on the stage.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.750
And we're going to look at
a demo of World of Warcraft.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:12.220
And this is an interesting demo
because it combines two technologies,

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.360
OpenGL and QuickTime together to bring
new capabilities to an application,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.680
new user functionality.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.800
And we thought it would be interesting to
look at this and see how that was done.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.680
So with that,
I'm going to hand it over to Geoff.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.330
GEOFF STALL: Thanks, John.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.420
We can go ahead and switch
to the demo machine.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.530
And what we're going to show here is
a little bit different than last year.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.980
Last year,
we showed how Blizzard has taken

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.260
advantage of multi-threaded
OpenGL to greatly enhance the

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.510
performance of their application.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.170
In this case,
we're going to show how Blizzard has

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.410
taken a synergy of some of the
technologies we have here to

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.230
greatly enhance the user experience,
allowing players to create great

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.580
machinima productions in-game.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:26:00.250
What we're demonstrating is a new update
coming very shortly from Blizzard for

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.140
Mac OS X that will allow in-game movie
capture and compression on the fly.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.080
So let's jump right in and show
you what you're going to have.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.680
So if we look under Mac Options,
now we have the ability to

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.180
control movie recording.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.740
We're going to be recording
for the demo at 1024x768,

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.360
30 frames per second,
and using an H.264 codec

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.490
to compress on the fly.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.530
So as we run around,
one of the keys here is to

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.780
actually integrate this into your
player experience so it doesn't

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.070
really affect your gameplay.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.960
So I've just enabled the video capture.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.610
And if you notice,
the gameplay is still extremely fluid.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:44.910
Using the power of the GPU and
the multicore on this system,

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:50.350
Blizzard has been able to put the video
capture in and the on-the-fly compression

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.040
without detriment to your gameplay.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.070
So once you finish your adventure,
you can head back to the

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.380
campfire to tell tall tales.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.440
And you can show who really
was the hero for that day.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.330
You see the compression is finishing
up here as I'm heading back out.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:07.050
And this will compress into
a QuickTime movie that we

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:11.550
can then send to your mom,
sync to your iPod.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:19.380
Send to your Apple TV or to your
iPhone or even make a great website.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.690
So let's hop down and look at
the movie we've just created.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.450
Launching in QuickTime,
this is the movie we just created,

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.250
1024 by 768, 30 frames per second,
on-the-fly compression,

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.640
and the gameplay still is tremendous.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.490
So this is a great example
of how Blizzard has taken,

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.480
again, a synergy of these technologies,
OpenGL, QuickTime,

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.880
the GPU and multi-core CPUs,
combined them together to create a great,

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.360
enhanced user experience.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.570
Thanks a lot, and back to John.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:54.570
JOHN STAFFER: Thank you, Geoff.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.410
So that's a great example of
combining two technologies to

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.110
bring a new functionality or a new
capability to your application.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.280
And that brings me to Quartz Composer.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.840
Quartz Composer is a
technology that does just that.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:14.140
Quartz Composer integrates many
of the interesting technologies in

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:19.560
Mac OS X into an easy-to-use framework.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.960
Quartz Composer is for building stunning
motion graphics and visual effects.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.580
That's what Quartz Composer is built for.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.510
But further,
Quartz Composer comes with a tool that

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:34.540
allows you to build these visual effects,
and we call them compositions,

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.510
in a visual programming model.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.280
You can launch this tool,
and you can build visual effects

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.950
without writing a single line of code.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.820
And that's one of the really
powerful parts of Quartz Composer,

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.170
is the tool that allows you to do this.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.140
It makes it an artistic process,
not a programming process.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.510
So these compositions are easily
integrated into your application.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.000
And so new for Leopard,
what we've done is we've

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.500
added the ability for you
to write your own patches.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.240
Patches are the functional
blocks of a composition,

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.080
the logical functional blocks.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.570
So you can write your own
patches so you can extend the

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:11.570
capability of Quartz Composer.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.590
And what we've also done for Leopard is
we've built a system-wide composition

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:20.000
repository where compositions can
be shared between applications.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.640
So, for example, Photo Booth, iChat,
and Automator use the compositions

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.600
in this shared repository.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.670
You can build a composition,
add it to that repository,

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.840
and automatically extend the
functionality of those applications.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.450
Those applications will pick those
compositions up and they'll become

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.980
available in those applications.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.380
So that's a great way to share
compositions between your

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.270
applications or other applications.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.260
So we've added new and
updated the current patches.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.130
We've been putting a lot of
work into enhancing those,

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.350
the patches that come
with Quartz Composer.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.000
And we've completely
rewritten the visual editor.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.410
We've rewritten it from the ground up,
making it even easier and more

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.280
flexible for you to build compositions.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.640
So that's Quartz Composer.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.660
So something we're doing
that's interesting this year

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.940
is we have a display wall.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:15.040
Some of you may have seen it already,
but it's something you have to go see.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.690
It's down in the Graphics & Media lab.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.440
It's a massive video wall display.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.880
And this is based on Quartz Composer,
and it shows the flexibility

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.190
that Quartz Composer has.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.190
Quartz Composer brings very flexible
technologies into a single package.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.840
So we talked about a few technologies.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.150
We highlighted a few.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:43.400
Don't forget, there's a whole array of
technologies in Mac OS X and Leopard.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.100
And we encourage you to go to all
the sessions and learn about the

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.540
graphics and media technologies
that are built right in,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.980
technologies that will not
only enhance your application,

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:57.580
but make your application optimized
for the system and do the heavy

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.500
lifting for your application.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.030
These are fantastic technologies
that should make your jobs easy.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.860
Easier.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.390
So with that, I'm going to hand the
stage back to Peter.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.560
Thank you.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.900
PETER GRAFFANINO: Thanks, John.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.900
Thanks, John.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.100
So that's a little brief tour
of Leopard and some of the

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.110
new things we have for you.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.830
As John mentioned, there's tons of stuff,
lots of sessions, so please check out all

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.090
the great Leopard stuff.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.240
I'd like to talk a little bit
about Mac OS X to kind of set

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.340
the stage for the web section.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.810
Mac OS X is a layered architecture,
and that's really stood us well over

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.890
the test of time with the applications
and frameworks on top of graphics and,

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.740
of course, the OS stack.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.830
So we've got a lot of stuff underneath.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.630
And if you think about it and
squint your eyes a little bit,

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.720
the web is sort of
designed in the same way.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.780
There's websites,
which are kind of all the

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.560
applications that run on the web.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.370
There's an HTML engine,
which provides the framework.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.290
There's a graphics layer underneath that
that supports the HTML engine for text

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:07.930
and graphics and an operating system,
obviously, for the device that the

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.790
browser is running on.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.480
And really, if you think about Apple's
implementation of the web,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:20.000
it really is all about... And one
thing we haven't mentioned so far is

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.580
that actually the Quartz 2D API moves
with WebKit wherever WebKit goes.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.580
And so both iPhone and the
Windows implementation of

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.840
WebKit rely on Quartz 2D.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.900
That's why we get such great
rendering fidelity across platform.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.760
And, of course, QuickTime,
the QuickTime plugin,

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.340
plugs right into WebKit to provide
rich media services as well.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.560
So if you look at all the things
we're doing in this space,

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:45.140
it's a pretty compelling platform.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.510
And to talk about that...
Across all of our products.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.370
Sorry, I missed that click.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.000
But to talk about this,
I'm going to invite Darren Adler

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.650
up to the stage to talk
about Apple's web technology.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.650
Thank you.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:04.680
Thanks, Peter.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.900
So even though I'm the manager of
the team that developed Safari,

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.940
I'm not really talking
just about Safari today.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.090
I want to take you on a quick
tour through the world of web

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.220
applications and web technology.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.000
So first,
let's get a little bit of context.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.190
Here's a picture you've seen
earlier today a couple times,

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.840
desktop as of 1984.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:29.980
The state of the art in terms of the look
with those snazzy rounded corners around

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.970
the screen and in the user interface.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.020
The desktop has changed a lot.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:39.400
If you take a look at desktop today,
you see a lot more media,

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:48.010
pictures everywhere, graphics,
and also a lot more richness.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.930
Well, the same kind of thing
has happened with the web.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:56.710
Here's the web as it looked in the Mosaic
browser at the dawn of the web in 1993.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.860
And websites are mostly
about text and links.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.260
There are plenty of pictures in them,
but occasionally.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.260
And the web has also changed.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.410
Alongside the desktop,
the web is also now full of media.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.640
Even a website like the
New York Times that's still basically

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:17.500
about some information and some links
is full of elements that have media,

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.290
have interaction.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:25.790
And this is what it looks like in
a modern browser like Safari 3.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.420
Both of these platforms,
the web technologies and

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.600
the desktop platforms,
are obviously going to keep moving.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.520
And what happens is that capabilities
that were something you'd find

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.760
only on the desktop in years
past become something that's

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.930
achievable with web technology.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.490
I'll show you what I mean
by that in a moment.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.200
So what are some of the
distinguishing things about the web?

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.600
Well,
we talked about the connectedness of the

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:53.590
web and also the ubiquity of the web.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.870
If you take these four,
these are the top four

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:58.950
browsers by market share,
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari,

00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.640
and Opera.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.950
If you take these four,
they cover a huge variety

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:07.470
of devices and platforms,
everything from a kiosk in an airport,

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:10.300
desktop computers, game consoles.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.200
You're going to be able to
get web content all over

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.100
the place because of these.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.170
And what makes it work across all
these different browsers is the way

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.540
that we cooperate and use standards.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:28.480
But even if you just think
about Safari 3 and WebKit,

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:32.490
this is something that
you've got on Mac OS X,

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.860
you've got on iPhone,
and also on Windows.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.310
So there's a lot of reach to web content.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.340
So what is a web application?

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.800
Well, a lot of times you might
hear the term Web 2.0.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.390
And this was coined a few
years back by Tim O'Reilly,

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.680
the famous technologist
and book publisher.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:57.490
And it's really about a new generation
of websites that are different

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.200
from the websites on the early web.

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.430
The kinds of things that we're
talking about when we talk about

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:07.260
Web 2.0 are websites that involve
participation and also websites

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:11.080
that start to have a feel that's
less about moving from page to page.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.380
And more like what you associate
with a desktop application.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.080
So now let's take a look at
some of these web applications

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.460
to show what I'm talking about.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.470
Wikipedia is an interesting example.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.980
You take a look at this page full of
information like an encyclopedia page.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.250
And there's nothing there that
particularly makes it Web 2.0.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.000
But the key is the
interaction and participation.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.690
If you know more about
the Adelie Penguin and you

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:41.280
want to add it to the site,
you edit it using this link.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.820
Wikipedia's editor.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.860
One of the seminal web applications
that had a lot of impact on

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:55.340
what everybody thinks of being
possible on the web is Google Maps.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.140
Again, this is an application that when
you're using the map and manipulating

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.930
it and searching for things,
you're not moving between web pages.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.440
You're using the kind of interaction
and clicks and gestures and user

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.460
interface that's a little bit
more like a desktop application.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:16.180
37signals is a company that's
done a number of web applications,

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.200
and this HiRise application is
an example of a contact manager.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.830
Now, these are applications for
keeping track of contacts,

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.080
very popular for people in businesses
like sales who really need to

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.760
keep track of who they talk to.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.240
And these are traditionally
desktop applications.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.430
Here's one built completely
with web technology.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.220
And then you get to some applications
that are really traditional desktop

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.800
applications like word processors,
and Google Docs, formerly Rightly,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.630
is a complete word
processor implemented with

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.410
Web Technology.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.370
So I'd like to show you
another web application.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.980
So let's go over here.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.980
One of my favorites.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.710
and this is the mail from .Mac.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:14.580
So if you're familiar,
if you haven't seen this before,

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.880
you might not even realize that
we're looking at a web page.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.190
The main clues are the fact
that it's inside Safari and

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.510
has the bars from Apple.com.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:30.270
But what's going on here is that
you have a mail application with

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.630
a lot of the same qualities as
mail applications on the desktop.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.560
It looks a lot like the OS X Mail app.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.300
You click on a mail message
and see the message down below.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.600
These fancy ones look really great.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:47.110
And there's a lot of interaction
here that's exactly like what you

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.690
would expect in a desktop app.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.160
For example,
if you choose a couple messages,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.720
you can delete them or
reply to any one message,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.460
mark them as unread,
all the same kind of commands

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.390
you'd expect in the desktop.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.580
And also, the user interface is very
similar to the desktop.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.100
The user interface has elements
that you might not expect

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.740
to find in the web at all.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.310
For example,
I can just take this message,

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.780
drag it over and drop it into a folder.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.610
This is not what people think
about -- what most people think

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.780
about when they think about web
pages and web user interface.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.770
So let's see.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.800
We can search for a word
like "team" and -- oh,

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.780
that was the wrong word to search for.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.720
Let's not do that.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.500
Or I can search for somebody's
name in my address book.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.500
And just choose it here and
use it to address my mail.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.800
So really what you've got here is
something that has a lot of the

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.920
properties of a desktop application,
even though it's implemented

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.490
entirely with web technology.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.940
So let's go back to the slides.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:40:00.970
So even though this is a web application,
it's reminiscent of desktop apps.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.640
And it really is the kind of thing that
it looks like a desktop application,

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.120
maybe not a desktop app of today,
but certainly a desktop

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.320
app of a couple years ago.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.100
The techniques used to implement
this are a big part of a lot of

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.130
the different Web 2.0 websites.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.770
And one interesting thing about
this is even though I was demoing

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.820
that in the brand new Safari 3,
it works just fine

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.720
with existing browsers.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.750
It doesn't require brand
new browser capabilities.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.030
It works great in Safari 2.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.050
So if you're putting
together a web application,

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.470
there are a few things you want to do.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.660
One is that you want to make
sure that it works in any

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.780
browser and degrades gracefully.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.580
And another is that just like
any software development,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.210
you'd like to reuse your code.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:50.890
You don't want to have every single
web application start from scratch.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:55.040
And to make that happen,
one of the most important things to

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.440
do is to get a JavaScript library.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:02.320
JavaScript is the programming
language you use inside web pages

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.720
alongside the markup languages,
HTML and CSS.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:14.230
And there are some really excellent
JavaScript libraries that have

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.230
been a big part of the Web 2.0

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.320
thing that's happening right now.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.540
Dojo, Scriptaculous,
which is built on prototype,

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.450
are some of the richest and most popular.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.200
You can also build your
own JavaScript library.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:33.150
It's great language and it's
pretty easy to make reusable code.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:36.910
Here at Apple,
we do both of those things.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.060
And if you take a look at Apple websites,
you'll see all kinds of

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.160
use of these libraries.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.160
One of the nice things about the
web is you can see the source code

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.900
just with view source and all.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.880
And so see that we do
both of those things.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:53.760
Now, when the people build these sorts of
libraries and you build your site,

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.760
there's really a rich set
of technologies to build on.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.590
A whole lot of stuff already
built into every browser,

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:00.810
all the modern ones.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.560
And just to give you an idea of how
this relates to desktop technology,

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.790
I picked out a few of the
fundamentals and listed the

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:13.800
classes in AppKit or the techniques
in AppKit and the web techniques.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.150
And I'm not going to go
through all of these,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:20.240
but, you know, there's, you know,
if you want to do a table on the desktop,

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.300
with AppKit, use NS Table View.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.120
There's the table element on the web.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.520
But let's talk for a moment
specifically about 2D graphics.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:33.240
So, because of the Canvas element,
which is an innovation originally

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.180
created by Apple for Safari around
the time of Dashboard,

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.900
which is now in most
of the modern browsers,

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.590
you can do graphics operations.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.610
Pretty most of the graphics
operations that are in Quartz 2D

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.510
are available to you within the web.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.580
So let's look at an example here.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.700
If you looked at
Apple applications recently,

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.530
you may have noticed that to
create the illusion of a floor,

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.460
we often reflect an image.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.360
In fact, I think of this as the rounded
corners of the 21st century.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:11.120
So to achieve this in a web page
is straightforward with Canvas.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:16.450
You simply have the image,
draw it twice with the proper settings

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.580
to make the reflection look right.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.500
And so I just,
that's an example of achieving

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:29.200
these things that you think of
as doing with desktop technology.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.880
Now another example is rich text editing.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:38.150
I list here one class, NSTextView,
as the Cocoa way to access rich text.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.260
And it is true that there's
only that one class you have

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.740
to deal with to do the basics,
but there are really tons and

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.400
tons of classes when it comes
to rich text editing in Cocoa.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.680
And the reason for that is
it's a really complex class.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.700
It's a complicated problem.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.300
It's one of the trickiest things
to do in an application framework.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.780
Now with Safari 3,
we have a full implementation of that

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:04.860
rich text editing based on what is done
in other browsers and some web standards.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.890
Let me show you a little bit,
a little example of that.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:21.580
So this ties together the idea of
using a JavaScript library and also a

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.910
little bit of an example of rich text.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:30.230
So imagine that this is a piece
of a web page that's editable.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:39.020
And because we want it to be
what you see is what you get,

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.820
we don't want to put a lot of editing
controls on the page all the time.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.040
So instead,
what we do is make it so that once

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.790
you make a selection in this text,
you get this attractive editing

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.100
toolbar that appears around it.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:54.300
Now, any time you have
editable text in Safari,

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.460
you have this whole menu full of
editing stuff that the browser

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.980
supplies that's always there.

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.100
So I'm going to use that.

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:08.230
Just pull up the font panel,
make the text a little bigger,

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.370
about 20 point.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:15.310
But in addition,
this toolbar gives you something

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:19.910
that will appear in any browser that
lets you do these editing operations,

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.620
bold some of the text,
make these three words italic,

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:29.670
or even take a whole paragraph
and right justify it.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:35.500
And what I think is particularly cool
about this example is that it's a little

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:40.130
bit of JavaScript to create this toolbar.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.540
And it's really beautiful.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:50.190
It's nice looking, nice experience,
and works with any browser.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.630
So that's an example of the kind
of building block that you might

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.960
want to use when you're putting
together web applications.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.720
This particular one looks good.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.900
We're going to give you source code.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.460
There's a session on
HTML editing later in the week,

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.320
I think Wednesday,
where you'll hear more about this.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:15.860
Now, as I said,
Safari 3 now has full rich editing.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.980
The basics were there in Safari 2,
but now it's really all there.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.210
So one thing I'd like to
ask you to do is please,

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:25.690
if you have a site that does
rich editing in other browsers,

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.220
turn it on for the new Safari.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.460
A lot of times, we go to sites where
there's rich editing,

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.920
but we just get plain
text because they say,

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:32.700
oh, it's Safari.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.160
They don't have this stuff.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.640
So please turn it on.

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:41.900
And also, if you're doing that,
please check for the new WebKit version,

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.970
not the new Safari version,
because we don't want to lock out other

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.560
web browsers that are using WebKit.

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:51.280
So I talked a little bit about
some of the things you use to

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.650
put together a web application,
but there's another really

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:56.220
interesting category,
what I'm referring to here

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.940
as hybrid applications.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.000
Now, there are really these applications
that take advantage of web

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.440
technologies and desktop technologies.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:09.300
Now, there's one category like World of
Warcraft that uses the Internet and

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.770
networking on the back end and
desktop-type stuff on the front end.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:16.800
And that's really one type of hybrid app.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:19.620
But the kind I'm talking about is
one that wants to use other web

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.390
technologies like HTML and JavaScript.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.550
And this is really
straightforward to do with Cocoa.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.280
You just create a web view,
which is an NSView subclass.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.990
There's all kinds of ways to use it,
rich text view if you're authoring HTML,

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.470
to incorporate web pages.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.350
Let me just show you a
couple examples real quick.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:42.480
IChat in Leopard uses
WebView for its chat transcript.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.360
And what does that do for IChat?

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.670
Well, one of the things it does
is you can have a bunch of

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.660
different styles of transcript,
and you don't have to write separate

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.530
code for those because the people
writing IChat didn't have to write

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:55.530
separate code for those because
they can use CSS style sheets.

00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:01.780
So just by changing the style sheet,
I can make this chat instead

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:04.710
look like this or like this.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.660
And all of that is done with
the style sheet language.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.190
You get that for free just
because you're using a WebView.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:19.340
Another example of sort of the premier
application using WebKit is Mail that

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.470
uses WebKit for authoring all the mail.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.300
A great example of a third-party app
that's a true hybrid is NetNewsWire,

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.640
which is an application to help
you read lots of news feeds.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:36.300
And here,
what WebView is really being used for is

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.310
to be a mini web browser inside an app.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:44.110
And depending on the
type of app you have,

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:44.110
you may need one of those.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:44.110
It's really easy to get one.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.710
Finally, I thought this was an
interesting example.

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:52.260
There is a web chat
program called Campfire.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.940
And so it's just, it's a web application.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.730
It's on a web page.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.290
But they wanted to have
a desktop version of it.

00:48:57.350 --> 00:49:00.950
And so what they have here is this
application called Pyro is just

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.330
really a single-purpose web browser.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.810
And I've seen a lot of
these cropping up recently,

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:09.240
things that are called applications
that are really just a web browser

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.380
that points to a particular site,
a real junction point between

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.380
web technology and the desktop.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:19.550
So let me show you now one
of the most interesting

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.140
and the rest of the world.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:26.160
This is actually something built
entirely with web technology.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:31.610
and others have been working on a new
web kit that is built into WebKit.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.070
It's not yet in the
versions that you get,

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.880
say, on the Leopard DVD,
but it is going to be in

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.360
nightly builds very soon.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:42.500
And that's the Web Inspector.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:49.390
Let's say that I want to take
a look at this website and

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.890
figure out how it's built.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:50.890
And I'm interested in how this
Delete button is implemented.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.650
So I choose this menu item here,
Inspect Element.

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.730
And because I have a build of WebKit with
this additional feature in it,

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.960
it'll appear any time
I click on anything.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:06.500
And immediately,
I get a view of the web page.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:08.990
This is the DOM tree.

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:12.500
So what you see here,
and you probably can't see,

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.560
I can make it big just for a second.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.900
Let me put it back to the normal size.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.880
This is the entire DOM tree.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.490
The way HTML works is a tree.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:24.300
And I have this image
element selected right now.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:28.360
And over to the right here
are all sorts of details about

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.160
the style of that element.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.070
And that's very useful if
you want to find out why

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:35.170
something is a certain color,
what rule made it so.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.500
And I'm not going to take
you through all of this,

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.760
but you can find out what style
sheet a particular rule came from.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.560
If you click on that link,
it'll take you right to the

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.980
style sheet source code.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.800
There's some other
information you can get.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.690
For example,
what's the size of all the various boxes,

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.270
which is really good for
understanding the layout of the page.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:59.790
Now, as this page loaded,
the document itself is only one of the

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.430
things that was loaded from the network.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:02.600
All sorts of other things were loaded.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.290
For example,
all these images were loaded.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.640
And so we can take a look.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.360
DeleteDim.gif is the one on this one.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.610
I can click on this link.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.570
It'll take me right to it.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:13.720
And here's the image itself.

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:17.110
And that way,
you can take a look and say, you know,

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:20.710
if you see the name of a resource,
you can go over here and

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.510
view what it looks like.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:24.580
But there-- oops, wrong button.

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.130
Oh yeah, that docks it in the window.

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.980
Sorry, didn't mean to demo that.

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.180
So let me reload this again.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.430
Does it help me show you this?

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.840
So if you have the inspector up
while you're loading the page,

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:39.140
it'll also report any
errors in your HTML.

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:43.740
And this page has some tags here,
has some examples here of some tags

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.440
that were closed without being open.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:50.270
So that's great if you develop a site and
you want to see what mistakes you made.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:54.480
This same console is a place where you
can evaluate any JavaScript exceptions.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:58.770
So for example,
I'll just type in something here just to

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:00.740
show you that the whole language is here.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:06.040
Get the Delete button
and get its inner HTML.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.020
And there, it's evaluated the expression.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.660
And so there's the string
that came out of it.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:15.450
So that's really good if you want to test
some JavaScript functions you've written.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:16.610
There are so many features.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.700
I want to show you a couple more.

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:21.420
If you type-- let's say you're--
interested in this Delete button,

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.210
you want to find out all the
code that's dealing with it.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.200
So let me just type Delete button
into the Search field.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.350
And I'll immediately get
all the different places

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.460
Delete button is referenced.

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:31.420
The original HTML source,
which has this cool

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.430
syntax highlighting here.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.780
The DOM,
which is the parsed version of the source

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.750
with all the information we saw before.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:38.840
Here's a style sheet.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:43.550
This is a style rule that applies
specifically to the Delete button.

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.380
The JavaScript code,
here's all the places in any

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.860
JavaScript code loaded by the
site that refer to that button.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.670
It's real good when sleuthing and trying
to pick apart a site and figure out

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.560
how it works or any kind of debugging.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.570
So the last thing I want to show
you here with the Web Inspector is

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:01.600
this little view we have that
shows you how your page loaded.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.630
This is a graph over time.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.420
And so we see each color corresponds
to a different type of thing.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.940
So we see here the document loading,
and then the style sheets loading,

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.240
and then the scripts loading,
and then the images loading.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.230
And you can learn a lot about
why it takes a certain amount

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.760
of time to load your site.

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:27.430
This is really good for figuring out how
your site will perform on a slow network,

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:28.000
too.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.480
So we think this is going to be really
popular for people doing web development,

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.360
whether they're targeting
the desktop or iPhone.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.600
So this tool that will
help you build those apps,

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.580
it was created entirely
with web technologies.

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:56.240
And because of that,
it's going to work in

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.790
any WebKit application,
and it also works in Safari.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.540
We didn't have to do a whole
new version just to make it

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.660
work on Windows as well as OS X.

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:09.280
And it's going to be available
soon in WebKit Nightly Builds.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:15.470
So Mac OS X is a really popular
platform for people who are

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.880
developing content for the web.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.000
And I just wanted to dig a little bit
into the reason why it's so popular.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.630
This is something I've
heard for a long time.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:27.130
And I think one of the biggest reasons
is all the tools that are side by side.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.700
What's built into OS X are all
these unique server technologies,

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.120
the very same server
technologies that many,

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.560
if not most,
websites use on the back ends.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.330
And also there are these beloved
client-side tools that are really what

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.930
people building websites love to use.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.540
And they're both there on OS X.

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.960
So if you take a look at
all these built-in tools,

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.730
I just picked a few here
to give you the idea.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.810
But these are a few of the things
that are built in that you can

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:58.680
actually run on your OS X machine.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.830
And a lot of web developers I know sort
of run a small version of the site on the

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:03.710
very same machine they're developing on.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:06.120
And you can do that without
having to add anything,

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.070
because all this stuff comes built in.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.840
And then as far as client-side tools,
there are these crucial tools that

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.550
you use both for content creation,
manipulating your images,

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:19.090
editing your HTML,
and all that sort of thing.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:20.880
And both of these are available on OS X.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.850
But I think there's another reason.

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:33.300
And I went and asked some web developers
why is it they like to develop on OS X.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.500
And this is what Jason Freed told me.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.300
Jason is the CEO and
founder of 37signals,

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.350
the company that created and popularized
Ruby on Rails and also the application,

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:44.860
a lot of web applications.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:48.950
And he said,
working on OS X reminds me that beauty,

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:51.590
clarity, and workflow matter.

00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:54.480
That's a valuable reminder
when you're building a web app.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:55.850
about.

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.030
So I think that there are some things
that go beyond just the concrete issues

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:06.600
of exactly which tools are available
that affect people choosing OS X.

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:13.460
So how is it that these web technologies
are put together and work across

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.000
all of these different web browsers?

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.940
The key is web standards.

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:22.210
And I'm just going to say a
word or two about web standards.

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:25.470
This is an open process that
involves all the different

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.090
people who make web browsers.

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.050
And in addition, lots of people are
interested in web technology.

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:34.530
And the way the standards process works
helps prevent us from really diverging

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.740
when we have these multiple browsers
all trying to work with the same web.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.980
And it also gives a way for innovations
to spread from one browser to another.

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:46.730
The process is managed by
standards organizations.

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.980
And two of the most important
standards organizations are the W3C.

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:54.000
This is the original organization
that does the HTML standard and

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.410
all sorts of vital web standards.

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:59.260
And also, more recently,
there was a group called the

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:02.040
What Working Group formed
a little while back.

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.620
It was formed by the browser vendors who,
at the time, were a little bit frustrated

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:09.640
with not enough standards that
really were relevant to the

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:12.000
future directions of browsers.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:16.000
There's a recent standard that's
being developed that's actually being

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.440
worked on by both of these groups.

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.550
It was started in the
What Working Group and now

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:23.370
is being worked on in both
W3C and What Working Group.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:28.580
And its original name was different,
but it's now called HTML5.

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:32.580
And this standard is going to be a really
big deal for the future of the web.

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:35.650
One of the things that
HTML5 is doing is defining,

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:39.010
previously undocumented and undefined
things about the web very clearly

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:43.980
so that the browsers will all be
able to implement them the same way.

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.480
So it's really going to
help for compatibility.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:51.860
A lot of the new features that really
would help pushing Web 2.0 even further--

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.080
I don't know if I was more of a marketer.

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.130
It might say Web 3.0 there.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.560
And also,
some relevant Apple points are it

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.780
includes Apple's Canvas element,
which we created and was

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:09.200
quickly implemented in some
of the other major browsers.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:12.930
Some recent news-- we contributed a
design for video and audio elements.

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:17.560
We really want to bring media out of the
plug-in world into the browser world.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:21.780
And our proposal was very well received.

00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:25.600
And it was a great example of bringing
a lot of the expertise that our

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.280
media experts here have at Apple.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:32.290
Last thing I want to say about
HTML5 is that this is one of the

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:35.100
easiest standards to participate in.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.920
It's even more open than most.

00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:40.890
The mailing list where the
technical issues are discussed is

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:42.160
something you can subscribe to.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:46.000
If you're interested,
go to the W3C website.

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.860
So what's coming in web technology?

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:52.900
Well,
there's going to be more innovation.

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.860
For us at Apple,
this standards and this whole

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:59.150
space of web is a place where
we want to do a lot more.

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:02.960
And as you can see, we're really serious
about web technology,

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.610
having just brought Safari to
new platforms with a bunch of new

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.190
features and an open-source approach.

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:13.070
And I think there are some
opportunities for developers here.

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:18.130
And one of them is,
if you have an existing website,

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:22.550
turn it into a richer Web 2.0 website.

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:27.830
Or if you have an application,
think about what kind of web presence

00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.600
really makes sense for your app.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:33.290
With the web technologies,
there are a whole variety of

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:35.860
different ways to kind of add
the web to your desktop app.

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:42.320
And there's also this situation
where Web 2.0 has undergone

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.340
this explosive growth,
and I don't think the development tools

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.100
have really caught up to that yet.

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.910
So I think while there's
some really exciting new ones

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:50.770
that have come out recently,
I think there's room for

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.810
web development tools.

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.140
So for some of you,
that may be an opportunity as well.

00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:00.080
And as you heard this morning,
the skills that you develop developing

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.830
web applications are going to
be directly relevant to making

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.500
great applications for iPhone.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:11.660
So with that,
I'd like to hand it back to Peter.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.600
Thanks a lot, Darren.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.580
Thank you.

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:20.770
Great.

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:22.460
So Darren talked a lot about the web.

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:25.890
And I'm going to take you through
the media section of the talk,

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:29.950
where we're going to talk about
the media platform for Apple.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.440
So really, if you look at kind of the web
2.0 application phenomenon,

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:40.880
you know, kind of Google Maps being the
archetypical starting point for that,

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:45.830
more and more of these sites are starting
to-- like YouTube and Google Video,

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.590
other sites starting to add video
and media into their websites.

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:56.470
So it's a really important kind
of development in web design.

01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:02.630
And Apple plays a role in that,
certainly, with all the great technology

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:05.200
we build right into Mac OS X.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.810
It makes a great foundation for
the wealth of content creation apps

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.440
that you see out there that some of
you have built and Apple's as well.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:21.330
At the heart of all of
this media platform for

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.200
Apple is QuickTime and H.264.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.000
So let's talk a little bit about H.264.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.860
It's the next-generation codec
from the MPEG community as well

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.520
as the phone standards groups.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.940
It comes in a variety of profiles.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:41.830
It's really meant to scale all the
way from phone-type applications

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:44.220
all the way up to HD and cinema.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.560
It comes in three basic profiles,
extended, main, and baseline,

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.520
and I won't go into all the details.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.910
But it's been well-received in
the industry and adopted by many,

01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:00.960
many platforms from PSP to Xbox and
PlayStation 3 and platforms like that.

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:05.320
And of course, Apple uses it for a
number of applications.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:09.840
We use it in a real-time
teleconferencing video chat,

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:14.200
the application we ship with the OS,
iChat AV.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.210
So it's great low-latency codec.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.500
It's also the backbone of our
media business with iTunes,

01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:26.050
with the content we distribute,
both movies and TV shows.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.180
And of course, with Apple TV,
with recent announcement with YouTube,

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:36.050
what we've done is we've had them give
us a web feed of their content in 264,

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.330
and we put a user interface
on the Apple TV for that.

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:42.830
So we're using 264 with
the YouTube content there.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.100
So really, across all of Apple products,
it's really the core of our

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.790
strategy to leverage this effort
on this codec and implement

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:53.120
it up and down the product line.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.800
And some specific
examples of the bitrate.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.970
So we have sites that we use,
for example, to get full HD on a decent

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.100
performing Intel Mac.

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:07.700
It might be 1920 by 1080 HD.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:13.720
For Apple TV, we have 720p video,
also HD.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:19.880
iPod and iPhone are megabit and
a half of the baseline profile.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.880
And on iPhone,
we have format as well that is tuned

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.740
and optimized for the edge data.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.690
network, the cellular data network.

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:32.420
So all the way up and down,
we can get great video.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:35.080
So let's talk a little bit
about media on the iPhone.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.190
We haven't really talked
a lot about this yet,

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.810
but it's real important that
you guys understand what's

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:41.460
coming with iPhone and media.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.950
So iPhone can play back
media in two forms.

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:48.820
First off, it's an iPod,
so it can take any content

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.360
that's synced via iTunes.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.490
If you have a podcast,
it can get synced to iPhone and

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:58.500
actually stored like a video iPod.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.750
Or you can stream via Safari.

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:05.440
We've extended Safari with a simple
embed in object tags that can

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.100
do streaming over the internet.

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:11.610
The thing to remember about
iPhone is it's always connected,

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:14.300
so it has both Wi-Fi and
Edge connectivity.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.680
In fact, it can switch between them if
you go out of range of a hotspot,

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.800
Edge automatically comes on.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.570
So it's real important to
realize that there's pretty

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:26.400
different data rates there,
and so we're recommending

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.200
about a megabit per second.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:32.500
So it's a simple profile for
Wi-Fi and about a 90 kilobit

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.630
stream for the Edge network.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.480
The more speeds and speeds,
the 264 baseline that

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.780
is supported is level 3,
and it's up to 640 by 480

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:45.000
at 30 frames per second.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.530
We also recommend AACLC,
which is our standard audio codec,

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:57.830
and for media container formats,
it's .move, mp4, m4v, and 3gp.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.670
So this is not in your seed,
but we are going to be adding

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.100
to the ever-growing Movie 2
exporter list for a quick time.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:12.350
We're going to add Movie to iPhone,
which is appropriate for streaming

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.440
over Wi-Fi or hotspot connectivity.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.050
We're going to add
Movie to iPhone Cellular,

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:21.990
which is for the Edge data network.

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:25.860
It's compatible with the 3GP file format.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:31.090
And of course, Movie to iPod,
since iPhone is part iPod,

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:34.060
that data rate works as well.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:38.190
And one of the things you may not know
if you haven't been around the quick time

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:45.180
media space is understanding the concepts
of ref movies or reference movies.

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:48.680
And these are movies you put on
a website that actually point

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.520
off to a bunch of different
representations of the same video.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.260
So for example,
based at runtime on conditions

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.920
like network or whether you're
connected to Edge or Wi-Fi,

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.430
we can pick the appropriate
data stream to feed.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.350
And this works both
on desktop and iPhone.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:10.880
So with that,
let me go over to the iPhone and

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.280
give you some more demos of media.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.320
So if I can get the iPhone up.

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:27.310
So let me--

01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:33.860
I'm going to go into Safari on
the iPhone and I've bookmarked

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:40.440
a site here that we've created
with a bunch of demos for you.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.280
First off,
we took one of Jeff's rehearsal

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:48.740
demos with his World of Warcraft
and made it work on the phone.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.550
And there's a little blog,
Jeff and His Quest.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:56.190
And you'll see what happens with iPhone,
with media on the iPhone.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.680
There's an embedded experience,
but then media always goes full screen.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.220
So there it's playing.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.360
Let me see if everything's working here.

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.130
There we can rotate.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:14.330
So you'll notice that we have a
full-screen experience on iPhone,

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:17.020
so we don't actually play
video embedded in the web page.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.040
It just goes to full screen,
so we can use all the real estate.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.130
Let me go back.

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:27.600
There's a heads up display there
that I'll show you that in a second.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.480
So let me go back to my page here,
and here's an interesting one.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.860
The apple.com guys, you know,
they launched a new Web site today,

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.060
a new redesign.

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.530
They're also preparing for iPhone.

01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:46.110
So they're actually putting up ref movies
that can stream both edge and Wi-Fi.

01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:51.080
And I've got the
Ratatouille trailer here,

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.130
which of course you have to play.

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.110
I know there's some
Pixar people out there,

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:10.740
and Chris Harkin are the
founders of the Paris France,

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:20.760
home of the finest restaurants and
the greatest chefs in the world.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:26.020
You can see I do a fit or a
fill just with a double tap.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:26.020
Go back to my web page.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.920
And rather than just
showing sites we created,

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.400
we thought we'd go find some that
work pretty well on the iPhone.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:39.800
This is a video site.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.070
It's like a soap opera,
but it's only on the web.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.610
So you go watch this site.

01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:50.350
And it's a site where the basic setup is
it's a bunch of folks having breakfast,

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:55.680
and they kind of review their
week and what they're doing.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:56.620
It's kind of fun.

01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.860
But if I go to the View Episode link,
you'll see they come to

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.870
their episode viewer.

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:07.260
And you see the QuickTime logo there?

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:11.700
That's their plug-in for their embed tag.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:18.140
And the one thing that they haven't
done to be ready for iPhone is we have,

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:22.800
there's a way to do a
JPEG URL for the poster frame.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.600
And that's kind of the
one thing they're missing.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.140
Other than that, they'll be ready.

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:30.700
If anyone who works on that site's here,
maybe they'll be ready tonight.

01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:35.210
But basically, you can see the content.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:42.000
and David I can show you
the scrubbing as well.

01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:45.900
We have HTTP 1.1 support.

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:51.500
In fact, you need to have an HTTP 1.1
server to feed iPhone video.

01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:58.180
But I can even seek outside of the
range and hopefully it will catch up.

01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:58.980
There we go.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.660
Honest, Mr.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.980
Wiley, it was a ride home.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.780
So if you've already seen the
first few minutes of the show,

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.780
you can go watch the end.

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:08.960
But anyway, so that's that site.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.420
And like I said,
the only thing they're missing is the

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:17.520
embed tag poster frame rather than
putting the poster frame in the movie.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.630
So they're pretty close.

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:25.180
Let me go back out, and I think that's,
I think I'll just show you that for now

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.420
and then save the other one for later.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:30.600
So that's a few things
about iPhone and media.

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:41.630
So let's talk about Leopard and
H.264 and what we're doing there.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.740
So we've improved the encoding speed.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.590
We know that this is a
sometimes painful process.

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:49.280
You want to get your
content up on the web.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:57.680
So both the single pass and multi-pass
is about a factor of two faster now,

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:57.680
and we're continuing to work
on that to get it even better.

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:02.390
QtKit has gained some
capture capabilities.

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:08.470
John talked about some of these,
including capture from multiple

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.870
cameras simultaneously,
which people have been

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:14.990
asking for as well.

01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:20.730
We have alpha support in the 264 codec,
so you can create

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:21.710
compressed alpha movies.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:21.710
And we're going to turn
on full screen for all.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:13:45.800
( Transcript missing )

01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:53.110
and I'm going to kind of show you a
best practices site we've put together.

01:13:55.340 --> 01:14:02.780
that brings together all of the richness
of web technology plus Quicktime.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:07.320
So what we have here is a site that
we-- Ducati of America is actually

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.650
a neighbor down in Cupertino,
so they were kind enough to let

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:13.780
us take some of their assets
and play around a little bit.

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:17.630
So we've developed the site
here that we think is a best

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:20.580
practices site for embedding media.

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.850
So right here we have a
media-- a plug-in instance,

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:28.700
and I can play the video directly,
have an inline experience.

01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:29.960
I can stop that.

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:35.690
I have a watch now if I want
a more full-screen experience

01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:36.900
of this particular entry.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:43.660
And what that does is it
switches over to a 720p feed,

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.860
and it goes full browser width.

01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:49.960
And you'll notice we've got
chapter tracks that are marked,

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.480
and you can see as the video
traverses the chapters,

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.720
the HTML at the bottom
is changing to respond.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.100
So this is all done in JavaScript.

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:03.040
And you can see as
I hover over the chapters,

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:09.090
I even have little chapter
marks that help me navigate.

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.090
So that's pretty cool.

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:10.480
And you can see as
I hover over the chapters,

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.100
I even have little chapter
marks that help me navigate.

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:16.900
So that's pretty cool.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.500
So that's... it was really easy
to write the JavaScript controller

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.110
as well because of the DOM events.

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:37.940
So let me go back to the site here
and point out a few other things.

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:40.300
We have some download buttons.

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:43.800
We're recommending that people
support downloads direct of,

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:48.040
you know, if you have a video site
like this for both iPod,

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:52.680
Apple TV, and this download goes
directly to QuickTime.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.050
This is the 720p content downloaded.

01:15:58.350 --> 01:16:00.200
and the rest of the team.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:28.200
Peter Graffagnino, John Stauffer,
Geoff Stauffer,

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:28.220
Darin Adler and the rest of the team.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:28.220
Peter Graffagnino, John Stauffer,
Geoff Stauffer,

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:28.220
Darin Adler and the rest of the team.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:32.420
Or you can actually drag the
XML directly into the iTunes window.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.790
That works as well if you just want
to manage iTunes to manage it and it's

01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:38.620
not through the podcast directory.

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:41.060
So anyway,
that'll sync down all the content.

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.140
All the content on this
site is in the XML.

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:47.090
And so, for example,
I've synced a couple of these.

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.560
This is an HD version that then
I could sync to my Apple TV.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.690
So we think podcasts are real important.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:55.420
If you're putting up an
episodic video site or a video

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.120
blog or something like that,
to have that XML.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.910
Because I think that's going
to help you reach a lot more

01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:03.920
platforms that are more in the sync
model than the streaming model.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.590
Okay, so that's the Ducati site.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:17.600
Now, what I wanted to do was show you the
Ducati site also running on the iPhone.

01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:21.460
So on the iPhone, as I said,
it's the baseline profile,

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:28.210
so some of the media embeds need to
have the proper ref movies to bring up

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:36.100
the appropriate formats for the iPhone
since we support the baseline profile.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:36.120
If I can get the iPhone up again.

01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.770
There we are.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.950
So we'll go to the Ducati site.

01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:45.500
That is the same bits
from the same server.

01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:49.900
And you'll see it's
basically the same design.

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:53.530
I can zoom in and you'll see it render.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:57.250
And we've done some conditional
browser detection to remove the

01:17:57.250 --> 01:18:03.110
download things because they don't
really make sense on the iPhone.

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:04.320
And zoom back out.

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:10.460
I can play the video and
the video goes full screen.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:14.840
And this is now streaming the
iPhone version of the video.

01:18:56.230 --> 01:18:58.840
And to thank them,
I had to actually play the

01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:02.640
whole commercial for you just
because I thought it's cool.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.390
Anyway,
so the other thing I wanted to point

01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:08.910
out here is the web pages are all,
if you do the right CSS,

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:13.250
you get kind of the semantic zooming
where you can get the appropriate

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:16.000
element kind of coming to the front.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.900
And so that's another thing to be aware
of when you're developing websites.

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:23.610
If we can kind of figure out from your
CSS the important areas of your site,

01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:25.410
that really helps navigation.

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:29.560
So anyway,
so that's it for the iPhone demo.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:34.470
And I believe I left
my clicker over here.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.400
So again, that was the same bits
coming from the same server,

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:50.000
which is just with a few tweaks
and the right content on the site.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.740
So let's review what was on that site.

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:57.620
It used reference movies to be able
to address the appropriate data

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.760
rates for desktop and for iPhone.

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.190
It used a poster JPEG and
the object embed tag.

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:07.900
That's why the serialized guys
didn't have a poster frame

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.480
showing for their content.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:13.440
One thing on iPhone is you need
to be aware of your viewports.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:18.100
Some websites are very
particular about their viewports,

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.960
and on iPhone,
you need to be aware of that because

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.080
it's not the same size as a desktop.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.930
There are ways to detect the user agent,
and so we were doing that to kind of

01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:30.080
disable the download buttons because
they don't make sense on the iPhone.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.660
Also, we recommend including an
RSS feed for offline viewing,

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:36.660
and that's your way to
support Apple TV and iPods.

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.120
And don't require
JavaScript for media playback.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.110
The media extension that
we have in iPhone right now

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.580
does not do any JavaScript.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.510
It just gives you that
full screen experience.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.100
So don't require JavaScript.

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:51.200
Have an alternate.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.960
So that's the combination
of 264 and web technology.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.430
I think you can see you can make some
pretty compelling websites with that.

01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:02.480
And again,
you can support the wide variety of

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.060
Apple platforms that are out there.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.640
And I think there's a
lot of opportunity here,

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:11.260
both in the authoring space for tools,
as well as in the content

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.980
and application space.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.580
So those are the platforms.

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:18.150
We gave you a little
tour today of desktop,

01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:19.330
web, and media.

01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.680
And my message to you is to
really get ready and kind of think

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.980
beyond just desktop applications.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:29.950
Think about this whole bigger
ecosystem of devices and websites and

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.290
content and how to support developers
with rich-media experiences.

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:40.150
And of course,
keep iPhone in mind and build great

01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:44.380
Web 2.0 experiences on iPhone.

01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:48.500
So there are some sessions
I want to point you out.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.570
I can't list them all here
because there's too many,

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:51.980
but I will point out the tracks.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.280
There's the Graphics & Imaging track,
which is about all the

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.480
APIs for graphics and media,
of course,

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.720
emphasizing the new ones in Leopard.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:03.320
There's a Content & Media track,
which this year is focusing on web

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.380
development and content creation.

01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:07.520
You'll definitely want to go to that.

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:11.850
There's a session in here tomorrow
talking specifically about iPhone issues,

01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:15.510
and there'll be some discussion
of both the kind of the the

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:20.300
web technology piece of that as
well as the media piece of that.

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:25.770
And in closing,
we decided to have a little fun

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:29.050
since it's at the end of the day,
and we put together a brief

01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:30.980
video for your viewing pleasure.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.930
I'd like to roll now.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.680
You have no doubt been hearing
a lot about Web 2.0 recently.

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:48.480
Today on WIT TV,
we sit down with management at a

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.540
local company focused on integration
of media with Web 2.0 technologies.

01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:57.190
Thanks for letting us
visit CashCal Media.

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.990
Before telling the viewers
about your unique approach to

01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:04.200
media and Web 2.0 integration,
tell us a little bit about your company.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.080
I'd be glad to.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:12.160
CashCal Media combines expertise in web
technologies with a passion for media.

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.640

01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:21.550

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:38.300
( Transcript missing )

01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:45.420
And to better serve clients and partners,
we're committed to ongoing

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:50.380
employee education in all the
most relevant web technologies.

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:55.370
Tell us about your focus on Web 2.0
and the opportunities you see.

01:23:55.710 --> 01:23:57.380
Yes, certainly.

01:23:57.410 --> 01:24:02.090
CCM wholeheartedly embraces the
social networking phenomenon.

01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:04.730
Through our partnerships,
we're involved with

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.670
the destination sites.

01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:12.210
Also, in this results-oriented world,
it's not about what you're doing,

01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:13.990
it's about what you've done.

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.700
Consider microblogging.

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.580
Who has time for sentences,
let alone whole paragraphs?

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.330
We're pioneering nanoblogging.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.200
Words, they're the future.

01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:27.780
Mm-hmm.

01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:31.930
Please tell us about challenges
in producing rich media.

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:36.870
Well, we see many of the same challenges
producers of mainstream media see,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.680
but also face some unique ones.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:48.390
Take, for example,
finding the right talent for projects.

01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.390
I see you've only worked
in low-bitrate video.

01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:55.870
And we have other challenges
in finding the right talent

01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.870
for our web media efforts.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.480
Finally,
let me show you something we just

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.730
put together demonstrating the
synergy possible between traditional

01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:10.040
markets and Web 2.0-enabled media.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:27.320
In the '70s,
math was hard... ♪ ♪ ...until

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:30.240
the arrival of the calculator.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.830
The lumbering is still hard,
but now there's SearchBar.
