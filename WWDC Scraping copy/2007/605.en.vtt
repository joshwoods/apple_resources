00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:20.280
>> Welcome to session 605, Understanding Web
Accessibility for Building Better Websites.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.270
My name is Faruk Ates I am a web centered
specialist on the Apple Online store.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.739
Now, thank you.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:38.030
Before I start can I please see how many of
you consider themselves software developers?

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.799
How many of you consider yourself web developers?

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:47.269
And how many of you consider yourself
a little bit of both, equal?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:59.469
Right. So as you are all very much aware this is the first
WWDC where we have session syntax on web development.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.769
Now this is not just a jump on the increasingly
large Web 2.0 bandwagon, though we will have to admit

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:09.629
to taking some of the right cues from that.

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:13.689
Now with Web 2.0 we mean desktop
like applications on the web.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:21.649
As you can see here, this is the .Mac web new
interface, but it looks very much like your mail app

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.780
on the desktop and that's really what this is about.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.480
Desktop like applications on the web.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.859
They behave much like your desktop
applications, but they are web based.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:40.060
Now this is because the web becoming
a bigger and bigger part of our lives.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:48.409
It is becoming very integrated in our desktop
software but also in the real world itself.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.489
You can see that...

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:56.750
you can imagine that sometime from now
we'll have contact sensitive ads driven

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.510
by the web on billboards along the highway.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.290
I wonder why there's no phone number there.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.689
Now this integration offers phenomenal potential
for all kinds of new and innovative ideas.

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.270
New in applications.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.920
But in order to really take full advantage
of all these possibilities that are opening

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.309
up to us, it is important to be well prepared.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:34.000
And what I'm going to show you today is that web
accessibility is the key to building a great website.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.229
And I'll explain how you can prepare yourself
to be ready so you can take full advantage

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:46.879
of all these possibilities opening up to us, in
this rapidly evolving industry know as the web.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.539
So what is web accessibility about?

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:56.349
Well, before we set out to discover what web
accessibility is, it is important to look

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.409
at what accessibility itself is all about.

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.840
So what is accessibility?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.009
Well, when you set out to define accessibility,

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:11.769
you immediately encounter the biggest problem
surrounding the subject and the problem is

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.960
that accessibility is a very broad,
very vague, very hard to define concept.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.909
However, Joe Clark, an accessibility consultant and author,
once said to me, and he may have put it best when he said,

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:35.409
accessibility is making allowances for that
which you can't change or can't change easily.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:44.180
Now this gives us a great feel for what the essence of
accessibility is all about, but it's still pretty obscure.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.700
It's not very pragmatic.

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.089
So then what is accessibility?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.460
Well accessibility first and foremost is about people.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.260
Accessibility really is about people with disabilities.

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.539
So then how many people are we talking about here?

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:05.789
Well, worldwide we're talking about
more than 600 million people.

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:10.669
600 million people in the world with
some kind of physical disability.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.829
That's over 9% of our population.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.900
But the percentage is even way higher
than that in first world countries.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:22.539
In the United States, there's over
54 million people with a disability,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.170
which is almost 1 in every 5 people in the country.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.660
And first world countries report higher percentages
because they have better reporting available to them.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.100
They have better amenities for
people to live with a disability.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.340
So, people with a disability the numbers are very high.

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.459
So what types of disabilities are we talking about here.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:49.019
Well there's four main types of physical disabilities.

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:51.560
The first one is visual impairment.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.949
Someone is either blind, has partial sight, also
color blindness which effects 8% of all men.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.060
What may seem like some nice set of
colors to you can be very hard to read

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.600
for someone with a specific color blindness.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.910
There's also a dexterity impairment.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.910
It may be difficult for someone to hold a mouse, or hold
the mouse steady enough to click on very small links.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.230
Someone may not be able to hold the mouse at
all, and have to rely on keyboard navigation.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:29.180
Or they may be so motor impaired that they have to use
voice commands to navigate your website, their computer.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.030
There's also hearing impairment.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:36.619
Now, you may think, well with all this text on the
web how does hearing impairment really have an effect?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.439
Well we're getting into more and
more multimedia content on the web.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:49.990
We are getting a large amount of podcast, lots of video
content, and if all that content isn't properly transcribed

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.699
or captioned, then people who can't
hear are locked out of the content.

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.519
This is becoming increasingly the case.

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:59.599
And then there's learning impairment.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.320
And learning impairment is a very, very wide array
of possible disabilities, but one of them that I want

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.480
to highlight is the language of your website.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.759
Now if you are building an English language website, someone
who is visiting it may not be a native English speaker.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:22.409
And if you are using a lot of high level complex English
language in your site, someone who is not a native speaker,

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.590
may not be able to really comprehend
what your website is all about.

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:33.589
The same if you use a lot of jargon, a lot of slang,
abbreviations, or acronyms and you don't define these terms

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:39.089
that you are using then someone who is not
familiar with them may just give up and leave.

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:45.709
So that's physical disabilities, but
on the web, there's so much more to it.

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:51.000
On the web, you also deal with what are
called device specific disabilities.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.189
Now these come in many, many flavors.

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:58.579
You have the choice of web browsers someone may
be using an older version of Internet Explorer,

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:03.310
someone may be on an old operating
system, can't even use a modern browser.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.879
Browser settings also matter very much.

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.779
Whether certain features are disabled or enabled.

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:12.089
Certain plug-ins available or not available.

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:14.599
Also the screen resolution is very important.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.000
Someone may have a lower resolution screen.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.899
Not everyone is using nice widescreen displays.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.729
People are still using very old monitors.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.310
There's also the color calibration which matters.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.459
Then you have internet connection speeds.

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:36.729
Someone who's on slower broadband or on dialup
will have to wait a long time before they can get

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:42.970
to your very graphic rich or media rich
website, and they may get frustrated and leave.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.360
Internet connection speed is also
very important for mobile devices

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.350
which are typically on WiFi or much lower network than that.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.260
And mobile devices have a lot of different things
that you have to take into account as well.

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.599
They have a smaller screen.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:05.510
They only have a few buttons as input method
and they are a completely different environment

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:09.819
and you still want your website to be
accessible on these, all these devices.

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:11.379
And that's just a few examples.

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.490
There's so much more out there.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.460
So, we have the moral reasons.

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:18.719
It's the right thing to do.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.320
It's the right thing to be accessible.

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:21.509
You have the business reasons.

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:27.709
You don't want to lock out all these, all these people,
you don't want to lock out all these potential customers.

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:30.299
And then there's government legislations.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.000
A lot of countries, especially
first world countries these days,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.559
have a lot of government legislation
that force you almost to be accessible.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.089
Now there's the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in Europe.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.370
They also have the EuroAccessibility Consortium.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:52.560
There is the Disabilities Discrimination
Act in Australia and the United Kingdom.

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:57.289
UK also has SENDA, the Special
Educational Needs and Disability Act.

00:08:57.289 --> 00:09:00.329
Canada has a great government online initiative.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.139
Japan has a fantastic Digital 21 Strategy.
!

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:09.460
And then the United States has, there's a few,
there's the Americans with Disabilities Act,

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:17.650
which last year has set a precedent where
this applies to retailers of any kind.

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:24.509
It's not just brick and mortar retailers where
this is relevant it's also online retailers.

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:33.649
So if you sell something on your website then you are liable
if you are not accessible by this act and then there is one

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:39.279
that most of you are probably familiar
with and that is Section 508.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:44.839
So, there is all this government legislation
in the world now if you want to learn more

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:51.000
about what your government is doing with
legislation on web accessibility or what kind

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.769
of initiatives they are offering then you can go to
www.webaim.org and you can look up your country and you find

00:09:57.769 --> 00:10:01.360
out all the things specific to your country.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.070
So we have these reasons to be accessible, we have the moral
reason, the business reason, and the government reason.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.110
Well how do you make your website accessible?

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:23.360
Oh, we have here an accessibility cocktail.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:31.180
And if you have no physical disabilities and you
have a modern computer, modern operating system,

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:36.939
using a modern web browser, your
accessibility cocktail is a full glass.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.840
You have full access to all the content.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.460
But if you have a physical disability or you're stuck
on an older system, you're going to an internet cafe

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:53.930
and you are using an older browser, then your
accessibility cocktail can be an empty glass.

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:57.159
You have no access, you can't access the content.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:11:02.659
So how do you make this a full glass for everyone?

00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:07.629
Well you start by changing the
way you think about your website.

00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:17.500
Now we mentioned Web 2.0 at the beginning of this and this
is a phenomenon that has been going for the last few years.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:26.470
It has become very big, now there's also another phenomenon
that has been going on at the same time and that's podcast.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.389
Podcasts have become incredibly popular.

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:32.360
Who here listens to at least one podcast a day?

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:35.870
Not that many.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.970
Who here reads blogs?

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.900
Who here has more than a hundred blogs in their newsreader?

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:53.350
Well if you read a lot of blogs, you may not
be using podcasts much, but if you read blogs,

00:11:53.350 --> 00:12:02.389
which you probably do at work or in class, then you may find
yourself wanting to get access to this content as a podcast

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:08.210
so you can listen to this content on your
daily commute or whenever you feel like it.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.379
And you don't have to spend time reading it
you can just listen to all this blog content.

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:21.689
Well if you think of your website as a podcast, you get
this completely different way of thinking about the website.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:30.060
You get this new approach, and if you start by that, you
think well how would I think of my website as a podcast?

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:34.489
Well, really what it means is your
website is going to be read out to you

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.649
and the only thing you can control is what you hear back,
of course there is video podcast, but we don't want you,

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:44.309
you know, watching a video podcast while you drive to work.

00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:51.679
So we have this way of thinking as
a podcast and you want your website,

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:54.589
when it gets read out to you, you want it to make sense.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:13:00.769
You want to know that, well you want your website to
tell you this is the list that I am approaching now.

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:06.079
Now imagine that you're using a tool to
listen to this podcast and you have a button

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.860
that says well anytime I encounter a link and
I want to follow that link I click this button

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.080
so you can navigate your website just by
clicking a button whenever you encounter a link.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:23.100
Well, if you navigate your podcast that way, your website
has a podcast you still want to know what everything means.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:29.740
You want to encounter well this is a heading; you
want your site to read out to you this is a list.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.259
So you want to make sure that you can actually
get all that content back to you as a podcast.

00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:38.710
This is a great way to start thinking
about web accessibility.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:44.889
You just get into this completely different
mindset about how to make an accessible website.

00:13:44.889 --> 00:13:47.480
So we want to make this a full glass for everyone.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.269
Well how do you that?

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:57.730
There are three pillars of web development basically,
three pillars and you want them to be done well

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.100
and these three pillars are your content, all
the data that you want to present to the user,

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.879
all the things all the information on your website.

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:06.179
You have the presentation.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:13.179
This is how you present it to your users, whether
it is as speech or just visually in a brochure.

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:16.809
And you have your interactivity, your behavior.

00:14:16.809 --> 00:14:20.779
Now how do you make an accessible
website with these where you want

00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:25.529
to separate your content, your
presentation, and your behavior?

00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:28.659
And when you do you that you build them separately.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:33.480
You build content using semantic markup, that's your HTML.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:42.360
Then you want to create your presentation using cascading
style sheets, your CSS, and then you want to add a layer

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.700
of behavior to it and for that you
want to use progressive enhancements.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.790
That's your Java script.

00:14:47.789 --> 00:14:52.779
And you want to separate these, well what
does that really mean, the separation?

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:59.179
Basically it means that you take
this and you turn it into this.

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:08.189
You take your mixed code and you separate it into
clean markup, clean CSS, and clean Java script.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:17.260
So you want to separate your content presentation
and behavior, what do you get out of that?

00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:19.519
You get the benefit of file caching.

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:28.139
If you have your contents separated into separate
files, then all these external files they are cached

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:33.949
in the browser, they are downloaded only once by
the browser, and then retrieved from the cache

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.910
so the user doesn't have to constantly
download everything on every page,

00:15:38.909 --> 00:15:42.740
this gives you the benefit of much smaller page sizes.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:52.190
Now this has two direct benefits - one for the user, the
user has to download less so they get to your page faster,

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.330
they get a better user experience out of your website.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:00.700
For you it means, lower traffic costs
and this can be pretty significant.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:11.670
A few years ago espn.com did a
complete redesign of their website.

00:16:11.669 --> 00:16:20.159
They took their entire website and they changed it to be
built with separated content presentation and behavior.

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:26.969
As a result, their website every page
was about 50 kilobytes smaller every page

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.779
and at the time they served over
40 million page views a day.

00:16:31.779 --> 00:16:41.669
So the bandwidth savings they got out of that
were 2 terabytes a day, 61 terabytes a month,

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:47.399
or 730 terabytes of bandwidth a
year and that's a lot of savings.

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:52.929
So the bigger and more popular your website
is the more these savings really add up.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.929
So you get these benefits.

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:59.099
You also get the benefit of increased reusability of code.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.279
With separation, your code becomes more usable and reusable.

00:17:04.279 --> 00:17:09.970
You can more easily include the same elements of a
design, the same elements of a page in another page

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:15.610
because it is all separated, you can
reuse your codes in many more ways.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:21.549
You'll also get great maintenance benefits.

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:27.680
When everything is separated and you need to make a
change somewhere to the visual design or to the behavior,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.700
you only have one location or you have
one file where you have to make a change

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.830
so your maintainability becomes so much better.

00:17:35.829 --> 00:17:39.960
It is so much easier to maintain your website along the way.

00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:46.410
And this also helps to future proof your
website, well how does that really work?

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:53.370
Any time a new device comes out in the future, a
completely new device, something new that we don't know yet,

00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:59.750
something new we haven't encountered yet, but it has
a capability of browsing the web, then you may find

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.599
that it doesn't work as well with your website.

00:18:02.599 --> 00:18:10.659
Your website doesn't render right or any new device that
comes out as of today has to support at least a baseline

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.759
of standards, and this baseline
of standards that is supported

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:21.390
by all current browsers, all modern browsers, have the
same baseline and any new device has to support at least

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.820
that baseline if it wants to survive in the market.

00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:36.189
Now it may extend the features, it may add or offer more
functionality than a regular device or a regular browser,

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:41.289
but it has to support at least its
baseline of standards and because of that,

00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:49.099
if you have your code cleanly separated, then you can much
more easily add another little file or another piece of code

00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:53.089
to add compatibility with this new device.

00:18:53.089 --> 00:18:59.849
So it helps to future proof your website; makes it much
easier to accommodate new devices that are yet to come out.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.200
So how does that look like in code?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.580
Well this is a code example for, you
may have seen this in the past a table

00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:12.319
of navigation, just a horizontal navigation menu.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:13.740
Well what do we have here?

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.039
We have a table element with some table rows and table cells

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:22.129
for something that's not tabular
data at all, it is a navigation list.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.930
We have a link that doesn't point anywhere.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:31.350
If I middle click or command click on this link, I
end up on the exact same page, I am not sent anywhere,

00:19:31.349 --> 00:19:38.069
but also if a user with assistive technologies
encounters this link then they are going

00:19:38.069 --> 00:19:41.990
to have difficulty following it
because it doesn't point anywhere.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.329
We have some inline Java script to expand the menu,

00:19:45.329 --> 00:19:51.089
inline behavior here in the middle
of our content to expand some menu.

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:57.429
And we have a font element to add a little
increase in the size and add a color.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:05.100
We have a presentational image to show some arrow
down to say, 'Hey there's an expand menu feature here'

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:07.639
and it's right there in the middle of our content.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.460
This also, this example doesn't
have an alt tribute so this image,

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:17.309
when a screen reader encounters this image,
it will read out the source of tribute.

00:20:17.309 --> 00:20:27.129
Now the only thing in this entire
example that is actually content is this.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.900
That's our content.

00:20:32.589 --> 00:20:38.480
So how do we take this example and
separate it and make it more accessible?

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.039
Well we start with a content.

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:50.409
We separate it and this is a navigation list so
we use an unordered list elements and list items.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.440
We see our content our little link
there, actually pointing somewhere.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:02.500
Then we want to add a layer of presentation with CSS so
we target it and say well we give it a bigger font size,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:08.250
we give it some color, and we add that little
background image because it is a presentational image.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.890
It's not content.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:15.090
Then on top of that we add some behavior,
we use dom level 2 EventListener to

00:21:15.089 --> 00:21:20.220
listen to a click on this link and
if we find it, we expand this menu.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:31.950
So that's our way of making that table, that horizontal
table and turn it into a more accessible content

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.410
with presentation and behavior cleanly separated.

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:45.269
So we get to our accessibility cocktail and
we see these three pillars of web development

00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:49.789
and we want to start off by using semantic markup.

00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:54.009
You want to use semantic markup when you do your HTML.

00:21:54.009 --> 00:21:55.220
Now what do you get out of that?

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.370
Do you get cleaner code?

00:21:56.369 --> 00:22:01.429
When you, the more semantically rich
your code is, the cleaner it is.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:10.060
You don't get stuck using presentational elements in there
or behavior elements in there, so you just have very rich

00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:15.519
but very clean code surrounding
and structuring your content.

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:21.950
This cleaner code is of course much easier to deal with and
the purpose of semantic markup is not so that you can stuff

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:28.150
as much semantics in there, but so that you or
someone else or someone with an assistive technology

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:32.990
or search engine can get semantic data out of your page.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:39.240
Someone who is using assistive technology or a
search engine, when they go through your site,

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.890
they don't see your site, they only read your code.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:49.100
They read your markup and you want them to know well
this is a list and you want them to be able to convey

00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:55.879
that information back to the user so you
want your, the more semantic your code is,

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.160
the easier it becomes for assistive
technology but also search engines

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:06.290
to discover what your content is all about,
what kind of meaning it has, what it is.

00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:12.940
This gives you improved search engine optimization because
the easier for assistive technologies it is to make sense

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.529
of your data, the easier it is for a search engine.

00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:20.059
Now this search engine optimization can be very interesting.

00:23:20.059 --> 00:23:28.000
A friend of mine Mike Davidson once did not a very
scientific test, but it was a great example of how this,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.369
how semantic markup can affect your search engine
optimization and he called it the roundabout SEO test.

00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:44.079
He created five test cases of three pages each and
they were all varying in markup, varying in semantics,

00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:47.679
varying in whether it was a valid code at all.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.299
He used some old methods in some test cases.

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:56.339
He used very clean and rich semantic markup in
the others and he put just keyword in all of them

00:23:56.339 --> 00:23:58.619
and the keyword was something that
Google had never heard of.

00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:00.359
It was loadafizzle.

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:03.289
It was the nickname of a coworker of his.

00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:11.710
And he created these 15 test cases and after a while he
put them on a sub domain and let Google know about it.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:17.559
Then after a while he searched for it and
what he discovered was that the more valid

00:24:17.559 --> 00:24:26.109
and the more semantically rich the pages he created
was, the higher up it was in the search results.

00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:32.549
So he discovered also that keyword placement whether it
is at the top or the bottom of the page didn't matter,

00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:39.119
it really mattered whether it was in a semantically
meaningful element, regardless of its position.

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:46.579
Now, we can take this, well it helps your search
engine optimization, but it is not a magic bullet

00:24:46.579 --> 00:24:51.589
and you don't want to go overboard with
it to try and trick search engines.

00:24:51.589 --> 00:25:00.359
You don't, I've seen people who have taken H1 element, at
the most high level heading and put 800 keywords in there

00:25:00.359 --> 00:25:04.479
and then used some CSS to hide it from the browser.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:12.430
They got pretty high up in their search results for a little
while and then they got shortlisted never to be seen again.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:18.420
So you don't want to trick a search engine you want
to use semantic markup because you really should

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.210
and the more correct and accurate you
use it, the better your results will be.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.029
It will help.

00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:27.309
It is not a magic bullet, but it will help.

00:25:27.309 --> 00:25:29.710
And this helps increase your accessibility.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:35.750
So you see our cocktail glass is getting a little
fuller and we get some more access to the content.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:43.720
Now after you've built your semantic markup, you want to
use cascading style sheets to give it a nice presentation.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:54.079
So cascading style sheets, well, the best example of what
you get with cascading style sheets is the CSS Zen Garden,

00:25:54.079 --> 00:26:01.319
and you've probably already heard of it, seen it, but
for those of who may not have, the CSS Zen Garden,

00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:09.730
is an example created a few years ago to showcase the power
of CSS and it is to this day still the very best example.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:18.900
And what you get with the CSS Zen Garden is one single html
file, one single page with the same content but there is

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:26.009
over 700 hundred unique designs for it and the only
thing different in all of these designs is a CSS file

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:35.730
that is included, and these are just ten samples, but
you can see how incredible diverse the designs can get.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:43.040
But it is all the same exact content.

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:49.879
So you get CSS Zen Garden style flexibility, great power.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:58.350
It makes it so much easier to redesign and rebrand your
website whether you want to make some small changes to it

00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:04.349
or whether you want to do a complete overhaul
of your website, CSS makes it so much easier,

00:27:04.349 --> 00:27:09.759
you can hook up into your semantic mark up and
do whatever you want with your presentation.

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:17.819
You can go in any direction now this doesn't mean you don't
have to touch your mark up at all like this CSS Zen Garden,

00:27:17.819 --> 00:27:24.179
but you don't necessarily have to adjust your
mark up to make any changes in the design.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.890
So it is much easier to redesign or rebrand your website.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:36.410
Now when people start using CSS to build their
websites they often stick to their old methods

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:43.240
and they use the same methodology in building a website
as they did before with presentational mark up and having

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:52.430
to put font tags everywhere but you really want to remember
to leverage the C in CSS, it's a cascading style sheets

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:57.500
and you also don't want to fall prey to diff
class and ID overkill and what do I mean by that?

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:04.789
Well we'll go through a little example,
this is what I have seen people do a lot

00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:13.750
and they would just repeat their code examples,
repeat their code over and over again for everything

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:22.069
but with CSS the only thing you really have to do, you
can leverage the C in CSS and just specify everywhere

00:28:22.069 --> 00:28:27.029
where you have different styling and
the rest will just cascade through.

00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:34.519
So you want to cascade around and this is also something
I see a lot of people do when they first switch to CSS

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:42.119
and they'll use a dif for everything and
just hook up IDs in classes for styling.

00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:46.669
Well if you find yourself doing this these are tip offs.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:55.430
We have perfectly rich semantic elements for this, so
you'll want to use a H1 instead of a dif ideas heading.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:03.930
You'll want to use paragraph elements for paragraphs,
you'll want to use list elements for lists and last items

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:11.289
so you'll want to remember your semantic mark up
and all this will help increase accessibility again.

00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:16.339
Our cocktail goes a little further
up, but there are caveats.

00:29:16.339 --> 00:29:24.129
With so much power and control over your website it's
possible to make it less accessible, so you really want

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:32.920
to know what you are doing when you're going
when you are using very sophisticated CSS.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.779
Next you want to use progressive enhancements.

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:42.940
So we have our semantic layer, our content grade
very accessible, we have given it some styling,

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.370
some presentation with CSS and now we want to add behavior.

00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:56.119
Progressive enhancements is an approach to doing this that
basically says you want to think of your website in layers.

00:29:56.119 --> 00:30:01.719
You are building a layered set of, you
are doing a layered build up of pages.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:08.539
So you start off with just a base layer of
semantic mark up, fairly accessible content

00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:13.930
and after that when you add another layer
on top of that the presentation you want

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.970
to make sure that you don't break accessibility.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:22.529
So you start with a accessible layer and
as you add layers on top of it you want

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:29.230
to make sure you don't break accessibility on the
layers below, that's progressive enhancements really

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:36.180
and after you add your presentational layer
you add the behavioral layer of interactivity.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:46.240
Now this interactivity especially with
web applications is very significant.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.890
On a regular informational website
you don't need as much interactivity,

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:55.820
but for web applications its all about interactivity.

00:30:57.089 --> 00:30:58.859
When you build this layer...

00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:03.939
when you use this layer buildup of pages
approach, you retain all the benefits you get

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.640
out of semantic markup and cascading style feeds.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.770
You get these all these benefits mentioned before
and you retain them as you add more layers.

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:16.139
It can add multiple layers of interactivity.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.690
The more sophisticated the device
is the more layers you can add.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.500
Now this helps accessibility a lot.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:30.920
Specially with web applications, this can make or
break the accessibility of your application entirely.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:41.210
So progressive enhancements, they are a lot of work
but they really help increase accessibility a lot.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:50.470
And it is a lot of work to add layers, and layers and
layers, but as you go and more experience with using,

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:57.190
with just starting off with semantic markup, and just
base layer, very accessible content and then add the layer

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:04.799
of presentation, you'll also get a lot of
benefits like, greater understanding and control

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:07.509
of your website when you add interactivity.

00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:09.519
When you add the behavior.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:16.700
So we have our three pillars and now
we have a full accessibility class.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:23.890
Full cocktail class, and our content is fully accessible to
everyone, regardless whether they have a physical disability

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:29.300
or a device specific disability like
an older system, or a mobile device.

00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:36.750
So we've been looking at this as adding
semantics helps increase accessibility.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.569
Using CSS helps increase accessibility.

00:32:39.569 --> 00:32:43.200
Using progressive enhancements, helps accessibility.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.580
But if you remember from the start,
accessibility is this broad concept.

00:32:48.579 --> 00:32:53.919
Very vague and these are all very concrete tangible results.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.580
So its kind of a backwards way of thinking about this.

00:32:56.579 --> 00:33:02.129
This is a backwards way of saying, oh we have
these results, and they lead to this vague concept.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:08.740
So, what you'll find is that accessibility
actually leads to all these benefits.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:16.339
If you start off from an accessibility conscious base
line, you will automatically end up using semantic markup.

00:33:16.339 --> 00:33:19.740
You will automatically find yourself
using cascading style sheets

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.779
and you'll automatically use progressive enhancements.

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:26.099
And you'll get all the benefits that we've discussed.

00:33:26.099 --> 00:33:33.949
You get all these benefits starting
from accessibility and just building up.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:38.549
So how do you become accessibility conscious?

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:43.210
Well, its really a state of mind to begin with.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:48.000
And you want to think inside the box, outside
the box, below the box or through the box.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.339
Really just think in very different ways
about how people can access your website.

00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:55.579
How people can navigate your website.

00:33:55.579 --> 00:33:58.579
How they can access the content on your website.

00:33:58.579 --> 00:34:02.669
You really want to think in ways beyond your usual ones.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:07.430
So you can for instance think of
turning your monitor off and trying

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:11.010
to navigate your own website using a screen reader.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:15.240
And just trying to use the keyboard to just
navigate your website without seeing it.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.329
You can see it of course.

00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:20.119
You are not blind but you can turn
your monitor off and simulate it

00:34:20.119 --> 00:34:26.210
and we'll get all this information,
how to actually navigate your website.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:30.170
Now you also want to be mindful of your own frustrations.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:34.940
When you're on a website and you find yourself
using it a lot, but there's a few things

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.820
that frustrate you and they get in your way.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.340
They make it more difficult to use the website.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:46.980
More difficult to navigate, then these frustrations
are often an accessibility concern as well.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.559
At the very least they are a usability issue.

00:34:50.559 --> 00:34:54.289
But very often these are also an accessibility issues.

00:34:54.289 --> 00:34:58.190
So if you look into them, you have a
frustration, you can look into them.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:06.190
And you can discover some kind of accessibility related
issue, you can make sure you don't repeat that mistake

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:09.110
and don't have that same issue on your website.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.000
So whenever you're frustrated with
something on the web, you can look into it

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.239
and discover some lesson about accessibility.

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:20.279
And the biggest thing is not to fear the complexity.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:27.730
Its very easy to come out of a presentation like this, or
read an accessibility book, and find yourself going, wow,

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.289
this is overwhelming, this is very difficult.

00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:34.599
How do I really get into being accessible for all these devices?

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:37.429
All these various physical disabilities?

00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:40.929
But it's really not that difficult.

00:35:40.929 --> 00:35:48.199
If you start by separating your content presentation and
behavior, and if you just use semantic markup as much

00:35:48.199 --> 00:35:53.429
as possible, then you're going to
have a very accessible website.

00:35:53.429 --> 00:35:58.509
And really the use of progressive
enhancements will have the biggest impact

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:02.440
on your accessibility, specially with web applications.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.889
And, but it's really not that difficult.

00:36:05.889 --> 00:36:11.210
It is complex to be fully accessible, but
there's no such thing as fully accessible.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:16.860
You can never be really fully accessible,
you can only be as accessible as possible.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:24.110
And there's always trade offs to be made
when you are dealing with web accessibility.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:31.320
But the good base line of accessibility is pretty
easy to accomplish and it really just starts

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.990
with separating your content, your
presentation, and your behavior.

00:36:36.989 --> 00:36:39.789
There are also tools to help you with this.

00:36:39.789 --> 00:36:43.639
There are a lot of tools to help
you make your website accessible.

00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:49.779
Your government will probably have, in its
legislation there are tools available to you.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:55.330
There are checklists that you can use to go through
your website and see well this is accessible,

00:36:55.329 --> 00:36:57.519
this is accessible, oh I'm not doing this.

00:36:57.519 --> 00:37:00.170
Well, it will tell you how to fix it.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:07.670
There are tools like extensions for Firefox that
will let you simulate the use of a screen reader.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.539
You have these methods.

00:37:08.539 --> 00:37:10.650
There's all kinds of tools available.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:16.930
And W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium,
also offers accessibility guidelines.

00:37:16.929 --> 00:37:23.399
They have a web accessibility initiative
which produces three important guidelines.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.349
The first is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:32.170
If you're building a website, you're writing markup, you're
creating content or you're just creating a little bit

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:36.740
of content for use on a large website, then
you're building web content and you want

00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:40.559
to read the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:48.019
If you're building software, whether its web based software
or desktop software and this software has the ability

00:37:48.019 --> 00:37:53.389
to export content to the web, whether
it's CMS, College Management System,

00:37:53.389 --> 00:37:57.400
that is build to create content for the web.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:04.820
Or a tool like Photoshop, or word or pages that
has the ability to export content to the web,

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:11.400
then you're building an authoring tool and you want
to use the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:18.869
Now there's also the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
which is for every browser but also for any piece

00:38:18.869 --> 00:38:27.150
of software, again, web based or desktop software or
any kind of device that has the ability to read content

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:32.820
from the web and interact with
content from the web, is a user agent.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.440
So in that case, if you want to, if you are
building or working on a product like that,

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.010
you want to use the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.740
So you have all these tools available to you.

00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:43.579
You have...

00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:50.079
There's a lot of checklists that you can use to
really just quickly go through and learn so much

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:54.670
about web accessibility related to your website.

00:38:56.909 --> 00:39:02.469
There's one more thing...always wanted to say that.

00:39:02.469 --> 00:39:08.349
We have the iPhone and when you're designing
AJAX web applications for the iPhone,

00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:14.110
web accessibility is again a very
big part of this and it really,

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:19.890
the good design practices overlap
with web accessibility in many ways.

00:39:19.889 --> 00:39:25.579
So if you're developing or designing an application
for the iPhone of web application for the iPhone,

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:29.920
then all this stuff about web accessibility
that I just talked about,

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:35.150
applies just as much if not more
so, to development for the iPhone.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.970
So you want to use good design practices.

00:39:37.969 --> 00:39:44.779
If you want to think about using the column
layout, so that when someone double taps

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:49.070
on an iPhone then they can easily
get to a column of your content.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.240
You want to remember size matters.

00:39:51.239 --> 00:40:01.719
It's a small device and page sizes are important
specifically because it is not connected to broadband.

00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:07.819
It's a mobile device and it doesn't always have
high speed broadband or connection available.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:11.010
So page sizes really matter as well.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:22.110
If you want to media queries for CSS, and optimizing for
the iPhone means, remembering that it has a small viewport,

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:29.329
people can double tap this, they can double tap on any
part of it, they can scroll around using their finger.

00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:34.980
There's automatic text size adjustment
and you want to be ready for that.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.780
When you zoom in on a page of, on
part of the page on the iPhone,

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:45.400
it will adjust the text size and
make it as readable as possible.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.150
And there's lot of things about events.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:54.220
If you're using a lot of Java script, you
are used to a lot of dumb events that may

00:40:54.219 --> 00:40:58.699
or may not be available, or exist at all on the iPhone.

00:40:58.699 --> 00:41:00.199
There's no mouse to click with.

00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:01.319
There's a tap.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.019
There's a lot of things about even
that you want to keep in mind.

00:41:05.019 --> 00:41:11.110
And again media, it supports streaming
media like it supports QuickTime.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:16.579
And you want to be ready for that and you want to learn
about how you can make sure that it works properly.

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:20.799
That it doesn't conflict in anyway on the iPhone.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.430
Then after that, if you want more information,

00:41:24.429 --> 00:41:29.460
we have Mark Malone our internet technology's
evangelist, and you can contact him.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:35.960
We have some links here and these will
also be on the WWDC website for attendees.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.849
So you can always come back to them.

00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:47.630
This is for iPhone and media specific development you want
to contact Allan Schaffer if you want to deal with that.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:52.030
Again these links will also be on the website later on.
