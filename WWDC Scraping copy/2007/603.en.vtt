WEBVTT

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.300
>> Steve: Welcome everybody to
session 603, Delivering your Media.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.450
And today's session will be handled by the following three
gentlemen Ken Waagner, Michael Shaff, and Austin Shoemaker.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.919
So, I'm going to hand it off to Ken then.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.500
>> Ken: Thanks Steve.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.750
Hi everyone.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.649
( Applause )

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.699
So, today we're, the session is Delivering your Media.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.450
And basically what we're going to talk about the band
Wilco, who Michael and I do a lot of work for.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.580
We basically went and done all of their web and
online operations for the last six or seven years.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.839
And we're just going to really talk about how we've
used QuickTime really from the very beginning

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.390
of my getting involved in the band in 1999 and then all
the way up through the release of their current record

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.539
which came out about a month ago,
which is called Sky Blue Sky.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.810
And we're just going to go through and talk about
some of the things we've done in the past

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.799
and some of the things we currently do and
some of the things we'll be doing in the future

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.709
with the new developments in Leopard
and QuickTime and stuff.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.849
So, we'll get rolling on that.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:20.619
I should go back to that slide for a
second so I don't just blaze past it.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.380
We're going to talk about the web and the website
and how we've used the website with Wilco.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:32.000
We've really kind of, when I started working for
them my whole target was to really get them to sort

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.569
of use the web as their base of operations.

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.489
Really, the hub of where people would
come to find information about the band.

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:44.000
And I know it sounds like a really novel concept
but at the time it wasn't really happening for them

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.579
and it wasn't really happening for a lot of bands.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:52.500
It was a still a relatively, basically bands weren't,
didn't seem really to be using the web very effectively.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.519
There was a lot of confusion at the time.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:58.200
And they, the band were really willing
to kind of forge ahead with this concept

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.710
of using their site as the place for all things about them.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:08.180
At the time they were signed to Warner Brothers and
they had a record that they, they had three albums out.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.740
And they recorded their fourth album,
which was called Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.200
They delivered the record to Warner Brothers.

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.500
And Warner Brothers rejected the record as career sui-

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.259
They basically said that the record was career suicide.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:25.209
So, the band ultimately got the
record back from Warner Brothers.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.860
And about a week after we got the record back we put
the whole record on their website for free streaming.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.210
In the process of the band fighting with the record
company, the record actually ended up leaking on the P-

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.340
to-P networks and was out there pretty prevalent.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.390
And ultimately as soon as the band got the
rights to the record back we just decided

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.059
that if people were going to be looking for
the Wilco record the best place for them

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.370
to find it would be on the Wilco website.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.849
So, we put it there and we made it
available to everybody for free.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.259
This was in September of 2001 and basically
the record didn't come out until May of 2002.

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:02.620
And at the time when the record came out everybody was like,
those guys are idiots man, they just gave the record away

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.430
for the last eight months or ten months or whatever.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.260
And when the record came out it debuted at number 13
on the charts and sold 56,000 copies the first week out.

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:14.899
It has done seven, almost 700,000 copies to date.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.990
And the most records the band had
sold prior to that was about 230,000.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:29.450
So, from that point on they really bought into the whole
concept of really using the web to really effectively kind

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.269
of reach more fans and reach a larger audience.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.540
So, we've used QuickTime and streaming media

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:41.469
across the band's site pretty much exclusively
for the last, last six or seven years.

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.289
we're going to talk some about live web casting.

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.370
We're going to do a little demo or at
least show you some of how it's done.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.849
That's one of the things we started doing with
them in 2002, Apple release QuickTime Broadcaster.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.189
And I had been doing some stuff in the
web casting space up until that point.

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:03.490
And Broadcaster really just seemed to make it
really easy to do and really simply achievable.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.760
And so, we started by the seat of our pants.

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:10.469
Michael and I started doing live web
cast with the band in the fall of 02.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.400
And now we're at the point where
we basically do one a month.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.019
We go out on the road with the band and we'll kind of do
live web cast and then make archives of shows available.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.490
We'll also talk about media players.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.079
And we'll show you how we've kind of
integrated those across the whole website

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:31.430
and across enhanced CDs and across file distribution.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.709
We'll talk about the enhanced CD and we'll show you we've
done some pretty neat things with web links on the CD

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:41.409
where we were able to publish content
to the CD, updated content all the time.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.450
So, it's sort of a reward back to fans.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.060
And then some of the new stuff we're going to talk about
is some of the XML and RSS implication and showing some

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.430
of the ways we've used that across the site currently and
some of the ways that we're looking to do it in the future.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.189
And that'll pretty much get us rolling.

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:06.120
So, basically with the website it's like my real goal,
prior to starting to do the Wilco website I'd done a website

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.209
for a booking agency in Chicago
called the Billions Corporation.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:12.069
And they had about 100 artists on their roster.

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.029
And in the process of building their site I went
around and looked at about 100 band's websites.

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.789
And again, this was in 2000 I guess it would've been.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.770
I didn't see very many good band websites.

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:25.459
And from seeing them all you could really see
the things that were kind of wrong with them.

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:30.239
So, we really set out to just make the band
site really simple and really easy to navigate

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.720
and make things really easy to find for people, if
so many times you find the sites are frontloaded

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.960
with animations and just kind of like cute things.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:41.459
But, it's like as far as like, if I'm a fan and
want to find out when the band's coming on tour

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:46.729
or when the records coming out, or I just want to
see photos or I just want to do one particular things.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.810
We just tried to make it really easy for people.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.790
And the other thing I tried to do really with the
site was just make it really an open canvas

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.379
where the whole center guts of the site is just
really, I can do anything in that space.

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.990
And we were able to do photographs and streaming video

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.430
and just different presentations
really be able to use that space.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.650
And I'll show you a little bit more of the site in a bit.

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:16.029
From the web site we started when originally when I did the
stream of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot I didn't really know a lot

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:23.609
about what I was doing as far as like the whole kind of
stream, I think I just hadn't done that kind of oriented.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.790
And I had a 29 dollar and 95 cent a month hosting site.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.640
And the first day that we put the
record online we did 15 gigs of traffic.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.560
And so, I almost got shut down by the hosting company.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.480
But, over time we started to really
do these streaming players.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.670
And on the last record, on Sky Blue Sky,
we basically really set out.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.590
We started, the record came out on May
15th and we started back in November

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:48.839
and December really setting up what we wanted to do.

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:55.310
And we decided to work within this framework where
we worked everything within a 600 by 400 pixel space.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.350
And we just were able to kind of put everything into it.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.580
We started with the week the record went to press.

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:07.979
As soon as there were promo copies out we knew that
the record would immediately begin to leak on to the P

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.460
to P networks and would be
out there and start to circulate.

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:14.310
So, what we did is the week that the,
as soon as the record went to the press,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.110
the record went out to the press
on like a Tuesday or Wednesday.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.170
And that weekend we launched a stream
of the full album from the site.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.310
Initially we just did it for 24 hours.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.430
Then we did it for a week.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.189
And then about six weeks out from the
release of the record we put the stream up,

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:32.129
I'm sorry we put the stream up of the record full time.

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:37.370
And then we were able to just, through the
adaptability of this player, which Michael built.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.230
We were able to change and just throw
a bunch of different content at it.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:48.840
The band did a DVD of 45 minute live in the studio, a
DVD that was a bonus record, excuse me, a bonus DVD.

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:55.319
And we were just looking for a way to kind make people more
aware of it and give people some feel for the content of it.

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.040
So we did a preview of the trailer.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.189
And then about a month out from
the record we did a live web cast.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.110
And we sort of did everything within the same framework.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.939
And the player's just been really incredibly adaptable.

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:11.790
Michael, it's basically all built with XML and QuickTime.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:17.500
And we've really just kind of got it together where we
can really make changes on the fly pretty, pretty quick.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.180
So, we went out in April.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.240
We did a live web cast from Australia,
which was an audio only web cast.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:30.750
And then in May, a week after the record came out, we went
to London and we actually did two web casts live from London

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.350
where we worked with still photographs and streaming audio.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:41.200
And we've used this still photograph thing
pretty successfully as far as a live web cast.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.090
I think one of the things of, of the live
photograph thing is it's made, certainly for us,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:51.360
it's made web casting a lot more achievable.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:57.600
We don't have the budgets to really go out and hire a
camera crew, shoot a 20- or 30,000 dollar production.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.330
But this way, we're able to put concerts on online.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.940
Like at least once a month we're
able to bring them to the fans.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.360
And it's all for free from the site.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.129
So, that said we're going to get into our first
demo here, which is going to be about web casting.

00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:19.269
And we'll kind of explain sort of the, from
the front to back of how we do it.

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:24.799
And Michael's going to talk more about it because
he's sort of the brains behind the operation.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:25.729
And I just am there.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.120
But the first part we're going to talk about it the inputs.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.399
And we're going to show this to you as we get into the, we're
going to demo some of the tools that we use and everything.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:45.360
But, basically what we've done with the Wilco shows is we
do an audio feed from the sound board and the combine it

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.769
with room mikes in the room and try to get the
fans a real sense of presence of being there.

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:54.689
And then combine that with some
type of t a live visual experience.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.680
And like I was saying, we found that
the photo thing has worked really well.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:03.889
So, at the point where we've got it coming
into the computer we're kind of creating the,

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:08.899
we've got our content then we've kind of
have to figure out how to put it out online.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:11.879
And Michael came down to talk about that so.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:18.580
>> Michael: Right, as Ken was saying, we initially use
QuickTime Broadcaster, which indeed got us online simply

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.050
but it also taught us some lessons about what
things we would want to be able to control.

00:10:23.049 --> 00:10:28.229
And one of the things that we found was we
needed a more sophisticated input model.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.580
So, you have these various inputs, say
the audio and you've got the room mikes

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.150
that you're bringing in, you've got the visuals.

00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:38.769
All of these are going to be encoded at some setting.

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:40.860
And we'll show you what settings we use.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.759
We're using MPEG-4 for the visual and AAC for the audio.

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:48.080
But we'll show that in the actual app.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.389
Now it gets to a machine.

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:55.949
Now we thought occasionally that we were
bigger and better than we really were.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.580
And we would try to put multiple data
rates on a single encoding machine.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:06.190
Now if you ever want to invite pain in a
live situation this is a good way to do it.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:12.250
So, our first rule of thumb became
one encoding machine per data rate.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.600
So in our diagram up here we have
one very beefy looking machine.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.019
But what we actually use is a number of laptops.

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:23.639
So, we will, I think the current
laptops are called MacBook pros.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:27.710
I have to say that very slowly
because I say sometimes older names.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:33.730
Anyways we'll have a number of these set up based on how
much, how many different data rates we are going to do.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.600
And that will encode it and put it up to that big cloud.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.860
Now, what is that big cloud?

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.080
And I want to split this into two parts.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.290
The first one is if you're doing a small event
with anticipating a relatively small audience,

00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:57.610
at that point you could be beaming or
reflecting to a, you know and exert

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.080
and it could certainly handle a
number of simultaneous streams.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.830
I don't know what the current spec on that is.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.950
It would be a good thing to test.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.050
But you're basically beaming to one machine.

00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:14.349
And then that machine will handle all
of the requests from the audience.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:20.200
In our case we're dealing with a much
larger audience to an international scale.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.230
So, we actually use an edge network.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.750
We use the Akamai network.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:29.700
And we again stream to one place that then
is replicated basically around the world.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:38.870
And so, somebody in Bangladesh is going to get a stream
that is originating from relatively close to where they are.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:44.470
And we experienced this quite directly
when we did our first international show.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.720
We were web casting from Australia, Sydney Australia.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.269
I had to get up at 3:20 in the morning, which is not
something I usually do in order to set things up.

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:58.559
And at four, about 3:40 we went live.

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:02.319
And the first people that we saw were
from Iceland, and Bangalore, India,

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.940
and places that I don't normally
get to interact directly with.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.240
And we'll show how we can interact
directly with them in a moment.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.250
But, when you have that type of a reach, and
that large of an audience, then a single machine,

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.379
at a single location could be a most unfortunate bottleneck.

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:26.490
So you may need to pair up with some of the streaming
services that are out there that can have either a cluster

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:34.009
of machines. I could tell a funny story about Warner's but I
won't, in which we took down a very large piece of hardware.

00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:42.200
Because, it's not how fast the CPU can go it's how
many shovels can get in there digging out the data.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.100
So, you need to be able to handle
simultaneous streams that's the function.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:54.070
If you're looking at potentially 10 to 50
simultaneous streams that's going to be one class machine.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.720
An exert can certainly handle that.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.899
If you're looking at 25,000 simultaneous streams
you're probably going to need either a cluster

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:05.059
or some type of an Edge network to help you out.

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:11.879
Now, in our case, on this diagram I want to draw your
attention to number two where it shows a laptop.

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:19.090
And in this beautiful diagram made by Apple
it only has an arrow going up into the cloud.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:26.720
We actually wanted to turn that around because one of
the things that we found was go figure problems happen.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.470
And so we actually needed to be able to complete that loop.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.019
And we're going to talk a lot more about what I mean by that.

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:41.230
But, basically if you want to be able to fix situations on
the fly, you're going to need bi directional communication.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:46.899
And the wonderful thing about the QuickTime
API is it's actually all there for you to use.

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:52.309
And it's based off of XML, which
is just text in a formatted way.

00:14:52.309 --> 00:14:55.529
So I think we can move to our demo.

00:14:55.529 --> 00:15:00.199
We're going to start off with talking
about the input selection.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.970
And then we'll move over into the
encoding and the network settings.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.940
And then we'll move over to what the client side looks like.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:14.570
And I'll talk some about some of the fault tolerance
that we've built in order to better serve fans.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.960
>> Ken: So initially when we started web casting,
like I said we started using QuickTime broadcaster.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.570
And at least initially to get audio
online it worked really well,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.379
because of the fact that we weren't doing
video it ended up not working so well.

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:34.039
So originally we did, when we first started kinda
trying to implement a visual aspect we came

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:35.870
up with this idea of doing the slideshow.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:42.029
And the first time we did it was with REM on
their greatest hits tour in the fall of 04.

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:45.129
And, so we were doing things pretty caveman like.

00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:50.730
We were basically publishing the photos to a directory
as they were coming in, putting them on the server,

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:58.279
and then manually updating an XML file to tell the player
how many photos were in the file, then all the transitions

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:00.350
and everything were pre built into it.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:06.420
Cut to about a year ago or so and we kinda
became aware of this program Wirecast

00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:09.750
that I had had my eye on for a little while.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.220
And we finally were able to get a hold of it.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:21.350
And basically it's ended up really allowing us to really
put across a much, much more professional presentation

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.220
and it's been a lot less
pain for us as far as doing that.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:33.470
So, we're going to walk through the whole Wirecast
kinda set up initially without getting into great detail.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.279
So the initial thing for us is
setting up the audio, which does,

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:40.019
obviously the audio's the most
important thing because they're a band.

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:47.360
And with Wirecast it's basically you can add, you can
stream, I believe, three channels of audio simultaneously.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:53.169
And what you do in the audio shot
is you basically select your input.

00:16:53.169 --> 00:17:00.269
And your input can pretty much be anything from a fire
wire device to your internal line to a CD, an MP3.

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:08.289
You can pretty much drop anything into
the audio bin on the program here.

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:12.559
And then just basically select
it and assign it to your shot.

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:18.139
And so, as you build a new shot, you've
got your audio layer put into place.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.190
And normally we use a couple of different things.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:28.070
We use an M-audio a FireWire 410 box we just
bought M02 ultra light box, which we started to use.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.089
And we just kind of experimented with different things.

00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:32.839
We also have an M box on the road with the band full time.

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:39.169
So that took basically, we either do just a straight 2
mix out of the sound board or we'll do the 2 mix augmented

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:44.230
by the mikes to again try to get the presence of the room.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.680
And then there are these three layers
in Wirecast, which are the back panel,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.110
the normal layer, and the foreground layer.

00:17:51.109 --> 00:17:54.699
And those are literally layers that
you're able to assemble on the fly.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:01.039
So what you're doing, it's literally like a video production
sweep that's all built, that's all software based.

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:07.299
And so, what it gives you is the three layers of
images and you can stack, you can do a stock background

00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:11.490
and then you can do photo's on top of it
and you can bring video in on top of it.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.569
It's got really extensive transition,
which we'll show you a little bit of.

00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:19.519
But we won't get too far into it.

00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:23.619
We're able to just, you can see where we've got a new shot.

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:28.629
The way it works is on the left hand side is the preview
window on the right hand side is the live window.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:34.780
And as you add things in it automatically loads into the
preview window so you can see what you're doing.

00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:39.250
There's also the auto live button at the bottom, which
be careful not to have it checked if you're not ready

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.369
to go auto live because it's instantaneous when that's set.

00:18:43.369 --> 00:18:53.009
And then from, with here then there's a third, a third
option within Wirecast, which is the titling layer.

00:18:53.009 --> 00:18:57.490
And we found that to be really helpful because
it basically gives us the ability to add kind

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.289
of professional looking titles,
which you can design yourself.

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:05.769
I can show that even just built
into the program there are a variety

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:10.430
of pre configured backgrounds and templates that are.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:17.100
You can pretty much find one to do anything
that you sort of all different kind of styles.

00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:19.679
And again, you can design your own as well.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.920
And you can do trippy and you can do really
trippy and you can do all kinds of stuff.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:31.850
So, that's kind of some titling and then in here it's like,

00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:37.230
again on the fly what we do is we put the
titles to the songs into the player on the fly.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.029
So as the band's playing we'll
load the titles into the player.

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:47.109
And then literally it's as simple as
hitting go and it's pushing out live online.

00:19:47.109 --> 00:19:53.359
From there it comes down to the settings of how that's
going to be optimized and depending on what it is kind

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:59.419
of setting the optimization settings and Michael will
kinda walk you through that stage of using the program.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:06.490
>> Michael: Oops, don't do that inspector.

00:20:09.829 --> 00:20:14.689
There we go, the danger of using someone else's machine.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:24.360
Okay, so what we have here starting off
from the top is our different presets.

00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:32.009
We have two machines that we or two ports that
we actually port to a primary and a secondary.

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:39.230
The secondary we will typically use for our low
end stream and the primary for our high end stream.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:46.269
And if we get desperate and our primary or
secondary is not working we'll kind of unify that.

00:20:46.269 --> 00:20:48.420
You know, of course you can name them.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:53.490
We only use the announce to QuickTime streaming server.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.809
But I know that it also has the ability
to have a built in streaming server

00:20:57.809 --> 00:21:06.039
so that you could actually have this machine be your, both
your encoding, your, you know, you production, you encoding,

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:09.619
and actually the machine that was handling your server.

00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:17.799
At our level of audience, that really wouldn't work,
but for a smaller audience that might be possible.

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:20.690
Then you're basically giving it the host, which is just you,

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:26.309
know the IP or the DNS, and then
where to find your SDP file.

00:21:26.309 --> 00:21:31.899
I'm not actually going to try to go through
the intricacies of SDP for two reasons.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:40.570
One, I would get confused myself, and two what
we've found is that when you're using the announce

00:21:40.569 --> 00:21:45.529
to QuickTime streaming server in
the Apple way it just works.

00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:46.920
And that is a good thing.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.269
We also will be supporting different bands.

00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:54.750
So we will have a different user and password here for that.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.930
At that point, you know, it's pretty
much done on the networking side.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:04.560
And then for my encoding settings.

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:05.509
Excuse me.

00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:12.349
( Whispering )

00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:21.139
Okay so down here we have our own web
Wilco ones loaded on this machine.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.150
And you can see we're using MPEG4
we're doing that versus the H264

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:32.220
because we still have a sizable QuickTime 6 audience.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.630
If we had more machines on the road we
could actually have a separate machine

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.290
that was doing H264 and another one that was doing MPEG4.

00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:44.339
And then we're setting our size.

00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:53.779
We like to match the exact size of our players so that
it completely encloses that area, your quality settings.

00:22:53.779 --> 00:22:57.519
The frames per second, we do it at 15.

00:22:57.519 --> 00:22:59.250
We tried it at 18.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:03.299
We rarely find the situation where we need to be at like 30.

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:11.240
And typically we don't know exactly what the
venue is going to support until we get there.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:18.620
And we'll use tools like Net Monitor in order to
see exactly what the upload is capable of doing.

00:23:18.619 --> 00:23:24.479
And then we've got to split that upload
from between the visual and the audio.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:33.900
So, typically we'll give, you know, since we're a band based
kind of production, we want to give a good rich audio sound.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:42.330
And we'll do anywhere from 80 kilobits per second
to, if we have a very low end kind of connection

00:23:42.329 --> 00:23:45.919
at the venue, all the way up to like 192.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.960
Yeah.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.220
>> Ken: If we're feeling lucky.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.380
>> Michael: If we're feeling lucky right exactly.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:57.680
And then our video we typically like it to be
at 300 but we'll tone it down if necessary.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.170
300 would be kilobits per second.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:05.620
>>Ken: Should point out that that's for still photos
actually so that's one of the reason why we're able to push

00:24:05.619 --> 00:24:09.779
at 300 on the video is just because it's just still photos.

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:14.339
>> It is still photos but during the
transitions we want to have a nice frame rate

00:24:14.339 --> 00:24:20.199
and all of that will be encoded on
the fly by Wirecast and put live.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.509
Alright so, let's take a look at
one of our streaming clients.

00:24:25.509 --> 00:24:37.359
( Silence )

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:38.509
I can go to the archive.

00:24:38.509 --> 00:24:44.559
( Silence )

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:46.029
>> Ken: There you go.

00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:50.450
>> Michael: Okay, road case is our
area where we swap in current content.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:58.120
And right now we are featuring
the archive of our London show.

00:24:58.119 --> 00:25:05.449
I click on that and after a moment or
two our QuickTime media skin pops up.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.860
Notice that the.

00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:13.189
( Music )
Could you turn the audio down a little bit for the machine?

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.660
Thank you.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.470
Maybe even lower, there.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:29.900
So, on this to start of this is a QuickTime media
skin so I have the complete control over the shape

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:35.100
and the user interface experience, maybe even mute it.

00:25:35.099 --> 00:25:35.829
There we go.

00:25:35.829 --> 00:25:39.399
So, as much as I like Jeff I don't
want him actually singing over me.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:45.150
And we have complete control over
the look and feel of the experience.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.170
So, there's not QuickTime branding here.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.259
There's no Apple branding going on.

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:50.650
It's strictly us.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.490
And you can see that we are using it from end to end.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.289
Yes we could put holes in it or make it strange shapes.

00:25:56.289 --> 00:26:03.180
But what we've found is that this kind of
postcard motif works very well for road travel.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.470
Down here we have kind of our own controls, and in this area

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:15.809
because we're doing an archive we are
able to chapter track through I said.

00:26:15.809 --> 00:26:17.619
>> Ken: Chapter track.

00:26:17.619 --> 00:26:23.539
>> Michael: Chapter track through,
yes the demo God's are toying with me.

00:26:23.539 --> 00:26:25.329
They said you were too confident today.

00:26:25.329 --> 00:26:31.929
So, I should be able hit that fast forward arrow and
go to my next chapter track and being that I wrote

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.600
that code I don't know why it's not working.

00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:41.309
But what I really wanted to show you were two other
areas that have come about as we learn lessons.

00:26:41.309 --> 00:26:45.509
And we're hoping that because we suffered
this pain and gained this scar tissue

00:26:45.509 --> 00:26:48.200
that you folks can learn from our mistakes.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.059
I think this mike is live and why
you kept rising and I just rose.

00:26:52.059 --> 00:27:04.849
So, the first thing that we came across was, hey, we really
want to know what's going on with, oh I know what's going on.

00:27:04.849 --> 00:27:10.949
( Silence )
Okay, now everything will work including the chapter tracks.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.920
See I can step forward and there's my next chapter.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:25.509
If I press this kind of chat button right here I
come into a chat environment that is on Wilco World.

00:27:25.509 --> 00:27:30.190
( Silence )

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.910
And live in real times there are two different areas.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:40.370
There's a show area where the fans can
talk to each other and enjoy the show.

00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:44.679
And there's a support area, because,
sometimes things go wrong.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:51.090
The types of things that can go wrong are people are
behind routers or their speed setting is set too high

00:27:51.089 --> 00:27:53.419
and they're not actually able to support it.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.400
There's any number of problems that can happen.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.450
And when they first come in they're in the
support room and ask, can ask us any questions.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:05.900
And while we're running the show we'll actually
answer them and point them off to support pages.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.509
The other thing that I wanted to show.

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:13.039
( Silence )

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:22.220
Is this info panel, when you press on the question mark it
will actually go out and do a basic diagnostic on what's,

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.650
going on, now right now everything's working.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.410
So, it's telling us hey, you know,
we've got our connections established,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:33.940
we know what version of the operating system
you're using and what your QuickTime version is.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:37.009
It tells you whether you're working
on a high or a low stream.

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:38.849
That can be part of the diagnostics.

00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:45.289
It also, the media status, these are all
points where things could have gone wrong.

00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:52.079
And there's no way that I want to talk a user who really
wants to listen to the show through finding all these things

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:55.799
in the various kind of system panels
or wherever they might be hidden.

00:28:55.799 --> 00:29:00.299
So, I bring them all up into the immediate experience.

00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:05.200
Also what time the music is at
and whether or not it's playing

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.350
because sometimes somebody can get very
excited and actually hit the stop button.

00:29:09.349 --> 00:29:10.679
And they want to know what it's not playing.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.860
Well it's not playing because you stopped it.

00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:14.069
And this will point that out.

00:29:14.069 --> 00:29:21.019
And now these processes down below are actually ways
for me to know whether or not there's a possible bug.

00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:23.849
I do do them sometimes, a possible bug in the player.

00:29:23.849 --> 00:29:27.230
So I'm actually taking a look at my own state.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.490
All of these things can be put into the chat environment.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:35.730
It can be fixed and then they can close out.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:42.150
You would not believe how happy people are when
you actually have a human being that helps them out

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.530
and their problem is resolved in a matter of moments.

00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:52.079
The amount of positive feedback we
get from support issues is enormous.

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:54.029
And I can't kind of over state that enough.

00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:56.569
I mean we are talking about delivering your media.

00:29:56.569 --> 00:30:00.490
But ultimately you're delivering your organization as well.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:05.720
And if there's no organization to back it up it
can be a very frustrating experience for the user.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:11.809
And they will take that frustration
out on your organization, alright.

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:12.349
>> Ken: Cool.

00:30:12.349 --> 00:30:16.149
>> Michael: I think we're going back to demo slides, yes.

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:18.539
>> Ken: Yes.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.180
So, that's just a little run down of how we do it.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:31.279
But I would really encourage you to check out Wirecast
and just kind of experiment with the web casting thing.

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:37.769
We've done lectures and we've done conferences and we've
concerts and we've done a variety of different things.

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:38.990
And it's really a neat tool.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:43.940
And it's, when we first started doing it we had
somewhere around to about 10 percent of the user base

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.650
or probably 15 percent of the user base had broadband.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:51.800
But now we can find that, we find that about 97
to 98 percent of our user base has broadband.

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:57.549
So one of the things Michael was talking about was
the whole, we use the support pages and just kind

00:30:57.549 --> 00:31:01.909
of the interactions with the fans and the chat and
everything to really kind of like deal with the fans

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.420
and give them, try to give them a positive experience.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.529
It's one of the things that I things that I think has
really made the Wilco website successful has been the fact

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:14.950
that we've really, you know, tried to, you know, show the
fans some appreciations for in turn appreciating the band.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:20.500
And one of the ways that we set out to do
that was with enhanced content to really kind

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.539
of give people back some additional
incentive to buy the record.

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:27.930
Again with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was the
first time that we had done the enhanced CD.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:33.440
And that was one of our things was because of the fact
that the record had been online streaming for free

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:39.370
since September of 01 and on the P to P network since
July of 01, the record was coming out ten months later.

00:31:39.369 --> 00:31:42.989
And to try to incentivize
people put enhanced content on the CD

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.120
with deep links where we were able to publish content.

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:52.250
With first record, with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, on the
one year anniversary we did, we gave away a bonus EP

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:57.950
which was five addition tracks that you could only
download via the enhanced interface on the record.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:05.730
And what we really have tried to do with Sky Blue Sky
is really try to like reinvent the album experience.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:10.269
I talked about how, where, as the people's expectations

00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:14.519
or the audience expectations are changing the
music industry has really changed from sort

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:18.160
of a physical goods based business to
more of and experienced based business.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.570
And that's what we've really tried to do with Wilco.

00:32:20.569 --> 00:32:26.069
It's really kind of shifted to where the
album really has kind of come to life.

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:29.579
And we're able to publish things into it constantly.

00:32:29.579 --> 00:32:31.449
And that's really what we try to do.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:36.640
So, we're going to now just show,
Michael's going to launch the, enhance the,

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.759
we're going to do another demo from the same machine.

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:43.950
And Michael's just going to show what we've done
with the enhanced content on this record.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.380
It's the first record where we've really offered
people multiple things right off the bat.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.770
So, if we can go to demo on is it.

00:32:52.769 --> 00:32:54.099
>> Michael: Machine three, I think.

00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:54.539
>> Ken: Yeah.

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:55.680
There we go.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:00.769
>> Michael: Alright, in this side over
here what we have is a dual partitian CD.

00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:05.579
The first partitian has your audio
track just like one would expect.

00:33:05.579 --> 00:33:08.659
The second partitian is our enhance content.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:16.240
And for those of you who got to Peter's talk yesterday
you would have heard him mention reference movies.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.390
This is a great example of reference movies.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:26.000
We're basically pointing out to a place on our
server where we know we're going to put things.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.279
And, we actually want to do a few tests before we
even get there because we've learned the hard way.

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:39.910
We actually test to make sure that certain
components have been loaded in the system.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:47.040
And so, if we have any possible errors that we can detect
we'll catch them at this point before they've actually gone

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:54.230
to the network and had, you know, further complications
and will diagnose them right there and wills how a status

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.490
of what's missing and how they can resolve it.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:02.359
If I was really brave I would force a
failure here but I'm not that brave.

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:07.000
At that point please click here and we launch.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.989
And we get another QuickTime media skin.

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:21.359
After it's loaded it gets rid of the previous
skin so that it doesn't kind of cloud their focus.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.750
And what I have here are four different buttons.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:33.300
I can download a special track, an enhanced track
that was only available through this interface.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.230
I can also get wallpaper.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:42.579
I'm going to save the RSS feed for later
and we just saw kind of the archive.

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:49.909
Now, on the face of it it's, okay so there's four
buttons, so what, it's just a movie with four buttons.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.219
But, all this is being fed by XML.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:35:00.649
So, if at any point Ken calls me in the middle of the night
and he says, hey, you know, we need to move things around.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.470
We can respond to it.

00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:10.480
By using XML you put yourself one step back in which
you can actually modify where things are going to go

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.329
and then be ready for those invariable problems.

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:21.210
If your organization is good enough where you never
have any problems you can ditch this part of the talk.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:27.329
But, most likely, your organization is very similar
to ours and problems are right around the corner.

00:35:27.329 --> 00:35:32.559
XML and describing where things
are and having your assets looked

00:35:32.559 --> 00:35:38.190
up dynamically is a much safer approach
than to actually hard code them in.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:42.940
>> Ken: You should tell the, the ghost is born antidote.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.970
>> Michael: Ken reminds me to tell the Arch type story.

00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:52.569
Ken's in Chicago and I'm in California, which means
he's got two hours on me and a lot more often times.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:58.539
And I started getting calls at a very early
hour, and again, I don't tend to do very early.

00:35:58.539 --> 00:36:00.000
And they were desperate calls.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.389
There's a big problem, Ghost Is Born
has just come out and it's not working.

00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:08.129
So, I went well we've tested that a bunch of times.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:16.590
So, I was not actually sent the
final release of the album, not yet.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:24.430
When we looked at it we found that somebody in the
fabrication process had changed the name of the disc.

00:36:24.429 --> 00:36:27.789
Well that, unfortunately, changed more than a few things.

00:36:27.789 --> 00:36:30.650
This is before we had learned some of the scar tissue.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.019
So, we were actually looking to make
sure it was the right named disc.

00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:38.500
And of course it wasn't the right name disc
and it immediately locked everybody out.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.269
So, at eight o'clock I got this,
eight o'clock in the morning.

00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:44.300
And I looked at them and went hum.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.880
I said aha, I know the answer.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.710
All I have to do is change my XML,
point it to a new location.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:56.420
I'll update it so that it's no longer as
restrictive on the titling and it will work.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:03.480
And in about two minutes later I could tell Ken, hey,
tell the non such people that everything is working.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:10.349
And they were able to have the same CD, which was already in
their computer because they were all freaking out about it,

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:13.860
launch the enhance content and have it work.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:20.420
So, it's that level of responsiveness
that I think is valuable from this type

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.119
of an experience and this type of an approach.

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:26.929
Should I go to the RSS?

00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:29.379
>> Ken: No because I'll show it in a second, so.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.450
>> Michael: Then we're done with this one yes.

00:37:30.449 --> 00:37:31.259
>> Ken: Oh yes.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.380
>> Michael: I'm going to close this one out.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.510
>> Ken: And we can go back to slides please.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:40.100
( Silence )

00:37:40.099 --> 00:37:45.880
I'll try not to, how many people up here
are like familiar enough with XML or MRSS

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.200
or use it that I don't really need
to get into like elementary.

00:37:50.199 --> 00:37:51.980
Cool, a pretty good show of hands.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.139
But I'll kind of cover it in base.

00:37:54.139 --> 00:37:57.210
So basically, or you should actually
cover it more than I should.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.710
But I'll talk about it a little bit.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:07.260
What we've done with more and more we found XML to just
be amazing for us to be able to kind of port information

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.480
across various areas of the site and various servers.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:17.150
And just, we've just found multiple
applications to use it on the bands website.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:22.820
And originally the real thing was data both for
what Michael was talking about with the publishing

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.410
and the enhanced content and that type of thing.

00:38:25.409 --> 00:38:31.759
And then as we got into audio we started using it just to
kind of feed a lot of the players and feed all the previews

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.490
and everything like that and then video as well.

00:38:34.489 --> 00:38:39.419
And we're going to show you just some different places that
we've used it within, we've just shown you where we used it

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.760
within the web cast and within the enhanced content.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:49.160
But we'll also show you some different areas that we've
used it pretty effectively from a bands perspective

00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:56.239
and we'll kind of go to that now, which, if I can
go back to the same machine again for another demo.

00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:59.089
I'll just go back and show this stuff real quick.

00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:09.230
So that, on the band's website, the first
thing that was kind of happening was the band,

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:13.880
they tour about 150 shows a year all over the world.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.030
We have 50,000 people on their mailing list.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:21.420
But one of the problems is, is that when we announce
tours they end up kind of it'll be a three week tour

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.980
and the dates will kind of come
in over a period of a week or so.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.340
We'll get confirm dates and we'll be posting on the website.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:32.850
And we've tried to get the fans used to the fact
that we can't publish or send out an email every time

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:34.739
that we post a date or every time that we do something.

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:41.529
So what we try to do to encourage people to be able
to stay up to date was, we did a tour dates RSS feed.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:46.620
And all it is, is an XML feed of the dates
that we kind of published simultaneously

00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:49.109
as we're publishing the dates on the band's site.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:40:00.210
So people are able to go on and basically subscribe to the
RSS feed which is at the bottom of the tour dates page.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:09.099
And when they subscribe to it, depending on what their
news reader is it will show them the whole list of dates

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:12.339
for the band and we're able to kind of build
in ticket links and everything like that.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.329
This is in Safari.

00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:17.279
It really depends on the person's newsreader.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.269
But it works within like the Google homepage you
can have it just it'll just show the tour dates

00:40:23.269 --> 00:40:24.960
with the link for details.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.099
In that news wire it displays differently but it's
really adaptable because it's just information.

00:40:30.099 --> 00:40:37.089
So that was sort of like the first, where we
first really started to implement RSS on the site.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:47.019
With the record coming out out we wanted a way for
them to be able to publish all the news

00:40:47.019 --> 00:40:49.300
and reviews of the record that were coming in.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:54.170
and this provided us a really neat
eloquent way to do it and for them to do it.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:58.630
Basically we've got their publicist
using the application feeder.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:06.570
They're able to publish an RSS feed of all of the news,
all of the reviews that go on with the record.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:13.019
And in Safari it works pretty well because the neat
thing is that they're able to attach attachments

00:41:13.019 --> 00:41:15.710
and images as well as the full text of the article.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:19.599
So, in this way they're able to kind of,
oh she's got some broken links in here.

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:24.279
but basically you can go in and just browse
the headlines or you can open it up

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:32.100
and you can view the whole, you know, like
basically the band's entire press kit.

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:35.809
So, that's another way that we
ended up doing it.

00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:41.599
Then we got into rebuilding the
discography section of the band's website.

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:46.309
And with that we ended up doing it,
initially we built it all in Flash

00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:50.559
and it's all just basically a Flash
file looking at an XML file.

00:41:50.559 --> 00:41:56.210
When you select the record it tells the ID of the
record and basically loads all of the preview.

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.510
So, I think I muted you.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:04.840
( Silence )

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.370
>> Michael: Did you probably mute it centrally?

00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:08.599
You probably muted it centrally.

00:42:08.599 --> 00:42:09.650
>> Ken: Alright, okay.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:14.000
So anyway you can go through, the
fan can go through and basically check

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.260
out every record and be able to preview every record.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.250
And the website's wilco world dot net.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:21.659
Feel free to go there and check it out if you want.

00:42:21.659 --> 00:42:27.119
But, this is just another way that we were, it was really
handy to be able to kind of like manage the content

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:32.179
and manage the assets on the site and then just really be
able to kind of present them in a variety of different ways.

00:42:32.179 --> 00:42:37.739
So, we basically have one centralize
discography XML file that has all of the Music

00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:39.929
in it and all of the titles and everything.

00:42:39.929 --> 00:42:43.719
And that's ported across all the individual
album pages and everything like that.

00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:48.059
so, from there we kind of got to the
point where one of the thing the managing

00:42:48.059 --> 00:42:51.269
of Wilco has been it's has been a
complete word of mouth phenomenon really.

00:42:51.269 --> 00:42:53.719
The band has never really had a lot of radio play.

00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:55.339
They've never gotten a lot of video play.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.960
They're kind of like, they've been around
for ten years at the point where I really,

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.500
well not ten when I started working about
eight when I started working with them.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.440
It didn't really look like they
were going to have any, you know,

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.490
like any more upward growth at least by traditional means.

00:43:09.489 --> 00:43:12.669
And so as we started to use the
website it really started to build.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:17.440
It really was a word of mouth phenomenon especially
with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, that record in particular.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.789
And what we wanted to do was, when we got asked
to do this we sort, they asked us to try to come

00:43:22.789 --> 00:43:27.329
up with some really like new ideas and
different ways that we could kind of, you know,

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:32.799
kind of step the site up to another level and do some
things that we, you know, that we though would be cool.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.050
So they were kind enough to introduce
us to Austin Shoemaker here.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:40.760
And Austin basically and us, we
work together on redoing the,

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.050
really the discography kind of
rebuilding it in a different way.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:48.080
And so I'm going to turn it over to him and he'll
kind of explain to you what he's done there.

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:50.190
>> Austin: Alright can we go back to slides?

00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:56.589
Okay, so what we built is called Wilco MixTape

00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:01.900
And the reason why we built it is we were thinking what
if we could combine the rich media experience of QuickTime

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.320
with the social element of the web application.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:10.780
And so we went and said okay, how do we build this
using completely open standards and QuickTime.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:15.380
So, what the Wilco MixTape site lets you do is
browse the discography using the same XML file

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.220
that powers their Flash discography
and select a few tracks and put them

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:22.079
into a MixTape and send it to your friends over email.

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:25.969
And when your friends receive it
they can see it and play it back.

00:44:25.969 --> 00:44:33.359
And the most cool thing about this is it was completely
built using open standards like H2ML, CSS, Java script,

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.840
and it talks to QuickTime over Java script.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:41.890
So, I think the best way to show you what you can do
with straight up web standards is show you a demo.

00:44:41.889 --> 00:44:44.750
So let's go back to computer.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:50.150
Okay so this is what it looks like.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.599
On the left you have a list of all their albums.

00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:56.339
And when you mouse over an album you get a track listing.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.360
So I can go through and see all of the tracks of each album.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.240
So I can go and say let see I want to play this.

00:45:05.239 --> 00:45:11.669
Well no, and so then it plays I right now.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:14.470
And I can listen and I can say hey is this a good song.

00:45:14.469 --> 00:45:18.750
Yeah it's a nice song but I'm going to try another song.

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:19.530
This one I like.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.630
So now I can just drag it and drop
it into this track listing.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:31.030
So, I'll go grab another song like, now you can,
you can sort of go through and listen to songs.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.920
So this is like a good way to just discover the music.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.880
And in addition, you know, you have the social element.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:42.640
So, now I can go in and grab one last song and say this one.

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:45.179
So I can insert it anywhere here but
I'm just going to drop it at the end.

00:45:45.179 --> 00:45:49.569
And I can say, you know, my mixed tape.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:54.250
And send it to person at where dot com.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:46:04.400
Hey check this out and then I quick send and off it goes.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.420
And this is what the receiver sees.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:14.450
It's basically what you selected in another page; when
you click on it, it starts playing the song right away.

00:46:14.449 --> 00:46:15.799
And you see the full album.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.130
And so the cool thing about this
is it's all built in Java script.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.930
So all of the content's fed in from the XML feed.

00:46:21.929 --> 00:46:29.429
So, if you had a completely different band or a
completely different application you could,

00:46:31.579 --> 00:46:35.340
you could go and put in that XML and
it would look completely different.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:40.690
So, anyway we think this is pretty
cool and that's the next tape.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.510
So let's go back to slides.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:51.430
( Applause )

00:46:51.429 --> 00:46:52.440
>> Ken: You went to the demo.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.260
So that pretty much I mean, we went
pretty quick, he blazed through his demo.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.170
But that's alright.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.050
We're, that's pretty much it.
