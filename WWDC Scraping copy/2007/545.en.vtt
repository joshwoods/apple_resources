00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.000
( Applause )

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.629
>> Jason Thorpe: My name's Jason Thorpe.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.410
I'm the Xsan Engineering Manager at Apple
and I'd like that thank you all for coming.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.760
I know that after such a great
party it's kind of hard to come

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.790
in for a Friday morning session,
but thanks to all for being here.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.420
I'm here to talk to you about Xsan 2.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.510
( Cheering and Applause )

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:38.509
>> Jason Thorpe: All right.

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:40.989
So first of all, let's get just a show of hands.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.740
How many people are sort of old salty Xsan dogs?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.230
You've been around the block, you know you run
it, you think it's great, you use it today.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.679
Okay good.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:48.009
( Cheering and Applause )

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.199
>> Jason Thorpe: How many of on you are
kind of on the cusp of becoming Xsan users?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.870
You know you need a SAN and you're
getting ready to deploy one?

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:00.679
How many of you are here because you heard
about it at the Podcast Producer sessions?

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:01.380
Anybody? A few?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.940
Okay good.

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.899
So for those of you who are new to Xsan, let's
kind of talk a little bit about what it is.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.890
It's a shared file system.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.180
It's ideal for sharing sharing file content
in a high performance way for video editing,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.950
for servers, for high performance computing.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.280
Kind of anything that needs high
performance access to shared storage.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.849
So what does that mean?

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.149
Well, let's kind of take a look at what
a traditional file server looks like.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.660
So traditional file sharing environment,
we have some storage there at the top.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.619
It's connected to that file server using fibre channel.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.609
Nice big fat pipe between the server and the storage.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:42.819
But those clients down there, which are trying very hard
to run Final Cut Pro, are attempting to get to that storage

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.119
over gigabit Ethernet and it's all going through one server.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.290
So gigabit Ethernet is half the performance
of even just one fibre channel port

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.810
and chances are that server's connected with both.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.740
So what's going to happen is, you might be able to sustain, you
know, a couple of streams of video, but more than likely,

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.989
you're going to have a couple of clients drop frames.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:01.769
That's not what you want.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:03.700
That makes your whole day bad.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.240
So if we take a look at Xsan.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.310
So in Xsan, all the clients are
directly attached to the storage.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.729
They all have a nice big fat pipe to the RAID.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.079
We have something that's very similar to a server.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.810
We call it Xsan Controller.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.259
It kind of hangs off to the side.

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.859
It's connected to the storage as well.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.990
And it is in charge of dealing with all of the metadata
associated with the file systems; so, you know,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.790
the file names, their owners, their
creation dates, all those things.

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:32.959
But it is not actually involved in the transfer of the data.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.320
So another nice property of Xsan is that the
performance scales when you add storage.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.180
So in this case, you know, we might have a work load that
requires more bandwidth than just one RAID can provide.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.080
So we add another RAID and the pipes get fatter.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.540
And again, you know, we can keep scaling that up.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.590
You know, add another couple of
RAIDS and the pipes get fatter again.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.460
Another nice property about Xsan is that you can add a
redundant controller to provide failover capability.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.360
So if you look at the our first file server
slide, there is one server and that's it.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.900
I mean that one server can be connected
to that one set of storage.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.020
And if that server goes down, then
all those clients are out of luck.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.909
In Xsan, you can have a redundant
controller, we call it a standby controller.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:23.159
So if the primary controller were to fail for
whatever reason, the stand by controller just takes

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.729
over transparently and the clients
can still access the data.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.940
So we've been using, you know, some Final Cut
workstations in these example slides here,

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:39.039
but Xsan is more than just a platform
for running video applications on.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:45.799
It's a great platform for deploying scaleable and
highly available server services and it just so happens

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.790
that Mac OS X server with Leopard comes
with three of them right out of the box.

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.549
First one is a mail server cluster.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.740
Yeah mail server cluster.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.409
The second is an iCal server cluster.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.259
How many have been are interested in deploying this?

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.969
( Applause )
>> Jason Thorpe: This is pretty cool stuff.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.849
And finally, Podcast Producer.

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.909
And let's who thought the Podcast Producer
demos were just phenomenal this week?

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.609
( Cheering and Applause )

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.420
>> Jason Thorpe: So Xsan is a key
enabling technology for Podcast Producer.

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.029
We're going to like, you know, see all of
that in a diagram here in just a second.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.409
So let's just take a look at what an example
mail cluster configuration might look like.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.500
There in the middle you have sort
of your cloud of mail servers.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.160
They're all connected to a shared back end set of storage.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.570
And then you kind of have your
clients over there on the left.

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:40.730
So in between the clients and the cloud is a load balancer
that enables your mail clients to connect to this, you know,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.490
mail dot example dot com, instead of having
to know that there are forks servers there.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.430
The load balancer spreads out the
load across all of those servers.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.740
If one of those servers were to go down, the load balancer
knows to redirect the connection to another client.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.949
The mail client will retry and it
still can get to all their data.

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.800
So we're going to wave your magic wand here and
see that an iCal server cluster is very similar.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.569
Not a lot of magic here.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.730
This is all just set up in server
admin to make all this work.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.040
And then if we take a look at a Podcast
Producer cluster, it's a little different.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.290
So in Podcast Producer, you have a set
of machines that are uploading content

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.910
over the network to the Podcast Producer server.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:31.270
The Podcast Producer server is then going to place that data on
the shared storage and then the sort of work flow engines,

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:35.939
the XRAID agents are then going to process
that data that's on the shared storage.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.879
When it's done processing it, it's going to post it to,

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:44.839
for example in this example slide we have
just a web server posting to RSS feed.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.369
The web server can pull that directly off the SAN.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.730
You don't have to copy it.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.790
Slide. There we go.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.120
All right.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.840
So let's talk a little bit just about the history of Xsan.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.329
So we released the first version
of Xsan back in January of 2005.

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:03.250
It supported Panther.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.259
There were a couple of updates along the way.

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:13.519
First really major update that we had was in June of
that year when we released Xsan 1.1 supported Tiger

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:19.289
and gained support for volumes larger than 16 terabyte.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.960
Another software updater 2.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:29.319
In April of 2006 we released an update that supported
RAID sets that were larger than two terabytes.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.879
We kind of corresponded to a size bump on the RAID.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:40.000
And then the next really big update was
in August of 2006 we released Xsan 1.4.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.899
It was time to come out with the new MacPro systems.

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:47.429
It was universal binary and also
supported access control lists.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:54.509
And then here's what you're all here to learn about today,
Xsan 2.0 which is going to be available later this year.

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:55.810
So let's talk about it.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.490
What's new in Xsan 2?

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.569
So the first thing that's new in Xsan 2 is a new
Xsan application completely rewritten from scratch.

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.199
Yeah. There's a couple of people
very happy about that I'm sure.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.259
The most important thing to know about
the new admin app is it's been designed

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:16.189
to streamline all of your set up and administration tasks.

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.149
So there's not a lot of hopping
around between panes anymore.

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:21.549
It's very task oriented.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.780
And we have assistants to guide you
through those things that are complex.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:31.129
So for example, in the old admin application you have
to know that, all right, to expand a volume I have

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:35.259
to unmount my clients and I have to stop the volume
and I have to drag some things into a storage folder.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:36.360
You don't have to do that anymore.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.420
We have assistants that walk you
through all of these multistep tasks

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.160
to make it really simple and much less error prone.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.810
There's a streamlined presentation of
all the data and a streamlined work flow.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.560
We've kind of gone for consistency of gesturing
across the application so that, you know,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.959
every task that you have to do will feel very familiar.

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:01.180
And it's asset oriented.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.769
So this enables you to really find the
things you're interested about very quickly.

00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:09.859
There's a set of assets along the
left side of the application window.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.210
You can find the thing you're looking for.

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:16.509
We have some filters built in to those assets that are kind
of similar to smart play lists in iTunes that allow you

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:20.069
to drill down and find the information
that you want really quickly.

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:27.120
And finally, I think this is going to be really interesting
for small shops, perhaps boutique video editing places

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.399
where you don't have a big network infrastructure,
but you want to leverage all the things that Xsan has.

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.299
Including, for example, access control lists.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.449
That requires Open Directory.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:42.890
Well, Xsan Admin can now optionally manage your user's
groups and network settings without you having to hop

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:45.029
around to different apps and know
how to set all these things up.

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:49.409
And we actually have in integration
with the server set up assistants.

00:08:49.409 --> 00:08:54.789
So there's going to be some really nice out of box
experience for, you know, just bringing your whole stuff

00:08:54.789 --> 00:09:01.079
out of unpack it, connect the cables, power it up,
and then very quickly you can have a running SAN.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.460
So we don't have any screen shots of this
because it doesn't really do it justice.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:11.530
I actually am going to ask Jason Townsend, who is our lead
Xsan Admin Engineer to come up and give us a quick demo.

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:11.839
( Applause )

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:20.710
>> Jason Thorpe: So can we please
go to the server projector please?

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.340
>> Jason Townsend: All right.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.649
Can everybody hear me?

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.569
All right.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.129
Let's see.

00:09:29.129 --> 00:09:36.600
So I wanted to show you a little
bit about the new Xsan Admin.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.950
As you heard just a moment ago,
we've got a new navigation style.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:49.000
So on the left hand side we have the various
assets like, volumes, LUNs, and computers.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.639
And then similar to using iTunes or other apps like
that, you just pick which asset you're interested in

00:09:55.639 --> 00:10:01.759
and then you get a list of what applies to
that and you can do various commands on it.

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:12.500
So I'd like to first show you the we've also another part
of the navigation that's different, we've moved graphs

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:19.519
and logs into their own windows so, for logs
you just bring up a logs window and you can see

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:23.009
on whichever computer you're interested
in, the log that you want to see.

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:24.059
You can filter it.

00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:30.699
It's probably familiar to anyone who's used
any of our other server tools how that works.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.280
And we also have a graphs window.

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:41.269
We have a lot of graphs so you can see CPU
network traffic, fibre traffic, memory usage,

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:46.000
and you can look at different time scales.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.389
You can see us doing some set up
stuff around this time probably.

00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:56.419
And again, you can look at whichever
computer you're interested in with that.

00:10:56.419 --> 00:11:01.179
Now I'd like to look at the Quotas
pane and we've got some data on our SAN.

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:10.069
And you can quickly see what different users are
using, how they're in relation to their quota.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.400
You'll notice these little tick marks
here indicate where the soft quota is.

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:18.240
We now have separate control for hard and soft quota.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:25.399
So you can let someone temporarily go over their
soft quota, but they'll still be able to add files

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:28.529
up to their hard quota within a certain time limit.

00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:30.539
And we can also filter.

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:32.129
This applies across the whole app.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:40.389
So if I wanted to look for, you know, the French
group for example, I could filter it that way.

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:45.840
If there was a lot more here, it would
probably be more compelling there; but anyway,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.710
just imagine there's a whole screen full of quotas here.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.480
And also we have filters here where we
can look at just servers or just groups

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.750
or who's over their soft quota or
who's reached their hard quota.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:06.279
So if you know that that there's some kind of problem,
you can focus in on what you're actually interested in.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:08.620
All right.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.389
Now let's take a look at the computers pane.

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:14.449
We can see the computers we've got here.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:21.520
And another feature I want to show you, that, again, applies
to the whole app, we have what's called the Inspector.

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:25.549
And that will show you more information
about whatever you have selected.

00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:32.469
So you can see what software's installed, you can see
the network interfaces and how they're configured,

00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:36.139
and, you know, a lot of information there.

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:38.620
See what the license is.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.620
Now I'd like to just add a computer to the SAN.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.070
And that's pretty simple.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:49.340
I just click this plus button here and
there's a lot of machines on the rack

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.190
that I could add, but I just want to add that first one.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.640
And we have the option of either entering the same name
and password for everything or doing it one by one.

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:04.250
In this case it's basically the same either way.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.769
And oh, I guess I need to add a license for this.

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:10.259
Let's see.

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:12.360
I have this file here.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.440
Okay. There we go.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.360
So yeah. There's the one Jason sent me.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.379
I guess I could just let's see.

00:13:19.379 --> 00:13:23.240
I guess I could add a license and maybe retype that.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.629
Well that's kind of crappy.

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:27.059
Maybe I'll just maybe I'll just copy it.

00:13:27.059 --> 00:13:28.379
Does that work?

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:30.519
Oh cool. Okay.

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:30.600
( Applause )

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.259
>> Jason Townsend: Okay.

00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:39.789
So there's a license and then I'll go ahead and add that.

00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:45.199
And right now it's setting the license, setting up the
config files and there's a computer add to the SAN.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.290
That was pretty easy.

00:13:46.289 --> 00:13:52.610
But one other thing I want to show you,
just looking at how we deal with licenses.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.220
Those are managed as an asset just
like everything else on your SAN.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:02.960
So it doesn't like the ones we have
here, they're all assigned to computers.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.910
But if I wanted, I could add some more
licenses that are just part of the SAN.

00:14:07.909 --> 00:14:12.740
And they're not assigned to anything yet, but
when I add computers later they'll go ahead

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.259
and automatically assign as those computers get added.

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:18.049
I think I had another file somewhere.

00:14:18.049 --> 00:14:19.149
Oh, here we go.

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:21.490
There's some more some more serial numbers.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.120
All right cool.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.720
So let's see.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.500
How am I going to do this?

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:30.179
Okay, well I guess I could add one and then copy and
paste, but actually I don't think I want to do that.

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:32.789
That's gotta be a better way of doing that.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.360
Maybe I can just drag this file in.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:35.919
Oh, there we go.

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:36.129
Okay.

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:37.399
( Applause )

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:37.649
>> Jason Townsend: All right.

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:43.419
So now I've got some extra licenses available for when
I add more computers later and I don't have to worry

00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:48.870
about individually assigning those licenses
to each computer anymore like we used to.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.470
All right.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.570
Thanks. Can we go back to the slides please?

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.450
( Applause )

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.290
>> Jason Thorpe: All right thanks Jason.

00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:07.000
So the thing to take away from this is we've put a lot of
effort into making that Admin app sort of more streamlined,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.870
easier to use, and we definitely
encourage your feedback on that.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.019
So we'll keep that in mind for
later on in this presentation.

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:17.740
So next we have some improved performance.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:23.710
So one of the things that Xsan is really, you know,
good at is, you know, streaming data from storage

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.700
to a workstation, like a Final Cut workstation.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:33.450
We've actually made some performance improvements in this
area and are planning on doing more before we ship it.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.950
But most interesting is that we've actually
added pretuned volume workload settings.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:45.430
So one of the things that may or may
not be obvious to people in the room is

00:15:45.429 --> 00:15:50.209
that if you have a volume that's
been tuned to stream big video files,

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.879
it might not be so great for hosting home directories.

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:55.200
There's kind of two different ends of the continuum.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.780
Big files that are read sequentially versus small
files that are accessed completely randomly.

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:05.439
You need to set the volume up differently to work
optimally for those two types of configurations.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.690
In the old Admin app you had to know a lot of magic to make
this happen and we've kind of made that a little simpler.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:19.020
We've we're providing some sort of presets that will
allow you to select kind of at a high level what kind

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:22.379
of workload you're going to use that volume for.

00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:27.899
It'll pretune a bunch of settings, both on
the controller side and on the client side.

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:32.629
And this is actually there's a plug in architecture here.

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:38.309
If you, for example, are a shop that deploys a lot of
Xsan volumes and you know you're going to be adding more,

00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:41.129
it's going to be possible for you to add your configurations.

00:16:41.129 --> 00:16:46.320
It's just going to be a P list to the application
itself and have it appear in that pop up menu.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.210
( Applause )

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.879
>> Jason Thorpe: So we also have a new
data layout for streaming workloads.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:58.529
We're going to talk about that just a bit more
here in a second with a little diagram.

00:16:58.529 --> 00:17:03.620
But we think that this is going to be really
good for folks that are making the transition

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.390
to uncompressed high def video, want to work
with that and kind of like this online format.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.170
We've heard some anecdotal reports
of kind of like a ceiling.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.170
When you get to a certain number of
streams, like you kind of get stuck.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:21.850
We're making some changes in the way we actually
lay out the data that are designed to address that.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:28.899
And finally we have some more advanced settings for even
finer finer control for you guys to fine tune your volumes.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:34.420
You're not going to have to edit config files manually
based on what a kbase article says anymore.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.600
You're going to have some things that
are right there in the application.

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:42.289
So if you know that you have, you know, a folder that's
going to have a hundred thousand items in it or more,

00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:47.859
it's going to be possible for you to tune up some
settings to make that work a little better.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.889
So let's take a look at what the new data layout looks like.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.640
First let's look at what the old one looks like,
the kind of standard one that we use today.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.259
And this still exists in the Xsan 2 software.

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:00.980
So we have two movie clips here.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.349
They're both uncompressed high def movie
clips that require a lot of throughput.

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:08.959
Each of them requires, you know, two full
Xserve RAID's worth of bandwidth.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.620
So we have a storage pool here that's going to hold our video.

00:18:12.619 --> 00:18:20.119
And we have that storage pool has an affinity assigned
to it so when people are storing their video files

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:25.129
in this their video folder, it's
getting steered to this storage pool.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.280
So when we write the first movie, it's
going to get spread across all of those RAIDS.

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:34.609
When we write the second movie, it's also
going to get spread across all those RAIDS.

00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:40.759
So the problem here is that if you're accessing those two
video streams independently, you're going to have contention.

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:43.150
Those RAIDS are going to be doing a lot of work.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.050
The discs inside are actually going to
be seeking back and forth a lot.

00:18:46.049 --> 00:18:50.490
And if you push this too far, you may drop frames.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.440
So what we've done is the new streaming
data layout that is going to be enabled

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.610
when you select the appropriate
volume configuration when you set

00:18:58.609 --> 00:19:03.459
up your volume is we actually split
that up into multiple storage pools.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:10.559
But your users might be used to having one folder that
has an affinity for video to put their content in.

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:12.629
They don't want to have to know that
they have to put it in different folders.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:20.400
What we've done is decoupled storage pools from affinities,
and now affinities can encompass multiple storage pools.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.930
So now the user can drag, you know,
a movie file into their video folder

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.970
and the first one's going to get written
to the video one storage pool.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.579
The second one's going to get written
to the video two storage pool.

00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:35.549
They're both going to have the bandwidth they need and
they're not going to have contention for each other's drives

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:40.950
because we round robin those files
across those storage pools.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:46.509
So the third big new thing that we have
in Xsan 2 is something we call MultiSAN,

00:19:46.509 --> 00:19:50.259
and what this allows you to do is
provision your Xsan controllers.

00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:56.720
So I have a diagram coming because this is maybe
a little hard to grasp just from the text here.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.900
But what this really allows you to do is isolate
your mission critical volumes away from one another.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.430
So if you have something that's really
important, like a playout volume,

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.539
you don't want trouble on another
volume interfering with that playout.

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:12.009
This allows you to do that while
still having global visibility.

00:20:12.009 --> 00:20:19.609
So it allows you to have one machine connected to sort
of both SAN islands to move the data back and forth.

00:20:19.609 --> 00:20:22.189
So let's take a look at a diagram here.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.700
So over on the left we have a post production volume

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.410
with some Final Cut Pro workstations
and they have their Xsan controllers.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.670
Then over on the right we have a playout volume.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.560
And there's a playout server that's playing
out to air and it's pulling its data directly

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:43.409
from its volume with its own dedicated controllers.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.350
In between there we actually have a data mover.

00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:46.219
This is optional.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:53.650
I wanted to point this out because I think there's a
developer opportunity here for a for a playout server

00:20:53.650 --> 00:21:00.330
that can watch, for example a folder in the production
volume and do a rate limited copy up to the playout volume.

00:21:00.329 --> 00:21:05.269
Using Finder to copy that data you're going to
really pound those discs to try to copy data fast.

00:21:05.269 --> 00:21:08.529
So I think there's a developer
opportunity here in that data mover piece.

00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:12.549
But as you can see here we've got these
two sets of control lists provisioned away.

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:16.309
So how many of you run multiple
volumes and you have like a pool

00:21:16.309 --> 00:21:19.089
of like four controllers if you in your SAN deployments?

00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:20.029
Let me see a show of hands.

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.639
A few people here.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.980
Okay. So you may have noticed that when you bring

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.509
up the SAN you might have all four volumes
being hosted on one controller, right?

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:29.549
If you observe that behavior before?

00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:32.250
MultiSAN allows you to sort of fix that problem.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.000
You can say, well these two controllers
are only involved with this volume.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.210
These two controllers are only involved with this volume.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:44.480
So if you have a failure of a controller
on, say, the production volume,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.940
neither one of the playout controllers is
going to attempt to take control of that volume.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.150
They're completely isolated, but there's
still completely global visibility.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.460
So everything can see everything else.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.450
Finally, Xsan 2 supports Spotlight.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.309
( Applause )
>> Jason Thorpe: Yeah.

00:21:58.309 --> 00:22:06.149
So for those of you who aren't familiar with Spotlight,
Spotlight is the searching facility that's built

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:12.180
into Mac OS X. It allows you to find files based
on their content or any part of their metadata.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.250
So Xsan is actually fully integrated
into the Spotlight search experience.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.700
It works just like a local volume
and, you know, just what users expect.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.840
And it supports all the standard Spotlight API's.

00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:28.709
So if you, as a developer, are integrating
Spotlight support into your applications,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:33.319
you're going to get Xsan search and support for free.

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:37.230
And finally this does require Mac OS X Leopard.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.789
So it does not work with Tiger.

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:45.639
Tiger clients will work in a SAN environment like this.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.759
The content will still get indexed,
but Tiger will not be able to search.

00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:55.680
So I'd like to bring Bill Studenmund,
who's one of the Xsan file system engineers

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.450
who actually did a lot on the Spotlight
support in Xsan 2 to give us just a quick demo.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:04.190
( Applause )

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.920
>> Bill Studenmund: Can you hear me?

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.840
Can you hear me?

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:12.059
Excellent.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.640
All right.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.890
As Jason mentioned, my name's Bill Studenmund

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:24.650
and I've been the engineer that's worked
most on the Spotlight in Xsan component.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:31.590
And in order to demonstrate Spotlight for you today
I was going to take the role of a content creator.

00:23:31.589 --> 00:23:35.230
Spotlight is really great for what it lets you do.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.029
And so in this demo I'll be part of a group.

00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:42.000
I have Alice and Bob as my co workers.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.670
And we create various forms of content.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:54.170
We have images, movies, documents, and our
collaboration is a lot easier with Xsan.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.670
We have one volume; all of our files are there.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:03.550
If we're one of us is done with a part of a project,
wants to hand it off, it's just there for the next person.

00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:05.029
That's great.

00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:10.410
The problem we've had is we have
all of our content on our Xsan.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.759
That makes it kind of hard to actually find
things when you're not working on them.

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:22.529
We tried folders and then subfolders and subfolders
and that's great if however it is you set those folders

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:25.339
up is how you always want to find things.

00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:34.250
But if the reason you're looking for a file, the keyword
is not one of the top folders, it can be like 20 questions.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.400
With Spotlight it's a lot easier.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:50.150
We just keep our files in folders on the SAN
and Spotlight will find whatever we need.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:55.750
We also really like Spotlight because
it gives us very free form searches.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:03.420
We just pull up a search; we like it so much
we've actually made some smart searches.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:14.140
We we just have a smart search for images,
movies, documents; they're kind of boring.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.300
We just we search for something and we see it there.

00:25:17.299 --> 00:25:22.529
With Quick Looks you can go in and make sure
what you're looking at is the one that you want.

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:27.119
We also we love Spotlight because also it's free form.

00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:29.719
Sometimes we got more than we wanted.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.390
Well sometimes, if you're looking for one thing, we think
we know exactly what we want, we find something else

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.480
and realize, oh, that's actually a better idea.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.180
So it can lead us in directions we
hadn't thought we were going to go.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.330
So let me show you some searches.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:26:01.000
Hello? Oh there we go.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.250
Okay. Oh. I'm seeing everything on the
volume, including some of shell's files.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.579
All right.

00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:11.659
I just started a project on Yosemite.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:17.430
So let's see what we have.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.539
All right.

00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:29.930
It looks like I've got some images, really nice
looking pictures, and it looks like I have a map.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.539
Well, that's a good starting point.

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:33.879
That can get me going.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.040
We can do other searches.

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:42.269
Say you're looking for an image
of someone surfing on the beach.

00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:47.259
Not someone surfing in the water, not
someone putting the surf board in their car.

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:55.410
If you click in the right okay.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:27:01.570
If you ah, I see what's wrong.

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:12.589
There you get the image.

00:27:13.829 --> 00:27:16.909
Exactly what I was looking for, and then it went away.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.890
You can also do other searches.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.600
I have a project I'm starting where I need some sunsets.

00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:26.500
So let's see what we have.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.299
All right.

00:27:29.299 --> 00:27:30.369
I have some images.

00:27:30.369 --> 00:27:31.929
That's a good start.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:38.580
But I was talking about this earlier and Alice
said she has a sunset she's been working on.

00:27:38.579 --> 00:27:40.869
It's a Namibian beach.

00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:41.569
It's beautiful.

00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:46.519
She thinks it's just what I need, but I don't see it yet.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:49.519
We love Spotlight because the searches are dynamic.

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:58.359
As any of us change content on the SAN, all
of the searches can see this and update.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:06.809
So Alice has been working on things and,
oh, it looks like she just finished.

00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:15.500
And there is her beach that she was telling me about.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.680
I think that would really work for my project.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.090
Not only that, but like I was saying, with
Spotlight you get more than you'd asked for.

00:28:24.089 --> 00:28:33.269
I've got some other ones that I can flip through and these
aren't quite what I needed, but they can give me ideas.

00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:37.059
So that is Spotlight searching on Xsan.

00:28:37.059 --> 00:28:39.889
We really like it and we hope you will too.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.120
Thank you.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:44.739
( Applause )

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:49.210
>> Jason Thorpe: Okay, can we go back to the slides please?

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.750
Thanks Bill.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.250
>> Bill Studenmund: You're welcome.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.259
>> Jason Thorpe: Okay.

00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:58.490
So those are the four big new things in Xsan 2.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:02.609
And at this time I'd actually like to bring up Bill Hudson
who's the director of business and market development

00:29:02.609 --> 00:29:08.509
for ProApps at Apple, who's going to talk to us about
how these new features can help the ProApps folks.

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:10.519
>> Bill Hudson: Thank you very much, Jason.

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:13.490
( Applause )

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:20.039
>> Bill Hudson: As many of you may know, we
released Final Cut Studio 2 just this last couple

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:22.649
of weeks, about three weeks ago.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:30.250
And it is a comprehensive suite of applications that
include all of these products, Final Cut Pro 6, Motion 3,

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:35.170
Sound Track Pro 2, Color Compressor 3, and DVD Studio Pro 4.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:40.269
This is an entire suite of applications
that address a lot of different disciplines.

00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:44.279
And when you have so many different
disciplines in a particular suite,

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:48.089
naturally you have a work group requirement.

00:29:48.089 --> 00:29:54.319
And Final Cut Pro and Final Cut Studio works
absolutely beautifully in a SAN environment

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:59.339
where many different artists can
work together to create projects.

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:06.409
Well Final Cut Studio is incredibly popular
with the individual users and the like.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.410
But on Xsan it absolutely sings.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:13.190
And I'm going to talk for a few minutes
about some of the types of deployments

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:17.100
that we see around the world with Final Cut Pro.

00:30:17.099 --> 00:30:23.799
But first let's take a look at who these
customers are, well, and what they do.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:25.809
They're independent productions.

00:30:25.809 --> 00:30:30.669
They make, maybe documentaries, they
make feature films and the like.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:36.830
A lot of the independent films that would go
at Sundance and the like, boutique post houses.

00:30:36.829 --> 00:30:42.829
Now boutique post houses and independent productions
are the class of customer that typically is

00:30:42.829 --> 00:30:47.349
in a small work group of about three to five or six users.

00:30:47.349 --> 00:30:57.189
This is, at times well, it's a majority of the Final Cut
Pro user on Xsan falls into this category of about six or so.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.080
We have many, and I'm going to show
you many that are much larger,

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:04.169
but we find that a majority of our
users are in that classification.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:12.190
And Xsan 2 is going to go a long way to helping
these guys set up their systems and manage them.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.080
So we're very excited about that.

00:31:14.079 --> 00:31:20.529
Television production, shows like Scrubs and
others where, a lot of reality television as well,

00:31:20.529 --> 00:31:27.480
where there's a very quick turn around and you'll have work
groups of anywhere from three and four people all the way

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:34.829
up to very large facilities such as Bunim Murray Productions
in Los Angeles which produces reality television.

00:31:36.339 --> 00:31:37.699
Next, feature film.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.930
I talked about that.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:47.090
Typically small configurations of no more than
about four or five editors on a single system.

00:31:47.089 --> 00:31:51.389
Broadcast created is a big market for Final Cut on Xsan.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:56.730
These are people who do on air promos and
bumpers and station ID's and this type of thing.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:01.220
Very very popular on Xsan with Final Cut Studio.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.880
Broadcast news is an environment where we are
only really starting over the last few years

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.500
to make in roads with Final Cut Studio and Xsan.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.490
Broadcast news is a very different requirement.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:21.380
We rely on a lot of third party companies such as Building
for Media, Gallery, other companies like Grass Valley

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:26.010
and others for integration in this category.

00:32:26.009 --> 00:32:31.200
And then there's broadcast production.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.799
So long form television shows and the like.

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:38.180
So let's look at an actual deployment.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:46.870
This is a schematic of NHK's production
environment for the Olympics in Turino,

00:32:46.869 --> 00:32:51.779
Italy for the Winter Olympics about a year and a half ago.

00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:57.970
And they relied on Final Cut Studio
and Xsan and a third party product

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.670
from a small developer in the UK called Gallery.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:06.180
And Gallery has an application called PictureReady.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:14.769
And PictureReady allows for live base band streams
in this instance it's the ingest from satellite.

00:33:14.769 --> 00:33:21.519
HD streams that are coming in to
PictureReady running on a Mac, ingesting

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:25.740
through a Kona card to the DVC Pro HD codec.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:32.529
The beauty of PictureReady is that it
allows editors on Xsan to instantly access

00:33:32.529 --> 00:33:36.299
and edit these files as they're coming in.

00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:40.809
Now you can imagine in a live sporting event
how important that is because you can't wait

00:33:40.809 --> 00:33:44.819
to for an event to finish before you can start editing.

00:33:44.819 --> 00:33:48.639
Well, the beauty of this is, of course
you can be editing as it's coming in.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.810
They can online and do some color grading,
edit this thing, and send it out right away.

00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:57.599
Extremely successful application and deployment.

00:33:57.599 --> 00:34:02.480
They used it at the World Cup as
did a couple of other broadcasters.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:11.510
Another high profile customer of ours around the world
is CCTV, Central China Television in Beijing, China.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:18.020
And they were launching a television network
that was an HD broadcast facility and they needed

00:34:18.019 --> 00:34:23.360
over 20 Final Cut Pro systems to be
editing multiple shows simultaneously.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.890
And they turned to Xsan and Final Cut Studio.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:31.339
And at that time they really had an issue.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.280
They wanted to work in uncompressed
HD to get the highest quality.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:41.680
But as Jason spoke of earlier, you have bandwidth issues.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:49.269
High definition, HD, can range from 100 to
about 150 megabytes per second per stream.

00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:53.960
And Final Cut Pro can allow you to edit
multiple streams on a single station.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.559
So you can see that you do the math and you
are not going to get 20 uncompressed streams here.

00:34:58.559 --> 00:35:05.190
They used the DVC Pro HD codec
primarily in addition to uncompressed.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:12.679
Well Final Cut Studio 2 has a new codec
and that codec is called Apple Pro Res 422.

00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:22.129
The beauty of this codec is that it allows you to edit
uncompressed quality at standard definition data rates.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.530
It's a full raster or a full frame rate codec.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.990
It's an eight or ten bit codec.

00:35:27.989 --> 00:35:30.000
It's a variable bit rate codec.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.809
And it allows you, as I said, to work in very high,

00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:39.659
extremely high quality HD as around
20 to 22 megabytes per second.

00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:44.940
So an incredibly efficient codec and
CCTV is incredibly excited about this.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:51.909
They will be able to move all of these stations
to this codec for a higher quality output.

00:35:51.909 --> 00:35:56.480
Next, traveling the globe, we're now looking at Televisa.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:05.030
Televisa is the largest Latin American broadcaster and
they have deployed a lot of Xsan in multiple facilities.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:10.300
Here we're looking at a render pipeline
using Compressor and Qmaster.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:16.280
Now they have over 50 Mac work stations in
this particular facility and 10 work stations,

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.760
and those are the 50 doing Final Cut
editing, and then they have 10 work stations

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.560
that are doing graphics in 3D using Maya and After Effects.

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:32.759
Now the beauty of this is facility in this installation
is that we've got a rather large render farm of 12 servers

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.620
and this render farm allows them
to use Compressor for transcoding.

00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:44.029
It allows them to render Maya and After
Effects projects using Qmaster

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:48.850
so they can use this entire render
farm for all of these purposes.

00:36:48.849 --> 00:36:59.029
Now Televisa also has a lot of Discrete
or Autodesk products for high end graphics

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:05.190
and compositing using Flame and Flint work stations.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:10.980
And Xsan is compatible with the StorNext file system.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.809
And that allows them to connect
these autodesk work stations to Xsan

00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:22.460
and allow Final Cut Pro to be a
feeder into those work stations.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:28.559
Those are incredibly expensive work stations
that start at around $250,000 per work station.

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:31.799
They didn't want to they did not
want to scrap that investment,

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.780
yet they needed to connect their editing
stations into their existing facility.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:44.450
And because of the cross platform support of
StorNext, they're able to do that very efficiently.

00:37:44.449 --> 00:37:52.139
Now more locally here in the United States, we've got
CNN in Washington, D.C. And they're using applications

00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:55.869
from Building for Media and their Fork products.

00:37:55.869 --> 00:38:01.210
And CNN has been on the air for
nearly two years with this system.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:09.199
They do a number of shows from Washington, D.C. all
on Xsan, all on Final Cut, using Building for Media.

00:38:09.199 --> 00:38:12.210
And it is incredibly successful solution.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:17.579
You'll notice that there are a number
of iMacs and PowerBooks in this system.

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:21.569
And they've got a server that allows
them to tie those systems in.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.470
They're working off line in Offline resolutions.

00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:29.299
But again, the Building for Media
applications work very beautifully

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.060
with Final Cut Pro and there's a great solution there.

00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:40.449
There are deployments all around the world with
Building for Media running Xsan and Final Cut.

00:38:40.449 --> 00:38:42.219
Now next, this is an interesting one.

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:48.189
This is a facility that has been in the
testing phase for a number of months in Asia.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:54.900
And they had a requirement of connecting
two facilities, a production studio

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.500
and a post facility, by fibre over 30 kilometers.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:10.500
And so they had some fibre relay switches in there,
what they call a DWDM switch; it's basically a repeater.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.489
And they had two volumes in each facility.

00:39:14.489 --> 00:39:20.129
Well now, with MultiSan, you have the ability
to deploy that in this type of environment.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:26.630
If you lost that connection between those two SANs,
both can work independently without a problem.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.849
Right? That link comes back up
and they're communicating again.

00:39:30.849 --> 00:39:34.289
So in this instance here, if they lose that link,

00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:39.079
they've got a problem because they're both
actually co dependant upon one another.

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:49.699
So Xsan 2.0 is going to be fantastic in allowing for this
type of environment to work very very efficiently.

00:39:49.699 --> 00:39:53.869
And I think we've got one more.

00:39:53.869 --> 00:39:55.509
That's right.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:40:00.710
We if you were at the session a couple of days
ago that J.D. Mankovksy gave,

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:04.880
he talked a little bit about the Vicom VMirror.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:11.820
This is a very successful appliance that has been
deployed in a number of important broadcasters here

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:15.190
in the United States as well as others around the world.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:20.349
And it allows you to mirror your your Xsan entirely.

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:25.039
So broadcast facilities, they absolutely
need that redundancy.

00:40:25.039 --> 00:40:26.400
They need the protection.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.900
And also, quite honestly, you know, you
never know what kind of disaster may happen.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.389
You may have power outages and things like that.

00:40:34.389 --> 00:40:42.869
This allows a file that's being written to the SAN to be
simultaneously written to two distinct SAN mirrors, right.

00:40:42.869 --> 00:40:50.309
So this is working today at a number
of facilities NFL Network for one.

00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:55.400
The Korean Broadcasting broadcaster,
National Korean Broadcaster, KBS, in Seoul,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.150
Korea is using this system very effectively.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:07.730
They've got 19 Final Cut Pro work stations and they
are mirroring their SAN using the Vicom VMirror.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:14.539
So these are just a couple of examples of a
large deployments doing different types of things

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:20.789
with very unique requirements and
Xsan gives you that flexibility

00:41:20.789 --> 00:41:24.820
to customize your solution for your particular installation.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.570
Again, thank you very much and I'll hand it back to Jason.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:27.809
( Applause )

00:41:27.809 --> 00:41:28.610
>> Bill Studenmund: Thank you.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.470
( Applause )

00:41:30.469 --> 00:41:33.369
>> Jason Thorpe: Thanks Bill.

00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:38.089
Okay. So, we've gone pretty fast today, which is good.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.860
We're going to have a lot of time for questions and answers.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.250
So let's just summarize what we have here.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.920
So Xsan 2, just a recap.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.190
What is new in Xsan 2?

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:56.220
We have an all new Xsan Admin, we have improved
performance, we have MultiSAN, and we have Spotlight.

00:41:56.219 --> 00:41:59.589
A developer preview is available today.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.940
Some of you may have already downloaded
it earlier in the week.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.730
I actually encourage you to download it again.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.469
We found a problem with the original one that was posted.

00:42:05.469 --> 00:42:07.819
Download it again if you've already done so.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:14.450
You can get it from the Apple Developer
Connection and it supports Tiger and Leopard.

00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:22.679
For more information, first of all for general Xsan
inquiries, feel free to send email to Xsan at Apple dot com.

00:42:22.679 --> 00:42:27.480
That will reach the appropriate folks who can get you
more information if you're interested in purchasing Xsan.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:33.829
For anyone who's interested in participating
in the Xsan seeding program for Xsan 2,

00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:38.400
I encourage you to contact Shayaan Siddiqui
Shayaan, can you stand up and wave your arms.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.950
This person can help you if you're interested
in being part of the seeding program.

00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:48.289
And this will allow you to, you know, provide
a lot of feedback on the product early on.

00:42:48.289 --> 00:42:51.630
And then finally for general information
about Xsan support and other resources,

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:56.410
you can always go to the Xsan web
page as Apple dot com slash Xsan.

00:42:56.409 --> 00:43:01.279
And then I'd like to also take a minute
to plug some of our Xsan user communities.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.110
We run a mailing list at Apple
called the Xsan Users Mailing List.

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.430
You can just go to lists at Apple dot
com at your web browser and, you know,

00:43:08.429 --> 00:43:10.239
browse that, search that, and sign up for it.

00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:15.869
And then also we have an integrator that
actually runs a community site calls Xsanity.

00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:18.329
There's a lot of useful tips and tricks there.

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:20.559
Please, I encourage y'all to, you know, take a look at that.

00:43:20.559 --> 00:43:21.829
There's always lots of good info there.
