00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.429
>> For those of you that haven't been to one of my
sessions I'm Shawn Geddis, enterprise consulting engineer

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.589
and through my work with a lot of the government

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:28.269
and enterprise customers, VPN access
has been one of the trouble spots.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.589
Has anybody had that situation?

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.789
Is that why you are all here?

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.990
The typical environment, there's so
many as you hopefully understand,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.640
there's far too many VPN remote access type
solutions to be able to cover all this in a session.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.340
So we are going to hit on a couple and I think one
thing that we definitely want to do at the end,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.320
we want to have a really good Q&A cause I think that's
kind of where we can drill down to a little bit more

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.469
of the troubling area's that you might
be facing that we haven't covered here.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.450
So this is going to be a little bit higher
level overview then some of you may need to have

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.159
for some low level trouble shooting but we'll do our best.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.929
So we kind of want to talk about internet connect
being the application for remote access and in some

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.070
of your environments you know how we,
what do we need to do to configure that.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:23.099
How do we need to get into your, setup your networks?

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.259
So hopefully we are going to, first of all those
not aware we want to help you understand what some

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.660
of the challenges are in providing the services.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.640
Understanding the services in OS X for remote
access, some specific enhancements that we've done,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.780
even in the end of the Tiger train and with Leopard and
hopefully cover some of the integration into some

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.859
of the environments and vary little by the way of providing
troubleshooting at least in this session right now,

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.849
but we can help you with information going forward.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:00.219
So again hopefully you are going to learn a little
bit what's going on in OS X in remote access,

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:06.719
the compatible enhancements in 10.4 that
we've added along the way and in 10.5.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.689
So let's start with remote access, Internet
Connect that's typically what you're all using

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.590
for setting up your internet connections.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.569
On the VPN side of the house you've got layer two and
point to point and it be kind of interesting to know

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.169
who all's using layer two over point
to point or taking other solutions.

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.979
But we'll just hit on a couple of these
and we can maybe talk a little more

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.209
in dept with some of you maybe even in Q&A.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.350
So if you look at the configuration within Internet
Connect on here, within a setup for say a layer two

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:49.289
for IPSec the user authentication options that you
have obviously the password, one time passwords as well

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:55.799
with securID with CRYPTOcard certificates
Kerberos and then there is machine authentication,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.219
right some of you are wanting to do
more in the machine authentication area.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:08.490
We do support both the shared secret certificates and
I think I have the enhancements we did along the way

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.860
in Tiger so some of you may have seen this.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.880
Some of you may have been able to all of a sudden,
things worked maybe after one of the software updates.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.490
Kerberos related with IPSec, group filtering with Cisco.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.409
Anybody doing groups on Cisco Concentrators,
okay a couple of you.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.419
And NAT traversal is a big issue.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:37.629
They did some definite improvements on the compatibility
on the NAT traversal and during those builds to that's

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.269
when we added CRYPTOcard as the second
one time password support as well

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.450
and we as Apple we use the CRYPTOcard
solution quite extensively.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:54.129
So when, we were just covering the one time password, both
CRYPTOcard and securID are available on there as well.

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.799
I think I was just pointing that out to
those folks that weren't aware of it.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.870
Okay enhancements in Leopard, continuation
with NAT traversal,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.129
that's a situation if you had both the
client and the server behind a NAT.

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:16.810
Hopefully people were able to leverage that if they were
having trouble if there server itself was also behind a NAT.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.930
And of course the enhancements with DHCP over PPP in
the same time frame with Leopard enhancements here

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.689
with getting the static routes, search
domains and all from the concentrator.

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:31.269
That's adding the enhanced compatibility
that both Microsoft and Cisco.

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:36.789
So if you're in those environments that will improve
when you get, when you come out with Leopard.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:46.390
Hello. So here we go with, lets kind of walk through
the situation to better understand what's going

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.949
on with communication, the components that
are in there and what you need to know

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.939
with respect to the exchange of information.

00:04:54.939 --> 00:05:00.420
So first of all lets specifically look right now
at just layer two tunneling protocol over IPSec,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:09.640
kind of connectivity here, in this scenario I've got one of
our laptops set up with remote access with internet connect.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:17.209
I'm going to say Cisco 3000 a line concentrator and in the
end there we are looking at authentication server typically

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:22.069
in this environment people are using
like a Windows IIS server bound to AD.

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.420
So as I am doing my request from my laptop, I'm
going to do the request to the concentrator.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.390
The concentrator is then going to make the request
back to me, to my client saying okay who are you?

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.069
Prove your identity.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.100
And I'm going to provide that back to the concentrator and
in this environment we're going to go in a little bit more

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.520
in depth as to what's necessary her because in
this case the Cisco 3000's not going to be able

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:53.930
to terminate the EAP-TLS session here, so what happens
is, its actually passing this off as a RADIUS request

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.660
to the Windows IIS server, and that's some area's
where some people may have had some issues.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.080
So were actually passing it off as a RADIUS
request to the authentication server,

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:13.099
if everything is okay with that identity,
RADIUS success comes on back to the concentrator

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.939
and of course then we're in, session complete.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.720
So lets look a little closer at some of the
configuration issues you might have with that 3000 line.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.060
One is that on the, on a Cisco concentrator
side since we are doing layer two right,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.129
we are not doing a pure IPSec connection
from the client to the concentrator,

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:36.389
your actually having to set up the concentrator.

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.490
Set it up for eight proxies, right and then
doing RADIUS to that authentication server,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.639
or in this case we are doing groups who are doing that
shared key, and we're going to get into a little bit more

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.310
about the fact that within those
concentrators there's issues with the groups.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.280
You got the base group and then you got some
additional configuration for various groups.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:59.169
So the fact that layer two of our,
layer two of our tunneling protocol

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.189
over our IPSec is kind of the key point here.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:10.360
There's all kinds of stuff we can get into but one of the
key pieces is that you're additionally on the concentrator,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.689
your having to set up the authentication servers.

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:18.810
Many of you have got, are familiar with the
administration on the concentrators here.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.069
Got some of the parameters that you can go back
on the slides later on and check and compare along

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.930
with your configuration on your concentrators

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:37.040
but the key thing here I think is really
coming up in a second as soon as I.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:44.569
Now we get onto the authentication server, okay and we are
doing this with RADIUS because that's what necessary to do

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:50.259
that request to terminate the TLS validation
that we started from the client's side.

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:55.240
Not doing so well with my clicker here.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.879
In conjunction with this since most folks have
been using potentially the Cisco client to go

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:07.879
to the Cisco concentrator the client
itself was doing pure IPSec.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:13.379
Once you have the need or you're shifting
over to use internet connect to do layer two,

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:20.769
most of you haven't done the corresponding opening
of the ports for layer two to get that connection.

00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:27.399
So be aware both between, be aware of which ports you need
open between a client and your concentrator and of course

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:32.230
between the concentrator and your
authentication server, in this case RADIUS.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:38.720
Depending on which way you use, whether you
are using a 1812 or kind of legacy 1645.
E

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.190
That's actually how I caught several people by surprise.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.520
Just because they didn't have it configured that way before.

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:48.490
So let's kind of look, step back a little bit
at the client and how would you set this up.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:09:00.730
I have it here related to the smart card but it
doesn't have to be that, again we are using EAP-TLS.

00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:09.129
With user authentication every panel
whether its layer two, point to point 802.1x others,

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:11.779
you're always going to get the select certificate panel.

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.240
How many people are doing EAP-TLS?

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.250
How many people actually doing client
side authentication with certificates?

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.799
Is this in an area that most of you are not doing?

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:21.809
Interesting.

00:09:21.809 --> 00:09:30.759
Okay. How many of you are trying to do
machine authent or machine authentication?

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:34.620
No's, surprising.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:41.919
Same thing here just want to hit quickly on this
same enhancements we had with point to point,

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:48.799
one time passwords with both securID and CRYPTOcard
certificate support and the enhancements that we have

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:52.419
in there are of course the added CRYPTOcard components.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:10:03.750
So if we do the same thing with our connections here, boy
this clicker is not doing, with point to point again keep

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:12.629
in mind the ports you need open on these,
I am surprised how frequent that is again

00:10:12.629 --> 00:10:16.600
if you are doing the Cisco client
you didn't have to have these open

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.050
because you are doing a straight IPSec
communication between the client and the concentrator.

00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:30.579
VPN on demand, any body using VPN
on demand on internet connect, boy.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:38.389
The VPN on demand is quite helpful particularly for your
objectives maybe, people that aren't really familiar

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:45.289
with how to start the internet connect or how to
start the remote access session and just to kind

00:10:45.289 --> 00:10:51.049
of reaffirm here real quickly for
you, okay we will get this.

00:10:51.049 --> 00:11:00.569
VPN on demand is your ability to configure what domains are
tied to what configuration, so if I am going to a host here

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:09.360
in my talkback.company.com domain, its instantly going to
launch my VPN on demand configuration, whatever that is.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.350
That now removes a layer of kind of complexity,
gives a little bit more of ease of use for the user.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.769
I don't have to now launch remote access to know
what's going on, it's going to be launched for me.

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:25.409
The services if I have to authenticate with a
token, with a password, whatever I need to do,

00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:28.679
that will take place automatically for me.

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:35.719
Now you shift from VPNs to 802.1x
, more of you are doing 802.1x.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.600
I don't see too many hands going up, a couple maybe.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.409
Okay first off remember that 802.1x
is on the wired and wireless side.

00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:49.699
But what we've done is added a few things, we still have
course the support here, a lot of these are in reference

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.450
my slides are in reference to use
of TLS for certificates and smartcards.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.550
But we added some support, some enhancements to 802.1x

00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:04.789
but if you were doing 802.1x in
10.4, it was a little cumbersome.

00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:09.789
What I mean by a little cumbersome, if you wanted to do
it you had to log in, right we added that capability right

00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:15.329
at 10.4.6, why am I having so much problems?

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.400
So there is a Kbase article to help you,
to help walk you through the steps you need

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:22.909
to do to setup 802.1x authentication log in.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.610
So why is that an issue?

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.870
Well if you're trying to authenticate to the network
and the user at the same time, it's a catch 22,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.840
right you need access to the network first before you
can authenticate but you can't authenticate until you get

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:43.100
to the network so you got this catch 22 situation,
we did some what or a workaround there in 10.4.6,

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.620
you had to do some exporting Kbase article
will help walk you through that process.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:55.049
But we did some enhancements to that within Leopard so
within Leopard we also added EAP-FAST which is kind

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:59.889
of a successor to LEAP here, kind of address
some of the issues of kind of dictionary text

00:12:59.889 --> 00:13:06.370
and man in the middle pieces, so that's
new with in Leopard, within 802.1x.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:15.039
Now the other enhancement first if all you notice the
window we're actually no longer in internet connect.

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:21.789
In Leopard all of this configuration shifts over
into your network interface configuration panels.

00:13:21.789 --> 00:13:31.209
Okay. In addition to that now with 802.1x we're not forcing
you to go that sort of cumbersome method that you had

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.150
in 10.4.6 of setting up 802.1x for login.

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:40.360
We actually now have three domains for authentication,
we've got the login that is taking the same credentials

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:49.389
for authenticating the user themselves and at the
network and in addition to login if you don't,

00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:53.429
if you aren't authenticating that
user log in you have the user domain,

00:13:53.429 --> 00:14:00.019
maybe for once your on a network your authenticating
into another isolated area, isolated services

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:02.199
and then you have a system domain, this is now

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.790
where you are authenticating systems using
802.1x, also with certificates as well.

00:14:07.789 --> 00:14:10.809
Many folks have been talking to me
about the need in their environment

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:16.899
to do system level authentication
and 802.1x with certificates.

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:23.840
So again all three you got, the login, the user
and system domain authentication with 802.1x

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.710
in Leopard, all done within the interfaces.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:34.370
So this is one reference that I was making to the
some what simplicity approach that I am giving you

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.549
with troubleshooting, with the remote access.

00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:41.779
Its some what of a hard guidance,
we could be spending all day I think

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:46.350
on some low level TCP dumps and we
could bore many of you to tears.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.820
But I think that particularly for first
time admin's you are getting into this

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.120
and you kind of want to keep this at a high level.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.870
The very first thing you should be looking at for
instance within Internet Connect make sure you got verbose

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:04.350
at a logging on, make sure you get as
much information within the client itself,

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:09.940
within the logs to determine where things may be failing.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:15.570
Okay there's, the remote access gets a little bit complex
with the various components that you have in place

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.500
and it's hard to give you a simple cookie cutter approach

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.320
of here's the five things you do
and you've solved your problem.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:32.970
But start here with kind of verbose logging and the
next thing is moving on into the PPP log right its going

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.360
to give you information on establishment of that connection.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.970
Many folks have been able to diagnose
where thing have failed,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:47.060
where they might have some configuration
problems, simply by looking at the PPP logs.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:55.259
Then if you really want to get down to the lower level,
okay this is actually a successful session and I think

00:15:55.259 --> 00:16:03.069
in many areas of connectivity, networking and all kinds of
area's the first thing that's best for you to be aware of

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:09.110
or you to know is what does a good connection look like,
right what should it look like cause if you don't know

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.560
that when you are looking at a failed connection you're
unsure of where things may have failed connection.

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:15.989
You are unsure where things may have failed itself.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:21.049
And I'll quickly run through this, but this is
really is an establishment of a layer two connection.

00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:25.779
Here you're getting all the exchanges
of, exchange back and forth with EAP-TLS.

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:29.509
All those stars really represent your
getting some encrypted content here.

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:36.559
Your getting at the end exchange of a lot of your
request, you look at the bottom and your getting the DNS,

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:47.259
that's where your getting that DHCP over PPP request and
then successful setting up of the local and the remote IP's,

00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:52.200
primary DNS, secondary DNS and you're
a success you are in there, right.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:58.870
If you know what it looks like when you have a successful
connection, its better or its easier for you to understand

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.509
where things maybe failing, each one of those components.

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:11.220
And in conjunction with this, how do I do this again, I have
many environments that are using cert-based so here's one

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.509
that you are physically failing, the
physical certificate wasn't available.

00:17:15.509 --> 00:17:19.049
I think I actually had removed my
smartcard at this point to do this.

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:26.430
And we're doing an exchange and you see down about
two thirds of the way EAP-TLS and we actually failed,

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.120
we failed to authentication ourselves to the peer.

00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:35.309
So the peer, being between the client
and the concentrator at this point,

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:40.960
going on through all the way through
to our authentication server.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:53.370
So particularly in the 802.1x environment again as I kind of
emphasized over and over in a lot of these areas is you got

00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:58.099
to know what's happening, who's
requesting what to know where things fail.

00:17:58.099 --> 00:18:02.859
So in this kind of environment what are
the exchanges that are going on between

00:18:02.859 --> 00:18:07.139
and typically again this is kind of
standard environment with an 802.1x.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:14.880
I'm getting this request to establish this EAP
connection over LAN, EAP over L, EAP over LAN.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.770
I do that to start the authenticator.

00:18:16.769 --> 00:18:21.670
I get the request back from that
authenticator, back to the supplicants,

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:27.340
my client, my portable PowerBook, MacBook Pro.

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:33.439
And I'm now doing the response of my identity that
gets sent all the way over to the auth server.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:41.190
Right this is where that RADIUS request comes in,
and all the way back through the authenticator back

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.990
with a challenge, so I do the challenge
response here with RADIUS.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:54.870
I supply my credentials again the request on
the auth side and I'm now successfully in.

00:18:54.869 --> 00:19:01.750
So if you understand those, the interplay between
these components here again this is where a lot

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:08.700
of folks can quickly identify if I have improperly
configured my authenticator here, I'm going to be stopping

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.240
or even failing to even start the session itself.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:25.470
Extension of, folks have this question a lot and
that is they have securID tokens and yet they want

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:32.029
to use the Apple VPN server here and they
wanted to know how to make that work,

00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:35.599
how to tie into the backend a server as well.

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:40.309
I shared this with folks last year and it
seemed to be quite helpful to those people.

00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:45.429
So there is a knowledge base article on how to configure
and unfortunately you have to kind of go under the hood

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:51.910
of things and configure the VPN server, but you
can do that authentication back to the RADIUS,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:59.480
not RADIUS the RSA ACE server sorry
about that, directly from the Apple VPN.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:08.509
Now I'm shifting away from standard VPN and 802.1x to
another area that seems to be quite prevalent as a challenge

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:15.930
with folks, even some folks earlier this morning
were asking me about SSL VPN challenges they had.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:21.450
Well first of all why are folks using SSL VPNs?

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:26.190
There's a lot of challenges for
providing remote access to employees,

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:33.250
to ultimate partner's maybe, maybe
temporary, maybe the long term.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:38.049
What are some of the reasons why there
considering an SSL VPN kind of solution?

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:42.950
Well first of all it doesn't require a client
management, right you don't have to start loading software

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.690
on each client, you don't on ours
because the internet connects there

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.820
but in this case you don't even
have to change configurations.

00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:52.679
A client less architecture, your browser is already there.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:21:01.430
It doesn't require additional touch points systems
actually pushing things out to each client.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:07.700
The second point there is actually quite powerful though
and that is largely the challenge that people have

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:16.279
in shifting away from some of the other remote access type
approaches is dealing with firewalls in remote offices

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:22.970
or dealing with firewalls again in
partners organizations or just remote sites.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:29.829
And so the SSL VPN solution helps them break through
that challenge because now you aren't having to open

00:21:29.829 --> 00:21:35.769
up those additional ports since you probably
can't even manage those, it's out of your control.

00:21:35.769 --> 00:21:42.009
Integrating with firewalls in this environment
makes it quite a compelling solution.

00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:45.569
And the other thing with SSL VPN you can reduce the exposure

00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:49.039
down to particular services rather
then opening up your full network.

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:54.629
So lets kind of look at this, its all going to look quite
familiar to you, your just connecting from a browser

00:21:54.630 --> 00:22:04.840
to a server right, I'm doing a request to save
my SSL VPN and now I'm doing my typical response

00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:07.750
and the challenges with certificates here.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:15.849
I finally do my sending of my certificate, my client
side identity to the server, I get my authentication

00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:22.859
and now I have established my whole
tunnel between my client and my server.

00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:28.289
Now all my interaction from my client is all
going through that SSL tunnel to the server,

00:22:28.289 --> 00:22:30.619
right now I don't have to deal with additional ports.

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:36.279
I don't have interaction with the
rest of the network in my remote site.

00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:38.769
But some of you have had some challenges with that.

00:22:38.769 --> 00:22:48.190
Some with so interaction most people have been deploying
like Juniper SSL VPN solutions and they had some challenges

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:55.059
with different versions of 10.4 and maintaining or
actually initially establishing that connection.

00:22:55.059 --> 00:23:01.909
I wanted to run through some of this and explain what's
happening both what you can do now and what is coming

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:06.320
in Leopard that helps you address
those particular kinds of problems.

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:10.029
Okay so if got a single identity and
your doing a connection to SSL VPN.

00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:13.950
Some of you have probably seen this slide several times now.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:21.400
It's a typical exchange, OS X is going to pick that
first valid certificate, send it off to the server,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:27.590
if you're challenged locally if it's stored in some
protective container like smartcard you'd be challenged

00:23:27.589 --> 00:23:35.859
for the PIN during that exchange, the challenge response
sent to the server, trust validation is either successful

00:23:35.859 --> 00:23:41.189
or failure and if its successful then you
are granted access to your service, right.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:46.130
If you have multiple identities now that
same process is going to go through the step

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:53.630
but you may potentially be rejected at the other
end, so what happens is we talk about this ability

00:23:53.630 --> 00:24:02.960
to select an alternative certificate, alternative identity
and once you select this you get a identity preference

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:09.410
and this is kind of your work around too as some of the
like Juniper SSL VPN issues that some folks have had.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:17.170
Once there is an identity preference in your keychain,
the next time Safari goes to that SSL VPN server its going

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:22.990
to automatically look for and rely on that
identity rather then just picking the first one,

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:29.599
because a lot of you have had problems
with which identity is being used

00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:35.429
because of the key usage you may have multiple
identities that are valid associated with key usage.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:43.120
So within Leopard we've done some enhancements here to
give you the ability to manually creating those identities,

00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:47.559
this gives you the ability to set
that identity up first and not getting

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:53.079
in that catch 22 looping effec"t
with connectivity to the server.

00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:59.240
This is one of the closer kinds of views to an
identity preference, if you look physically in keychain

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.620
on your builds and you want to look at your identities,
your selection my certificates on the category area.

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:14.299
There's a contextual menu now, so get the contextual menu up
and do new identity preference and you can now enter the URL

00:25:14.299 --> 00:25:21.309
to that SSL VPN, okay and select which
certificate you want to use in this area.

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:30.069
This is where if you were previously connecting to a
Juniper SSL VPN switch, the system would be sending

00:25:30.069 --> 00:25:38.240
that first identity, first certificate and because
the environment that most of the switches are

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:45.269
in are windows based environment, what would happen is that
Juniper switch would respond back to the browser with a page

00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:50.089
that says, basically tells the user
please select the appropriate certificate.

00:25:50.089 --> 00:25:55.799
And so you failed to actually be able to
set one because Safari got back a page.

00:25:55.799 --> 00:25:57.649
Okay let's walk through that again.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.660
I use Safari, try to connect to the SSL VPN.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.160
The SSL VPN sends me back a web page that
says you need to select your certificate.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:11.610
It fails because Safari thinks things are successful
because it got a successful response back with a page,

00:26:11.609 --> 00:26:17.629
what should of happened is that the
SSL VPN box should actually have failed

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:21.170
at the hands shake, the SSL hand shake level.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:28.000
Safari would have been notified up through our
networking stack that, that identity was not accepted.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.130
Essentially it failed and then would have listed the
sheet of all the additional certificates to select from.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:40.410
So in Leopard what we have done is given you this
additional capability of if you have solutions like that,

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:45.779
that do not fail at the protocol level, they give
you that page and tell you to manually select it,

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:51.599
you now have the ability to over come that
problem regardless of who's box it is, alright.

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:56.049
This gives you a very workable
solution in all those environments.

00:26:56.049 --> 00:27:03.079
So here you're entering the URL, I'm selecting my
certificate and again it adds it into the keychain.

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:08.230
So if you've ever selected an identity or
certificate in any one of those panels,

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.970
if you look in your keychain you'll
provably see a couple of these.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:21.420
In reference to websites or servers, so there is a
lot of things that we can talk about on remote access.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:29.320
Again like I had mentioned early on, we wanted to spend
considerably more time in the Q&A area but with respect

00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:35.089
to customers that I have spoken to over the last several
years, the predominate challenge has been connectivity

00:27:35.089 --> 00:27:44.329
to the Cisco 3000 line, that's been most
prevalent use or in the SSL VPN side of the house,

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:47.639
and hopefully I have walked you through
some of this as a very high level.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:54.810
Some of the capabilities that we have in the built-in
services, hopefully you are still aware of some

00:27:54.809 --> 00:28:01.099
of the enhancements we've done, remember
NAT traversal, DHCP over PPP, the groups,

00:28:01.099 --> 00:28:08.279
management and then with the transition as I kind
of some what mentioned that and many of you clapped

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:13.879
and that is the transitional way from internet connect to
physically do all that configuration into the interface

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.690
for each one of the network preferences itself.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:24.640
And so what we want to do at this point is
really kind of move into the kind of QA thing,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.210
the Q&A time and spend a little bit more
in addressing some a little more esoteric,

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:38.230
a little more interesting configurations that you may
have and troubles that you've faced within connecting

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:48.339
for remote access from an OS X client, and I think at
this time I will ask Jason and Kristoff to join me.

00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:52.109
>> Thank you Shawn.

00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:59.469
>> So we have a fair amount of time if you have
some questions you can probably go into detail.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.360
Can you guys hear me, okay.

00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:05.859
So I see you guys lining up, so lets start over here.

00:29:05.859 --> 00:29:13.829
>> You said in 10.4.9, you can do group passwords?

00:29:13.829 --> 00:29:13.960
>> Yep

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.240
>> And where do I find where to
put the preshared key and all that?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.410
>> That's actually in the panel itself

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.970
>> In internet connect?

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:28.329
>> Yes, Oh.

00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:29.699
>> Okay great thanks.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.440
>> I'll leave it up because I think
that, that might be some questions that.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.360
>> As he is going to the back, let's come over here.

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:46.589
>> Association of Corporate Council,
couple question, hopefully quick enough answers.

00:29:46.589 --> 00:29:55.649
One and any experience using internet
connects with Junipers Netscreen products?

00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:01.910
>> In some very old environments that
some folks have some Netscreens, we,

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.940
I haven't personally been working
with folks on the Netscreen side.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.720
We're hoping one of our other folks
from our IT was going to be here

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.589
because he has actually done a
lot of work with the Netscreens.

00:30:13.589 --> 00:30:18.839
>> Okay and then we actually do use the Apple
VPN server just directly connect into it

00:30:18.839 --> 00:30:21.799
and two problems that I have come across.

00:30:21.799 --> 00:30:27.169
Number one is it doesn't seen to be exactly
reliable I mean in 10.4.9 how reliable,

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:33.130
I mean what kind of reliability should I be looking
for on this because just now, literally I was iChatting

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:39.300
with my guy back in my office to restart the server
and all it is doing is VPN service and there's only

00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:46.000
like a few people actually hitting us, so I mean should I
be looking, I mean this thing should be pretty reliable or?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.029
>> Should be, that's the goal.

00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:55.589
>> It should be reliable especially if you
only have a couple of people connecting.

00:30:55.589 --> 00:30:58.659
>> I mean its bound to an open
directory masters on a separate box,

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:04.090
I don't know if that causes any
problems or extra anything there?

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:10.990
>> Well we use our own server at Apple and we
terminate like hundreds of connections on each server.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:19.140
>> Okay and one other thing I ran into which I did see on
some other apps, somebody else had mentioned the same.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:26.570
Problem was I had my VPN server as my file server
I think at one time and for whatever reason

00:31:26.569 --> 00:31:30.629
when it's doing some exchanges it
seems to mess up the AFP server.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:36.080
I had to move, once I disabled the VPN and moved it
off onto a separate box the AFP problems went away.

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:41.269
And I was just wondering if that was
anything that was known or anything?

00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:42.160
>> I don't know.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.230
>> Okay. All right.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:46.760
>> Up front here.

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:47.640
>> Thanks.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:55.330
Quick question, first of all thanks for the
security session yesterday that was awesome.

00:31:55.329 --> 00:32:03.980
I am an admin on a network of about 200 Mac's, I don't
know a whole bunch about connecting and using this software

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:08.230
through to and authenticating into a Novell network.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:18.009
Does the internet connect software in
both Tiger and Leopard allow for that?

00:32:18.009 --> 00:32:25.470
I know they were thinking of using a product by a company
called Apani to maybe pull that off but I don't know

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:30.230
if these two pieces of software in conjunction
in either of the OS builds allows for that

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:35.660
so I just figured I'd ask a general question
to see if I am even in the right place here.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.070
>> At least can you back up to
the earlier part of your question?

00:32:40.069 --> 00:32:50.149
>> We're trying to connect to, thru VPN, thru the
internet, authenticating into a Novell network.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.660
>> Yes Apani is one of the only ones
that really has been working that product.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:33:00.740
And that line is really the only one that is
doing a fair amount of work with the Nortel stuff.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.000
>> So internet connect is not the
program to use for that at all?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.369
>> Yea, there have been more issues on that side.

00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:15.629
The Apani within our customer base, they
had the most success with that product line.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.750
>> Okay thank you

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:22.650
>> We're not sure yet whether its configuration related,
we need to be experiencing a little bit more close work

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:27.680
with the customers to determine what environment
they have and why it's causing problems.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.350
>> I would be more then happy to
invite all of you to my place of work.

00:33:32.349 --> 00:33:35.769
It's a very nice place, they have good food anytime.

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:38.410
>> Are you in Hawaii by any chance?

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:43.580
>> No but I am at the Getty Center center and it is very
nice, architectural landmark of Los Angeles, so you know.

00:33:43.579 --> 00:33:44.750
>> Yea. We can talk offline.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.339
>> Alright.

00:33:45.339 --> 00:33:46.409
Thank you very much again.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.029
>> Thanks.

00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:49.539
>> Let's clear here and then we will go to the back.

00:33:49.539 --> 00:33:57.839
>> Hi, our internet connect works really well with Mac's but
the problem we are experiencing is once we connect with VPN,

00:33:57.839 --> 00:34:03.720
we are no longer able to surf the web or go to other
web pages, we like to be able to do both of those.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.880
Could you refer me to a website that
might tell me how to configure that?

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.849
>> I'm sorry could you ask that again, I'm not sure I.

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:15.469
>> We can connect through internet connect to our
VPN but once we do that we have no longer can go

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:22.859
to the internet any other website besides
our own through, we're using PPTP.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:28.440
>> There is some way of configuring I know
there is but I don't know where it is.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:35.360
>> Well typically I think what you
are doing is that once you connect,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.430
all your traffic goes through your VPN corporate server.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:40.480
>> Right

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.079
>> And for some reason you corporate
firewire's doesn't allow that outside.

00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:54.159
So it maybe a configuration issue or you can change
that on the client to not send some of the traffic.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.029
>> How do you do that?

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:58.740
That's what I am asking, cause there's
some, I'm sure that there is ability to do

00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:01.459
that I know there is cause some ones been able to do it,

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.720
I just don't know where the website
is that details how you do that.

00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:07.629
>> Do we have a website for that or?

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.340
>> Shawn's going to do some research.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.910
>> I was trying to pull this up.

00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:16.969
>> Oh okay.

00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:22.029
>> Options where, are you looking where
to turn off the send all traffic over VPN?

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.180
>> Yea I want to be able to send traffic in both directions.

00:35:25.179 --> 00:35:28.039
>> In internet connect there is a check box.

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:34.559
>> There is a check box in internet connect for that
but it depends also on your server configuration.

00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:37.570
So what type of server are you using, is it a Mac server?

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.480
So what server is that?

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.760
>> Windows.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.680
>> It's a windows server.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:45.839
So that's umm.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.920
>> It's a local configuration on a Mac that
does it, but I don't know what does it.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.840
>> Right so if you launch internet config and you go to,
there's like a menu option, its like the second to last one

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.930
on the right had side if somebody has a machine open.

00:35:58.929 --> 00:36:00.659
>> Say that again.

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:09.139
Connect and there is an option at the bottom that say
send all traffic over the VPN connection, you uncheck that

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:15.489
and only traffic for your network goes over the
VPN and then traffic that not on your network goes

00:36:15.489 --> 00:36:20.799
over the second IP address, the second network.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.380
>> Actually a related piece of that and I
think that some people weren't aware of that is

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:31.380
within the port prioritization on the networking
side you can actually set the prioritization

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:35.760
of which core your traffic goes out of.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:46.210
So in other words, in addition to the VPN client saying
that the sending all traffic over your internet connection,

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:55.829
whichever your using point to point that within the
network priority you can actually set your local network,

00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:59.389
built in Ethernet at a higher priority.

00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:04.779
Right you can actually change and you could force everything
to go over your VPN by putting your VPN configuration

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.460
at the highest configuration as well, in addition
to checking the option in internet connect.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:10.860
>> Okay.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:16.829
>> In Tiger its drag and drop and in Leopard you got a
nice little sheet that lets you dictate what order you do.

00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:18.069
>> Okay cool thank you very much.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:23.090
>> And actually to extend, because some people have been
asking, how do you force all of your traffic

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.420
over the VPN without the user being able to change it.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:32.730
if the user is not an admin and you do the port
prioritization and set Point to Point or layer two

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:40.019
as your top priority port, they would have to
have privileges to change that prioritization

00:37:40.019 --> 00:37:41.940
so it would force everything to go over as well.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.970
>> Everybody we are talking about has admin privileges.

00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:46.879
>> Okay, well that negates that.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.320
>> Thank you.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.769
>> Lets go back over here.

00:37:49.769 --> 00:37:55.150
>> John Welch Kansas City Lawyer, I
am one of those people using SSL VPN

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:59.430
for pretty much every single reason Shawn listed.

00:37:59.429 --> 00:38:04.489
Its from F5 its been a good product, the
problem is you know when we run into issues

00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:11.409
like the previous question were we want, we don't want
everything to try to go out our little 12 man connection

00:38:11.409 --> 00:38:18.449
so configuring I got split DNS and that case is
a little interesting cause its not really a port,

00:38:18.449 --> 00:38:20.879
its an SSL connection.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:26.940
And in our case for admin's and some limited use people
we actually allow full VPN connections but its all going

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:32.150
through basically Safari, so I was
wondering if there's any tips, tricks on.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.920
>> You could make it work but it tends to get really boggy.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:39.809
It might work it might not.

00:38:39.809 --> 00:38:40.170
>> Comments?

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.150
>> Sorry that sounded like feedback,
versus a type of question.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.260
Its good feedback

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.410
>> If nothing else if you guys could take a closer
look at SSL VPN and dealing with split DNS issues

00:38:49.409 --> 00:38:51.629
through those that would be a big help for people.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.700
Thank you.

00:38:52.699 --> 00:38:55.509
>> Yes SSL VPN using AOL won't work out

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.150
>> Thank you.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:01.510
>> Lets take two down here and we'll go to
the back and then we'll come down to you.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:06.610
>> I was wondering with if Tiger,
is EAP-FAST supported in Tiger?

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.539
Cause I thought that there was an update that came out
for that and you just mentioned it in Leopard only.

00:39:11.539 --> 00:39:15.539
>> It's a Leopard feature, it would been from Kristoff's.

00:39:15.539 --> 00:39:18.539
>> I don't know.

00:39:18.539 --> 00:39:21.420
>> It was only suppose to be in Leopard.

00:39:24.389 --> 00:39:30.829
>> Cause I remember I think the 10.4.6 updates had
something for EAP-FAST only on the Intel side though.

00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:34.319
>> Yeah I don't remember if we
added that into software update.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.610
I think we talked about that at
some point but I don't remember.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:43.120
>> Sometimes its hard for us to keep
track of some of these get black boarded.

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:44.849
It was intended to be a Leopard feature.

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:45.190
>> Okay.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.340
>> If it is that's a bonus for you all.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:51.309
>> The other thing was wondering if you could back up the..

00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:54.840
>> Its in the release notes for 10.4.9

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.710
>> Oh it is?

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.929
>> Yea.

00:39:55.929 --> 00:39:58.949
>> The comment was it was in the release notes for 10.4.9.

00:39:58.949 --> 00:40:02.689
>> Was also wondering if you could back up the
slides to show the ports that need to be open

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:07.820
between I was also wondering if you could back up
the slides to show the ports that need to be opened

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.830
between for the SS, the, yeah that one, that one.

00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:11.739
Thank you.

00:40:11.739 --> 00:40:16.689
So, I'm glad that helps you because I don't know
how many people I've talked to because what they're,

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:21.639
they've got their VPN administrators, everything configured.

00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:25.309
And they're saying, okay, we need to
do layer two, and everything fails

00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:28.690
and the problem is they just don't have ports open, so.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.039
That's good.

00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:29.960
>> Right here.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:38.630
>> Al: Al Willis, MIT, excuse me, two things, Shawn
are you saying that we can replace Cisco's VPN client

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:43.700
with Apples VPN client if we have Cisco's concentrators?

00:40:43.699 --> 00:40:52.339
>> Shawn: We have, there's several issues in
the configurations get kind of tenuous at best.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.000
It'll work.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.510
We've gotten things to work, but
there may be some complexities

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.400
in your environment that may cause some other challenges.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:07.780
But, the scenario I showed you right here I fully
in production and has been in production for like

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:21.080
over a year going from a, from Internet Connect on 10.4
to a Cisco 3000, or 3060 Cisco concent`rator all the way

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:25.610
to a windows IIS bound active directory yes.

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.640
There's some of the key points and some of those slides

00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:32.690
where in a Cisco concentrator,
you know how you have base groups.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:37.119
And probably most of you are just relying
on the base group for all use coming in.

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:38.589
When you're creating these groups.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:42.890
When you're doing this you have to have the
base group for layer two over IPSec as well.

00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:45.469
And that's typically not a common scenario.

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:48.879
And if you have all your PC users coming
in and they're all using the base group,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.289
first of all configure a new group for them.

00:41:52.289 --> 00:41:55.279
Configure the base group for layer two.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.710
You're not using mode config because that's Cisco's method

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:03.809
of passing back the configuration
between the client and server.

00:42:03.809 --> 00:42:10.539
And within the Apple group your doing a lot of
the configurations, we can switch back to slides,

00:42:10.539 --> 00:42:16.989
but you're doing a lot of the configurations specifically
for the layer two over IPSec implementation as well.

00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:19.659
>> So if somebody answers yes it
is possible with some work.

00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:22.679
>> It is, it's just careful because
what happens when you're getting some

00:42:22.679 --> 00:42:27.569
of this the Concentrator
drops into the values that are in your base group.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:32.039
So, you almost have to configure base group
for the Apple guys as well or it'll fail.

00:42:32.039 --> 00:42:36.739
>> And my other quick question was; is it possible
to create those identities that you showed

00:42:36.739 --> 00:42:40.349
in key chain access in Tiger in any programmatic way?

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:44.409
Can I script back; can I do something
to create those identities?

00:42:44.409 --> 00:42:53.739
>> Oh yeah, the identity preference, is that what you meant?

00:42:53.739 --> 00:42:54.279
>> Yes.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.519
>> The identity preference yes, talk to me offline.

00:42:56.519 --> 00:42:58.050
It's not part of the product.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.230
We can help you do this as a manual process.

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.469
>> Okay.

00:43:00.469 --> 00:43:01.009
>> Thank you.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:06.430
>> Thank you, let's go up in front
and clear it out straight back.

00:43:06.429 --> 00:43:08.859
>> Ortwin  from Equinox. I just want

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.849
to mention a short side not to the one gentleman.

00:43:12.849 --> 00:43:22.949
Before using net screen and the other gentleman
using Novel, maybe our product VPN Tracker might be

00:43:22.949 --> 00:43:26.559
of help for them just as a consideration.

00:43:26.559 --> 00:43:28.199
You can talk to me afterwards.

00:43:28.199 --> 00:43:29.469
>> What's your company's name?

00:43:29.469 --> 00:43:31.329
>> It's Equinox.

00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:32.400
>> It does work.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.349
>> Yeah, I should have mentioned that.

00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:37.259
Sorry Ortwin.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.340
>> Alright you, yeah.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:43.269
>> I didn't realize I was standing behind Ortwin.

00:43:43.269 --> 00:43:46.269
I love their product and it's terrific
they're doing what they're doing.

00:43:46.269 --> 00:43:51.259
The problem that I've had is the push back
from clients wanting to use the Mac client

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.500
with their existing VPN whatever they're using solution.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.409
And then saying, well gee that's suppose to work.

00:43:56.409 --> 00:43:59.389
Why do we have to spend more money for their product?

00:43:59.389 --> 00:44:03.420
And it seems to me, you know, nothing against what
these guys are doing, but it seems like there needs

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.159
to be a little more integration within
the Apple VPN client number one.

00:44:07.159 --> 00:44:16.609
And number two; it would be helpful, I think, if Apple was
evangelizing with some of these VPN device manufacturers,

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:22.930
SonicWALL and Linksys come to mind, and saying look, you
know, let's do something and not make this window centric

00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:29.789
and not make this impossible to use with a Mac and not
make so many hoops to jump through to make it work.

00:44:29.789 --> 00:44:30.659
>> Good point.

00:44:30.659 --> 00:44:33.609
( Applause )

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:34.840
>> Thank you and I have noted.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.090
Back, let's go to the back.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:44.230
>> Phil Goodman Los Angeles Goodman Consulting, piggy
backing on Al from MIT's, question about the Cisco issue.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:49.400
One of the reasons why we're continuing to support
the Cisco client directly is one of the features

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:54.730
from a gooey user experience point of view is they
have a feature for backup servers that's built in.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:56.889
And I haven't been able to find that either in the Tiger.

00:44:56.889 --> 00:44:59.359
And if you have built it in the Leopard that would be great,

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.809
so if the primary server fails it automatically
goes to an unlimited list of backup servers.

00:45:04.809 --> 00:45:06.179
>> So you're kind of doing load balancing?

00:45:06.179 --> 00:45:11.460
>> Yeah, not just load balancing but VPN server failure.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:21.769
>> Yeah, one of the features in Leopard is to
implement the load balancing and failover mod.

00:45:21.769 --> 00:45:29.050
So, it was on server and on our clients
we'll be able now to connect to the pool

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:32.980
of VPN server and to pick up the one that's available.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:37.340
>> Right. So I can do that now, let's
say, in the Tiger Internet connect client

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.220
by creating multiple configurations,
one for each of the backup servers.

00:45:41.219 --> 00:45:43.529
And that means I have to reconfigure it all over again.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:52.450
The question is, is there just in Leopard the ability
to populate one field with a list of backup servers

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:56.449
without having to reconfigure a
whole new settings, set of settings?

00:45:56.449 --> 00:46:04.949
>> Well the way we work in all the VPN clients whether you
connect to Cisco or to your own servers is you just connect

00:46:04.949 --> 00:46:11.199
to one single IP address, which would be a
virtual address of a pole of servers.

00:46:11.199 --> 00:46:15.359
And one of the servers available will reply.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.329
And the client will connect will connect with specific one.

00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:25.630
So you don't populate a list from the client
you just have one single address that you specify

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:28.690
and the client will take care of the rest.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:37.179
>> Okay, so allow me to do my now standing plug for
bugreport.apple.com, if that's an important feature

00:46:37.179 --> 00:46:40.299
for you please file an enhancement request.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.300
It'll go to our team.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:48.120
They'll evaluate it if you can give as much detail in terms
of why you find it valuable that'll be very useful for us.

00:46:48.119 --> 00:46:54.539
>> Great. And another request for being able to
script all that being, you know, defaults and so on.

00:46:54.539 --> 00:46:55.429
>> Thank you.

00:46:55.429 --> 00:46:57.639
>> Let's stay in the back and then
we'll come up front down here.

00:46:57.639 --> 00:47:00.480
>> Hi. Fi Sanders with Vital Source Technologies,

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.190
we're using OS X server VPN and have been since Panther.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.950
Upgraded it to Tiger and all my Mac clients work great.

00:47:08.949 --> 00:47:14.549
We're just doing shared secret and open
directory where the VPN server's a replica.

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:20.340
But my windows clients can now connect
and for about a minute ping works

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.300
and they can start getting data on our internal network.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.769
And then they just stop transferring data.

00:47:30.929 --> 00:47:34.129
>> Sounds like a bug.

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.740
Bugreport.apple.com

00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:38.589
>> (Inaudible)

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:39.120
>> Okay.

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:42.179
>> Yeah, it sounds familiar somehow.

00:47:42.179 --> 00:47:43.779
But I don't remember the specifics.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:51.750
>> If it's not fixed in Leopard please, you know, test
it and let us know and Kristoff

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:55.260
I'm sure will be happy to get right
on that and get his team working on it.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.840
>> We'll get him to work on the weekend.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.039
>> Thank you we'll have him work weekends.

00:48:01.039 --> 00:48:02.750
>> Eddie Martinez Vmix media.

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:08.360
Is it possible to configure, enable
and bring up a VPN via command line?

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:15.720
>> Is it possible to configure
the VPN, VPN via command line?

00:48:15.719 --> 00:48:18.289
>> The VPN server or the VPN client?

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:18.869
>> I'm sorry.

00:48:18.869 --> 00:48:21.359
>> The VPN server or the VPN client?

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.420
>> Client's side.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.019
>> Probably, you're trying to script it?

00:48:26.019 --> 00:48:30.159
>> Well, actually I have SSH access to multiple
machines but I also need to set up the VPN.

00:48:30.159 --> 00:48:33.319
And then I can do ARD from there.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:40.690
>> Yes you can use a VPN from the command
line the problems start with authentication

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:46.420
because all authentication is designed to prompt
and ask the user for password and certificate.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:55.329
So depending on the type of authentication you are
using you can or cannot do it from the command line.

00:48:55.329 --> 00:49:00.340
>> Okay, if I don't need the authentication from a
particular type of VPN where could I read about that

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:04.050
so I could bring that up and then
perhaps configure over ARD?

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:10.239
>> Just come to me after and we can.

00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:10.599
>> Thank you.

00:49:10.599 --> 00:49:11.529
>> Look at it.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:13.920
>> Thanks, let's clear out here.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:20.340
>> Sirus Dahaji (Assumed spelling.) Best Buy, and I'm
wondering if there is a way to utilize machine certificates

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.740
on a predominantly PC dominate environment?

00:49:24.739 --> 00:49:29.139
Currently I'm using user certificates
and it's just kind of painful.

00:49:29.139 --> 00:49:35.869
So I'm wondering if we can generate the machine certificates
for 802.1x, for wireless and VPN?

00:49:35.869 --> 00:49:39.900
>> So the machine, you're trying to do this on 10.4?

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.500
>> 10, 10.3.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.099
>> 10.3?

00:49:43.099 --> 00:49:43.920
>> Yeah.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.250
>> Do we do 10.3?

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.659
This is where I'm having to rely on
Kristoff because he did a lot of that work.

00:49:50.659 --> 00:49:52.589
But I.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:56.280
>> Machine certificate is a difficult issue.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.280
And we did a lot of improvements along the way.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:05.650
I remember about 10 (unclear) specifically
but we did a lot of improvements in 10.4

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.139
and in Leopard to better support machine certificate.

00:50:08.139 --> 00:50:14.539
The problem with machine certificate is to
generate a certificate with a high values insight.

00:50:14.539 --> 00:50:22.469
>> So it's not supported in Leopard then?

00:50:22.469 --> 00:50:27.099
>> Yeah, I mean it's all Leopard, but I was
trying to be sure you were wanting it back in.

00:50:27.099 --> 00:50:27.539
>> 10.3 yeah.

00:50:27.539 --> 00:50:28.489
>> It's all in Leopard yeah.

00:50:28.489 --> 00:50:28.879
>> Okay.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.640
>> The next version.

00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:29.920
>> Thank you.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:38.460
>> Yes Zane Christianson at Tmobile I actually
have a question, a more general question about how,

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:45.470
who should I direct our IT folks to if they
need hand holding and reassurance on how to open

00:50:45.469 --> 00:50:48.309
up and echo system to be more Mac friendly?

00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:55.259
Specifically with VPN because we have a, we just went to
a certificate based system from a group password system.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:59.880
Before it would work occasionally, slightly,
sort of but now it doesn't work at all.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:05.280
And there's issues with firewall rules and
things like that that aren't present even

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.560
in the Cisco version of the client itself.

00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:15.230
So, I'm trying to figure out how to, who to plug them into
over at Apple to kind of help evangelize and reassure and.

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:20.050
>> Probably the easiest thing I
could suggest to do is have them work

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:24.550
with their sales reps and they'll
probably pull me into that.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:28.710
>> Okay, because they're actually, it's
all, pretty much all windows environment.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.510
So most of the Mac support's exception based.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:35.410
And it's like big high powered
executives that say give me a VPN access.

00:51:35.409 --> 00:51:36.269
And then they do it.

00:51:36.269 --> 00:51:42.519
So I'm trying to kind of funnel them toward a resource that
they could go to just to get all the questions answered

00:51:42.519 --> 00:51:48.460
and to get, you know, reassurance that it
is secure, it is a feasible thing to offer.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.769
>> So the presales.

00:51:50.769 --> 00:51:54.730
>> Yeah somebody that kind of helps, help
me get my foot in the door a little bit.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:52:03.070
>> With presales, it would be a work, first of all you may
have to locate who the sales rep is that deals directly

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:06.980
with either your group within Tmobile or within Tmobile,

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:10.369
ultimately I'd get involved so, if
you wanted to contact me as well.

00:52:10.369 --> 00:52:11.440
>> Okay, thanks.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.829
>> Thank you.

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:14.789
>> Right here.

00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:22.610
>> Rich: Rich Trodden, National Institutes of Health,
our VPN access for the NI is just handle at a global level.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:30.769
I have a central IT group who keeps our Cisco
VPN's set up pretty much as black box as possible.

00:52:30.769 --> 00:52:38.409
One feature that would help out a lot within
integrating the remote access client built

00:52:38.409 --> 00:52:44.469
in the Mac OS X would be the ability to import
Cisco profiles if that's possible at all.

00:52:44.469 --> 00:52:47.179
Because at this point we don't have the.

00:52:47.179 --> 00:52:47.369
( Applause )

00:52:47.369 --> 00:52:49.739
We don't have the group passwords or anything like that.

00:52:49.739 --> 00:52:52.929
We basically just get an installer
package with two sets of profiles,

00:52:52.929 --> 00:52:58.079
we install it and it's pretty much a black box to us.

00:52:58.079 --> 00:52:59.980
>> Thank you for the feedback.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:04.699
But again it always helps to put it at
bugreport.apple.com just to make sure it's logged there.

00:53:04.699 --> 00:53:07.929
Looks like the last question goes to you sir.

00:53:07.929 --> 00:53:08.679
>> Jodie: Alright thanks.

00:53:08.679 --> 00:53:09.859
Jodie from Adobe Systems.

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.809
That was partly my question.

00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:13.519
We're in a similar situation.

00:53:13.519 --> 00:53:19.550
You mentioned some issues that come
up with the Cisco 36 concentrator.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:26.480
And I looked up in the document that's typed, the
session the network services administration guide.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.110
And unfortunately there's none of
this and what's on the slide in there.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:35.690
Where do we get that kind of guidance so
we can share those with our IT peers?

00:53:37.239 --> 00:53:39.049
>> Yeah, I wish it was all in there.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:44.600
So that's definitely good feedback that
Apple needs to improve that documentation.

00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:50.849
All the contents from this, of course you'll
get all these slides accesses developer stuff.

00:53:50.849 --> 00:54:00.190
But if you need more than that information, more urgent
method, again you can get in touch, let's talk afterwards.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:02.170
>> Okay thanks.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:03.409
>> Alright thank you folks.
