WEBVTT

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.359
>> Welcome to the Managing Mobile Computer session.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.019
It's the last session before our big party.
( Cheering )

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:26.850
>> Yeah. All the Europeans know that we actually check to
make sure you're 21 before we'll serve you alcohol, right?

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.960
So you need a little yellow band for that.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.939
Also I know some of you are going to be tempted to leave
early and run to the party and so I wanted to let you know

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:41.449
that I've got a little something special for those
of you that wait till the very end, so stick around.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.040
( Laughter )

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.219
>> Let's begin.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.239
My name is Tony Graham. I'm a Systems Engineer with Apple
Education, and I wanted to give you an overview of the kinds

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.650
of tools and technologies that you can use for
deploying large numbers of mobile computers.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.390
A number of the sessions at the conference
have dealt with the topics we'll cover.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.230
This is the mobile twist on them.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.500
So we've got a bunch of things we
want to talk about today starting

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.739
with Directory Services and then
moving along to home folders.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:14.629
Try not to say home directories here because it
tends to be a little bit of a conflict in the naming.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.670
So if you hear folder and you're
thinking directory you can just swap it.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.969
Then we'll discussed managed preferences.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:30.509
And then take a break and talk about security,
followed by some tips on software distribution,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.800
and then finish with a discussion of backup technologies.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.269
So let's start with Directory Services.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.510
Your computer needs to know lots of things about you
in order to operate in a way that's customized for you.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.830
It needs to know your name, it needs for know you
UNIX, or your user ID, it needs to know your password,

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.769
and that stuff needs to be stored
in a way that it can get to.

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:57.519
Now, out of the box a Mac is going to
implement a local directory service

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:00.069
so that you don't have to be connected
to a network to use it.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.139
And the local directory service
will have your account information

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.540
and can optionally store what I'll
call management information.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.349
You can think of it as parental controls, the kind
of things that limit your access to applications

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.090
or set up the environment in a particular way.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.490
We'll refer to it generically as management information.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.390
So how many of you are new to Mac
OS X system administration?

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.439
Oh my, one.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.189
Okay, excellent.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:30.490
Welcome.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.920
( Laughter )

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.989
The rest of you are well aware that Tiger
uses a local directory service called NetInfo.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.740
And it's stored in a hidden directory, the
directly that the user -- no, no hissing, please.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:50.900
Don't speak ill of the dead.
( Laughter )  (Applause)

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.789
NetInfo is in a hidden directory in /var/DB.

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.789
Your users don't see it but you probably have.

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:01.159
They're going to use graphical tools like
the accounts pane and system preferences.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.520
You might have used NetInfo Manager or in some
cases Workgroup Manager to modify that local data.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.730
There are a number of command line
tools that are available as well.

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.989
And the historical ones start with NI,
which tell you it's a NetInfo tool.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.590
And the newer stuff starts with DS for directory service.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.590
And you want to make sure you're using those today
on Tiger because starting with Leopard they go away.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.819
Sorry. Starting with Leopard the NetInfo ones go away.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.139
So you're local directory service is going to be
presented to most of your users in this way.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.239
You may be working with it in this fashion.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.090
This is the DSCL command line tool which will display
and let you modify and navigate your directory service.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.490
Navigate the local directory service on Tiger and on Leopard
will show you something along these lines for user record.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.960
So in here you navigate the database
as if it was a UNIX file system.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.260
You can change the directory to users.

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:56.199
Group information can be stored in here, computer
information would be stored in here as well.

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:02.479
Navigate to your user record and you can use the
read command to display the properties of your user.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.899
And I've shortened some of them here, left out a few
of them, but the ones that are kind of interesting

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.219
in an out-of-the-box situation is your home folder.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.740
When it accepts your authentication it wants to drop
you in environment and know where your preferences are

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.259
and where your documents are; the database needs
to know where that is; it needs to know you name,

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:27.550
it needs to know your login name, your short
name and; it needs to know a unique UNIX ID.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.639
So new in Leopard are account property lists, P lists.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.490
Each user going to have a Nile your
file system that defines your user.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.350
And when I say "user" I'm kind of honing in on the
user aspect, but certainly groups in other part

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.720
of the directory service are represented as well.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.250
The same graphical tools with manage those,
system preferences and Workgroup Manager --

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.459
notice NetInfo Manager no longer there -- and
DS commands for Directory Services as well.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:01.739
So here's a shot of kind of the directory
structure for your local directory service.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.949
And notice that at the bottom the administrator user
and the root user have a P list or property list.

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:13.180
So for those one of you who's new to administering Mac
OS X, that's a text file you can open and t a text editor

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.620
or property list editor and see how those settings are.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.370
It's a little bit more open now than in
NetInfo, a little bit easier to get to

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.399
So local directory services are fine until you start
to create accounts on lots of computers and you start

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:29.709
to do a lot of repetitive data entry and you
start trying to synchronize passwords on lots

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:32.269
of machines that becomes quite a bit of an effort.

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:37.419
So a way of mitigating that is to try and
put your directory services information

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.660
on a server, we'll call that a directory server.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.070
Your account information and your
management information can go there.

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.009
Even in this scenario you've got
a local database in use as well.

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.839
You cert that as an administrator you're
going to have to decide where accounts go.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:57.899
But if you want to use them for multiple places on
your network they got to go in the directory server.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:03.370
Two popular choices for directory services
are Open Directory, Apple's directory service.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.910
It ships standard with Mac OS X Server.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.870
>> Yeah.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.610
( Laughter )

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.850
>> One of you likes Open Directory.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.920
Any other Open Directory fans?

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.810
( Applause )

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.560
Okay, good.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:20.790
Think of it as a database and it has to have all those same
sort of the feels we saw in the local directory service.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.770
We've got, obviously, slots for all of those.

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:24.759
Another popular one, Microsoft Active Directory.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.149
How many of you using Active Directory?

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:27.639
( Applause )

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.849
Oh, come on now.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.660
( Laughter )

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.439
Probably half of you.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.699
And the rest of you are afraid
because people were hissing, right?

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.339
( Laughter )

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:37.079
Snakes in a show, right?

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:39.039
So Microsoft Active Directory.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.210
The good news about AD is you can talk to it
through LDAP which is how we talk to Open Directory.

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:48.149
And you can stuff the same sorts of things in AD, or
Active Directory, that we stuff in Open Directory.

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.319
But they don't have slots for everything.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.519
So if you want to store management information

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:57.279
in Active Directory you typically have
to add extra slots to their database.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:00.789
You have to extend their schema so
that they have room for management

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.420
and other information that we want to put in there.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.000
And that's quite easy to do.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.839
Some of you are comfortable doing
that and some probably not.

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.989
And alternative for those of you who don't
want to extend the Active Directory schema is

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.769
to use both Open Directory and Active Directory.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.789
And how many of you are doing this,
what we call the magic triangle?

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.770
( Applause )

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:23.759
Probably a third of you, great.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:28.779
The beauty of this is you can put your management
information in Open Directory and your users stay

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:34.449
in Active Directory and you may not be the person
or the group that manages Active Directory.

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:39.550
It may be something handled at a university level or at
a corporate level and you're interested in management

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.069
of your machines at a departmental
level, you can govern the behavior

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:48.240
of your machines using Open Directory
and still use Active Directory users.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.319
Your clients will be bound to both directories.

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.360
That's caused the magic triangle.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.530
Now coming up in Leopard -- how
many of you were lucky enough

00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:57.309
to see the bending Directory Services to your rule session?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.240
Good. About half of you.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.439
That was really, good, huh?

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:03.279
In there we talked a little bit about augmented records,

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:08.819
which will allow you to more streamline
this process in Leopard and Leopard Server.

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:15.409
There's another session tomorrow that will talk
probably in more depth about augmented records.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.750
So network accounts are great for people that are connected
to the network, but if all of your user information is

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.720
on a server and you disconnect
you've now lost your user accounts.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.490
We need something that will allow
you to work offline as well.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.530
And mobile accounts are the way you do that.

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:34.699
With mobile accounts you've got a copy of the -- you
have a local database on your machine and you have one

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.920
in the server and periodically that gets synchronized.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:41.449
So when you log into it it'll ask you if you
want to create a mobile account, you say yes,

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.110
and your user records get copied down to the system.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.620
So you can work offline.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.730
You can unplug and you can go home or travel.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.120
So if you want details about this
you have a number of options.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.750
Some of you had a chance to see the directory
services, bending directory services session.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:04.460
Others of you will probably watch the recorded version,
which should be available online in the future.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.960
Those of you who missed it will want to make sure -- and
actually those of you who went will want to make sure

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.230
that you go to the managing and deploying Open
Directory session at Pacific Heights tomorrow at 9:00.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:17.750
And Managing Your Clients are Leopard
Server tomorrow at 2:00.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.580
All right.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.720
So that was directory services.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.450
Now we need to talk about home folders.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.590
( Laughter )

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.759
How many of you were at the calendar server session
and couldn't go to the home directory session?

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:27.549
All right, good.

00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:30.599
So I'll give you a little overview of
what you missed.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:35.959
Again you take a Mac out of the box, you open
it up, it needs a place to put your stuff.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.320
We'll call that a local home.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.050
And that's going to be automatically created
in the users folder on your machine.

00:09:41.049 --> 00:09:46.379
And Mac OS X will create subfolders for you: Your
documents folder, your library folder, et cetera.

00:09:46.379 --> 00:09:49.000
In the library folder is a preferences folder.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.470
And in the preferences folder are where
your application preferences are stored.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.759
This is fantastic but it's not necessarily scalable.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:10:03.370
It defaults to /users and it's very easy to
use because that's what we do out of the box.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.090
It's the default way of creating home
folders on Mac OS X. It's tested.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.120
All the developers that are here at this session

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.909
that are writing your applications are most likely
testing against this situation, this scenario.

00:10:13.909 --> 00:10:18.539
And it's uniform so those of you users who have
Macs at home are used to using their Mac that way

00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:21.159
when they go to work it will be the same way.

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:22.819
But it doesn't scale very well.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.740
For one thing there's no separation between
the operating system and your user data.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:34.159
So your user home folder's on that same volume
as your operating system, called the boot volume.

00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:37.149
And some of you may want to set up a system whereby

00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:41.069
that operating system can be replaced
without losing use you are data.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.280
I imagine most of you want to be able to replace
the operating system without losing user data.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:49.679
And there are some mechanisms in Mac
OS X for doing that, but not quickly.

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:58.479
And so partitioning your drive and kind of having a boot
OS and a user volume may be an approach that you like.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:06.500
Some of you are work around that by creating a symbolic link
from /users on the startup drive to the secondary drive.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.669
And others of you actually edit the FSFS
tab file so that that second volume gets mounted sort

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:17.409
of invisibly behind the scenes on the first volume.

00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:22.149
We'll show you in a moment maybe a better way
of doing that, a more easily supportable way.

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:25.199
And then the other downside is all
the users data is on one hard disk.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.690
So if their MacBook Pro gets stolen or lost

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:35.190
or the hard drive crashes they lose all
their data, and they may come crying to you.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:40.170
So you may work around this by saying let's give everyone
a network home and we'll have everything on a server

00:11:40.169 --> 00:11:43.929
and we can back up the server and
we can put it on redundant storage.

00:11:43.929 --> 00:11:45.899
And that works great.

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:51.980
Typically you'll locate that on a share point
on a file server like an AFP, SMB or NFS share.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.920
The beauty of this is none of the user's
data exists on their local computer.

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:59.500
It's used live over the network,
and that means it's portable.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.980
You can go from any machine, go to any machine
on your network and get to your user environment.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.170
The downside to this is performance.

00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:12.809
All the reads and rights to a user's
home folder are going over the LAN.

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:17.299
That means cache files are going over the LAN as people
are browsing websites, all of these temporary files

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:23.240
that are supposed to speed up access and take a load off
the network are actually traveling twice over your network.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.210
If people start to capture digital video in
iMovie to their desktop it's going over your LAN.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.100
So downside there.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.560
And also it's not ideal for portable because the moment
you unplug you have no access to your home folder.

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:38.349
So we'll represent it with this picture and we'll tell
you for portables not to necessarily a good approach

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.659
but we'll discuss in a moment how
you might use this in conjunction

00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:46.399
with portable homes to get the best of both worlds.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:51.730
So a portable home, like with Directory
Services is a mechanism

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.050
that will synchronize what's on
the network and what's on your disk.

00:12:54.049 --> 00:12:58.339
So you have a local home on your machine
and a network home folder as well.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.639
And you're going to periodically sync,
synchronize all of that data.

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:04.720
So you should have a copy in both places.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.430
The beauty of this is you can use it offline, you
can work at home, you can work in another office,

00:13:08.429 --> 00:13:14.539
you can work in the airport; but you can backup the
version of the user's data that's on your server.

00:13:14.539 --> 00:13:17.370
It's all in one place so it's easier to get to

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:21.459
And again, you can get to it from
multiple connected systems on your LAN.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.700
So the portable home is a periodic sync of your
home folder and if you've got the mobile account

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.980
which typically the two are used
together, then you can be somewhat assured

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.180
that the user's environment can travel with them.

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:40.120
Now, one things go wrong you may want tips
on troubleshooting these portable homes

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.990
and one that I'll point you to
is something that some of you ran

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:49.419
into where you configure home synchronization
using the Workgroup Manager tool.

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:54.209
And it's synchronizing, maybe you want to stop doing
that and you in Workgroup Manager set it to never,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.360
thinking that will mean never synchronize your home folder.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.590
That actually just means never control
the synchronization of your home folder.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:06.840
So we do have a tech note that explains
how to change that if necessary.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.460
And also you should know that the process
that's actually doing the synchronization

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.320
in the background is called Mirror Agent.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.730
And you're able to enable a debug mode in
Mirror Agent using the defaults command.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:25.590
Set a preference for Mirror Agent, and there
are increasing levels of detail from 1 to 4.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.210
Now you may find that a portable home works great
for some situation, and a network home works great

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.370
for other situations and you want to be able to use both.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:39.720
An example would be somebody that who sits at a
desktop machine most of the time, perhaps an engineer,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.170
they're working on a big screen and a beefy
Mac Pro, but they occasionally travel.

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:51.169
Or they want to take some work home, right?

00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:56.679
So set them up with a network home on their desktop machine
and when they want to check out a MacBook or MacBook Pro

00:14:56.679 --> 00:15:00.019
that can be set up with a portable home
so they can take a version with them.

00:15:00.019 --> 00:15:04.460
When they return to the office they can resynchronize
that and then go back to their network hope.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.540
The opposite is also possible.

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:09.480
You could have professors that have
a portable that they travel with,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.340
and that's the machine they use at home and in the office.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:17.000
But when it gets time to go walk into the lecture hall to
deliver their content, rather than unplugging everything

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.570
on that portable machine, carrying it into the lecture
hall, and reconnecting audio and video and networking

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.050
and maybe even USB, you can have a desktop
machine already there in the lecture hall.

00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:29.319
That machine can use a network home.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.680
So when they log in they're instantly presented with
their environment, there's no delay for synchronization.

00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:37.599
You typically don't want to use both at the same time.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.690
And then the third environment would be somebody uses a
network home because they left their MacBook Pro at home,

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.310
literally at home, or it's being serviced.

00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:50.519
So it's possible to synchronize and then hopefully not

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:54.370
at the same time use a network home
depending on your usage pattern.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.290
So Leopard brings some improvements to portable
homes and network homes and some new features.

00:16:00.289 --> 00:16:05.959
With portable homes one change is the
administrator and/or the user can define

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.320
where on your disk your user folder,
your home folder, is going to go.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:10.690
( Applause )

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:16.570
So whereas before it had to live on that
startup volume you can now partition your drive,

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.670
you've got your OS on the boot volume,
you've got a second one for the user folder,

00:16:19.669 --> 00:16:22.279
and you can specify that's where the user's data goes.

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:27.980
Rather than sort of hacking Mac OS X to make this
possible we have kind of a legitimate way of doing it.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:34.340
The other problem that sometimes folks run into when they
use portable homes in a lab environment is a student logs

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.350
into machine A and they synchronize their portable
home and they work and great, and then they leave.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.769
They log out hopefully, and then leave.

00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:44.289
We've all probably learned that lesson the hard way, right?

00:16:44.289 --> 00:16:47.909
When they come back the next day somebody's
sitting at computer A so they use computer B,

00:16:47.909 --> 00:16:51.179
it synchronizes their home folder, now they
have a copy in two places, which is fine.

00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:55.179
But over time enough students and enough machines
leaves little droppings all over the place.

00:16:55.179 --> 00:17:00.139
And some of you probably have scripts that run
when they log out to delete all of this stuff.

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:05.549
Portable homes in Leopard have an option to
automatically clean up after these people on a schedule

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:09.490
or also ensuring that synchronization takes place first.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.130
And also server side file tracking.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:17.980
When a portable home directory is used and you log in your
machine has to in Tiger traverse your entire home folder

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.309
and look on the server and see
which files have changed, right?

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:25.059
So it's basically touching the metadata of every
file and it's really beating on your server.

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:28.750
With Leopard and Leopard Server the
server can actually just tell you client,

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.299
here's all the stuff that's changed
so just synchronize that stuff.

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:32.019
( Applause )

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:39.579
Yeah. And that will help for those of you who are going to
use maybe Xsan for your home environments on the back end.

00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:42.519
A new feature in Leopard is the external account.

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:49.069
Think of this as a portable home directory but instead of
it being on your computer it's actually on a portable drive.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:55.939
An external hard drive ideally, although you may
find other removable drives that work as well.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.279
So in this situation you can take
that drive from machine to machine.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:07.559
When you connect it your home environment is immediately
available, you don't have to synchronize it with the network

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:09.869
and then come and resynchronize with the new machine.

00:18:09.869 --> 00:18:14.579
So your home folder and your directory
login all travels with you in the disk.

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:23.210
Now one thing that's kind of cool is when you use a
MacBook and you have a mobile account on it if you reboot

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.279
that machine in target disk mode, by
holding down the T on the keyboard,

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:29.329
you're MacBook will become an external hard drive.

00:18:29.329 --> 00:18:34.009
It's not usable, the keyboard doesn't function,
the screen essentially just shows a FireWire logo,

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:38.069
but you could connect the MacBook to a
desktop machine with a FireWire cable.

00:18:38.069 --> 00:18:43.950
At that point your MacBook becomes an
external account on the desktop machine.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.740
So you're working mobile and everything's fine, you put it
in target disk mode, connected it to a beefier machine --

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:53.720
maybe you need to do some video editing -- and
log in and your entire environment is preserved.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:53.990
( Applause )

00:18:53.990 --> 00:19:01.799
And finally the guest account.

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:07.409
The guest account is a no password account, a local
home folder that's created from the same template

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.790
and standard local users are created from.

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:13.599
But it's deleted as soon as they log out.

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:15.929
So a little warning would be kind
of nice if you're going to do that.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.990
But this is going to work great in kiosks or in labs where
you sort of trained your students to copy their files

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:26.720
or trained your faculty to copy your files to a server
before you log out, and then you don't have to worry

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.930
about leaving private information behind.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:33.880
Now external accounts and guest accounts
might raise some concerns about security.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.480
And you should know that you as an
administrator can decide whether

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.380
or not your machines allow guests or external accounts.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:48.070
So a couple of related sessions on these again
already expired so check those out online.

00:19:48.069 --> 00:19:53.419
By managing and deploying Open Directory and
managing your clients are Leopard Server tomorrow

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.789
at 2:00 will cover this ground as well.

00:19:56.789 --> 00:20:03.369
So let's take a moment and switch to the demo machine
and for the tremendous number of you who are new

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:07.089
to max OS X administration I'll give
you a Workgroup Management tour.

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:18.839
I'm going to use Apple Remote Desktop to
control both a Leopard and Tiger Server.

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:22.909
So we'll see some of the changes that are coming in Leopard.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:23.990
So first the Tiger.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:37.329
So Workgroup Manager's going to give me a list
of users, it's going to give me a list of groups,

00:20:37.329 --> 00:20:40.629
and potentially a list of computers
that I want to administer.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.250
So let's create a new user here.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.089
Oh, I'm sorry, Tim.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:51.550
I'll do it somewhere else great.

00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:57.769
Let's save this user.

00:20:57.769 --> 00:21:01.609
And Tim doesn't need a password.

00:21:01.609 --> 00:21:06.159
And we'll create a group and we'll call it "managed users."

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:15.150
And we can add Tim to this group.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:22.650
And then we can decide to govern Tim's
behavior using Workgroup Manager.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.370
I imagine his manager would like this capability.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:34.250
So we'll hit preferences and we'll go in and we can
decide, mmm, I want to control maybe his dock, right?

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.359
What should we allow to Tim to have in his dock?

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:38.399
Calculator?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.830
( Laughter )

00:21:42.829 --> 00:21:49.470
No we're not going to give him calculator,
we're going to give him the chess game.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:57.380
Yeah. You have the ability to say, gets
these icons that I define but also --

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.160
and again we're dealing with a
group here as opposed to a user --

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.830
but this group of people is going to have
these applications that I've defined.

00:22:02.829 --> 00:22:07.529
You can allow them to add additional ones
but not remove the ones you've added,

00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:10.839
or you can say, no, this is going to be the dock.

00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:14.209
So for those of you who are deploying a large number
of machines that are going to go away and you want

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.470
to have some control over the user experience,
setting this here and having them log in

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.660
and get that managed preference while
they're on the network will allow it

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.019
to travel with them when they leave your network.

00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:30.319
So we can also create a computer list.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.589
Oh, sorry, account.

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:42.579
Yeah, thanks.

00:22:42.579 --> 00:22:46.189
We can create a computer list and
I'll call this portable machines.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:56.539
And for this list of machines I'm going to go threw and say
I want to create a centralized software update server

00:22:56.539 --> 00:22:58.599
and I want to make sure that all of these machines use it.

00:22:58.599 --> 00:23:08.939
So I'll just put any URL.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.420
If you're running a local software update server
your portable machines will use that as opposed

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:19.570
to using up the bandwidth for your organization.

00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:20.879
What else do we want to do?

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.150
Let's take a look at mobility.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.120
These are portable machines after all.

00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:33.919
Now notice here we can say allow offline use portable,
essentially mobile accounts by require the user

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.320
to click okay, I want to create a mobile
account on this machine when they log in.

00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:41.029
In a moment I'll show you Leopard Server and
you'll see we have quite a few more options.

00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:54.970
In fact I will do that right now.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.059
So same tool, Workgroup Manager in Leopard.

00:23:58.059 --> 00:24:05.809
And we've got a group called Managed User.

00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:08.579
We'll go to preferences.

00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:12.599
Notice now we can do things like parental controls.

00:24:12.599 --> 00:24:20.659
Whereas that was something you'd do on each machine
before, you have the ability to say I want to limit access

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:29.170
to websites and I want to hide profanity in the dictionary
and always allow access to particular URLs, et cetera.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.900
So parental controls are available.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:40.590
Also Time Machine -- let's create a -- I
think I've got a group of computers here.

00:24:40.589 --> 00:24:46.609
So you say I always want to manage these and you can
specify the URL and share point of a Time Machine server,

00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:50.139
so when these backups occur they go to your file server.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:59.910
Some of you also want to run scripts at login.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.769
And managed preferences can do that for you.

00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:07.309
Just manage the login item here, select always,

00:25:07.309 --> 00:25:14.369
and you can do things like run a script whenever
somebody logs in or when somebody logs out.

00:25:14.369 --> 00:25:15.049
( Applause )

00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:19.240
Thanks. Some of this you can actually do in Tiger.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.410
Notice under the options pane here is where you can
do things like enable guest accounts on that list

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.820
of machines and enable external accounts.

00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:34.960
So you have that control.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.710
So kind of new also and something you may not know

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.539
about it is some preference management
that isn't reflected in this UI.

00:25:42.539 --> 00:25:46.799
So we've got a bunch of things
in here that we can lock down.

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:50.930
How many of you would like to govern the behavior
of iTunes on the machines that you disperse?

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:51.100
( Laughter )

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:51.259
( Applause )

00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:55.490
So there's no iTunes icon here.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:02.289
But if we go to details and click plus to
add a preference manifest to workgroup manager.

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:09.829
If a developer has taken the time to build something called
a preference manifest you can manage their machine using

00:26:09.829 --> 00:26:10.579
Workgroup Manager.

00:26:10.579 --> 00:26:17.129
And there are a bunch of prebuilt ones included
with Mac OS X in something called Managed Client.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.740
And I'm going to take the shortcut here,

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:31.900
but it's in /system/library/coreservices,
and it's called Managed Client.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:38.340
So if you add the Managed Client to this list
you'll see that there's a bunch of stuff now

00:26:38.339 --> 00:26:40.980
that you can lock down that you didn't see the UI for.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.120
One of them is iTunes.

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:51.739
So if you edit this notice where in Workgroup Manager
you had kind of a once often and always setting.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.150
It's not quite the same UI, but
it's the same kind of control.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:58.140
We could add a key here and say always.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:05.160
Let's disable music sharing and set the value to true.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.519
( Applause )

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:13.950
I like that one a lot, too.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:24.590
But one that I like even more is
something called folder redirection.

00:27:24.589 --> 00:27:24.720
>> No.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.360
( Laughter )

00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:30.179
>> Yes. So let's edit this.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.759
This one looks a little bit more hairy but it's so much fun.

00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:40.509
We'll go to always and click new key,
change this value to login redirections.

00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:42.670
We'll give that one a new key.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:49.720
Sorry, I left my own dropping behind there.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.390
All right.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.790
We now have a redirect action.

00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:56.230
Now, take a look at this.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.299
I'm going to take /tilde/library/caches.

00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:02.440
When the user logs in I'm going to delete it.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.789
( Applause )

00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:10.559
And then I'm going to redirect it to the temporary folder.

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:14.819
And notice this syntax here, this
percent at, that's the user name, right?

00:28:14.819 --> 00:28:19.869
So you'll have an individual cache folder in
your temporary directory for that user name.

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:26.500
Some of you probably scripted around this problem,
now you've got kind of a legitimate way to handle it.

00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:31.420
That does mean though that you've got some homework to do.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.060
Apple has provided some preference
manifests that you can use for management.

00:28:35.059 --> 00:28:40.720
All of applications that you use you need to beat up on
those developers and get them to provide those to you

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.069
so you can lock down other applications
besides the one that you see here.

00:28:44.069 --> 00:28:45.220
All right.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.529
I think I'm ready for slides again.

00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:55.279
Now we're going to take a break and
introduce Shawn Geddis

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:57.019
to talk a little bit about mobile security.

00:28:57.019 --> 00:28:57.629
( Applause )

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:04.060
>> Thank you.

00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:09.929
Okay. Real quick, we just wanted to cover some content
that some of you may have seen in some of our areas.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.870
Previous session we talked about security.

00:29:11.869 --> 00:29:15.689
There's a whole bunch of organizations,
whether it be government or commercial,

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.980
spending a lot of money protecting data, right?

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.680
So there's some simple things that you
can do to leverage the build-in services

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.340
to do that, particularly on mobile devices.

00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:31.490
One comment, one quote that I like to share with folks is
if you were here back in 2004 in one of the IT sessions,

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:35.390
Tom Yeager emphasized the fact
that you don't spend money unless it or -- yeah.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:40.570
You don't purchase anything unless it saves you money,
it makes you money, or the government requires it.

00:29:40.569 --> 00:29:45.200
So everyone here fits somewhere in that, in those groups.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.720
So let's quickly touch on managing the
encrypted storage in the FileVault.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.970
Particularly with FileVault many folks
have been concerned with how to manage

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.400
because they weren't sure how to do it on a charge scale.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.769
So hopefully we can quickly give you some guidance.

00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:04.500
We mentioned this a little bit
earlier about the new capabilities

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.690
in the disk utility enhancement
with 256-bit AES with Leopard.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:16.059
This gives you additional protection and some
people always ask, Well, what does that mean to me,

00:30:16.059 --> 00:30:18.059
'causey I don't understand the security side?

00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:20.980
So this is if you go up on the NIST
Web site you can get an idea.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.740
So if you could build a rack of supercomputers to crack
a DES key, which is not that hard --

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:32.120
crack a dez key in a second that same
supercomputer group will take 149 trillion years

00:30:32.119 --> 00:30:38.159
to exhaust all the permutations, all
the possibilities for 120- bit AES key.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.940
Now that we've gone to 256-bit, right, this is the exponent.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.549
All right, the exponent on this.

00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:49.289
So we haven't gone linearly we've now raised
this much higher than 149 trillion years.

00:30:49.289 --> 00:30:53.899
And if some of you are here at that time - - good.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.150
So let's quickly hit on the disk images.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:03.269
First, remember when you're created an encrypted disk image
you actually have the ability to save the symmetric key,

00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:05.879
symmetric being the same key to encrypt and decrypt.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.330
You have the ability of storing that in your keychain.

00:31:08.329 --> 00:31:14.740
It could be any keychain that you have that you could
even do a portable keychain with storage devices as well

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:20.809
But as you're creating an encrypted container
as you enter the pass phrase itself --

00:31:20.809 --> 00:31:24.039
first of all we'll make a quick
reference to the password strength.

00:31:24.039 --> 00:31:31.159
It's going to tell you whether the pass phrase
that you're keying in there is worth anything.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.910
Okay. Green is good, red is bad.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:34.790
Typical here.

00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:39.109
So, again, you can even -- if you click on
the little key there it'll bring up the,

00:31:39.109 --> 00:31:43.059
a much more rich password assistant
that many of you are familiar with,

00:31:43.059 --> 00:31:45.259
but as you type that you'll see the strength directly.

00:31:45.259 --> 00:31:49.670
So you can determine whether you want to
hang onto that key on this particular system.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:56.960
And once you do that it's actually putting in a
key entry in that keychain for that disk image.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.279
Now you could copy that over to another keychain and
manage that personally or even at a large organization.

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:08.740
The area there about that count, that's
really referencing that mountable image.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:17.630
It's directly related to that image and that's how the
system will ask for the appropriate keychain to be unlocked

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.980
when you want to mount that encrypted image.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.170
This is -- taking this a little bit further.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:28.230
When remember when you have any encrypted image
file you can now partition that multiple partitions,

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:32.930
create various disk formats, put data on their.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:36.460
Maybe you're doing some virtualization
parallels, VM ware, all kinds of stuff.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:41.519
Stick that on a partition, put another disk format like UFS,

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:46.930
if you have some older UNIX applications they require
both app lay indication and data being on UFS.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:51.440
These are again, other ways that you can now ensure
that all of that data even though they're used

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:57.330
by different run time environments and different maybe even
the user, that you can encrypt all of that in one container.

00:32:57.329 --> 00:33:01.919
This is a scenario that really has helped
a lot of people better understand the power

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.100
of the encrypted disk image that they weren't aware of.

00:33:05.099 --> 00:33:10.709
Not only with the fact that we've raised it up from
128-bit AES to 256, if you're in an environment

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:16.910
where you need access to that data sometimes
you don't always need the data to be maintained

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.519
on your portable device You may not
always have to take it with you as long

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:22.369
as you have access back to where it's stored.

00:33:22.369 --> 00:33:29.019
So as long as I have access back to this file
server I can mount that volume right on my desktop

00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:36.420
and all of the data going back and forth between the file
server and that disk image is fully encrypted blocks, right?

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.940
Because that volume's a logical
volume is seen as a blocked device.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:47.460
so as I read and write data only the blocks of information
that are needed, both being written out and being read back,

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.430
are all passed back and fort between
the client and the server.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:55.060
And you have the key locally for
that encryption and decryption.

00:33:55.059 --> 00:34:00.149
So let's look at kind of a more feature-rich
encrypted image, and that's FileVault.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.920
This is for the home directory.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:08.639
Now first of all it is relying on the same AS encryption,
works on the fly so users aren't aware of the fact

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.869
that you've got all that encryption and all
that power underneath protection of their data.

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:18.000
But you as the IT folks need to be able to
recover or be able to manage that in case --

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.840
I'm your employee, if I leave or you fire me or you just
get rid of me, I forget the pass phrase if I'm logging

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:30.300
in with passwords -- you need some method to be
able to manage and get back access to that data.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:36.730
So what I wanted to do is kind of carry forward with you
an explanation of what you can do both initially as a one

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:42.719
to one or a very large deployment on how
you can manage that FileVault container,

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:45.639
the encrypted container, for each one of those users.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:50.750
So you're already pretty much familiar with the system
preference on a local machine, you're doing security,

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:56.320
and you're manually enabling FileVault by clicking
on set master password, you enter that password,

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.550
and that is now creating what really
is an identity behind that.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:06.050
And we'll talk in a minute about how you
leverage that, how you manipulate that identity

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.590
for your use both for recovery and creation of FileVault.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.850
So let's review real quick how Tiger
provides the protection for FileVault.

00:35:14.849 --> 00:35:21.059
Somebody logs in their pass phrase, they log in,
that pass phrase is converted to a key, user key;

00:35:21.059 --> 00:35:26.329
and then that is unwrapping that symmetric
key that is protecting all of that data.

00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:29.579
Then as a user I read and write my
files just like I normally would.

00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:33.289
I'd see my folder, my documents, my
desktop, my library, my music and all,

00:35:33.289 --> 00:35:35.570
it's just there as a -- I would do as a normally user.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:41.140
On 10.5 we add the enhancement of
using two factor authentication

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:45.519
like the smart cards, to unlock
that same encrypted container.

00:35:45.519 --> 00:35:45.909
As I men- --

00:35:45.909 --> 00:35:46.239
( Applause )

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:46.639
There you go.

00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:47.779
You can clap for that one.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:54.310
As you can -- as I mentioned earlier, also with AES
256 the same user experience for everything else.

00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:57.619
Immediate access to all that data.

00:35:57.619 --> 00:36:03.179
This is where you need to have some
mechanism to manage this encrypted storage.

00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:09.589
Many of you need to manage by policy or
manage your users both for recovery reasons

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:13.250
and maybe in some cases just for
the protection of corporate IP.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:19.039
Maybe there's data that you need to be sure that you can
get back to in the event that the individual's not there.

00:36:19.039 --> 00:36:23.829
So when I mentioned that you clicked on --
manually if you click on the set master password,

00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:27.250
what really is created is this FileVault master keychain.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:31.719
It's an identity, meaning it has
a certificate and a private key.

00:36:31.719 --> 00:36:34.519
The combination becomes an identity.

00:36:34.519 --> 00:36:37.050
This is enabled and created for you on the fly.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:43.070
And many of you that have your own certificate
authority, if you want to maintain for --

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:48.630
predominant reasons would be for key escrow --
is issued the FileVault identity from your CA,

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:56.269
what you can do is once it's created wipe that out
and import your CA's issued identity for FileVault.

00:36:56.269 --> 00:37:01.429
Okay, then you can manage it at the user
level, Workgroup level, organizational level.

00:37:01.429 --> 00:37:02.359
So let's take this further.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.240
How can you leverage FileVault and
manage it across a large organization?

00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:13.529
Remember that when you actually enable FileVault on
the user all that really is used is the public key

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:16.570
from that certificate to wrap that data key, okay?

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.880
Some of you might -- I might be
losing some of you here, but hang on.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.740
And that is when I -- let me back up here.

00:37:22.739 --> 00:37:27.399
Remember that by default there's an
identity, a certificate and a private key.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.950
The public key is used to wrap,
the private key is used to unwrap.

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:37.289
What I've done now is I'm going to
deploy an image or I'm going to push

00:37:37.289 --> 00:37:40.809
out this management, FileVault
management to all my machines.

00:37:40.809 --> 00:37:46.219
What I do is I escrow that original
keychain and I remove the private key.

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:47.569
Okay. Why would I remove the private key?

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:54.000
Because if for various reasons there's -- through social
engineering or just somehow I am able to get the pass phrase

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.929
on that FileVault keychain I'd be
able to decrypt someone's account.

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:06.329
And if you remove the private key no matter whether someone
knows that pass phrase there's no potential for them a the

00:38:06.329 --> 00:38:09.559
that machine to decrypt and have access to that account.

00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:12.860
So what you do, again -- and back
up, 'cause this is important.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.720
I've created that identity.

00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:19.759
I can do it on one machine if you want to manage
it initially with one FileVault keychain.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:28.000
I enable, it creates the identity, I then remove the
private key, and I either push this FileVault keychain

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.860
to all my machines or I put this on the machine, the
image that I'm going to use to restore all my machines on.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:43.829
Okay? Then what I do is when I need to recover if the use'
forgotten their pass phrase to enter for login or if, again,

00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:50.599
the user leaves, they're no longer at the company, all you
need to do is restore that original FileVault keychain,

00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:54.619
that private key, and go through
the standard recovery on the box.

00:38:54.619 --> 00:39:00.190
You're going to login, it fails three times, it's going to
ask you for the master pass phrase, you enter that,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.539
you're able to reset the user's password.

00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:04.469
You can also do that from the command line.

00:39:04.469 --> 00:39:09.609
It's one line and you do HDI util is
the command to manipulate the unlocking

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.570
and the management of a encrypted image with FileVault.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:18.430
So I guess I'm turning it back to you.

00:39:18.429 --> 00:39:20.669
( Applause )

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.920
( Applause )

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.530
>> Thank you.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.710
Thank you, sir.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.079
Great. So let's move on to software distribution.

00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:29.829
I've got a couple notes on imaging.

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:34.610
And I need to be on the slides, sorry.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.369
I was hoping to get a laugh out of this slide
and I didn't get one so now I know why, right?

00:39:42.369 --> 00:39:47.009
So I got a couple notes on images but we have some great
sessions that cover images so I'm not going to go in-depth.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.280
A couple of the things that I'll point out.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.730
One being that there's the temptation for
many of you to build an operating system image

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:59.889
and put all your applications and set your preferences and
set your machine up in what you consider to be an ideal

00:39:59.889 --> 00:40:06.059
or perfect way and then copy that a thousand times or you
know, 40,000 times and distribute that out in the world.

00:40:06.059 --> 00:40:10.590
And that's fantastic, but the temptation
is as Apple releases new hardware to try

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.840
and take that old image and use it on the new machine.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.910
And those of you who have done this for some time
know that usual little when new hardware's released

00:40:18.909 --> 00:40:22.969
from Apple a new build of the operating
system is released with it,

00:40:22.969 --> 00:40:25.939
which is going to frustrate you if
you try and use your old image.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.450
Some of you have found workarounds to make this work.

00:40:28.449 --> 00:40:34.159
The danger you're going to run into
is if there's a problem as a result

00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:38.920
of you reusing your old image you may not discover
it until all of your machines are out in the world

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.119
and it's going to be very hard to deal with after the fact.

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:45.880
So what you want to do is develop
a process for building your image

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.010
that assumes the operating system
is there and then adds on top of it.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.320
Somewhat of a layered approach.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:57.530
So take packages that you're, that the
developers provide you or make packages yourself,

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:03.360
script this install if possible, and make the
creation of your image an automated thing.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.360
So that if we were to give you a new
machine you could click a button,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:12.280
make an image for that machine,
and maybe one click and walk away.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.540
So here is a way that I've used in the past.

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:18.360
I'm not necessarily saying that this is what you
want to do, but it's something to think about.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.599
And that is to use a shell script to
take disk images that you're provided,

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:28.119
that you download or that you copy off of optical media.

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:34.440
Mound the disk image, use the command line
installer to install the package that's on that image

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.110
and then, if you like, dismount the image.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:41.240
And you can do this for any number
of applications in sequence.

00:41:41.239 --> 00:41:45.929
So when you're forced to make a brand-new image for a
brand-new piece of hardware you don't have to remember all

00:41:45.929 --> 00:41:50.519
of the manual steps you used, all
of the applications that you used.

00:41:50.519 --> 00:41:53.000
And if you've got applications that you want to customize,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.269
remember that the defaults command can set
preferences so you can script that as well.

00:41:57.269 --> 00:42:04.079
Here's one that sets the Apple Remote Desktop administrator
application such that when you double click on something

00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:08.029
in your list it controls it as opposed to getting info.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:11.580
I've got another application, OmniOutliner.

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:17.039
This one is going -- this one doesn't use a package
installer so you need to copy the application onto the disk.

00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:24.940
And this uses the ditto command, ditto in the minus V
form is going to do a verbose copy of that application.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.380
So what you've got is sort of a bunch of
different things you can do in sequence.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.730
And if you have to repeat this it's
not a tremendous amount of trouble.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.599
This last one here is configuring QuickTime so that

00:42:34.599 --> 00:42:39.049
when you launch the QuickTime player it
doesn't bring up the hot picks movie.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.360
So you can imagine there are probably hundreds
of thousands of these things that you might want

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.750
to do to a machine before you build an image.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:50.699
If your resistance to tailoring your image to that
particular hard wear family is that it takes a long time

00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:55.000
to make it, an automated install
may do it, it may resolve that.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.280
Now you can do this or you can use a tremendous
number of existing tools to do something like this.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:07.500
Apple provides -- or Apple offers Apple Remote
Desktop, which is sort of a network management tool

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.699
but also has the ability to push installer
packages and you can save these steps that you do

00:43:12.699 --> 00:43:15.599
in Apple Remote Desktop and replay them later.

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:20.069
You can also use PackageMaker which is included
with the developer tools to make your own packages.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:24.510
So install an application, make an
installer based on that, and then redeploy.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:30.300
And the beauty of that is not only do you have it,
not only do you make building your image easier,

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.700
but you can repurpose those packages
with Apple Remote Desktop and push them.

00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:42.349
System image utilities you'll hear a lot more about
tomorrow, but it has workflow built in by way of Automator.

00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:45.179
So again, you can sort of automate
the creation of your image.

00:43:45.179 --> 00:43:50.389
And a number of other tools -- some of
these were even discussed here at the show.

00:43:50.389 --> 00:43:55.799
Who was lucky to attend the scripting for system
administrators session earlier in the week?

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.460
So many of you saw Tim Purfit use Ruby on rails to build
sort of

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:03.440
of a lightweight Apple Remote Desktop
application from a Web page.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.860
And he did offer his services.

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:09.300
If you need help building something like
that, his e-mail address is tim@apple.com.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.250
So if you need any assistance with
that, contact him directly.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.019
( Laughter )

00:44:16.019 --> 00:44:22.050
Speaking of Apple Remote Desktop, this is a tool that
will allow you to control and observe remote systems.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:26.340
We probably know by now that Leopard's going to
have some of that functionality build in,

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:31.900
but ARD is good for a number of other things
including generating system information, reports.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:37.610
And the beauty of the way Apple Remote Desktop does this
is it puts all the stuff in a post (inaudible) database

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.050
and you're clients will do it periodically.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:45.640
So the database stores the last information
your client gave it, and you can run reports

00:44:45.639 --> 00:44:47.739
against that if your machines are not connected.

00:44:47.739 --> 00:44:54.099
And this is going to tell you how much memory is in all of
your portable machines and how full their hard disk is

00:44:54.099 --> 00:44:58.039
and what operating system and which processer
and what kind of network capabilities.

00:44:58.039 --> 00:45:01.869
So when someone comes to you and
says, brand-new operating system comes

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:04.849
out next month, which of our machines can support it?

00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:08.659
You can run a report, get those answers,
and you don't have to wait for people

00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:12.049
to bring their machines in to get that data.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.400
You can also push installer packages.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.450
How many of you saw the extending Apple
Remote Desktop session this morning?

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:23.319
Great. So for the rest of you I want to take a moment
to talk about a new feature -- not at new feature --

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.030
another feature in Apple Remote Desktop called Task Server.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:37.000
And we'll need the demo machine for that.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.219
So I've got a machine designated as a Task
Server for Apple Remote Desktop and I want

00:45:41.219 --> 00:45:45.889
to push a package to a number of systems.

00:45:45.889 --> 00:45:53.670
Let's say the .Mac backup application.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:59.300
Now I can select the machines, drag the package
into the list of selected machines and install them.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.289
We'll go ahead and do that.

00:46:00.289 --> 00:46:03.529
And you'll see that you can see task progress.

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:11.010
These machines are ready to go and they're installing
the application directly from my administration system.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:16.750
And they're complete.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:22.550
Now an alternative to this is to select the machines,
install a package, but this time I say instead

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:27.740
of running the task from this application
I want to -- sorry about that --

00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:33.459
I want to send this install packaged task to
the Task Server running on another machine.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:39.309
This other machine is probably going to stay connected to
the network 24/7 and it will take these pack installs

00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:42.489
that you want to push and it'll
send them out to connected clients.

00:46:42.489 --> 00:46:49.149
Clients that are not connected will
get them when they come back up.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:50.730
So let's take one of these machines.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:47:00.010
Let's take the Leopard machine and shut it down.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.840
And send the package.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:09.170
And you'll notice now that the Task
Server is showing me the progress of this.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:16.420
And it's installing on the one machine
that's up, and almost complete.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:20.130
We're going to have to wait for that machine to come
back up so that we can' that once it comes back

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.539
on the network it'll check back in with the Task Server,

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:28.079
see that the administrator has a package
available for it, and install that.

00:47:31.909 --> 00:47:38.549
So while we're waiting how many of you are dying for the
punch line for Steve Hayman's joke?

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:38.710
Yeah.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.820
( Applause )

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:43.570
So I have a treat for you.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.180
At the end of this session I will
share that punch line with you.

00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:53.489
He was very kind to share the punch line with me and
I will save that till the Q and A, so hang in there.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:55.579
All right.

00:47:55.579 --> 00:47:57.159
So let me give you a status report on this.

00:47:57.159 --> 00:48:00.519
The Leopard machine is booting.

00:48:00.519 --> 00:48:03.139
Look at this.

00:48:03.139 --> 00:48:08.119
It's idle, it remains to be installed, but it's online.

00:48:08.119 --> 00:48:10.869
And notice that it says, oh, I've
got packages waiting for me,

00:48:10.869 --> 00:48:14.699
it's going to begin installing the backup package in a moment.

00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:24.839
Let me give you a zoomed view of this.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.070
( Applause )

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:28.340
There you go.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:31.210
All right.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:33.510
We need to switch back to slides.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:40.900
So all you need to do to set up an Apple Remote
Desktop Task Server is just buy another copy of ARD,

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:48.530
put it on a machine that stays connected to your
network, and designate that as your Task Server.

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:56.130
So we've got a couple of related
sessions for software distribution.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:58.070
This one's been done.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:01.450
But upcoming, managing your clients
with Leopard Server we talked about.

00:49:01.449 --> 00:49:03.819
That's going to be a jam-packed session tomorrow at 2:00.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.250
Also a Building System Images for
Large-Scale Deployment as 3:30.
0

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.789
And Understanding Managed Deployment at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:19.690
So if you're into software distribution,
tomorrow is a big day for you.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:22.090
And, finally, backup.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:27.829
How many of you are already using
portable home folders in your environment?

00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:33.989
Great. The best backup solution for that is
to back up those home folder at the server.

00:49:33.989 --> 00:49:39.129
A portable home by itself not a very good backup.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:44.559
My friend, Frank, just reminded me, just told me a story
not too long ago that portable home saved his marriage

00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:50.579
because his wife's machine -- he actually
demagnetized the hard drive using a giant magnet,

00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:52.380
which apparently you can do by accident.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.000
I'm not sure how he did that.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.050
( Laughter )

00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:01.590
But it had a lot of crucial data on it and he was
able to use his portable home to resynchronize that.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:05.079
I had an opposite experience, or a
near opposite experience with Frank.

00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:13.110
I was fooling around with portable home directories day
one in 10.40, and I didn't think the synchronization

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:17.950
of happening properly so I deleted a bunch of
files on the server so I could resynchronize.

00:50:17.949 --> 00:50:24.359
And so then my machine said oh well it changed the
network version sooner and these folders are gone

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.960
so it removed my iPhoto library from my desktop machine.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.679
Six years worth of pictures of my kids from, like, day zero.

00:50:32.679 --> 00:50:33.799
That was on ugly scenario.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.690
And I didn't actually discover that for about three
months, because the cache files were still there.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:41.500
So iPhoto looked fine, but the
photos behind there were gone.

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:45.340
Luckily I made a backup before I started that,
and you want to make sure you do the same.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:51.559
Back up the server and make sure that
your clients are in fact synchronizing.

00:50:51.559 --> 00:50:52.820
So there's a little bit of a danger here.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.410
If you're only backing up their network home

00:50:54.409 --> 00:50:58.409
and their portable home is not synchronizing
to that, you're not getting everything.

00:50:58.409 --> 00:51:02.960
But the beauty of this approach is you're deploying
an Enterprise backup solution at the server side

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:09.849
and you're sort of letting the clients come
and go and update their files as they do that.

00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:12.659
So if you want to make sure you get
everything you might want to push some

00:51:12.659 --> 00:51:15.349
of the responsibility for backup onto your users.

00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:20.829
And you can do that by way of client side backup
app lay indications like the .Mac backup tool.

00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:25.069
You have to have a .Mac subscription
to use it -- it's about $99 a year --

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:31.210
but it doesn't just back up to your .Mac iDisk,
which is about 1 gigabyte worth of online storage.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:34.340
It'll also back up to optical disks, CDs, and DVDs.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.480
It'll back up to a network server,
it's back up to your iPod.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:43.250
It'll pop up a very inobtrusive reminder, hey, it's
time to do your monthly backup, give me a disk.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:48.679
You give it a disk, it burns the disk, it spits
it out, and it says write this on the disk.

00:51:48.679 --> 00:51:55.409
So very easy for end users to use and puts a little bit
more of the responsibility on their shoulders and covers you

00:51:55.409 --> 00:51:59.399
in case that synchronization isn't
getting all of their files.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:06.289
You can also consider using things like iSync and .Mac Sync
to put contacts and calendar information on people's phones,

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:12.230
on people's iPods, or on other
computers by way of .Mac Sync.

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:16.789
This isn't a full backup, obviously, but if you lose
your phone and some of you probably support people

00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:21.460
that have their entire contact list in their phone
you've got a backup on your machine and vice versa.

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.970
And then .Mac Sync will let you
do this with multiple computers

00:52:23.969 --> 00:52:27.439
and will even handle things like
bookmarks and mail settings.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:32.019
So if you use iMap for your mail you don't
need to worry about synchronizing Mail,

00:52:32.019 --> 00:52:39.000
but you might want to synchronize the Mail rules and the
signatures, and the smart mailboxes and that sort of thing.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.400
And then, of course, new in Leopard
is the Time Machine backup tool.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.519
And this is going to perform backup
for you in two primary ways.

00:52:46.519 --> 00:52:49.090
One being backup to an external disk.

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:53.960
So assign it your users an external hard drive
and tell them this is your backup solution,

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.039
plug it in and it will copy your
data onto this external disk.

00:52:58.039 --> 00:53:05.170
Or set up a file server share point with Leopard
Server so that they can back up over the network.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.030
And you can use this in conjunction with portable homes,

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:11.080
or you might decide that this is the
way you want to do all of your backups.

00:53:11.079 --> 00:53:15.400
So we had a great Time Machine in-depth session and
a storage solution session that you'd probably need

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.269
if you're going to do all of these network backups.

00:53:17.269 --> 00:53:22.869
Now it's possible some of you got all the
way to this point and said, you know, what?

00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:26.130
All that GUI stuff is great, but I really want to
get in there and tweak stuff at the command line.

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:31.970
I've got a few minutes left and I wanted to share with you
a couple of tips that might, that you might not know about.

00:53:31.969 --> 00:53:34.279
And we'll start with something called PM set.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:39.070
So I think I showed you that in Energy Saver
you could govern -- maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:44.059
In Workgroup Manager and Energy Saver management you
can govern the behavior of your portable machines.

00:53:44.059 --> 00:53:46.099
When do they spin down their hard drive?

00:53:46.099 --> 00:53:49.969
Do they turn off the display?

00:53:49.969 --> 00:53:52.149
At what point do you sleep the machine?

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.720
You can do this manually if you like using the PM set tool.

00:53:55.719 --> 00:53:57.909
The PM stands for "power management."

00:53:57.909 --> 00:54:03.639
And Richard Glaser has a great
writeup on this on the MacEnterprise.org website.

00:54:03.639 --> 00:54:06.489
Also Kickstart.

00:54:06.489 --> 00:54:11.289
I've got -- I have one colleague who has a customer
that deployed a bunch of machines and they were worried

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:18.019
that theres who were administrators on their
machines would disable the Remote Desktop client.

00:54:18.019 --> 00:54:21.780
So they figured the way to do that is
they'd go to sharing and uncheck the box.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.970
Well, unbeknownst to them behind the scenes
is a script on a schedule that looks to see

00:54:25.969 --> 00:54:31.219
if their Remote Desktop client is running, and
if it's not it uses Kickstart to start it up.

00:54:31.219 --> 00:54:36.959
So you have this mechanism to manage the machines even if
there's some effort on the remote side to prevent that.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:45.190
And there's one command that I use over ask over and over
to enable all access privileges for my administrator user.

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:49.659
And I'm very thankful that in the help for
Kickstart, which you will get by type,

00:54:49.659 --> 00:54:54.019
by running the K star command
followed by dash H. They have an example after about six

00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:58.489
or seven pages worth of great documentation
of the line you use to do this.

00:54:58.489 --> 00:55:00.389
And the user they use is bob.

00:55:00.389 --> 00:55:04.859
So if you can remember to gret for bob
you can run this one command down here

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:10.160
and get that one line you're going to use over and over.

00:55:10.159 --> 00:55:11.489
I mentioned DSCL before.

00:55:11.489 --> 00:55:14.629
The Directory Services command line will let
you navigate through your directory service.

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:19.269
And this is your local directory, this is Active
Directory, this is Open Directory, just about anything.

00:55:19.269 --> 00:55:21.389
Read and modifier those files.

00:55:21.389 --> 00:55:24.789
It's also great tool for change
passwords from the command line.

00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:27.750
There's a man page for DSCL.

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:35.909
DS Edit Group is a Directory Services tool that
you may like if you want to make your users

00:55:35.909 --> 00:55:44.569
who are using a nest network account or portable home, you
want to make them administrator of their local machine.

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:49.309
So you assign them to a group in your
network directory called administrators.

00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:54.590
But the way you give those people
local admin access is you need to add

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:59.309
that network group to the local administrators group.

00:55:59.309 --> 00:56:02.960
And I've got a couple of lines you can run one
after the other with DS edit group that'll do that.

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.840
If you've got users that want to be
able to run sudo

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.890
from the command line this is the way you do it.

00:56:07.889 --> 00:56:13.049
In Leopard actually, group management is sort of the
build in to the UI so you don't need to fall back

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:14.560
on the command line method for doing that.

00:56:14.559 --> 00:56:18.619
And you can also use Workgroup Manager, by the
way, to make these changes on your local machine.

00:56:18.619 --> 00:56:21.339
So that's DS edit group.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.280
Couple of related sessions.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.120
And then some final steps.

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:29.309
( Laughter )

00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:32.029
So where do we go from here?

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:35.490
Believe it or not there are tons of sessions tomorrow,
especially if you're into software distribution

00:56:35.489 --> 00:56:39.739
or management, all the way up until the
end of the day lots of good stuff to go to.

00:56:39.739 --> 00:56:41.099
So take advantage of that.

00:56:41.099 --> 00:56:42.329
Also, beat up on Leopard.

00:56:42.329 --> 00:56:46.750
I think this is a fantastic opportunity because you have
the operating system now but we're not going to ship it

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:49.829
until October so you have all of this time to make sure

00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:53.069
that it does what it needs to do
for you so that you can deploy it.

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:54.630
And let us know how it works.

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:56.230
Use the Bug Reporter tool.

00:56:56.230 --> 00:57:04.250
Let your Apple representatives know how it's working
for you so that we can get it ready for you in time.

00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:11.559
And also, how many of you have not joined
or visited MacEnterprise.org or AFP 548?

00:57:11.559 --> 00:57:15.670
Okay. So you need to join -- no --
thank you for raising your hand.

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:16.200
All right.

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:17.460
So the rest of you did great.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:17.679
All right.
