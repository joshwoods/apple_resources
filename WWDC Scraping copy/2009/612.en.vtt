WEBVTT

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.109
[ Applause ]

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.119
>> Good afternoon.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.500
My name is Wilfredo and I'm the Engineering Manager for
the iCal Server team at Apple and I'm going to be talking

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.000
about pretty much everything calendaring in so far as Snow
Leopard, Snow Leopard Server, and the iPhone are concerned.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.170
So just to start out right now, our product
lineup for these areas includes iCal.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.300
They include iCal Server, they include a web calendar which
is new on Snow Leopard and they include the iPhone calendar

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:47.949
which in the 3.0 version of the system that
actually can talk to iCal Server via CalDAV.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.210
See if I can remember this timeline correctly.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.189
iCal version 1 was basically a product
that was a geared up personal calendar.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.780
And so you can kind of get that.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.840
It started out as a download that you could get
for Tiger, and it actually shifted with that system

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.909
and you could basically manage
your personal calendar that way.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.789
You could put in your birthdays, your dinner engagements,
and that sort of thing but it's pretty much just about you.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.260
Later on, sync came along and gave you the ability to kind
of get that information across all the different computers

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.620
that you own, but again it was still kind of
geared at your personal calendaring information.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.259
Then we shifted to iCal version 2 and iCal version 2 added
something a little more interesting which was published

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.570
and subscribed over WebDAV, and that gave you the ability to
share a calendar with other people in a read-only fashion,

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.719
so I could create a calendar that was like maybe
sports events for the little league or something,

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.400
publish that out to a server and we provided a way
to do that through .Mac you didn't have to set

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.230
up your own server and you can share calendars that way.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.250
But once again, that was just a read-only
and only one person can edit that calendar.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.539
iPhone version 1 followed along and again, it
included a calendar application that was geared

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.549
at personal calendaring much like iCal version 1 was.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:22.540
Then with iCal 3, we actually introduced CalDAV, and CalDAV
gave iCal the ability to actually store events on a server

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:28.889
in a more interesting way than it could with just WebDAV,
and that allowed people to actually schedule meetings

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.919
with each other, where I can invite you to
a meeting and you can accept or decline.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:38.709
I could see when you are available for that meeting
and it obviated the need for iSync as a solution

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.830
because now I can get all-- all my computers can get
to the CalDAV server directly and get that data down,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.630
and it added additional functionality on top of that.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.349
iPhone 2 added support for that same functionality
when you were talking to a Microsoft Exchange Server

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.269
which is a highly demanded feature for people in
the business center for I's [phonetic] market.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:07.530
And then with iCal 4, they added also support for
exchange and with iPhone 3, we had now have the ability

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.129
to speak to iCal Server via CalDAV, so thanks.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.939
CalDAV is actually kind of the glue that holds
all of our calendaring solutions together.

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:25.250
All of the Apple products now speak one common
protocol, that's an open standard that not only Apple

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.719
but actually several other players in the
calendaring marketplace participate in.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:38.180
So, let's talk just briefly, give you an overview what
CalDAV provides in terms of protocol and standards.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.659
First up, we leverage iCalendar which is a text data
format that basically specifies when a meeting is,

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.810
what its title is, who the attendees are, when it
ends, does it recur, does it happen on every full moon

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.129
of the third month of every year, that sort of thing.

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.030
It's actually a pretty rich way
to describe meeting information.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.879
iTIP is the iCalendar transport
interchange protocol, I believe,

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.460
and that allows you to basically schedule with other people.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.090
Lets you say send the messages as when
are you available for a meeting or, "Hey,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.950
I'd like you to come to this meeting, can you come?"

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.899
Now these two standards have been
around for a good long time,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:25.939
and they're supported by pretty much every
calendaring software system that's out there today,

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.829
that includes Microsoft Outlook, that includes
iCal going all the way back to version 1

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:35.759
and pretty much everything you use,
Mozilla calendar and that sort of thing.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.189
Now we wanted to take these things and be able to
store them on a server, and the protocol that seems

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.519
to be very well regarded for doing
that sort of thing is HTTP,

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:49.399
but in order to facilitate that,
you need WebDAV which leverages XML.

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:55.669
And with extensions for access control, you can
actually manage who is allowed to do what on a server.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.850
And then the CalDAV access protocol
uses iCalendar and WebDAV in order

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.700
to give you the ability to store that data on a server.

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:10.469
CalDAV schedule gives you the ability to-- with
iTIP actually do delivery of scheduling messages.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.700
Now, CalDAV access was made into an RFC
recently, so that's already an internet standard.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.349
CalDAV schedule is starting to wrap up and is
actually very close to getting to that level,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.480
but iCal Server's been supporting these all along.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.939
So, there are a lot of players as I mentioned that are
involved in this space, of course that includes Apple,

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:40.980
but also IBM which is a huge player in calendaring-- Scalix,
Mozilla, Yahoo and Google, Kerio, and so on and so forth.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.939
There's one that's absent here which
I won't mention, but maybe someday.

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:54.500
So, rather than kind of keep doing diagrams and
kind of talking to what theoretically you'll see,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.949
we decided that this is a kind of all best served

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.680
by giving you a nice long extended demo
of all of these in things in action.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.879
But since the demo is a bit long and involved, I'm going
to give you a little background about what you'll see there

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.279
so that when you're following along,
it will be a bit easier.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:11.799
So we're going to follow a day in the life of Cyrus.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.340
Cyrus is an employee at a company called Suits Incorporated.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:19.979
[Laughter] They manufacture suits, they
love suits, they wear them to work everyday.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.850
They are suit business.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.990
They've been at it for a long time, old established company.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.439
However, the economy has been a
little rough on them this past year,

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.639
so they're having a little trouble making ends meet.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:38.939
Cyrus sees the writing on the wall, so he kind of wants
to develop a plan B and starts a new company called Twunk,

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:43.389
and he meets a bunch of kids at Apple's developer
conference and they had started up this company that's going

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.189
to make a Twitter client, 'cause
that's where all the money is.

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:56.129
[Laughter] And they're going to make it for the
iPhone which is hurting for more Twitter clients.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:04.319
So, let's compare these two companies in how they run their
business systems in particular with regards to calendaring.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:09.329
So, the Suits Incorporated network, being
an old company, they run Windows so all

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:12.959
of their employees run, you know, identical looking PCs.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:17.979
They run Windows Vista, and on
there they run Microsoft Outlook.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.100
And of course they've deployed a Microsoft Exchange
2007 Server and they can do all of the calendaring

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.980
and scheduling via that system and it all works great.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:33.370
Now for his side jobs, Cyrus goes over to Twunk.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.259
Twunk of course is a bunch Mac folks.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.599
They've got their Mac computers out there and they run iCal,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.879
and of course they couldn't run an Exchange server
'cause iCal can talk to that, but that's no fun.

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:51.589
So they set up a Mac OS X server system that runs iCal
Server, and iCal Server of course can facilitate all

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:56.369
of their calendaring and scheduling needs via iCal.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.740
So looking at these 2 side to side, you
see that they're actually quite similar.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.379
On one side you've got Windows machines
talking to a Windows based server system,

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:07.839
you've got Mac systems on the other
talking to a Mac server system.

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:10.889
And otherwise, they're fairly identical networks.

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:18.039
So what are the implications of these for Cyrus,
who actually has to live in both environments?

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.629
Well let's say Cyrus is at home and he gets up in the
morning and the family has got an iMac in the house,

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:27.300
so he wants to kind of find out, "Well
OK, what's going on with my day?"

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.949
I wanna see my schedule for both the Suits Inc.

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:36.019
calendar and the Twunk calendar
because they both affect him.

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:42.279
So obviously if he launches iCal, he can speak to
the iCal Server that's running in the Twunk network,

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:47.480
assuming of course that he can get into this
network through their firewall as appropriate.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:53.620
And speaking to that, we've actually added a product
in Snow Leopard Server called the Mobile Access Server

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:59.779
that facilitates that without the need for VPN, which
is obviously a common solution that works pretty well,

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:03.230
but it's a little bit complicated
to set up and a bit involved.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:09.690
Mobile Access Server actually lets you expose services
behind your firewall in a managed fashion to clients

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:15.660
that are outside of your firewall, and that of course
includes mobile clients like laptops and iPhones

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:20.689
and similarly a Mac that's somewhere else on the network.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:29.410
Now, because iCal supports Exchange now, then similarly
he can speak to the network on Suits Incorporated,

00:09:29.409 --> 00:09:32.809
and that's the details of how he gets into that network.

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:37.929
Not really my bailiwick, but there'll
be similar solutions there.

00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:40.909
So from one client, he's got a view of everything there.

00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:45.289
Now let's say that's he's out on the go on a
sales call or something and he's with a customer.

00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:50.529
He doesn't have his computer with him, all he's got is
his cell phone, and of course iPhone 3 includes a client

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:54.309
that can speak to Exchange, actually iPhone 2 had that.

00:09:54.309 --> 00:10:00.349
And then similarly with iPhone 3 again through the Mobile
Access Server, you can reach the iCal Server instance

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:05.690
on the new company's network, and again,
you can see one unified idea of his calendar

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.860
in both situations and know what he has to do with his day.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.800
Finally, if he's out on the go and maybe he's
outside of cellular network reach or whatever,

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:22.599
he can walk into an internet cafe, go to the nearest
airport or whatever and borrow a computer there and they may

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.779
or may not have iCal installed and set up for his needs,
but he can get any standards compliant web browser

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:34.029
and using the new web calendar feature that's in the
calendar server in Snow Leopard, he can once again,

00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:40.319
through the Mobile Access Server get to the iCal Server
inside of that network and get a rich web based UI

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.550
into his calendar, where he cannot only see
what's going on but he can also do editing.

00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:49.599
>> And similarly if you've got, you know,
Microsoft's Outlook web access set up,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.950
you can do a similar thing with Exchange.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.600
Once again, assuming that they've enabled that
and set it up and you can get into the firewall.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:03.620
Now if he sits at his desk at Twunk, obviously iCal
can talk to iCal Server and just like he could at home,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.330
he could speak to the Exchange server at the other company.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.240
Now let's say he goes over to the other place
and now he sits down at his PC and now OK,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.120
well now he's not using an Apple
product, he's running Microsoft Outlook.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.490
And of course we know Microsoft Outlook can
speak to an exchange server, so he's fine there,

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.769
but now he wants to look at his calendar
over running on the iCal Server system

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:28.169
at the other company, and how is he going to do that?

00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:33.990
Well, much like he did at the internet
cafe, he can launch Safari or IE

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:40.710
or another standards-compliant web
browser and get into the network that way.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.170
Now the downside to this of course is, now
this is running Outlook to see one calendar

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:47.019
and he's running his web browser to see the other calendar.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:50.860
And that's not an ideal solution because
you've got two applications and you don't--

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.570
from your web browser, you don't get
alarms and all the functionality you might

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.800
from the native Outlook system on the computer.

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:03.709
Now it turns out that there is a third party company
called ZideOne and they sell a plug-in to Outlook

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:10.710
or they will be selling a plug-in that's in beta
right now, which enables Outlook to speak CalDAV.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.379
Well, we have a CalDAV Server because the A standards.

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:18.740
So, ZideOne can actually get Outlook talking to iCal Server

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.259
and that's actually pretty appealing
if you're an Outlook user.

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:30.539
So-- and regardless of whether Cyrus is at home using
iCal, whether he's out on the go using his iPhone

00:12:30.539 --> 00:12:36.649
or he's at an internet cafe or whatever using a
web browser, whether he's at his desk at Twunk

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:41.840
or whether he's running Microsoft
Office way over on the Suits Inc.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:49.560
network or Safari or at office with ZideOne, he's
got a solution that works everywhere he goes.

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:54.479
So with that, we're going to actually have a
demo and Cyrus is going to come up on stage

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.470
and show you some of these things in action.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.560
>> Okay, thank you Wilfredo.

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:07.059
So, you know, one of the key messages from this presentation
is this idea of ubiquitous calendaring, the ability to see

00:13:07.059 --> 00:13:10.719
and manage and interact with your
calendars on lots of different systems.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.019
So, we saw an example of 4 different
systems that we want to actually look at,

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:18.759
and this demo will take us through some of these areas.

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:24.559
So we're going to be looking at the Windows
desktop, the Mac desktop, the mobile phone,

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:27.519
the iPhone and then the browser situation.

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:34.399
So, let's start at Suits Company
where we have a Windows desktop.

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:39.379
Okay, here we have Outlook 2007 running on Windows

00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:44.389
and it's actually showing me right now
my iCal Server calendar information.

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:46.879
So how did we actually get that on there?

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:51.919
Well, we can go into Outlook's little configuration
panel here and we can pull this up and you can see

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:56.799
that we've actually installed the
ZideOne CalDAV connector for Outlook.

00:13:56.799 --> 00:14:02.789
And with a little bit of configuration, user name and
password, we can get access to our calendar information.

00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:09.509
Another thing to remember about ZideOne is that they also
have a CalDAV connector built into their product as well,

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:13.860
so you can also get access to Address Book
Server information which is, you know,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.399
Address Book Server is one of our
new services in Snow Leopard.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:22.019
So you can get not only calendar information but your
contact information through this plug-in as well.

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:27.639
So let's actually take a look at
Outlook itself and what do we have here.

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:30.019
Well it's just the usual calendar.

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:30.990
We got events on here.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:35.330
We can double click on an event
and bring up the event detail.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.650
We can see that there are several attendees in an event.

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:45.929
We can go to the scheduling panel and Outlook is
actually going out to the CalDAV Server and looking

00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:50.129
up free/busy information for each
of these attendees in real time.

00:14:50.129 --> 00:14:57.960
So let's actually run through a simple scenario
of just creating a meeting on our server.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:04.450
So I'm going to create a meeting,
let's see here at 4 p.m. on Thursday.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:13.740
It's just going to be a very simple meeting in the
office and I want to add some attendees to this meeting.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.240
So I can actually go to the Address
Book that Outlook has here.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.899
Now the Address Book, you know, could come
from Outlook's local contacts database.

00:15:22.899 --> 00:15:26.329
It could come from your Exchange contacts service.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.389
It could come from your Address Book
Server service running on OS X Server.

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:36.819
To add attendees it's just a simple matter of
double clicking the names to add them to the list

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.620
and then I can just click OK and again
in real time, Outlook is going to out,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.779
fetch the free/busy information from the server.

00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:51.159
So, you know, what I can see here is, you know, Thursday
it looks like Wilfredo is out of the office whole day.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:55.240
Probably had a late night Wednesday night at Tommy's
and, you know, he needs to take a break on Thursday.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.909
So, you know, this looks good.

00:15:56.909 --> 00:15:58.750
I think I'll just go ahead and book this meeting,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.159
a very simple process in Outlook
which is click the Send button here.

00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:07.219
Sometimes we have to dismiss a
few outlets that Outlook gives us.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.529
And Outlook also decided to go into offline mode.

00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:14.139
So one more little click here.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.199
Let's try that again.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.730
OK, here we go.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:30.259
Meeting, office scheduling and attendees, it
doesn't take too long to repeat what you have to do.

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:35.960
You don't really want to have to do
things twice but sometimes it happens.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.750
OK, so that meeting was put up on the
iCal Server that Outlook is connected to.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.769
So, you know, for those of you who've used Outlook

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:47.939
with Exchange you might be thinking
well, you know, maybe he's cheating him.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.890
Maybe he's actually connected to an Exchange
Server because this really looks no different

00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:54.090
from the way you would use Outlook with Exchange.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.379
And that's, you know, one of the key
goals, what we're trying to achieve here,

00:16:57.379 --> 00:17:03.230
seamless integration of CalDAV services
with the Exchange interaction on all

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.650
of these desktops and all of these situations.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:16.210
So let's actually go across to the iCal Server
system and take a look at what we see over there.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:24.150
So, OK, so this is iCal on Snow Leopard client.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:29.450
Now what I've done right now is actually
just configured it with an Exchange account.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:35.529
So, one of the major new features in iCal
on Snow Leopard is the Exchange support.

00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:38.250
In addition to the CalDAV support which we had previously,

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.089
we've integrated these technologies together
to give again that seamless experience.

00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:47.750
Using Exchange in iCal should be just the same as using
iCal Server on iCal with the interactions and so on.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:53.660
So what I want to do first is actually set
up an account for my iCal Server on iCal.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:59.070
And again, one of the key things we want to
do with all of our client interactions is just

00:17:59.069 --> 00:18:01.559
to make this as easy as possible for the user.

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:07.099
So now the process of actually configuring
an account in iCal is pretty straightforward.

00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:11.879
Basically, you just need to provide your email
address and your password and iCal will actually go

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.510
and use a suitable order discovery mechanism

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:19.849
to determine what is the Calendar Server that's
appropriate for that particular email address.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:23.769
Now you can if you want, you know, you can
choose the Automatic option and iCal will try all

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:29.619
of the different possibilities suitable or
you can explicitly say CalDAV or Exchange

00:18:29.619 --> 00:18:33.159
and also configure at Google or Yahoo directly.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.630
We're going to stick with automatic
for the time being and I'm just going

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:43.980
to enter my information here, my
email address and my password.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.200
I'm going to click Create.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.769
So iCal is going out.

00:18:47.769 --> 00:18:48.910
It's searching the DNS.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:54.730
It's doing DNS SRV record lookouts to find the
local CalDAV Server for my particular domain

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.960
that returns the host name and port information.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:04.390
So, you know, the service settings information that you see
here, all of this information was automatically determined

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.860
by iCal by doing these DNS queries
or the discovery lookouts.

00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:11.199
So, a very simple process for the end
user to set up and configure accounts.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:19.400
So let's actually look at some of
the data that we have on the server.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:27.420
With both-- with the Exchange support, you know,
we have here an event that was created on Exchange

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:34.210
and this was an event that was the Suits
CEO John was inviting me to a meeting

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.190
and I've got the option of accepting or declining as usual.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:42.980
I'm not actually going to do that at this point because
we're going to see how that works on the iPhone in a minute.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.150
Again, creating-- let's create--
actually create an event on Exchange.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.080
So I got my Exchange calendar set up here.

00:19:48.079 --> 00:19:51.220
I'm going to go in here.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.670
Create another meeting and I want to add some invitees.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.560
So iCal is actually going to use the contact
information from the system that I have here.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:06.119
Remember, Address Book also supports Exchange,
Address Book also supports Address Book Server

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:09.049
and you can have local address information
in Address Book and iCal can pull

00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:11.649
that information from Address Book as well.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:17.540
>> So I already have John configured in my Address
Book, so I can just type a part of his name in there

00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:22.500
and we have an invite ready to send to John, but let's
actually just have a quick look at his availability.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.819
So in iCal, again, I did a free/busy lookup, but
this time it's the Exchange Server that we're dealing

00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:34.470
with so iCal went to Exchange and actually queried
for John's free/busy information for Thursday.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:39.259
And we can see that he was actually free at the time
that we've picked, so this looks-- this looks OK.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:43.140
I'm going to click Done here and
I'm going to send that off to John.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.970
So we just did a very simple scheduling
operation with Exchange.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.110
Let's do the same thing on iCal Server.

00:20:52.109 --> 00:21:02.019
So I'm going to create-- I need to select iCal Server
first over here, and I'm going to create a green meeting.

00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:11.119
So we want to schedule, just to go through the same
process, meeting history and again, I'm going to--

00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:14.419
I want to invite some people that are on my iCal Server.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:21.269
Now in Leopard, iCal actually required the client
machine to be bound to OpenDirectory in order

00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:24.599
for the Attendee Order Completion Facility to work.

00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:30.419
Basically, the directory was providing the user information
to the calendar server, iCal could buy into the directory

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.789
and get that same information and use that
to order complete the addresses of attendees

00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:37.609
that are known to be supported on that Calendar Server.

00:21:37.609 --> 00:21:42.859
Well, one of the things that we changed in Snow Leopard is
to remove the need for the client machines to actually buy

00:21:42.859 --> 00:21:46.369
in to OpenDirectory in order to
get the attendee information.

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:50.629
So this machine is not actually bound to the
directory, but the server is bound to this.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.340
Server still gets its user information from the directory

00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:56.250
but the client machines don't need
to buy into the directory anymore.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:03.000
Instead, what we've done is used facilities in the
WebDAV Protocol to allow the clients to actually search

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.400
through WebDAV to find information
about users on the system.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.210
So in WebDAV, users are each represented by a principal
resource on the server, and there's a query report

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:17.710
that the client can do to actually say, "Tell me about
all the users with a particular name or of these letters"

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.160
that we can do in order to complete operations there.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:26.650
So, if I start typing, iCal is going out to the Calendar
Server, making a query of the Calendar Server in order

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.769
to complete those letters that I type
and it comes back with a few names.

00:22:30.769 --> 00:22:38.319
So again, I can type in several names here, and in real time
we're going to query the server and get that information.

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:43.960
And just like with-- with the Exchange event we just
created, I can pull up the availability information

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.460
and again, get in real time, free/busy
information from iCal Server.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.870
So again, the same process that we can do in Exchange,

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:54.500
we can do exactly the same thing with
our iCal Server, it's no different.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.829
The users don't have to do a context switch.

00:22:56.829 --> 00:22:59.149
In their mind just think "OK, I'm
doing something on Exchange.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.550
I have to do it differently over here or do
something in iCal Server different here."

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:03.329
None of that.

00:23:03.329 --> 00:23:04.220
Everything is the same.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.890
The interactions are the same.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:10.720
So in this case, I'm going to click Done,
we're going to send that meeting off

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:17.420
and the attendees can reply to that in a-- in a usual way.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:23.400
Now, another thing that's different about Snow Leopard
Server is that we now have the ability to schedule

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.970
with users who are not actually hosted by the server itself.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:35.089
So in that particular example, I actually typed in the names
of attendees who are known to be on-- on my Calendar Server.

00:23:35.089 --> 00:23:40.990
But let's say I want to schedule with someone who's-- who
only has a Gmail account, and a Google Calendar account.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.549
Well, we can now do that in Snow Leopard.

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:48.700
So I'm actually going to add the name
of my friend Elisa who I have configured

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.420
in my Address Book with her Gmail account information.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:56.160
So I'm going to add her to that event,
and I'm going to click Update to update

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.410
that event and put that back up on the server.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.910
Now, what's happening in the background is,
iCal is storing that event on the server.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.850
The server is passing out all the attendee information.

00:24:05.849 --> 00:24:09.219
It's spotting that Elisa is not
actually a user hosted by that server.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.779
But we specified an email address for her.

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:17.029
So the server can be clever and create and iMIP message
which is basically an iCalendar attachment imbedded

00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:22.660
in email, it can create that message and actually
send it to Elisa's email account at Gmail.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.920
So let's actually see what Elisa gets to see on her end.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:36.250
So I'm going out live to Google right now, and yup,
we see that there's a new event in Elisa's inbox here.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.960
Let me double-click on that to bring that up.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.470
OK, so we've got information for the event
that we just created and sent to Elisa.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:47.110
So we got a nice big icon there letting her know
exactly when that event is, we got the details, who's--

00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:50.959
who's the organizer, with information
about the other attendees.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.039
Now, Elisa has a couple of choices here.

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:56.769
She has the option of replying
directly from this email message.

00:24:56.769 --> 00:25:03.180
She can say "Yes,"Maybe," or "No" right here in the
email, or she can actually go to her Google Calendar.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:10.000
Now as it turns out, Google's integrated system allows
it to take that iCalendar, attach it from email,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.619
and automatically put it on her calendar.

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:14.139
So it's already on her calendar when she goes to look at it.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.450
And again, if you pull up the details for this event,
she can see all the relevant information about attendees

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:23.819
et cetera, and she can actually
reply directly from her calendar.

00:25:23.819 --> 00:25:30.409
So, what Google is now doing is again creating an
iMIP message which is a reply to the one I sent her,

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.210
but this one contains her new status which is accepted.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:37.500
So that message is winding its way back through
the cloud, back to our server over here.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:47.670
So hopefully, we should actually see that pop up
in iCal depending on how fast email is going today.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.620
We'll wait for that to come through.

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:53.839
In the meantime, we're going to
talk about another feature of iCal.

00:25:53.839 --> 00:26:01.189
One of the additional features that we added is the
ability for attendees to provide private comments back

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.970
to the organizer when they're replying to events.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:10.079
So for example, let's see, I put an
event here that I had created and Morgan

00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:12.559
and Wilfredo were both invited to this event.

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:17.599
Now, Morgan actually declined this event and he actually
sent me a comment to explain why he was declining the event.

00:26:17.599 --> 00:26:20.069
He has to go pick up his kids.

00:26:20.069 --> 00:26:25.539
Wilfredo accepted the event and-- but he also sent me back
a comment saying that he was going to have to leave halfway

00:26:25.539 --> 00:26:29.809
through the event 'cause he has to go fly to Vegas
for a business meeting or a poker game or something.

00:26:29.809 --> 00:26:34.240
So you know, these are comments that
attendees are sending to the organizer.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.900
Now, other attendees don't get to see these comments.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:43.160
It's only the attendee and organizer pair, those two
people that actually get to see this particular comment.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.300
The actual process of sending a
comment to an organizer is very simple.

00:26:47.299 --> 00:26:52.779
So here I have a meeting that was proposed by
the CEO Chris, and he invited me to this meeting.

00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:57.869
I haven't replied to it yet but I'd
like to just send a comment back to him,

00:26:57.869 --> 00:27:00.659
so what are we going to say, "Good idea."

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:07.860
OK, so I can just type my comment in and I can click Accept,
and that comment and that reply is now going back to Chris

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:12.339
and in just the same way that we saw
Wilfredo's and Morgan's comments in this event,

00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:16.069
Chris will see my comment coming back in his event.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:18.480
So let's see.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.430
Oh, well, Elisa's reply has just come back in.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.980
We see a green check mark next to Elisa.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.099
And so that email message we sent out to Gmail
with the iCalendar attachment, she replied to,

00:27:27.099 --> 00:27:32.869
has made its way back to our server and iCal
Server with its new feature took that email in,

00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:36.869
passed out the iCalendar information, figured
out that Elisa said she was accepting the meeting

00:27:36.869 --> 00:27:39.149
and it updated my calendar automatically for me.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.580
So her participation status is automatically covered.

00:27:41.579 --> 00:27:47.960
So we can schedule with people, not just on
our server, but on the other systems as well.

00:27:51.099 --> 00:27:52.939
[Background applause] And you know, this should work on--

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.019
with pretty much any system that knows how to handle
the iMIP protocol, and that's pretty much you know,

00:27:57.019 --> 00:27:59.660
most email calendar systems that are integrated together.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:05.540
So Google, Yahoo, Outlook and Exchange
can also do iMIP scheduling if needed.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:10.049
So let's look at a couple of other
features that have been added to iCal.

00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:15.139
One thing we can do in iCal, we have this
Inspector Window, we can drag these windows off

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.780
and we can actually have multiple
Inspector Windows open at the same time

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:21.899
so that we can see [background applause] multiple events.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:28.240
And another option that we have is if we go
to the Edit menu, we have this Show Inspector

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.269
which gives us a Floating Inspector Window,
so that now, as you select different events

00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:36.839
that stays updated [background applause] and
synchronized with the event you're looking at.

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:46.670
And one more feature that we have in iCal, let me--
let's take a look at this event here that I proposed.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:50.269
I'm going to look at the free/busy information for Friday.

00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:56.009
Now, if you look at the top row here, this is my free/busy
information, and you can see it shows me as free all day.

00:28:56.009 --> 00:28:58.950
But let's say I needed to go on vacation that day.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.150
I'd like to actually block that time out for everyone.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:08.340
A simple option to do that might be to go in
here and create an All Day Event, vacation.

00:29:08.339 --> 00:29:12.819
So if I go and do that, and I go back here and
look at my free/busy information, what do I see?

00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:14.980
Well, it's still showing me as free.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.910
So something didn't work quite right there.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:24.440
So what's actually happening here is that by default,
iCal actually creates All Day Events as being free.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.130
That's the behavior in Leopard and
that's the behavior in Snow Leopard.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:33.890
What's new in Snow Leopard is that you now have
the option to actually mark events as free or busy.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.930
So they can be free or blocking-time busy.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:43.750
Again, by default, All Day Events are marked as
free, and by default, Timed Events come up as busy.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.910
[Background applause] So it's a very simple
process for me to block the whole day.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:55.230
I can just mark this event as busy, click
Done, and if I go and pull up the availability,

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.130
you see that I'm now blocked out for this entire day.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.050
So a very simple process to manage
the free/busy information.

00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:08.470
So those are some of the key features that we have for
Snow Leopard, iCal Plan [phonetic], we have the integration

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.789
with Exchange, we have the new
CalDAV-scheduling support that's built in.

00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:16.789
I mean a lot of the work that's involved there is kind
of under the hood, but we have some of these new--

00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:25.619
new UI features and new user interaction capabilities to
enhance the calendaring experience for iCal on the desktop.

00:30:25.619 --> 00:30:27.199
>> So where do you want to go next?

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:33.519
Well, we've been to our Suits Office and we've been to our
Twunk Office you know, it's kind of the end of the day.

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:37.440
I need to, you know, hop on the
commute bus back into the city,

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.450
but I've got a few things I'd like to check on my calendar.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.069
So how am I going to do that?

00:30:41.069 --> 00:30:45.009
Well, let's go over to iPhone.

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:50.539
[ Pause ]

00:30:50.539 --> 00:30:52.569
>> OK, so we have iPhone.

00:30:52.569 --> 00:30:54.789
This is running iPhone 3.0.

00:30:54.789 --> 00:31:02.319
Now in iPhone 1.0 and 2.0, you were able to
actually synchronize your CalDAV Calendars

00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:07.029
with the iPhone using iTunes and a cable to connect the two.

00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:09.039
You can see that little cable here.

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:18.000
Well, good news, I can pull this cable out, I can, you
know, throw it away, and we can now do CalDAV on the iPhone,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.630
over the air, talking directly to the server.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.860
We don't need that tethering when-- [applause].

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.910
So we can change events.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:27.800
We can modify events.

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:31.930
We can see events, changes, get propagated to the phone.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.840
We can see all that over the air, no need for tethered sync.

00:31:35.839 --> 00:31:41.169
So let's actually pull up our calendar here,
and I'm going to go to our calendar view.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.590
So again, in iPhone 2.0, we had Exchange support.

00:31:45.589 --> 00:31:53.149
So here, we have an Exchange account that's set up and we
also have our new Twunk CalDAV accounts of that as well.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:59.970
And iPhone lets us aggregate the view of all these
calendars, so I can click the All Calendars option.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:09.660
And now I'm seeing the same events that we saw in iCal
where the Exchange is in red and Twunk iCal Server events

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.230
in green, and these events showing up in
the same way that we get on the desktop.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:18.789
We get the same view on the phone, again, the
seamless integration, ubiquitous calendaring approach.

00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:21.710
So let's actually take a look at one of these events.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.930
So this is an event on the Exchange Server.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.779
Again, it's-- that's the event that
was booked by the CEO for breakfast.

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:32.000
We can see information about you
know, who is invited to this event.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.660
We've got information about availability.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.519
We can set our own alarms.

00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:43.420
And at the bottom here, we have the option of
responding to the event with a suitable response.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:49.140
So I'm just going to click Accept here, and the
phone again, is going out to the Exchange Server,

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.590
sending that response back through Exchange, and we'll see
that information get updated on the Exchange site as well.

00:32:54.589 --> 00:32:59.740
So let's say I want to create a
simple event on my iCal Server now.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:05.890
So I'm going to go in here and just
click the plus-sign and I'm just going

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:15.960
to create a very simple event I
need to-- OK, pick up dinner.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.549
OK, so I'm done.

00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:21.619
OK, let's see, what time-- well I need
to do that probably in the evening.

00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:24.619
So I'm going to make this not too late in the evening.

00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:27.199
OK, 6 p.m. when I'm going home,
I got to remember to do that.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:34.240
Click down, yeah, I probably need to set myself
on the left, OK, 15 minutes, click down on there.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.359
OK, everything else looks OK.

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:37.919
Yeah, that's in the right calendar, I can click Done.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:45.950
So that event 6 p.m. on Thursday, we just created
that on the phone to upload it to iCal server.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.940
So let's see, did we actually get that over here?

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:55.140
Let's go back to our iCal and yes, here we
go, we've got that Pick Up Dinner Event.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:00.290
We created it on the iPhone, went out to the
iCal Server, any CalDAV client has connected

00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:05.099
that iCal Server will be able to see that event
update, and it will come back down to those clients.

00:34:05.099 --> 00:34:07.980
And again, we have a consistent view of our calendars.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.490
We get, you know, updates in real time.

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:16.869
We have push notification system built into Snow
Leopard, again, another new feature that allows us

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:19.849
to push these updates to our iCal on the desktop.

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:24.860
So rather than iCal having to pull, the
information comes in almost immediately.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:34.860
So [applause]-- so that's our iPhone solution.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:40.019
We're, you know, we're very happy to see CalDAV on
a mobile device, probably the first CalDAV solution

00:34:40.019 --> 00:34:47.750
for our mobile device and we hope to see many
more people using CalDAV on mobile devices.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:53.030
But let's say that, you know, I got my-- I'm
traveling home, and I'm at internet cafe and,

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.440
you know, oh dear, I left my iPhone on the bus.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.480
Well, I could use the fancy new MobileMe to find my iPhone
but it's, you know, it's on its way to some other town.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.360
So, I'm going to have to do something
else to access my calendars right now.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:10.990
Well, the internet cafe that I'm at
has, you know, a Windows workstation.

00:35:10.989 --> 00:35:15.219
So here we are in Windows, I need to get
access to my iCal Server Calendars again.

00:35:15.219 --> 00:35:18.779
Well, we have our new web calendar
in iCal Server on Snow Leopard.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:24.530
So I can just go in here, fortunately, for me I
already had a bookmark set up for this but, you know,

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.470
it's a pretty simple process to type
in the URL to get to your calendar

00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:30.309
on the Calendar Server and type
in your username and password.

00:35:30.309 --> 00:35:37.900
And then again, we have all the calendar information that we
got before, we're now seeing this again in the Web Calendar.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.570
So the Web Calendar, yeah, we designed
to give you, you know,

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:45.280
an experience that's pretty much the same
as what you get on iCalendar desktop

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.510
So let's go in and do same operation what we did before.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.960
We want to create a meeting here,
so let's do something on Friday.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.119
So I'm going to double-click here.

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:57.239
I can type in the title.

00:35:57.239 --> 00:36:01.509
I'm not being very creative with titles
right now, and the office location.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.020
So that's fairly straightforward.

00:36:03.019 --> 00:36:05.969
And then we have our attendee panel.

00:36:05.969 --> 00:36:12.480
So again, because we have attendee with-- because the
server can provide attendee information to the client,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:17.880
our web client can actually go back to iCal Server and
make requests of it to do its order complete for attendees.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.490
So again, as I-- if I get the names
right, OK, so Wilfredo Sanchez.

00:36:22.489 --> 00:36:26.869
So I can start typing and the web
client is going out to the iCal Server,

00:36:26.869 --> 00:36:28.739
order completing that, getting the results back.

00:36:28.739 --> 00:36:39.939
So again, it's a very simple process to type in attendee
names, Chris... Bill is out and get them in there.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:45.970
And again, the web client just like iCal, is
going out to the server and getting the free

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:48.789
and busy information for those users in real-time.

00:36:48.789 --> 00:36:55.000
So again, we can see, you know, for Friday-- well, I
was on vacation that day, but if we go back to Thursday,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.150
well we see little bit more detail on the free/Busy
information for the events that those folks have got booked.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:07.500
And again [applause], I'm actually
going to go at least on the Friday.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.719
So it will be a little bit clearer when
we look at it over on the iCal side.

00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:15.409
OK, so I just went and booked that
event over there in the Web Calendar.

00:37:15.409 --> 00:37:21.899
Now if I go back to iCal, well, here's the
event that we just created in the Web Calendar.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:28.360
Again, just like-- on the phone, we created an event, push
it up to the server, all of the CalDAV plans accessing

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:34.840
that calendar information, they get
to see the updates in real time.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.710
So that's basically it.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.500
The key here is ubiquitous calendaring.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.360
Calendaring on what's the different
platforms and lots of different scenarios.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.519
Our goal, you know, as calendar vendors, you know,
one of our goals is to satisfy the needs of users,

00:37:47.519 --> 00:37:51.800
and users want to be able to get access to their
calendar data wherever they are, whatever the time is,

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:57.200
they want responsiveness from their calendar
system, and they want to be able to interact with it

00:37:57.199 --> 00:37:59.869
to get free/busy inforamtion and
to schedule with other users.

00:37:59.869 --> 00:38:03.659
And we certainly believe with the--
Snow Leopard Calendaring solutions

00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:06.099
that we've gone a long way to addressing those requirements.

00:38:06.099 --> 00:38:08.110
So with that, I'd like to hand it back to Wilfredo.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.670
>> I mean, I know a lot of you folks are in the IT world.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:15.309
And you can imagine that for that demo there were
an awful lot of moving parts there, all right.

00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:17.789
I mean, we were looking at a lot of stuff here.

00:38:17.789 --> 00:38:23.539
We were looking at iCal, talking to
CalDAV Servers, and to Exchange Servers.

00:38:23.539 --> 00:38:27.590
We saw the iPhone talking to CalDAV
Servers and Exchange Servers.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:32.280
We saw iCal Server 2 and the Web
Calendar feature that's new in there

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:42.160
that gives you a full reach calendar experience
on a standards-based web browser or IE.

00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:44.039
We saw Safari 4 in action.

00:38:44.039 --> 00:38:46.469
We saw the Mobile Access Server kind of in play.

00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:52.409
So there's a lot of stuff going on here that all
kind of glues all of these together and the joy

00:38:52.409 --> 00:38:56.670
of standards is that all of this stuff works together.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:01.550
So again, regardless of what Cyrus was, if
he was using his iPhone or iCal, whatever,

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:06.890
it can either talk to the Exchange Server or it could
talk the iCal Server and all of the stuff plays nicely.

00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:10.089
The idea here is Apple is once again,
isn't trying to walk you into anything.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.950
Whatever environment you want to
live in, we'll be there for you.

00:39:12.949 --> 00:39:20.099
So let me give you some updates on what's new
since the last time we talked about this stuff.

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:22.940
So in iCal Server 2, we have a few things.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:27.200
One is we've got attendee lookup support, made
have we [phonetic] over HTTP Protocol now.

00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:32.449
What this means is that clients no longer
have to buy into Open Directory and do lookups

00:39:32.449 --> 00:39:37.250
through the directory services
API in order to look up attendees.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:42.639
That's much easier for setting up your clients and it's
way easier for your mobile clients that need to setup

00:39:42.639 --> 00:39:50.319
out on the open network because setting OD when you're
outside the firewall isn't the easiest thing in the world.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.660
Also very cool is we got rid of Services Locators and those
weird schema extensions that we had in the directory systems

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:58.579
that made it harder for you to
set up your directory especially

00:39:58.579 --> 00:40:05.989
if you are coming in from an OD Environment [applause].

00:40:05.989 --> 00:40:08.609
We worked really hard on performance in Snow Leopard.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.590
It's kind of the feel on the client's side.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:14.460
We took that to heart and the server side as well.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:20.789
>> And, you know, in Leopard, we could deploy those small
businesses and was a decent solution there, but frankly,

00:40:20.789 --> 00:40:24.469
like when you try to scale it a very
large business, it didn't work out.

00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:31.859
So we decided to suck it up and we were going to make
this work until we could deploy all of Apple worldwide.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.710
All of our employees are now using
iCal Server as of 2 weeks ago.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:39.949
We shut down Meeting Maker which we've been using for like
15-plus years and are now living on iCal Server [applause].

00:40:39.949 --> 00:40:51.549
Now if you want more of the scoop on that, you can head us
up at the lab, which is going to be downstairs after this.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:56.220
But short answer, running on one server
because we don't have clustering yet,

00:40:56.219 --> 00:41:01.449
so one server supports the entire company.

00:41:01.449 --> 00:41:06.269
Now, also on this server, we've got improved
client data validation, which you know,

00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:10.199
is important from the standards point of view because
you don't want a client putting data onto the server

00:41:10.199 --> 00:41:12.449
that another client is going to get confused by.

00:41:12.449 --> 00:41:16.559
So iCal Server is being a little more careful
about checking the data that's coming in.

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:22.000
We've added support for-- we call them Implicit
Scheduling which is a very fundamental change

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.159
in the CalDAV Scheduling Protocol that
happened since we shipped Leopard until now.

00:41:28.159 --> 00:41:32.779
And that was actually a change that we drove
pretty hard, and basically moved a lot of the logic

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.830
for scheduling from the client down to the server.

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:37.679
And that means a few things.

00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:42.879
One is that the implementation for the scheduling
logic is in one place, so that if there are bugs,

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.460
we can kind of rule that out as a server
update, and you can update your server rather

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.150
than updating having many thousand
clients you've got out in your network.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:54.730
It also means that there's only one implementation,
therefore, it agrees with itself as supposed

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.869
to different clients implementing the same logic

00:41:56.869 --> 00:42:04.539
and having slightly different interpretations,
possibly correct ones of the standard.

00:42:04.539 --> 00:42:08.090
We've also added Server-to-Client push notifications.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:13.620
This is based on the XMPP Protocol, and we've
added email invitations and use the Web Calendar.

00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:15.900
I'll get into these little more detail.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.150
Again, in implicit scheduling,
there's a big change in CalDAV.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:23.099
One of the other effects of doing this is
that it makes it easier to write a client,

00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:27.099
because you don't have to do the scheduling
work in the client, it's all on the server.

00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:32.630
The web client which is all done in JavaScript, now
we don't have to load up all of the scheduling logic

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:39.869
into your browser, it just edits the event and
the server magically takes care of the rest.

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:46.190
This also means that consistency on the server is
improved because if a client does some of the operations

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.539
but not others, you can kind of
get into an inconsistent state.

00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:51.179
Now, because the server is doing it,
we can kind of have a better guarantee

00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:54.799
that all of access is going to be consistent.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:01.480
And again, with Leopard, if I invited a hundred people
to a meeting, the attendees aren't going to know

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.610
about each other's participation status
until iCal sends updates to everybody.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.620
And in order to avoid doing a lot of
messaging, it doesn't do that very often.

00:43:09.619 --> 00:43:13.519
Now that the server is managing that,
everybody gets an update right away.

00:43:13.519 --> 00:43:16.820
And this actually helped a lot with the email invitations.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.400
The Server-to-Client Notifications
eliminate the need for iCal

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.309
to repeatedly pull the server,
"Hey, do I have any new meetings?

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:24.380
How about now?

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.840
How about now?

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.480
No? OK, how about now?"

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.769
And so, now the server says, "Hey, iCal, now is
a good time for you to check up for new meetings

00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:38.259
because we have new data for you," and that helps with
server load, and it also helps with the user experience,

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.690
because it feels a lot more real-time for the user
when they get notifications right away as supposed

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.300
to next time iCal gets around to checking.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:51.720
But a user Web Calendar-- now we had a Web Calendar
in Leopard but it was kind of limited to groups.

00:43:51.719 --> 00:43:56.899
Now every user can log in and they can edit meetings and
schedule, and as you saw that was a very rich experience,

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.490
you can do free/busy lookups, you can
actually do all of the things you can do

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:05.169
in iCal, but now you can do them all on the web.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:11.010
Email invitations allow you to invite people who
are not on your server to a meeting, and as you saw,

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:15.570
Cyrus invited somebody who had a Google account, but
similarly, you can do the same thing with a Yahoo account

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:22.240
or somebody who's using Outlook at whatever email system
they're using because most calendar agents out there

00:44:22.239 --> 00:44:29.089
in the world already understand iMIP and almost all of them
understand iTIP so that they can get these attachments,

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:34.630
open them up and then in that calendar agent, you
can reply "Yes" or "No" or "Maybe" to the meeting.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:37.970
Now, we went through some effort
to make those emails look pretty.

00:44:37.969 --> 00:44:40.629
So as you saw, there's an HTML formatted message in there.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:46.349
There is also a plain text alternative,
and then you've got the attachment.

00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:53.110
Most mail agents will process that for you and the
replies that come back actually don't go back to iCal

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.780
or to your email client and then to iCal.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:59.769
They go back straight to the server which because of
implicit scheduling needs that the server can then process

00:44:59.769 --> 00:45:02.590
that and then update everybody's status immediately.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.539
So everybody knows what's going on.

00:45:04.539 --> 00:45:13.110
So this is what that looks like in Apple's Mail
Client, rendered in WebKit, so embedded you there.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.289
This is what it looks like in Gmail.

00:45:15.289 --> 00:45:16.309
Again, it's pretty similar.

00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:19.980
Gmail gives you a little effort
to accept that right in there.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:26.260
And in Apple's Mail, you can actually have them
automatically forward, straight into iCal for you.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.600
Now, there are some other features in Snow Leopard
Server that are relevant to the calendaring space.

00:45:30.599 --> 00:45:32.750
One of them is the Wiki Calendars.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:38.769
Of course, we got this whole Wiki, this-- the user Web
Calendar came from the Wiki Calendar implementation.

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:42.409
And now you've got User Calendars in that product as well.

00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:48.699
And again, that's much richer with scheduling
and real editing of calendar events.

00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:53.179
But notifications server, the "push"
notification server, that's push--

00:45:53.179 --> 00:45:57.750
that's included in Snow Leopard servers is what
we use in order to send those XMPP messages

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:00.730
to make the experience more real-time for our users.

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:08.670
The Mobile Access Server gives you access to manage-- access
to things inside of your firewall, where you can restrict it

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:12.000
to certain users, and other certain conditions.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.349
And we've integrated entirely with the mail servers.

00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:18.989
So that when you configure iCal
Server, it just sets up iCal within a--

00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:22.969
sets up mail with an account that we can
do this email delivery stuff-- stuff was.

00:46:22.969 --> 00:46:30.589
If you're not using our built-in Mail Server, you can set
up, you know, configure IMAP and SMTP for iCal Servers

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:33.010
to use in order to facilitate all of that as well.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.650
So again, it's all standard based.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:40.650
iCal has got a whole bunch of new stuff for you as well.

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:45.570
We've-- they've done a lot of work to support this
implicit scheduling work that we've been doing to make

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:50.690
that flow better in the-- in the
user experience on the client's side.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.809
They of course, have to have support for
these push notifications and subscribe

00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:55.989
to them in order to take advantage of that.

00:46:55.989 --> 00:47:00.819
And again, they are now doing these attendee
lookups via CalDAV and not through Open Directory

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:04.170
which allows you not to have to bind to-- to an OD Server.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:08.200
They've added support for this
attendee comments and Cyrus demoed that.

00:47:08.199 --> 00:47:11.859
So now you can reply to a meeting that
I organized and I just see that message,

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.740
and it's not shared with all the other attendees
so you can explain why it is you can't come

00:47:15.739 --> 00:47:19.739
to a meeting or any other comments you have about it.

00:47:19.739 --> 00:47:23.549
iCal supports now-- supports Exchange like the iPhone does.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:31.289
It's got a much simpler experience for setting up your
account in the first place, including built-in support

00:47:31.289 --> 00:47:37.519
for Yahoo and Google calendars as well as Exchange,
and the entire application is a 64-bit top to bottom,

00:47:37.519 --> 00:47:43.519
which is one of the key goals in Snow
Leopard on the client in general.

00:47:43.519 --> 00:47:50.400
iPhone Version 3, of course, now facilitates access
to CalDAV which for us means good news on iCal Server.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:58.730
So for more information on all of this, you can head up Mark
Malone, and he can fill you in on any questions you have

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:02.619
after this session, and for training
information, go to training.apple.com.
