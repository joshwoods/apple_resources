00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.009
>> Sarah Laiwals: Welcome to Session 208:
Creating Safari Web applications with Dashcode.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.080
I'm Sarah Laiwala, one of the engineers on Dashcode,

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.959
and Sarah Oddwala is what my manager
just changed my last name to.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.579
But-- and that will be a crack at
my bad jokes I was going to put in.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.429
OK so let's go ahead and begin
with a quick history of Dashcode.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.200
Back in the Leopard days we presented Dashcode 1.0,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.820
where you could create Dashboard
widgets very easily using our templates.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.369
Last year, we released Dashcode 2.0, where
you could create iPhone web applications.

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.959
One of the biggest features that
we added was that you could run

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.090
and debug your iPhone web application
directly into-- in the iPhone simulator.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:12.670
So this year, we've decided to bring all of the powerful
tools like the JavaScript debugger, the ability,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.490
the control you have when designing your user
interface and bring to you Safari web applications.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:21.519
Clap please.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:23.200
[Applause] Thank you.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.540
Thank you.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.450
So what exactly is new in Dashcode 3.0?

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.000
Well, you can now create Safari web applications
and iPhone web applications in 1 project in 1 IDE.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.329
You can use our cool new templates like
the podcast template, the RSS template,

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:50.259
the browser template to get you started and they'll
run in the browser simulator and if you need

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.910
to inspect the elements on your page
you can use the WebKit inspector

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.659
that we've embedded directly into the browser simulator.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:06.129
So as you all may know HTML 5 and CSS 3
have gained a lot of traction this year.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:13.280
Safari 4 has done an incredible job
embracing these features and so have we.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.509
We now give you the ability to create offline web
applications so that when your browser is online it caches

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:24.729
and synchronizes the data so that when you're
offline your browser knows what to render.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:32.879
We've also added support for the video tab which
works similarly to the way image tags work for images

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.169
but we've made this is as easy as dragging
and dropping a video directly into Dashcode.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:45.030
Now this is better than plug-ins because you can
apply CSS effects like reflections and transformations

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.939
to your video and you can also overlay elements.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.229
Now, I just mentioned CSS effects.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:03:00.079
Dashcode now has support for reflections,
transitions, animations, transforms.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.620
So take the reflections for example.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.370
In the inspector you can visually set the
reflection that you want on a particular element.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.560
We've also added support for transitions in our
stack layout part so that when you go from 1 view

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.259
to another you can set the transition
that you want just from the inspector.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.849
Now I just mentioned parts.

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.769
So what are the new UI parts?

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.900
Well, we've added the split layout part.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.180
You can use the divider here to set the area of the view.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.370
We've also added the grid layout part.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:42.219
So if you have a collection of items like
images or video you can put them into a grid.

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.669
And list, that's new to Safari web applications.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.459
We've added features to the list like keyboard navigation.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.689
You can use the up and down arrow
to go up and down the list.

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.000
We've also added multiple and empty list selections.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.280
And one of the coolest, the most mind blowing feature
that we've added to Dashcode which Max Drukman showed you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.490
at the DT State of the Union is bindings where we take
your JSON and XLM formatted data and put that directly

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.889
into your web application without
you having to write any code.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.889
[Applause] Thank you.

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.009
So let me give you a brief tour of Dashcode.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:34.629
[ Background sounds ]

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.740
>> Sarah Laiwala: So when you launch Dashcode
you're greeted with the template chooser,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.009
where you can create Dashboard widgets or web applications.

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.670
You can create 2 types of web applications:
Safari, Mobile Safari, or both.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.770
And we've provided 5 new templates for you to do
that which come with both types of web applications.

00:04:55.769 --> 00:05:00.089
So let's go ahead and create a podcast project.

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:06.939
This big area right here is what we call the canvas
where you can visually design your user interface.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:14.969
You can resize the elements on your page or you can use
the parts library to drive more elements to the canvas.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.510
This right here is what we call the navigator,
which is just a list of dom elements.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:27.829
So if I click Title for example in the navigator
the selection is reflected in the canvas and at last

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:33.349
in the bottom left corner is what
we have what we call workflow steps.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.170
So if you were creating a web application from
scratch and you didn't know where to start from,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.790
we help you, we guide you through doing that.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.069
So what's the first thing I need to do here?

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:51.120
If I were using the workflow steps it says to create-- set
the source podcast for your widget and I can click this Go

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.620
To button here which takes me to the application attributes.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.759
So in the application attributes all
I need to do is enter my feed URL

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.459
because this podcast template is pretty much ready to go.

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:07.629
I just need to add my tiny bit of customization.

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:16.949
So I'm just going to grab a feed from the Science
Friday website which looks like this and I'll go ahead

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:24.289
and select the XML feed here, let me
show you what that would look like.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:32.460
Looks like that and we'll now go into Dashcode and
we'll just enter that into the podcast URL feed.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:38.310
Now one thing that we need to remember here is that web
applications have a same-origin restriction which means

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.439
that your data must come from your server
that your web application is hosted on.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:50.149
So when I hit Run, Dashcode is going to ask me whether
I want to simulate running on this domain and I'm going

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:56.120
to go ahead and say yes because I want Dashcode to
bypass that restriction in the browser simulator.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.170
So when I hit Run my podcast project
appears in the browser simulator.
