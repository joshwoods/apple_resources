00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.880
>> Michael: Good morning.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.760
My name's Michael Lopp and it's a pleasure
to be back here at WWDC talking with you

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.440
about leveraging web content in
Max OS X applications with WebKit.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.830
As I said, my name's Michael Lopp, I run the online store.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.500
And this is what the online store looks like,
in case you haven't had a chance to see it.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.460
This is web content and let's go ahead and leverage it.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.719
There; what we're going to do here, the story,
the story behind this presentation starts

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.979
with Sting, if you can believe it or not.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.909
This is a feature that's in GarageBand that we
announced in MacWorld called Artist Lessons.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:05.269
And last summer we came, GarageBand team came to us and they
said, hey we want to do this feature called Artist Lessons.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.969
And what it was, if you guys don't know is, this is
an amazing feature inside of GarageBand where Sting

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.329
and other artists actually teach
you how to play these songs.

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.179
And it's beautiful high, high production
quality, gorgeous applications.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.700
Now Online Store Music Lessons, what's going on here?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.100
What they wanted to do, they have some very successful
requirements, they wanted, these files are really big.

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.609
They're like half a gig to a gig and a half in size.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.849
And that means they weren't going to
get them all on the High Life DVD.

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.739
The other thing is they want to charge for them, obviously.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.829
And the other thing was they were
going to constantly have new ones.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.539
The fourth thing was what they wanted to do is
they actually wanted to embed the experience

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.080
of merchandising and browsing inside of the application.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.200
They wanted to not have it be a jarring
jump into another application experience.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.760
And so that's what we did for them.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.840
This is the Lesson Store.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.840
And this is the media browser inside of GarageBand.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.210
And if we've done our job well, you will not
know that everything over there on the right,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.210
everything in the black box is the same
thing as you were seeing on that first slide

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.050
that I told you, showed you, the white page.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.800
That's the store.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.830
We embedded it.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.790
We did some amazing things with WebKit, and we did some
amazing technology that we guys want to talk about today.

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:34.439
The nice thing about this is you stay
inside of GarageBand the entire time.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.300
You're purchasing, you're downloading,
everything happens inside of GarageBand

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.910
It's a really beautiful user experience.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.479
And the reason, what we're going to talk about
today is actually what we learned as part

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.530
of this process of embedding this store inside of it.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.969
What's happening that's really
cool is that platforms are merging.

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:59.359
On one side you've got Cocoa; on
the other side you've got the Web.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.320
And what we're able to do, thanks to a lot of technologies
that we're, Apple's producing, is you can start to pick

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.509
and choose the respective parts to build something new.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:15.139
The GarageBand browser is Cocoa, it's gorgeous, it's
beautiful, and it's the store all working together.

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.509
And again, you probably will never notice when you're
coming, or when you're leaving, or coming inside of it.
