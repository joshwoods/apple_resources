00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.269
>> Good afternoon.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.009
My name is Emilie.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.760
I'm an Automator Software Engineer.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.570
And I'd first of all, I'd like to thank DJ Jason in the
back for the great music that you heard before this session.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.390
Thanks, Jason.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.420
Great way to start off the last session of the week.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.350
So for those of you who maybe are just
sitting in here looking for a place

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.660
to check your email before you
catch your flights home today,

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.589
the first thing I'm going to talk
about is what Automator is.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.640
So we'll catch you guys up.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.609
And those of you who already familiar with Automator
can just kind of sit back and relax a little bit.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.570
Though, I will be talking about what's new in Snow
Leopard, so maybe you should pay a little bit of attention.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.480
After that, we'll be talking about how you can take
Automator workflows and add them to your application.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.569
Therefore, extending your application's functionality
and enabling your users to customize your application.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.590
After that, we'll be talking about how you can
take your application's functionality and put them

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.260
into Automator Actions, and then use those actions
to put your application into the rest of the system.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.480
So first, let's go back and talk about Automator.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.570
What is Automator?

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:22.279
Aside from arguably being the coolest icon
on the system, Automator is an application

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.810
in that first shipped with Mac OS 10.4 Tiger.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.240
And it's an application that you
use to automate repetitive tasks.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:32.299
Once you're able to automate these
tasks, you can then customize your system

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.689
to pretty much do whatever you want it to do.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.670
The terminology we'll be using in this session is workflow.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.969
An Automator workflow is the process
of actually accomplishing this task,

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.539
and you do this by stringing together
a bunch of Automator Actions.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.050
This is kind of similar to UNIX pipes.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.549
How you have a bunch of commands and
you string them together using pipes.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.590
So let's take a look at Automator.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.950
This is a screen shot.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.710
On the right side of the screen, you'll see that
there is a workflow view and that contains a workflow,

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.539
which is, if you recall, the act of
actually accomplishing this automated task.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.969
And then you have a bunch of actions
that are strung together in the workflow.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.270
Now, once you have an Automator
workflow what can you do with it?

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.090
Clearly you can run it inside of Automator, but you can also
run it in many other places as a stand-alone application,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.550
in the Finder, as an iCal plug-in,
or maybe even a print PDF plug-in,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.090
so when you save as PDF you can
actually run a workflow on that.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.200
Also in Snow Leopard, we've added the ability to make
workflows into Services, which you probably have heard a lot

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.759
about during the week and we'll talk more about that.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:35.049
So to create these different kinds of workflows
we've added a new Template Chooser in Automator

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.010
as you can see here enumerating the different
kinds of workflows that you can create.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.349
And I'd like to draw your attention
to the Services one for just a second.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.849
If you recall, Services in Leopard and prior versions
of Mac OS X were kind of not so great to use.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.840
They're supposed to be very contextual
and relevant to what you had selected.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.370
For example, if you had the Text Creating
Service, this is so easy even a manager can do it.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.360
To run a service on this you would have to go.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.620
I see we have a lot of disgruntled employees here.
