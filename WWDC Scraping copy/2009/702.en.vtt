WEBVTT

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.639
>> So, my name is Max Muller.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.649
I'm the Director of the iTunes
Store Content Engineering Group.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:22.719
It's my group's responsibility for building all the
infrastructure, for handling all things content.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:29.469
From music to TV shows to movies to this
new wee little phenomenon called apps.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.060
Before we get started, I would just like to say thank you.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.300
The App Store hasn't even been live for a year and already
customers have downloaded over a billion applications.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.989
We've already had over 50 thousand applications published.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.010
So to all the developers out there that
made this possible, thank you very much.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.189
[ Applause ]

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:57.379
And for those of you that are now ready to jump on
the bandwagon, well, you've come to the right session.

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.679
So today, we're going to be covering three topics.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.980
The first is the process for publishing
a new application to the App Store.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.859
Second, we're going to look at how you add
In App Purchase items to an application.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.200
And finally, we're going to look at
some of the tools available for you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.810
to manage your applications once
they're live on the App Store.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.129
So jumping right into it, to publish a new app
to the App Store is a simple five-step process.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:33.009
The first step is to set up an account in iTunes Connect.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:41.780
iTunes Connect is your online web portal for managing
your presence and your applications within the App Store.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.739
The prerequisite to getting an account at iTunes Connect is

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:49.169
that you must first be a member of
the paid iPhone Developer program.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.079
Once you've gone through that process, your account
will automatically be set up for you in iTunes Connect.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.989
You get to iTunes Connect at itunesconnect.apple.com.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.359
Now one thing we want to call out
specifically this year is for those of you

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.530
that are interested in paid application distribution.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.439
We want you to start filling out your contracts, banking,
and tax forms as soon as you have access to iTunes Connect.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.829
Don't wait until you have an approved
application to start filling out those forms,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.150
as this will just add unnecessary
delay in getting your application live.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.819
The second thing, we want to call out is we want
you to think through and make the decision up front

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.009
if you'd like to be an individual or company.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:37.780
The process to change from an individual to a
company at a later point is long and arduous.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.599
So when you log into iTunes Connect
for the first time, you'll land here.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.389
This is the homepage.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.169
These are all the modules that
you have to manage your content.

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:52.609
And again, for those interested in paid
application distribution, contracts, tax,

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.580
and banking module is highlighted up there.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.620
That should be your first stop.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.750
So once you have an account, let's
now add a new application.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.840
To do this, log into iTunes Connect
and click on manager your applications.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.360
Now if this is your first time into
the manager applications module,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.160
if highly suggest you download the user guide
linked on the bottom middle of the page.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:25.750
The user guide covers everything we're going to cover
in this session in detail, as well as provided examples.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.930
Now, I've already read the user guide, so I'm going to click
on the upper left hand button to add a new application.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.180
The first time you add a new app, we're going
to prompt you for two pieces of information.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.740
The first is your primary language.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.500
This will come into play when we start to talk about how
you localize your marketing message into different stores.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.319
But what we're looking for here is what language are
you entering in the metadata about your application in.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.329
next is your company or developer name.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.170
This is your brand within the App Store.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.089
Every application that you publish
will be listed under this name.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.319
Now the other thing that I'll point
out about this information is

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.859
that right now we don't have any facility to edit them.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.960
So you want to make sure you get them right the first time.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.120
Next up is export compliance.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.090
The App Store servers are located within the United States.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:22.229
As such, when you set up a new application, we're going
to ask you four questions about your use of encryption.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.090
The first is, does your product contain encryption?

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:29.169
Second, is encryption used for authentication purposes only?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.449
Third is, does your product contain 64 bit symmetric?

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.889
Or 1,024 bit asymmetric encryption?

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.039
Finally, is encryption used for the protection
of data or information security purposes?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.460
Now, if you answer yes to all four
questions, we are going to require

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:47.779
that you upload a valid C-cats
[phonetic] form to us.

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:53.629
If you don't know what a C-cats form is and think that you
might need one, I'm going to refer you to the US Department

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.610
of Commerce Commercial Encryption Controls
website for further fascinating reading.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.300
[ Laughter ]

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.670
Next up, we're going to look at adding in the
metadata or the details about your application.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:14.629
This is your name, your application description, the
categories that you'll categorize your application under,

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:20.269
copyright and version information, application
and support URLs, a support email address,

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:25.939
and end user license agreement if you
have one, and finally a SKU number.

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:32.060
Now the only two things I'll call out here is the
support email address is not published on the App Store,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.610
this is only for Apple's internal use to get
in contact with you to resolve a support issue.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.509
And the SKU number cannot be changed once it has been set.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.599
And this is what will appear in your financial reports.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.820
So new in iPhone 3.0 is parental controls.

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.240
So starting this week, we're now
requiring that all applications be rated.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.329
If you have an application that is currently
live on the store and has not yet been rated,

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:04.449
we're going to ask you to go into
iTunes Connect and rate it now.

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:10.459
When 3.0 ships, any application that is not
rated will display not yet rated in the App Store

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:14.279
and it will be enforced as if it had a 17+ rating.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:22.589
Now the process for rating an application is we
provide the following list of app advisories.

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:28.319
We ask you for each one of these advisories
to provide the frequency or intensity.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.589
Based on your selections here, will
determine the rating of your application.

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:41.689
The App Store has a simple age-based
rating system of 4+ , 9+, 12+ and 17+.

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:46.420
In iPhone 3.0, parents now have the
option of setting the maximum rating

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.980
for which a child can download
applications from the App Store.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.030
And that's it for the details of our application.

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:56.909
So now, let's look at the content.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.650
That actual assets that you're going to be uploading to us.

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:04.529
The first and most important is obviously your binary.

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:09.829
Now, there are a few things you want to check
about your binary before you upload it to us.

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:15.849
The first is that you've included a 57 by 57 PWNG icon.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.120
Note that rounded corners, as well as shine,
are automatically added by the App Store.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.670
However, if you would like to preshine your icon, the
App Store does honor the UI prerendered icon key if set

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.830
in the info dot pelos [assumed
spelling] file of your Xcode project.

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:33.819
Next up is your app id.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:42.110
You create your app id as well as your distribution for
visioning profile in the iPhone program developer portal.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.850
Every application in the App Store has a unique app id.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.610
New in iPhone 3.0 are device capabilities.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:59.230
This allows you to set within your Xcode project the
capabilities that your application absolutely requires

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.280
to be present on a device in order
for it to function correctly.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:07.589
You set this as an array with the
UIRequiredCapabilities key.

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:13.409
Note the App Store will refuse to purchase an
application if all of the capabilities listed

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.730
in that application are not present on the device.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:23.790
Likewise, iTunes will refuse to sync an application
to a device if all of the capabilities listed

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.000
in that application are not on that device.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.389
So finally, you're ready to build your application.

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:36.279
For this you're going to set your active SDK to device,
you're going to set your active configuration to release,

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:41.179
you're going to set your code sign
identity to your distribution identity.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:46.149
You're going to set at the provisioning profile
to be your distribution provisioning profile.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:51.620
Once you've built your dot app, we're going to ask you
to zip it up in the finder, and it's that zip archive

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.919
that you'll be uploading in iTunes Connect.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:09:02.409
Next up, we're going to ask you for
a 512 x 512 version of your icon.

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:08.240
This must be, this must come from the exact
same artwork as the icon in your application.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.990
Different parts of the application will either
use the large artwork or the small artwork.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:18.230
And you want to ensure a consistent
experience between in pages.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.980
Finally, are screenshots.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.519
We require one screenshot, but you can
upload up to four additional screenshots.

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:29.990
And that's it for the content.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.950
So one last step, it's to specify availability.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.219
Availability breaks down into two pieces of information.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.399
The first is the availability date.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:47.970
This is the earliest date at which your
application can be published on the App Store.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.160
The second is distribution.

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:55.519
By default, worldwide distribution is
assumed; however, if that is not your intent,

00:09:55.519 --> 00:10:00.710
for the 22 stores that we operate the iTunes Store
in, you can select which of those countries you would

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.810
like to distribute your application into.

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:06.199
And for all the remaining ones
that we operate only App Store in,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.100
you can opt into all of those or out of all of those.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:17.129
And finally, for paid application distribution,
we're going to ask you to select from a price tier.

00:10:17.129 --> 00:10:22.250
The price tier maps to the customer
prices as well as to your proceeds.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:30.730
In this example, price tier ten maps to a nine ninety-nine
retail price point with a seven dollar proceeds.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:36.870
All of the stores listed here, all of the stores not
listed here I should say, all operate on the US dollar.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.940
Now with that I would like to bring up Ricardo Cortez,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.860
Engineering Manager for the iTunes Store Provider Services
Group, who owns iTunes Connect among other things,

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.009
to walk us through a demo of submitting an application.

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:53.509
[ Applause ]

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:56.789
>> Thank you, Max.

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:57.539
[ Applause ]

00:10:57.539 --> 00:11:00.219
So once you've developed your application,
you're ready to distribute it

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.440
to the App Store, and that's through iTunes Connect.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.600
Of course, you need to test it, so we prefer to do that
first before we distribute it to the iTunes Connect portal.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:16.220
I'm going to log in to iTunes Connect and as Max
mentioned earlier, this is the homepage of iTunes Connect.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.660
The different sections are what we call modules.

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:23.049
This module right now, that we're
interested in, is manager applications.

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:28.849
In the upper left hand corner there's
a button called add your application.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.409
And you'll see at the bottom there's
a link for the developer guide.

00:11:32.409 --> 00:11:37.870
If you have any questions on how to distribute your
application or get it ready for the iTunes Store,

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:43.149
including your assets, your cover art,
as well as new features for iPhone 3.0,

00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:48.600
In App Purchases in device capabilities
is documented there in the user guide.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.950
So as Max alluded to earlier, the first two
pieces of information we want to collect

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.009
from you are your primary language and your company name.

00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:10.309
[ Silence ]

00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:12.729
Next is the export compliance.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.820
There are four questions.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.080
If you answer yes to all of them, we need
to actually ask you for a C-cats form.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.520
You'll see that form here after the fourth question.

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:26.689
This app is a game; Touch Fighter.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:35.150
Touch Fighter 2 does not contain encryption
so I'll go ahead and indicate that with a no.

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:36.909
the first tab in the flow is the overview tab.

00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:39.750
This is where you're going to enter
your metadata about your application.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.669
This is your marketing text and your descriptions.

00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:46.009
The fields that are indicated in bold are required.

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:51.200
[ Silence ]

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.950
Add a little cheat sheet here for my descriptions.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.009
Make sure I get them right.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:13:02.110
[ Silence ]

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:07.320
This application was compiled against iPhone OS 3.0 SDK.

00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:11.009
Next comes the categories.

00:13:11.009 --> 00:13:15.269
[ Silence ]

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:22.490
Touch Fighter is a game and upon choosing game, I'm
given the option of choosing up to two subcategories.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:29.169
Let's see, I'll choose action and adventure.

00:13:29.169 --> 00:13:40.009
Next, it's the copyright information,
the version number and the SKU.

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:46.789
[ Silence ]

00:13:46.789 --> 00:13:53.009
The next information is your application URL,
support URL and your support email address.

00:13:53.009 --> 00:14:02.399
[ Silence ]

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:06.519
As Max alluded to earlier, the support
email address is not used externally.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:09.939
It's in case we have a problem with your application
and we've, we want to get in touch with you.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.340
Next is the rating tab.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.910
Ratings are now required for all applications.

00:14:15.909 --> 00:14:19.299
You'll see the app advisories are listed below.

00:14:19.299 --> 00:14:26.059
You can choose none, infrequent
or mild or frequent and intense.

00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:29.009
As you choose the ratings, you see they
are dynamically generated to the right

00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:34.009
so you will know exactly what your rating will be
generated once you submit it to the iTunes Store.

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:40.259
[ Silence ]

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:43.259
After the ratings tab is the upload tab.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:45.759
This is the tab where you will submit your binary.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:51.009
Your large 512 x 512 cover art as
well as your primary screenshot.

00:14:51.009 --> 00:15:27.330
[ Silence ]

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.190
While we upload the assets, including the
binary, we perform many validations on these.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:38.720
Some of you are fairly accustomed these validations in terms
of verifying your distribution profile, the certificate,

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.550
if the app is signed correctly, the
assets are the right dimensions.

00:15:43.549 --> 00:15:46.179
As you upload the assets, including
your cover art and primary screenshot,

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:51.809
you can preview them to make sure
they are the correct assets.

00:15:51.809 --> 00:15:53.959
Lastly, you need a primary screenshot.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.070
This is the screenshot that is used on the device.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:03.010
It is the first screenshot the customer will see when
they're browsing your application on the App Store.

00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:21.730
[ Silence ]

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.310
Next is the pricing tab.

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:27.079
Here you choose your availability date and your price tier.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.000
I want this application to be available today.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.779
So I'll go ahead and choose June 12, 2009 as
my availability date, as well as select tier.

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:36.909
Tier 10 from the pull down.

00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:40.299
Upon choosing the tier, you're given a matrix at the bottom

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:45.559
that represents the customer price
and proceeds for each tier.

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:50.969
For Tier 10, you'll see in the bottom left that
in the US the customer price is nine ninety-nine

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.950
and the proceeds are seven dollars.

00:16:57.409 --> 00:16:58.990
Next is the localization tab.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:05.029
This is where you will localize your
marketing text and title for other app stores.

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:09.009
We're going to go ahead and add a French localization.

00:17:09.009 --> 00:17:17.000
[ Silence ]

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.680
And grab the French translation.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:30.480
And then appropriately change the
support URL, the support email address,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.819
and I will keep the primary screenshot
and additional screenshots the same.

00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:39.629
You have the option of uploading different
screenshots if you'd like for different localizations.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.560
Finally, we're brought to the review tab.

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:47.960
The review tab is where you get to see what your metadata

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.259
and your chosen selections look like
so far in the various app stores.

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:54.950
In the US, you'll see your descriptions in English.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:18:01.130
If I choose French, France app store in the
pull down, it's now reflected in French.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:08.290
You get to see your primary categories that you
chose, your copyright version, SKU information,

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:12.210
the rating and because I'm in the France storefront,

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.990
you'll see that the customer price
and proceeds are reflected in Euros.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.009
At this point, I'm ready to submit my application.

00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:24.869
[ Silence ]

00:18:24.869 --> 00:18:28.500
Upon doing so, I'm brought to the
main page of Manager Applications.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.789
You'll see that I submitted Touch
Fighter 2 version 1.0 and it's in review.

00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:37.509
Here is where you would see all your
applications listed, as well as their status.

00:18:37.509 --> 00:18:40.069
Once it goes through ready for sale,
you'll get a status ready for sale,

00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:46.700
and you'll know that your app is selling in the App Store.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.460
Thank you.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:54.069
[ Applause ]

00:18:54.069 --> 00:18:55.409
>> Thank you, Ricardo.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:03.340
All right, now let's look at the process for
adding In App Purchase items to an application.

00:19:03.339 --> 00:19:08.269
This, like publishing an app is
also a simple five-step process.

00:19:08.269 --> 00:19:12.000
The first step is to add a new item.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.950
Now for new applications that you're setting
up for the first time, you now have the option

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:23.340
in the iPhone program developer portal to indicate
the best, the app id that you're setting up,

00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:26.099
is going to be used for in app purchasing.

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:29.559
What this allows us to do is to
provision that in app, oh sorry,

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:35.819
provision the app id into our sandbox testing environment
so you can begin testing, you can be testing your

00:19:35.819 --> 00:19:40.210
In App Purchase items before you've
actually uploaded a binary to us.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:46.110
To do this you log into the iPhone Program Developer
Portal, select the app id that you're interested in

00:19:46.109 --> 00:19:51.289
and check the box to enable for in app purchasing.

00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:57.220
Once that's done, you can log into iTunes Connect
and click on the manage In App Purchases module.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:04.789
From here, the upper left hand button
is to create a new in app item.

00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:08.759
At which point, you'll land here.

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:13.129
All paid applications that you
currently have will be listed here.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:18.200
Note: Free applications are not
eligible to add In App Purchase items to.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.960
To complete this final step, you'll
select the final application

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.250
that you wish to add the In App Purchase item to.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:31.369
So next up, let's look at the details
that you need to provide about your item

00:20:31.369 --> 00:20:38.719
This is your reference name, your product id,
your item type, and finally your price tier.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.990
The reference name is your name for the item.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:47.210
This will not be displayed for the customer
and will not be displayed within the App Store.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:51.259
The product id functions in the exact same way as the SKU.

00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:56.720
Once set, it cannot be edited and it
will appear in your financial reports.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.190
The item type is the type of, the
kind of item you wish to set up.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:06.440
A non-consumable is one that we do
not allow the customer to repurchase.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.160
And if you think about the App Store,
applications are non-consumable.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.720
If the user buys an application on
Device 1 and logs into Device 2,

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.529
and clicks to buy the same application,
we allow them to redownload it for free.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:25.160
Non-consumable In App Purchase items
function in the exact same way.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:31.190
Non-consumables are also required to
work across all devices for the user.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:38.309
Now consumable items are those that are
consumed as part of the application play.

00:21:38.309 --> 00:21:45.589
They, we do allow repurchase and they're not
required to function across all devices for a user.

00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:47.789
The final type is subscription.

00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:55.180
Subscription behaves like consumables in that we
allow users to repurchase but they are required

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.500
to work across all devices for a given user.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.390
And finally, the price tier.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:07.780
All of the price tier points that are available for pricing
your applications are also available for pricing your

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:11.019
In App Purchase items, with the exception of the free tier.

00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:16.180
Next up is your display title and description.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.500
This, the title is actually what
will be displayed to the user.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.670
When the box pops up to confirm the purchase and
the description is available through store kit APIs,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.110
for you to retrieve, display and your application.

00:22:29.109 --> 00:22:38.129
And finally, for review purposes only, we're going to ask
you to upload a screenshot of your In App Purchase item.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:44.760
For instance speed, strength, all right, you get the idea.

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:49.970
So now that you've set up the item, the
next step is to actually test the item.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:55.110
So the first part of the testing process
is to set up test accounts within,

00:22:55.109 --> 00:22:58.519
what we refer to as the sandbox environment.

00:22:58.519 --> 00:23:04.660
To do this you're going to log into
iTunes Connect and click manage users.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:10.870
From here you will select an In App Purchase test user.

00:23:10.869 --> 00:23:16.159
And add user, then select the upper
left hand button to add new user.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:25.410
For sandbox test accounts, we're going to ask you for
a first and last name, an email address, a password,

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:31.279
a secret question and answer, a date of
birth and most importantly, a country.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:36.220
If you wish to test your In App Purchase
items in the United States, France and Japan,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.870
you would set up three different sandbox test accounts.

00:23:41.869 --> 00:23:47.089
So now, I know, this is the crazy side here, but
yes, we are going to ask you to thoroughly test your

00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:51.829
In App Purchase items before you submit them to us.

00:23:51.829 --> 00:23:55.449
So once you have thoroughly tested
your In App Purchase items,

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.680
it's now time for you to submit them for review purposes.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:07.400
The first thing to point out is the review process
for In App Purchase items is the same as applications.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.250
Now there are two ways to submit an In App Purchase item.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:17.289
One is to tie it to a binary, in which case the
binary as well as the In App Purchase items are going

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:20.049
to travel through the review process together.

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:23.529
If there is an issue with your
binary, your binary as well as your

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:28.220
In App Purchase items will all come
back to your for your correction.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.319
Likewise, if there is an issue with one of your in
app purchase items, your binary as well as all of the

00:24:33.319 --> 00:24:39.309
In App Purchase items submitted with that binary
will again, come back to you for your correction.

00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:46.190
The second form is if you have an application that has in
app purchase items that are currently live on the store,

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.920
we will allow you to add them and
submit them for review immediately.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:59.509
To submit an In App Purchase item, you're going to log into
the manage your In App Purchases and select the application

00:24:59.509 --> 00:25:02.309
that has the items you wish to submit for you.

00:25:02.309 --> 00:25:11.279
In this case, you can see that Touch Fighter
has one In App Purchase item called Missiles.

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:14.460
In the status, pending developer sign off.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:19.870
The status of pending developer sign off is where
I've been testing it in the sandbox environment.

00:25:19.869 --> 00:25:26.929
To submit this item, I'm going to inspect it and
click the upper right hand corner called approve.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:32.200
At which point, I will be given two options.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:38.580
Again, one to submit it with the binary
and the second is to submit it now.

00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:45.599
If you would like to submit it with a binary, the in app
purchase item will go into a holding state, at which point,

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:50.769
when you upload your binary, when I upload the new
Touch Fighter binary, I will be presented with all the

00:25:50.769 --> 00:25:56.099
In App Purchase items that are currently
being held, and when I hit submit, the binary,

00:25:56.099 --> 00:26:00.869
as well as all those in app binary purchase items
will then start to travel through the review process.

00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:08.489
In the case where I already have it, I have In App Purchase
items live for this app, I can merely submit it now

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:12.920
at which point we make no guarantees, and it will
travel through the review process independent.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:19.320
So finally, once submitted it's
in the waiting for review state.

00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:23.990
And again, I'd like to bring Ricardo
Cortes up to walk us through setting

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.440
up an In App Purchase item and submitting it.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.720
[ Applause ]

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.579
>> Thank you, Max.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:44.410
So there's really about four steps you need to go
through with respect to iTunes Connect In App Purchases.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:49.840
First, you've got to leverage Store Kit, you've got to
develop In App Purchase within your application.

00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:54.709
Then you need to go to iTunes Connect, create your metadata
and your SKU information, and your pricing information.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:27:00.390
Go to iTunes Connect, create your sandbox users and test
out your In App Purchase in the sandbox environment.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:06.009
And then when you're comfortable testing out those negative
and positive use cases, you log back into iTunes Connect

00:27:06.009 --> 00:27:10.269
and you either submit with the binary or on its own.

00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:13.049
So last time we created our app we
were in manage your applications.

00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:18.789
This time we're going back to manage your in app
purchases and we're going to create In App Purchase.

00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:22.450
Go ahead and create new.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:27.529
We're presented with a screen with the paid
applications that are eligible for In App Purchase.

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:32.950
And then we go out to the metadata page.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.420
The first section is pricing.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.460
Again, the reference name, the Max alluded
to it's loaded to is for your use only.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.890
On the right here, there are some question marks.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:45.630
If you've got questions about any of these
fields, it'll guide you through the process.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:50.010
And likewise, a developer guide has
been updated for an In App Purchase.

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:58.970
[ Silence ]

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:03.230
The product id will be reflected in your finance reports.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.990
I'm creating Missiles, it's a consumable.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.849
I'll choose Tier 1.

00:28:11.849 --> 00:28:16.439
I'd also like this consumable to be
ready for sale as soon as it's ready,

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.600
so I'll leave the Cleared for Sale box marked as checked.

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.539
The next session is the display details.

00:28:23.539 --> 00:28:25.279
This is your localizations.

00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:28.920
I'll go and add English localization.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:35.640
As Max alluded to earlier, the display name
and the description are the localizable fields.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.980
The display name is what's presented
to the user, or the customer,

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.009
when they purchase an internet purchase on the device.

00:28:44.009 --> 00:28:51.170
[ Silence ]

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.509
Go ahead and add this language

00:28:57.029 --> 00:29:03.009
At the bottom, we need our full review
screenshot, which presents this In App Purchase.

00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:31.129
[ Silence ]

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.440
We're all said and done.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.840
Go ahead and submit it.

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:40.000
And we're brought back to the main
page of manager In App Purchases.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.430
You'll see at the top there's one
application that has In App Purchases.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:47.269
As you add In App Purchases to your
applications, you'll see a listing at the top

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:49.160
and they're frequently modified applications.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.370
So it's a quick link section for
you to get to those applications.

00:29:53.369 --> 00:29:57.709
You can also search at the bottom by
reference name, display name or product id.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:01.700
I'll go ahead and inspect this in
app purchase by choosing the app.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.880
You'll see I have one In App Purchase for Touch Fighter 2.

00:30:07.589 --> 00:30:10.119
It's in pending to go in for approval.

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:14.659
I can see the product id, the pricing
information, as well as the localizations.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:22.640
When it's in pending developer approval, I have the
option of editing this information, but once I approve it,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.450
I no longer have the, I know longer have
the option of editing that information.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.850
So now, we would go back to the device, and we have

00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:36.259
to actually create sandbox users
to test out this In App Purchase.

00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:39.549
So we go back to manage your users.

00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:41.779
And this time we're presented with two options.

00:30:41.779 --> 00:30:44.470
I can connect user or In App Purchase user.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:49.490
We don't have any In App Purchase users.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:53.140
I'll go ahead and add one.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.009
And we need to enter the required information.

00:30:56.009 --> 00:31:26.640
[ Silence ]

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:37.470
I'd like to test my In App Purchases in the US so I'll
go ahead and select the US iTunes store and save it.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:43.009
Oops. We have some validations on
the passwords; it's a good thing.

00:31:43.009 --> 00:31:55.809
[ Silence ]

00:31:55.809 --> 00:32:01.970
Once you've submitted it, we can go onto the device, we
can log out of our iTunes store account on the device,

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:06.200
log in as a sandbox user and test out
our In App Purchases on the device.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:14.370
Once we're satisfied, we then come back to iTunes
Connect, we'd log in, we'd go to manage In App Purchases,

00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:22.539
we'd find the In App Purchase that we're ready
to sign off on, that's Missiles, inspect it.

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:27.619
I'm going to come over here and click the
big green button at the top named approve.

00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:34.599
We're now given the choice of submitting
this with the binary or we can submit now.

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:42.449
I already In App Purchases live on the store with Touch
Fighter 2 so I'm going to go ahead and submit this one now.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:46.110
And once we submit it you'll see the
status changes waiting for review.

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:57.329
And that is creating In App Purchases, testing
them and submitting them in iTunes Connect.

00:32:57.329 --> 00:32:57.909
Thank you.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:58.310
[ Applause ]

00:32:58.309 --> 00:33:04.349
>> All right.

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:05.759
Thank you, Ricardo.

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:12.559
So now that we've published an application, we've added in
app purchases to it, let's now look at some of the tools

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:17.319
that are available to you to manage your
applications once they're live on the App Store.

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:22.649
For paid application development,
most important is finance reports.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:31.440
So finance reports are posted monthly for every proceed
currency that you generated income for in the previous month.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.170
You access your finance reports
on the finance reports module.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:42.600
The format is a simple CSV text file
format, easily parsable.

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:46.959
And every report that we've ever
posted for you will be listed here.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:53.140
For those of you that are impatient and
can't wait until the end of the month

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.040
to see how your applications are
doing, we also provide daily reports.

00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:03.960
Daily reports are accessed under the sales and
trends module in the upper left hand corner.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:11.440
Here you're offered the report type, either the
daily or weekly reports and then the day or period.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:17.519
Note the daily reports we hold onto for seven days
and weekly reports are held for thirteen weeks.

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:22.550
Next up are promo codes.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.150
Promo codes are a great way for
you to promote your application.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:31.119
They all for a royalty free download of
a paid application and I stress this,

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:34.569
they are for noncommercial distribution only.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:39.450
You, you can get up to 50 codes
per version of your application.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:42.219
Once generated, the codes will expire after four weeks.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:46.869
They are available to user in the US iTunes Store account.

00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:52.989
Now one other thing I'll call out about promo codes is
the only actual requirement is to have an approved binary,

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:59.319
meaning if I'm coming out with a new application
and I have an availability date set of September 1st

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:07.350
and on August 1st I have an approved binary, for
the month of August I can use promo codes to, to,

00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:11.900
for to provide easy access of the application
before it's gone live in the store.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:19.059
And the other point to point out about promo codes is
now an iPhone OS 3.0, there's now within the App Store,

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:21.679
you can now redeem those codes right on the device.

00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:31.149
To get your promo codes, log into iTunes Connect
and click on the request promotional codes module.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:37.150
Here you will be given in the pop up a list of
all of your applications with approved binaries.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.440
When you select the application at the bottom part

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.269
of the screen will display the number
of codes that you have remaining.

00:35:43.269 --> 00:35:50.119
You can enter in the number of codes you wish in the text
box, click continue to generate and download the codes.

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:56.619
We also offer a view history link in the upper
left hand corner where we provide the last 60 days,

00:35:56.619 --> 00:36:02.159
all the code requests that you've made where you can
go and redownload any codes that you've generated.

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:06.599
And finally, crash logs.

00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:11.259
Now I know no one in this audience writes buggy
software, so this is more one of those tell your friends

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.340
who do write buggy software about this great feature.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:18.940
So to get to your crash logs, so crash
logs are updated for all applications

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.980
on the App Store approximately every two weeks.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.719
To get to the crash logs for your particular app,

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:32.019
you're going to log into the manage your
applications module and select the app details link.

00:36:33.429 --> 00:36:41.019
Here you can select your crash, you can view
your crash reports in the upper left hand corner.

00:36:41.019 --> 00:36:44.009
Now crash reports break down into three types.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:48.490
Crashes and freezes, timeouts and exhausted memory.

00:36:48.489 --> 00:36:55.289
For crashes, we provide the top ten most frequent
crashes that are happening within your application.

00:36:55.289 --> 00:37:01.190
And for each one of those, we will provide up to
three example stack traces as well as register values.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.940
For timeouts, there are three types of timeouts.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:09.639
Timeout on the launch, timeout on
quit and force quit by the user.

00:37:09.639 --> 00:37:15.250
For each of those three we provide up to five
example stack traces as well as register values.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:23.409
And finally, for memory, we provide the
average as well as the maximum memory,

00:37:23.409 --> 00:37:27.769
resident memory size when your application was jettisoned.

00:37:27.769 --> 00:37:32.199
And finally, we give you the breakdown
for all crash reports for your application

00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:35.679
of crashes versus timeouts versus memory.

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:40.419
So it should give you an idea of where you need,
of what you need to focus on, on tackling first.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:45.909
So what we want to do now is just cover two best practices

00:37:45.909 --> 00:37:49.109
of all the little nuggets that
we've learned over the past year.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.960
The first is to test your application thoroughly.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:59.610
Believe it or not, but the majority of the rejections
that happen for applications across the board happen

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.220
because the application crashes when it's being reviewed.

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:07.759
So please test your applications
thoroughly before submitting them to us.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:14.260
And the second is avoid adding a price to your icon.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:19.400
Your icon by definition is meant to be iconic,
meaning it needs to work across the entire world.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:24.500
And if you put in 99 cents right in the middle of
it, your application will not go up on the store.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:29.010
So avoid putting price to your icons.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:35.010
So in summary, the App Store is an amazing way
to reach millions and millions of consumers.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:37.470
And honestly yeah, we're just getting started at this point.

00:38:37.469 --> 00:38:46.439
So to recap, for In App Purchases, get into iTunes Connect,
get in set up, go kick the tires in the sandbox environment.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:52.970
If you haven't already done so, if you have an application
live, please make sure that you've done testing on 3.0.

00:38:52.969 --> 00:38:57.000
If you find issues, get those updates
submitted as soon as possible.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.340
And for ratings, if you have an application live that
hasn't been rated yet, please get into iTunes Connect

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.059
and get it rated soon, before iPhone 3.0 gets out.

00:39:07.059 --> 00:39:14.980
