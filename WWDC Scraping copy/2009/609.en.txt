 Good afternoon everybody. My name is Kjell Bronder. I'm Engineer on the Podcast Producer team and I'll be presenting today with Eric Circlaeys, a fellow Engineer. We have a great session and it's full of a lot of fun demos for you and really going to be taking an in-depth look at Podcast Composer and we're going to show you how easy we've made it for you to create really powerful workflows that you can customize for your organization.

We're going to step back to start off and we're going to come back to what Podcast Producer is Podcast Producer is a full end-to-end solution that really makes it easy to capture, process and deliver your content. I'm pretty sure there's a lot of administrators out here that are responsible for a podcasting solution from some sort. And in that environment, you have two types of customers. On one side, you have your clients who need to capture their content and distribute their knowledge. On the other side, you have your audience.

These are the clients that are going to consume this content. What Podcast Producer does is it creates a real invisible bridge in between. We make it really easy for your clients on one side to capture the content and completely seamless for your audience to consume the content. There's a lot of things happening underneath, but we make it really transparent for both of your customers and to show you that, I'm going to do a real quick demo.

So I'm going to move over to the demo machine and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to create a real quick video podcast. Just going to choose Video here and Podcast Capture, I'm going to turn this way and start the recording. Welcome to Podcast Composer In-Depth. This is going to be a great session.

We've tons of stuff to show to you and we're going to have a lot of fun with our demos. I hope that you take home that Podcast Producer is just a great solution for capturing and distributing your content. Just have to click Pause here and all I have to do now is publish my content. Then choose the Podcast here, which is Invisible Bridge.

I'm going to call this Podcast Producer and it's a full end-to-end solution. And now I hit Submit. Now Podcast Capture takes care of uploading all of the content to the server. Podcast Producer takes care of everything else and that's the whole point. For your customers, for the individuals in your organization or institution that have the expertise or the knowledge that you want to distribute, we make it extremely easy for them to capture this content so that they can concentrate on their presentation or lecture.

Then on the other side, you have your audience. Well they already have their ways of consuming content. They're used to using iTunes. They have certain devices that they're used to using for watching all of their content. So you want to make sure it's completely seamless for them and that they don't have to change their ways, you know download any other applications or plug-ins to consume this content.

Another really important point about Podcast Producer is that we leverage a lot of different technologies underneath and something that we believe very strongly in is that technologies are great, but they are only as great as their usage is simple. You want to make sure that it's really, really easy for your customers to leverage this technology. Maybe a lot of your experts in their domain, they might not be experts in video processing. They might not know how to encode multiple different formats.

They might not know how to publish out to the web, nor should they have to. Also with Podcast Producer, we go beyond that. We've brought in things with imager analysis to do really cool transitions. We do a lot of really cool things by leveraging some complex technologies, but we take all of that complexity out of the solution for your customers so they don't see it and we create this fully invisible bridge in between those who have the knowledge and those who want to consume it. So now that our content has been processed on the Podcast Producer system, let me play it back for you. See, I'm just going to open up my iChat here and let's go to iTunes and we're going to refresh our feed here.

If you've been to our other demos this week, you've seen that we've changed our titling, we've changed our intro video and here we've branded our podcast and that's what this whole session is going to be about. We're going to show you how you can brand your podcast very easily with Podcast Composer, how you can use all of the new transitions, how you can have animated watermarks and you can put in your own altra-videos. We've made this so extremely easy and all it takes now is just dragging and dropping your content into Podcast Composer. So what I'm going to do now, is I'm going to pass it over to Eric and he's going to walk you through Podcast Composer.

 Thank you, Kjell. Good afternoon everyone. I think for the end user this is really magic but for us, this is where the power of the workflows comes into play. So now, I would like to take a deeper look under the covers and see how all that content gets produced with Podcast Producer and Podcast Composer workflows. Podcast Producer workflow is kind of a recipe of how you're going to create a podcast.

I don't know if you remember in Z1, well in Z1 to create a workflow, you needed to be a guru. Now I know there are some in the room today and they created crazy workflows out there, but still this isn't really easy for everyone. So we wanted to simplify that and to give you an example of how it was complicated, then just imagine all the things you had to do.

You had to speak XML fluently. You had to know about every single bits and bytes of that Podcast Producer. You had to deal with the actions, the resources, all the credentials and even care about the parallelism. Well, this is great if you want to spend hours working on crazy things, but we wanted to bring that to any user. On Snow Leopard, on Podcast Producer 2, we kind of proved the idea of very simple application that represents sequentially what we think are the most common steps for creating a Podcast workflow and that's what I'm going to show you right now in action with Podcast Composer.

Podcast Composer is the new tool in Snow Leopard to create workflows and deploy workflows with Podcast Producer. It simplifies all the work with seven identified stages and these are the seven stages. This is just simple as filling up all these pages one after the other to create your own customized workflow using and leveraging all the cool technologies we've introduced in Leopard and Snow Leopard.

But before even going to through these steps one after the other, I would like to talk to you a bit more about the UI and specifically about the navigation and browsing user experience. We've made it brand new. Actually, the main stage you are working on is always centered in the middle of the window so then you can have a nice look about what you have just set up before and what you are going to do right after this page. It's also very simple to actually navigate through all these different stages.

You can just click on the stages, you can use the swipe movement, you can use the scroll wheel, you can even go in the mini icons and actually select the stage you're interested in or use the shortcuts to navigate. The coolest one we have added is the ability to double click on the title of this page and have an overview of the complete workflow and then jump to the stage that you are interested in.

So now you have seen how easy it is to navigate, let's go into each stage and see what you could do to customize your own workflow. The first one, in formation stage, is really straightforward. This is where you're going to add the title the author, and the description of this workflow.

All this information is going to show up in the applications such as Podcast Capture so when one of your customers is going to connect to Podcast Capture and select a workflow, it will then see the name and use the description to find the correct workflowings to use. Once you're done with that, it's time to work on the most important stage.

This is the step that defines what this workflow is going to be used for. This stage acts like a finale taking all the input sources produced by Podcast Capture and making a single source video for the rest of the workflow. There are three different importers. There is the single source importer, which is very simple.

It takes one input source coming from the video recording or the screen recalling or even the audio recording. You can actually even restrict a workflow to only work for a certain type of single source. Maybe you'd like to create a workflow that only works for screen recording so then any user in Podcast Capture that does a screen recording will see that particular workflow.

We have also added what we call the Automatic Chapter Generation. That's a nice feature because you could do any type of screen recording using keynotes for presenting any type of content or using a PDF or using any other presentation tools and we're going automatically to detect out of the video the different chapters in between the slides.

That is done automatically for you. Then there is the dual source, which is a new feature in Snow Leopard. To give you a little description about dual source, it's super easy. The Podcast Capture captures two sources, the screen and the video sources where the talking head is going actually to present the content. The dual source importer is going to build a picture-in-picture of those two sources for the rest of the workflow.

Well, we provide bi-fold four different compositions to lay out those two videos that we receive and then generate this picture-in-picture movie. There is the keynote composition that you all have seen in the two previous sessions. There is the overlay that shows all the time the two content on the screen. There is the overlay with fade, it shows the main content all the time and when it's necessary, it shows up the talking head and finally we do have the theater that shows up always the two content with nice transitions.

About these transitions, we have added a nice feature called automatic transitions. Since we are capable of detecting in the slides if they have change in a forced amount of time or not, we are capable of triggering an action and such action could be an animation to do something nice with those two contents we have captured. For example, it's like moving from one source to another in the transition. Again, we are capable of adding markers automatically in the videos so then you can jump from one slide to another in quick time or in iTunes.

Finally, we have this Montage feature. Montage is really nice because it gives you the ability to submit any type of documents that Quick Look could actually render. Quick Look is one of the technologies we had in Leopard that is still available in Snow Leopard and could even do better things.

With Quick Look, we could extract images out of some documents such as PDF, such as keynote presentations, such as pages documents and with all those images, we are going to be able to build a slideshow and produce a video out of that to be then podcasted on your different services. If we go in the configuration panel for Montage, you can set the duration for every image that we extract from documents you send. You can also change the transition to some of the transitions we do provide by default.

Again, we can automatically generate the chapters for you. Once you are done with these importer settings, it's time to brand your content. I can select Draw Source for the demo and let's talk about the editing. This is where you're going to brand your content. This is where you're going to set the introduction video of your company. This is where you're going to select the layout of your bumper title. Maybe also customize your content by adding a watermark and changing the outro movie and I'd like to show you all these different possibilities here.

There are these four vignettes and each of them are configurable. This is the introduction movie. By default, we provide some different introduction movies like the Apple Podcast or the Camera Flash or the Eye. but it would be great to use mine. So I'd rather set a file here I would like to use. So let's move that to the backstop and I have my personal track intro video and I would like to use it.

Let's just add it to this vignette. Now it's time to configure my bumper title. This is an automatically generated title that's going to be added in my podcast with the metadata that will be submitted from Podcast Capture. This is a Flying Title composition, a different one we had in V1. We've added two other ones. We added the Carousel and the Reveal. For example, the Carousel shows up the logo and then the title and the author. Maybe I would like to use my own logo in that particular case so just drag and drop the logo.

Maybe you'd like to only see the title and not the author and then you are done in the settings for Carousel. The one I really like is Reveal. Reveal is this type of composition that shows all the information with that typical layout, but let's remove the organization. Then you can also set up the transition in between those two elements. You can change by picking one of the transitions you may like for this configuration.

Let's select Zoom Dissolve. Then it comes to the content itself. This is a nice preview of what could be the dual source so you can get an idea about how it's going to look like for one of your podcasts. I'd like to use my own watermark. You see by default, there is this Apple logo.

Again, if I want to use my watermark, I just drag and drop file. I'd like it on the left, maybe a bit bigger, more opacity. We've also introduced this concept of introduction overlay. We've provided three different overlays. One I really like is the Ticker one. Maybe you'd like to add it at the beginning of your content some additional information.

In my case, since I'm also using a bumper title, I would like to show in the Ticker only the description. It means at the beginning of my content I will have a nice description ticker showing up. You could also decide to remove elements as easy as just clicking on it, deleting it. That's very simple and then add it back using this buzz button.

In my case here, I would like to use the new exit that my audio and video department has created for me. I'm pretty all set now and if I would like to have a nice looking preview, I could use the scheming over my vignette to have a nice view of the different settings I've set or maybe what I would like to have is a preview, a simulation of all these elements stitched together and that's what this button is for.

I could click on this button and have a nice preview of it. This is my introduction video, this is my zoom dissolve, then my bumper title I'm going to use, my content with my watermark, the description ticker should appear, here it is, and then finally my altra-video, it's as easy as that.

I would like to give you.

[ Applause ]

Thank you. I would like to give you some tips and tricks here. You maybe want to actually remove all the settings and styles from scratch. Just simply click Command and Delete and then you'll erase everything and you'll be able to start really from something clean. Let me have this back for the rest of the demo. Something else, maybe you want to have multiple different sizes for the Preview Simulator.

The default one is that big. If you want it bigger, actually just use the Option key while clicking and you'll get something much bigger. Once you've branded your content, then it's time to define what are going to be the exporters, the different formats for your finished podcast. That's very important because people are going to consume this data differently and that's why we've titled these exporters, the default one we provide, are very tightly coupled with Apple devices. We do provide the right codex, the right encoders for the Apple TV, for the Apple iPhone, for audio only devices and also for cellular.

You could use this QuickTime exporter to pick one of these different choices automatically, but what if you would like to create your own encoding and tune it for some reasons. Well, we have this product called Compressor and if it's installed in this machine, then you'll be able to see directly from Podcast Composer and here it is.

In that particular case, you'll have then access to all the default settings they provide and they have a few. The nice thing is they have this interface to create even more encoding settings and if you create it and put it in the default compressor repository, it's going to show up directly in this interface.

Let's select one default like the MP3 and maybe another one that could be, I don't know, like H264 streaming, let's say this one. There are two ways of using Compressor. The first one, the easiest one is to use Compressor with Xgrid which means we are going to call the Compressor task the same way we're calling the QuickTime task, so it's going to be scheduled with Xgrid.

This could also leverage Qmaster if you had a Qmaster cluster somewhere in your company and by leveraging Qmaster, it means that at the time the Xgrid task is going to compress, is going to relay to Qmaster so the Xgrid job is going to send the request to Qmaster to actually start the encoding on the Qmaster system and Xgrid is going to then look at this task to finish every couple of minutes for example.

Once you're done with all your different formats, then it's time to define where you're going to post and publish all this information. By default, we leveraged Podcast Library and in this Podcast Library, we publish all the things we have. We published original sources, we published the preview files, for example, we generate a poster image for you.

We also published what we call the Edit Master. This is a high quality master regenerate out of the editing stage. Just before encoding to all the different formats, we regenerated high quality versions that is going to be posted to the Library. And then we publish all these different formats we have just selected before.

The cool thing about key words is we could add different key words that are going to be added to all these different movies and since we are talking about the Podcast Library, then we are going to create automatically key words feeds for you so everyone could actually access to some of the content that's been tagged with these key words from our RSS automatically for you. But you may want to actually publish to some other destinations.

So we provide a set of different destinations here. For example, you may want to push the content to add the Apple Wiki. So let's push it, let's push some elements such as maybe the iPod and iPhone version. You enter all your credentials right in the tool and select the destination folder or destination blog on Wiki.

This is just as easy as that. You could also archive that using file transfer to any file server using FTP, SFTP, WebDAV[assumed spelling], WebDAV over SSL There are many different file transfer protocol we do support. You could also leverage file cast server using a watch folder or a casual content that pushed your content to some other shared folder. There is this nice cool new feature here. You can also chain workflows.

So, yes, you could chain workflows you create with Podcast Composer, but this is also very useful if we'd like to chain a workflow you have written manually. So for example, you may use Podcast Composer to write this very complex workflow done for you, but you would like to add like two or three tasks manually that you have written. So it's the place where you are going to call your small subset of tasks right there by specifying first what are going to be the input sources and then by specifying what's going to be the workflow you would like to chain here.

And I think this is really useful. Then it's time to notify people and also notify services that some content has been generated and published. So there are two ways for notifying people. You can notify people by email. By default, we do notify people under the Submitting User and the Administrator but you can also notify any user you want. Again, put your own credentials in this tool and this is going to take care of everything for you and it's going also to generate a nice body with all different links to these different destinations you've selected previously. We've added iChat and this is my favorite.

It leverages a Java server. We have a Mac OS X server and it produces what you have seen in the previous demo. But maybe you'd like to tell your service or iTunes U that some content is now available in the Library. Let's imagine that you have registered some of your feeds into the iTunes Podcast Directory or into iTunes U and then it's time to tell them that there are some new content available and it's time to synchronize those two services. But you could also do that with your own service.

Maybe you could decide then to ping one of your services to tell them that some new content is available. And finally, you have a nice summary of the workflow you have just created. This workflow is dual source. It encodes the result in four different formats, publishes it in three different locations and notifies some users and some services and this is Podcast Composer and this is your workflow.

[ Applause ]

So as I said before it generates automatically a poster image for you but you could also set this poster image manually so every single input sources that are going to run through this workflow is going to be actually generated, the poster images are going to be the same for all of these different submissions. The nice thing I wanted to show you is this one.

Even if this workflow looks really sequential, well this application takes care of everything for you and it also generates the most optimal workflow to run on Xgrid and if you look at these numbers, this workflow has about 27 tasks and the maximum parallelism is about to be 10, which means at some point in the execution it's possible to have like 10 of these tasks executed at the same time if you're grid is big enough and that's really important because as you've seen, it's really easy to build a workflow with this tool, but it also takes care of generating the most optimal workflow for your grid. Two or three additional quick things, from this application you can open remotely the workflows you have on different servers so it's as easy as just opening the remote panel, selecting to your workflow, selecting to your server and having the least of all the different workflows like this.

It's also as easy as one click to deploy workflow automatically on the server by clicking on this button or directly from the File menu. Another interesting point is you could also make sure that this workflow is correct. So if I would like to look at this workflow, it's actually telling me that the Qmaster isn't set properly and yes, I've just enabled it but I have no information entered here. You can very easily use this tool to also check that you aren't missing information so that it is totally safe for you to run this workflow on the server for your users.

One last point, Podcast Composer generates sales content workflows. It means it's going to embed every single resource you have added to this workflow, including all the compositions, all the templates and then all your images, videos and so on and so forth. If you want to share this workflow with other people, then you'll have all the resources you need to actually run it on a machine and you don't have to actually share also all these resources separately. Thank you very much.

[ Applause ]

Thanks Eric. So you guys like that?

 Yeah.

 You're going to use it? Great. So what you just saw in this demo, let's recap real quick. There's three types of workflows that you can create with Podcast Composer. You can create a single source like you had in Leopard.

It's real easy to create a real good-looking dual source workflow and you can use the new Montage feature to submit all different types of documents. We've made it really, really easy so you can just drag and drop all your different resources and brand your podcasts. We've also built in support for all the different devices straight into the application. We've also made it extremely easy for you to publish and notify different services. But there's something else about Podcast Producer.

The whole solution of Podcast Producer is extremely customizable. We've always made it so that you can extend Podcast Producer to fit into your organization and it can then meet your needs. Well Podcast Composer is no exception. As you saw with the Quartz Composer compositions that we're using for let's say dual source, for the titling and the transitions, well since these are Quartz Composer compositions, that means that if you want to write your own, you could integrate them into Podcast Composer. All it takes is you just drop them in the application support folder for Podcast Composer.

The same thing goes for templates. So if you want to write email template, or a blog-posting template, you can create your own, drop it into the folder and then anybody who uses Podcast Composer will have access to those templates. As Eric mentioned, there's also the compressor settings, so now you can create your own very custom settings if you have a particular need, or a particular device that you need to target. And that's what I'm going to show you now.

I'm going to show you how you can customize Podcast Composer. So we're going to switch back here to the demo machine. And I've got some comps already prepared here. So I don't, if you remember in the first demo we saw, what I want to start off with was the animated watermark. So let's go here to my little folder.

So I've got this little Quartz Composer composition that was really easy, really not very complicated. It's just a few patches. And all it is, is it takes in the, it takes in the logo, and it just animates it by rotating it around the Y axis. And you can see just real simple like that. So how do I get this into Podcast Composer?

Well, if I open Podcast Composer here, it's pretty much as you'd expect. I can just go here, grab my Quartz Composer composition, drag it in here, and now I've got my rotating title and I can still do everything I could so with an image, right. I can make it more, a little more darker, I can change the sizing, I can move it into the corner. This is great with Quartz Composer compositions. You can do the same thing with movies. So your watermark can be anything from an image to a movie, to a Quartz Composer composition.

So that's how you make and wrote an animated watermark. So the next one I want to show you is how to create a very a simple title composition. And as Eric explained, we have 2 types of, of compositions, titling compositions in Podcast Composer. The first is what we call a bumper title, which comes before your content. And then we have an overlay title that goes over your content.

So I'm going to show you how to build a bumper title real easily. So we've created this bundle format in, in, for Podcast Composer that's in the documentation and it's going to be documented how to create it. And just for the sake of the demo, I'm really going to concentrate here on the composition itself. And I'm going to start off here with this composition here, which is pretty empty. And I'm going to build up the title for you. So let me just set this up properly so we can all see what's going on.

So we're just going to put this up here. So for the, the titling composition to be able to work with Podcast Composer, it needs to abide to a certain protocol. And what you can see up here on the left here is, is basically this. These are the ports that you're providing to Podcast Composer, so it can pass the information to your composition. And in this example, you can see, you can specify the titling information, maybe an author, date, copyright and so on. I want to do a real simple one.

And we're just going to use the title, so I can get rid of all of these other supports so it looks, so it's not quite so hectic here. Now what I need to do in Podcast, in Quartz Composer is generate an image out of this string and then put it out on, and render it out to the screen.

So to do that, I'm going to go to my patch library, just going to bring up my image with string patch, drop that in here, and I'm also going to need some way of rendering this to the screen. And the easiest way to do that in Quartz Composer is with the billboard patch. So I'm just going to drop this here. And now you're going to see, I've got my titling information coming from Podcast Composer, just going to attach it to the string here.

And I've got my image coming out which I'm just going to connect to my billboard. And you can now see that I have my title being rendered to screen. But it's not quite the right size. So there's a few parameters I can play with. The first thing is, I want it to have the right aspect ratio. And to do that I just need to know, get some information about the rendering destinations. So this patch is just going to tell me, is going to give me information about what size I'm rendering to screen.

So we're just going to connect the width here, the height, and I'm just going to make this text a bit bigger. You see now we're on two lines. And I might even want to make this just a bit wider. And there we go. You can see I've got my title on screen.

That's great. But you see a lot of what we do, and what really makes Quartz Composer powerful is that I can animate all my content. So I, basically here with the exposition you can see here I can play with where my content is. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a timeline to animate this. And so I don't have to, this is what the final patch is going to look like.

I'm just going to steal this timeline here. Oops, that's not what I want to show you yet, we'll get there. So this is the timeline. And if I bring up Inspector here, I can show you what the timeline looks like. And if we look at how the ex, what I've set up for a graph for the exposition, you can see that I'm starting off at -2.

Because when the exposition that -2 well the text is completely off screen. And then I'm going to end up at +2 where my text, my screen is, my text is all the way off to the right side. So basically, I'm going to fly my text in from the left, and it's going to slow down a bit, and then it's going to accelerate off and then fly off to the right.

And that's what this little timeline is doing. So all I have to do now is take my exposition, and I connect it here to my billboard. We start and stop this. We can now see that my text is going to fly in, and then just fly off. That's great.

Maybe I'll want to do one last thing here. And I'm just going to add some alpha to it. So we have the nice little effect of when it flies in it fades in and when it flies out it fades out. So to do that I just have to set the color on the billboard. So if it's black and it's completely opaque, well then it's going to be, the text is going to be black and you're not going to see it.

So to do that, I just need to get a color pack, generate a color here. And the color lets me set different things. But what I'm really interested in is in the alpha. And if we go back to the timeline patch, you can see here that I already have a graph set laid out for the alpha as well.

We start at 0, because at 0 you won't be able to see it, it'll be completely black. And we'll fade up to 1 where it'll be completely opaque and we can see the text. At the same time, when we fly out, so if I bring up the exposition, you can put both on the same graph.

We'll fade out the content. So now if I just hook this to the color, and I hook the color to the billboard, can bring this here, can make it a bit bigger. And we can play it again. And see, now my text flies in, fades in, and it's going to fade out while it flies out. So there you go. That's how you can create Quartz Composer composition. But now how do I get this into Podcast Composer?

Well that's pretty easy too. And I'm going to show you that right now. So I'm just going to go to the bottom here, my simple title, where I have my PQC file. And I'm going to open up a new window here, and we're going to go to the application support folder for Podcast Composer. And you're going to see, there's a lot of folders in here, because there's a lot of things that you can set for Podcast Composer.

And here, we created a composition for the bumper title, so all I have to do here is grab my simple title, and I'm going to copy it into the bumper folder. Now, if I launch Podcast Composer, it's going to automatically pick this new title up. And if I double-click here, you're going to see now in the pop-up I've got my simple title.

[ Clapping ]

 And that's how you can create your own title.

And it's going to fly out. So that's how to create your own title in the Quartz Composer. The next thing I want to show you is the email templates. We ship by default a real good looking email template that works great in mail on the desktop, or even on, mail on the phone.

But it uses the Podcast Capture icon. And I can imagine that maybe there's a few of you out there that for your Podcast, you want to brand these notification emails with the, the logo of your corporation. Well it's very easy to do that as well. And we have these PMU bundles that allow you to create mail unit bundles. And these are basically your mail templates.

So in the same way, you'll see here, I have the corporation logo that I want to use here that I've dropped into the folder. And all I have to do for this thing is in the same way, is if I go back to the application support, let's close down the compositions here.

Go to templates, mail, and I can drag this in here. And now if I re-launch Podcast Composer, and I go down to the notification step, and if I want to add an email now, you'll see that now Podcast Composer's automatically detected that there are different types of mail templates installed on the system. So I can use the Apple generic one, or maybe I want to use my corporation's one.

Now we'll be documenting how to use and how to create all of these different bundles, but it's going to be really straightforward and it's going to be very easy for you just to drop in, in your corporation, or your organization's logo, so you can have your own emails.

And the same thing is going to go for your blog postings and all different other kind of templates. So that's the email template. See, so now we get to have some fun. I don't know how much, how many of you have been following what's happened with Quartz Composer, and well since their session is right now, you probably don't know this yet, quite yet, either. But they have new support in Snow Leopard for 3D models.st=yl8 And you know, we like to have fun with all the new technologies.

So I've downloaded this 3D model of a billboard that, you know, I can play around with, it's kind of cool. But what's really cool is with Quartz Composer I can put images onto the different meshes. So if I want to, I could put any kind of video on my billboard. So that's what we did. So let me show you what happens if I drag this one in to my dual source composition template folder.

Here we go. Just copy that in there. And this is just to give you an idea how you can brand your own dual source compositions and how you could go out and really have fun with Quartz Composer. But it's also a great third party integration point if you're a third party out there that knows how to use Quartz Composer and you're really good at it, you can write some really great bundles of stuff and integrate with Podcast Composer. So this is, you see now that I've got my little billboard down here, so you see wow, it doesn't look that different. Well, until we zoom out, and you might kind of recognize the building in the back there with the two billboards.

So that's kind of small. So let's play that in a bigger screen. And of course, you can play around, you can animate your three different, your 3D models.s=tylY What, it's having trouble finding the screen. So there you go.

[ Clapping ]

 So if you really want to have fun.

[ Clapping ]

 I think my manager thinks I'm always playing with Quartz Composer.

[ Chuckles ]

 So that was the demo for how to customize Podcast, Podcast Composer. So what you should take home from here. Well, as with Leopard, Podcast user workflows are still as powerful and easy to use. But with Podcast Composer, we've made it easier than ever for you to customize and create really beautiful podcasts. But we haven't stopped just there.

We let you extend it and incorporate your own content extremely easily. And if the third party is out there, we have tons of little hooks for you to bring in your content and your own expertise. Podcast Composer also ties in with all of the new features that we've been talking about all week.

You saw that there's direct integration with a Podcast library. We tightened straight with a dual source, so you can choose all your different layouts with Quartz Composer. We tie in with iTunes U, we have the Pro Apps Integration for the Compressor. So it ties right in and it's really at the center of the whole Podcast user workflows.

So for those of you who've been to our presentations before, you know we can't just stop there. We always like to push it a bit further and show you how powerful Podcast user workflows are. And we've kind of had some fun, and I guess it's time for this year's crazy workflow.

[ Clapping ]

 So, we know that transcription is a really important thing for a lot of you out there. And for those of you who were here last year, we showed you a really early prototype from MacSpeech that allowed you to automate everything. But we know that a lot of you need this transcription integration like yesterday. So we worked on a little demo. And I think we're going to show you how you can integrate Podcast Producer with external services really simply. And to do that, I'm going to bring up Circlaeys and Sons Transcription Service. So we've got Eric Circlaeys and his son Nader.

[ Chuckles ]

 And what we're going to do is I'm going to launch straight into, the one more thing demo. So what I'm going to do here. Oh, to do this, I'm going to give about two or three sentences that we're going to have them transcribe. But I need some type of topic. And just so you guys don't think this is all staged, you're going to have to give me a topic that I'm going to have to invent some sentences about.

 Beer.

 Beer.

[ Chuckles ]

 How come I wasn't even expecting that one?

[ Chuckles ]

 So, I'm going to log into Podcast Capture.

[ Silence ]

 Okay. Getting sick yet? No.

[ Silence ]

 So beer is a very popular drink.

[ Laughter ]

 I'm sure a lot of you really like it very much.

[ Laughter ]

 My favorite beer is Guiness.

[ Clapping ]

 So, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to publish this to a workflow that we have set up here. And we're going to call this beer.

[ Silence ]

 Do talk. Okay. So while this is processing, I'm going to explain what's happening. What we've done with this workflow is the, so Podcast Capture is uploading into the Podcast User Server. And what is the Podcast User Server doing? Well the first thing it's going to do is it's going to create a low res version of the, of the, the content that we just submitted.

What's happening then is that the low res version is being transferred to the SFTP to Circlaeys and Sons Transcription Service. And they've written a little app here, that I can show you real quick and give you a little look at, that allows him to transcribe the content. And he forgot his headset. So he's going to be transcribing, so Eric's going to be writing in French, and he's going to be translating this straight.

And Eric, and then Nader's going to be writing it in English. They're going to transcribe it and they're going to create the TextML files straight in this application. And then, in QuickTime, something that you may not have heard yet, is that there's a new TextML importer that allows you to import TextML tracks as subtitles, and the same thing goes for closed captioning tracks. But while they're processing this, we can paralyze it. So not only with Xgrid can we paralyze tasks in parallel, but we can put them in parallel.

So while they're transcribing, we're also encoding the iPod version with all of the video editing and the Quartz Composer compositions. And what's going to happen then is once the iPod version is finished encoding the Xgrid is going to use one of the new features of Xgrid in Snow Leopard, which is what we call the retry task. So what it's going to do is it's going to poll the out-going folder on the SFTP Server from the transcription service to see if the transcription is ready.

If it's not ready, with the retry task the job can tell the Xgrid controller to reschedule it in a certain amount of time. So you don't have to lock up a whole CPU just polling the SFTP Server. How are we looking? So once the task has figured out that the, the transcriptions are available, it'll just download them, and then it'll add them into the final content. So, let's take a look at the content. Going to go to iTunes here. Well, going to refresh this. So we have back-up content in case.

And here we go.

[ Silence ]

[ Background noises ]

 And you can see here that iTunes has popped up the subtitle track here. And that we have two subtitles, English and French. So, let's see how good a job Eric.

[ Chuckles ]

 Eric and Nader did. Well, I think Nader needs to work on his transcription.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Inaudible ]

[ Chuckles ]

[ Inaudible ]

 And you know transcription is great, but you know, you can also translate it.

 So beer is a very popular drink.

 So here, you have the French subtitles.

 I'm sure a lot of you really like it very much.

 So that's how we've made it possible for you to integrate with.

[ Laughter ]

 Existing transcription service.

 My favorite beer is Guiness.

 And, this, come back to this slide. So this is a work phone. I think it's going to be really useful to a lot of you. And, you know, when we started showing this off, a lot of people really wanted it.

So we'll be talking about it at the lab on Friday. So if you have any interest, please come and talk with us. And we'll also be working on making it sample code. And we'll be documenting it, so it will, make it as easy as possible for you to integrate with your existing transcription services.

[ Clapping ]

 Okay. But then, that ended up being a kind of a useful demo. So, we've got one more last thing. And we've got a little fun demo here and as always the point of this is to show you that since Podcast User Workflows rely on Xgrid, they can do anything you can write a command line tool to do.

So we've got a little thing we've prepared for you. And something we've noticed in education, and what we think is kind of cool is a lot of people are using technology to make the classroom a lot more interactive. And there's some cool tools out there, like Mobile AP that allow you to have web applications to have students interact with the lecturers, or the professors. So they can ask questions, they can vote on polls, they can leave comments, all sorts of things. So we randomly selected a few of you, and I'm going to invite you to come up right here in front of the stage.

And strangely enough, they're all in the front row, I don't know why.

 Don't be afraid.

 And they all have Apple badges, huh. I'll have to work on my random algorithms. Hopefully next year we're going to open this up to everybody. But just want it to work this year.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Laughter ]

 So, you guys are probably going to want to, well you watch there, you can watch up there. And you guys, don't help them yet. We'll come back to you guys. You can help them aft, afterwards. And we're going to switch the demo machine.

[ Inaudible ]

 Is everybody logged in? Okay. So the first question, you ready? Oh, I'm not logged in.

 I don't have a.

 Okay. Start off.

 Yeah.

 Okay. So first question, going to have to tell us where this monument is. You guys go to the first question, and where is this?

[ Silence ]

 [Inaudible].

 Okay. You guys ready for question number two?

 Yes.

 Let's go. Where's this monument?

Dee, do, do, do.

 [Inaudible].

 Timbuktu, no? Okay. Third question. Last one, this is a bit harder. You guys ready?

 [Inaudible].

[ Chuckles ]

 There's one little detail I need to let you know. Okay. Okay. That was the quiz.

 Thank you.

 Thanks everybody.

[ Clapping ]

 So we'll see. So we're going to submit this to Podcast Composer, Podcast Producer. We're going to go over what the results are. And we'll see how everybody did. I think there might be a few surprises. So, answers, let's play this back.

So what was the answer to question one?

 [Inaudible].

[ Chuckles ]

 Well, it was Vegas. So how could you tell? Well there's no buildings right next to the, to the Eiffel Tower in France. Didn't say it was an easy quiz.

 Question number two.

 Question number two. Wow, there's some good ones.

So how did you tell it was in Paris?

 [Inaudible].

 Shorter.

[ Laughter ]

 But you know it's kind of hard to tell in a picture. The easiest way to tell is the base. Something you might not know though is that, so the Statute of Liberty was a present by the French Republic to the United States. But it's Eiffel who actually constructed and designed structure that holds up the Statute of Liberty.

So that's why there's one in Paris. So question number three. This one's a bit harder. It's Tokyo. See there's cherry trees.

[ Chuckles ]

That wasn't Anaheim.

[ Chuckles ]

 Okay, is our workflow finished?

 Yes.

 It is? Let's see how you guys did. So what we did, before we start playing it back, is we're going to use Podcast Producer and with a command line, with all of our command line tools, we're using Mobile AP as the web application. So what everybody up here was doing is they were logged into Mobile AP on their iPhones, and they had the questions, and they had the different results, the different, the multiple answers that they could choose from.

And they would choose them, and they would submit. This goes into the database on the Mobile AP, and then when the Podcast Producer Command ran it knew what time we started and stopped the recording. And it could interrogate the database to find out what answers were written. Then we then kind of used Quartz Composer because, yes, I have always have to have fun in Quartz Composer, to do some fun little animations.

So here's what it looks like.

 [Inaudible].

 Took a while to start. So, this worked right, we should see who voted. And you can see, what.

 Wow.

 People voted.

 Wow it really [inaudible].

 So, some people got it. I think some people had already seen the answers. Question number two. So let's see how they did. New York, got a lot of people, one person got it right, two, ooh three.

[ Chuckles ]

 And one last one.

This was the hardest one.

[ Silence ]

[ Chuckles ]

[ Laughter ]

 See it took a while to figure it out. Yeah, it's still thinking about it.

 Oh London.

 Okay. Cool. So this is just to show you what you can do.

[ Clapping ]

 So just to give you an idea. I mean you can really do whatever you want with Podcast Producer. And if you want to write your custom one workflows, you can really, I mean, the bounds are only limited by your imagination.
