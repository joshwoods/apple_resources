WEBVTT

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.109
>> My name is Jussi-Pekka Mantere.

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.199
I am Engineering Manager in the Mac OS X Server Team.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.099
Brendan Langoulant will join me later.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.570
He's Engineering Manager on the Address Book Team.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.710
So what are the topics for today?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.929
So we'll talk about contacts, if you couldn't
tell that from the session description.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.159
So we'll go over contacts, how
we use them, where we use them.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.109
We'll go over where we use them on the
iPhone, what are new features on iPhone 3.0

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.130
and Address Book in Snow Leopard, new features there.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.120
And final, we'll conclude with the Address
Book Server in Mac OS X Server in Snow Leopard.

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:49.719
So a little bit of a background for people
who don't know what really contacts are.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.769
So, personal contacts.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.890
So this is basically people you interact in day and day out.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.329
So this could this be your family, this could
be your friends, could be your colleagues,

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.070
basically people you interact with regular basis.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.900
Contacts for these people, you'd keep them on your
phone, on your desktop so they could be on any device.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.320
And if you have multiple devices that
you have your contacts on, you sync them.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.289
So you have an iPhone, you sync that
with your Mac OS X Address Book.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.120
On Windows you would have iTunes sync to the Windows Address
Book and you might also use some services on the cloud,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.850
such as MobileMe or Google and Yahoo and
use those to store your contacts centrally.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:36.869
And you also have Work Contacts and the
distinction here is that, in your office,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.680
you probably have something like a directory.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.420
So this includes like everybody in your company that you
may interact with at some point, email or chat or call,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.159
but you don't necessarily have them in your--

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.219
in your Contacts Data Base in your Address
Book or on the Contacts on the iPhone.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.620
And you-- in the workplace you might also
have some contacts that are private to you.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.939
So the distinction here is that your private work
contacts may be some things like business partners

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:12.189
and these aren't your personal contacts, you don't interact
with these kind of contacts in your off-work-hours life.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:19.539
But they are people that you work with in your
work environment and might not have available

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.329
in the company directory because they're private to you.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.700
And in your work environment, your
contacts would be stored on a server.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:32.269
So right now, that's most typically Exchange
setup and coming up with Mac OS X Snow Leopard,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.130
you might also store the contacts on Address Book Server.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.490
So that's personal and work contacts.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.330
So where do you use these contacts?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.870
Well basically it's anywhere, everywhere, so
you search for contacts and you might mail them.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.789
You do chatting.

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.729
You schedule with your contacts.

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.159
You try to find a location.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.099
You map your contacts if it's a restaurant.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.639
You call them on your iPhone and you
might share your contacts using vCards.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:04.399
So contacts are all around us all the time
and it's kind of, it's like ubiquitous thing

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.120
that we don't really pay attention to,
well except when things don't work,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.599
but it's just pervasive in our day-in-day-out lives.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.000
So we email people, we use contacts.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.240
We chat or call people, we use contacts.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.800
We find locations, we use contacts.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.219
So that's using contacts.

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.770
So what are the Apple solutions for working with contacts?

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.600
So, let's start from the small to the big.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.699
So on the iPhone, we have the iPhone Contacts application.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.109
On Mac OS X, we have the Address Book application.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.160
And new in Mac OS X Snow Leopard,
we have the Address Book Server.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.659
So we'll talk about that in detail later.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:44.990
So let's start with the small.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.180
So, on the iPhone.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.379
So what are the contacts solutions on the iPhone?

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.319
So right now, your iPhone Contacts is probably
a merge of personal and work contacts,

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.900
so this is the pool of people you connect to or interact

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.300
with by using your iPhone, call
people or text them or whatnot.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.450
And your contacts are synced to the desktop.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:17.909
So again, using iTunes you would sync your contacts
between your Address Book on Mac OS and the iPhone.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.330
And iPhone 2.0 introduced ActiveSync.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.120
So it might also have your work contacts from your
office environment on the iPhone using ActiveSync.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.620
And new in iPhone 3.0 is the ability to
connect to your corporate directory using LDAP.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.470
So that's something we introduced in 3.0 and
sometimes that can be a little bit tricky to configure.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.370
So if you're not familiar with iPhone Configuration Utility,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.220
I highly recommend that you take a
look at that on Apple's download site.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.830
So if you ever tried to type in, a let's
say, search path for LDAP on the iPhone,

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:03.039
"DC, CN=blah, blah, blah, DC=, C=something."

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.960
That's a fairly painful exercise.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.060
So if you provide your users with
just text instructions on how

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.319
to configure your iPhone they may not
necessarily use this service so much.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:19.360
So we have a way in iPhone Configuration
Utility, now to configure LDAP search paths

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.600
that are accessible through the iPhone Contacts application.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.800
So if you know that your company
supports an LDAP directory and you know

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.770
that your organization has iPhone users
deployed, you might as well do your users a favor

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:39.099
and use iPhone Configuration Utility to
create a configuration profile for LDAP search

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.870
that tells them exactly how the iPhone should be configured,
and users can just download the configuration file,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.379
or receive it by email and then their LDAP search on
the phone would be configured automatically for them

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.189
without them having to type anything by hand.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.110
So let me bring up Brendan Langoulant.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.009
So he'll show some of the new features
on iPhone Contacts, Brendan?

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.360
[ Applause ]

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.710
[ Pause ]

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:16.810
>> Good morning, so just as Jussi
was saying, one of the great things

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.579
about this demo is actually that
I don't have to type so much.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:23.870
So with-- as you can see this is a
standard iPhone 2.0 configuration.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.329
I've got one Exchange account configured.

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:29.329
And so what I'm going to show you is actually an IPCU file--

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:33.719
profile that's been emailed to me that I'm
going to configure my LDAP search with.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.010
So you can see here, I've got an email, here's
an attachment, I simply click on the attachment,

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.730
and it asks me, "Would you like to configure?"

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.000
I say "install."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.740
[ Pause ]

00:06:51.740 --> 00:07:00.300
>> Great. So now if I go back to my
contacts, you notice we have a new entry.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:09.370
So the new entry-- my LDAP search is now configured,
probably the easiest LDAP configuration I've ever done.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:16.120
And you can see that it searches and I can
find results just like you would expect.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:24.420
OK, so also, something which is available
in 2.0 and just to go through it.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.170
You can see we have the Exchange global address list.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.699
It searches much like an LDAP would search.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.789
Again, it's a directory of people
and I have my private contacts.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.140
So I have my VIPs and the rest of my contacts.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:44.500
Great. So that's iPhone LDAP automatic
configuration from IPCU.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.339
Back to Jussi.

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:49.089
[ Applause ]

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:51.979
>> Alright, so thank you Brendan.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.960
So that's iPhone and new features in iPhone.

00:07:55.959 --> 00:08:05.259
So LDAP requires, obviously an LDAP server,
requires 3.0 version of the iPhone operating system.

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:10.629
ActiveSync on the phone requires
Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:15.199
and works also with Exchange Server version 2007.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:22.589
If you use iPhone Configuration Utility for any of the
policies, you'll need Exchange 2007 Service Pack 1.

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:25.339
So that's the iPhone section.

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:28.259
So let's move on to the desktop solution.

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:32.279
So Mac OS X Address Book.

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:33.629
So what do we have there?

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:38.429
So in Address Book, on the desktop right
now, you have your personal contacts again.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:43.459
So you could be syncing these using
either MobileMe or Google or Yahoo,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.030
and you would sync these using
iTunes, again, to your mobile device.

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:55.220
And the work contacts in Address Book on the
desktop can be in a directory system such LDAP,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.430
or you could access them from interactive system over LDAP.

00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:09.459
And if your clients are bound using a directory service
binding for a corporate network, if you use network logins

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.150
for example, then Address Book would also allow you
to search using the Directory Services interface.

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:18.169
So this is no manual configuration required.

00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:21.250
So you might be bound to an Open Directory environment.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.769
You might be bound to an Active Directory environment.

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:29.350
And Address Book application will automatically
do searches against these directory systems

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:35.139
without any user configuration outside of
binding their clients to the directory system.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:40.299
And what's new in Address Book in Mac OS 10.6
in Snow Leopard, is support for Exchange.

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:49.250
So again, we can use contacts stored on an
Exchange server and use the contacts there.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:57.750
So back to Brendan, and he'll show you
some of these new features in Address Book.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.149
>> OK. So I've been responsible for Exchange
on the desktop across all three applications.

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:08.689
And we've been working really hard to make this the
easiest to use Exchange setup that you've ever seen.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:13.680
So really, what I'm going to do, is we support all of
the-- as you can see I have got the standard configuration.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.489
>> It is a simple Address Book as you can get.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.370
I've got one group and I've got all of my local contacts.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:27.990
So what I'm going to do now is
actually add an Exchange account.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:38.470
So with Exchange, we've spent a lot of time basically trying
to make auto-configure work as seamlessly as possible.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.639
So you simply provide an email address and
your password which hopefully I type correctly.

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:50.490
Now it's going out, it's looking for the
auto-discovery server, in a minute it will find it.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.460
And you can see now, it actually figured out all of settings
that I made to actually configure this Exchange account.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.750
Also you'll see, that I can set up both
the mail client and iCal at the same time.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.409
So you can actually do that.

00:11:02.409 --> 00:11:05.049
You can set your Exchange accounts
up from any of the applications

00:11:05.049 --> 00:11:09.000
and it will automatically set up the other two applications.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.720
[ Pause ]

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.070
>> I'll give it a different name.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.259
So now what you can see is, I have
my Exchange account has appeared.

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:26.000
I have a set of contacts on that Exchange account.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.629
And just like you saw, exactly on the same as the iPhone,
I've got those same folders that the iPhone is syncing to.

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:37.149
So it has collected those contacts and
has showed me all of my private contacts.

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:41.579
We also have a directory search mode so
that I can search the global address list.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:50.830
And just like I have on the phone, I can search--
it will give me results from that directory.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:59.139
So generally, our approach to integrating Exchange
on the desktop has been to follow what Microsoft--

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:02.620
how Microsoft tries to use Exchange, in particular Outlook.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.360
But then what we've tried to do is actually
leverage, I guess, the way that Mac uses--

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.090
used to configuring an application or using an application.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:17.889
So, if you see here, I've got this group called VIP.

00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:23.000
So it's actually folder called "VIP," and that's good.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.529
[ Pause ]

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:30.500
>> So I can create a new address.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.769
And if type VIP, what will happen is,
that will actually use that folder,

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:39.870
much like a group mailing list and
actually it will expand in line.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.350
So that's something which Exchange
doesn't do, or Outlook doesn't do.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.899
But we've actually kind of extended
that with the standard Mac experience.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.509
So what happens if you're not using Exchange?

00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:52.240
And for that I'll bring back Jussi.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.789
[ Applause ]

00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:55.599
>> Yes, great demos.

00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:00.840
So, before we move on, Exchange Requirements again.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.840
So, we need Mac OS X Snow Leopard for the
desktop to be able to support Exchange.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.670
So go get those 29 dollar copi)es and spread them wide.

00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:21.149
For the Service side, we need Update Rollup 4
for Exchange Server 2007 SP1, URFES 2007 SP1.

00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:32.929
And that's basically all you need to get your work
contacts that are now on Exchange accessible for the Mac.

00:13:32.929 --> 00:13:36.469
So moving on, new in Mac OS X Snow Leopard.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.980
So this is Mac OS X Server Address Book Server.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.659
So we introduced this last year as
part of the developer conference.

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:50.319
And now this is included in the builds
that are distributed during the conference.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:57.930
So the current DVDs that you have, have the full
implementation of the Mac OS X Server Address Book Server.

00:13:57.929 --> 00:14:00.409
So about Server Contacts.

00:14:00.409 --> 00:14:03.819
So typically, why would you have a server?

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:11.520
So this is ideal where you have multiple devices
that are using some service like mail or contacts

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:14.439
and using a server account always remain up to date.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:21.020
So you could have a single account on a server and
all your data no matter where you access it from,

00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:24.159
from what ever device, it's always current.

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:32.079
And additionally, you may have some server enabled
features, such as, search, or sharing, or what not,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.280
because it's guaranteed to be available
and it's not just restricted

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:39.379
to applications that you'd use like mail for messaging.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:45.189
You might have things like global address lists on
Exchange that are only provided through a server

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.650
that you wouldn't be able to implement
just using your local context for example.

00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:58.250
So, servers are pretty cool things for
doing more advanced usage of these services.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.720
So for Mac OS X.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.090
So we have a suite of communication applications.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:09.550
So we have your mail application, you
have calendaring, chatting, and contacts.

00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:13.949
So for all of these we also have
great servers on Mac OS X Server.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:20.460
So we have a mail server that your mail clients
can connect to and retrieve and send mail.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:26.680
We have a calendar server, so you can now
have scheduling in a server environment

00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:30.549
or leverage in a server, we have a chat server.

00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:34.099
And all of these basically implement their typical things.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.080
But for contacts, we really don't have
anything right now-- for protocols, excuse me.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.889
So for protocols, we have always
followed the standards path.

00:15:44.889 --> 00:15:48.850
So for our messaging protocols,
we're not doing anything proprietary.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:57.670
We're using the IETF standards or the RFCs for either
messaging or for calendaring or for instant messaging.

00:15:57.669 --> 00:16:03.279
So everything that we built in to the server
is open standards based, it's extensible.

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:07.949
So we don't embrace and extinguish, we embrace and extend.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:13.590
So you have the freedom of choice and you're
not locked-in into any particular platform.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.370
So standards are important to us.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:19.360
So if you choose OS X server, you're
choosing open standards.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:25.779
But for contacts, there really hasn't been
an equivalent of a CalDav or IMAP or SMTP.

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:33.000
But just in the past couple of years, there has been
development on the IETF work groups to develop a standard

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.480
for contacts based on servers and
that standard is called CardDAV.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.769
And we've build the Mac OS X Address
Book Server on top of CardDAV.

00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:46.809
And that's what we introduced last year,
and that's what we're now had made available

00:16:46.809 --> 00:16:49.679
to you on the DVDs distributed here.

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:52.479
So let's look back.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.649
So we built the Calendar server in
Mac OS X Server Leopard in 10.5.

00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:01.860
And what is Calendar server really?

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:08.690
In the essence of it, it's a protocol that allows you
access to web stored resources, and that's WebDAV.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:12.870
And the data format is pretty much calendar events.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:18.349
So iCalendar files that are reachable by
the clients over the network using WebDAV.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.359
So that gives us CalDAV.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.409
There are other pieces to CalDAV
for, like discovering free visit

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.380
[ phonetic] and whatnot.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:29.160
But in the essence of it, it's dealing
with iCalendar files over the network.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.370
So that's what's left.

00:17:31.369 --> 00:17:34.559
And that's a standard that's been out there for a while.

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:41.730
And for contacts, we already have a standard
for contact Exchange, so that's vCard.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.690
So vCard was developed years and years ago
by a consortium, Apple is a part of that.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:52.759
And if we look at Exchanging vCards over the network, we
could utilize exactly the same infrastructure that we have

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:59.480
for CalDAV that is using WebDAV as
the network transport mechanism.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.549
And instead of moving iCal files
around and doing scheduling,

00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:08.829
we can move vCards around and do contact discovery.

00:18:08.829 --> 00:18:11.929
So that gives us CardDAV.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:18.320
So vCard's really a ubiquitous standard for
changing or exchanging contact information.

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:24.809
So this is something that pretty much
every device known to man understands

00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:27.289
and writes if they have anything to with contacts.

00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:29.420
Your phone will understand vCards.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:35.960
Your laptop, be it Windows or was it running
Windows or Mac OS X will understand vCards.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:41.360
So vCards, you can pass them around and expect
that the information will be transferred

00:18:41.359 --> 00:18:45.529
from application to application without any issues.

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:50.720
There's one unique thing in vCards in
the CardDAV server in the CardDAV space.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.950
So in CardDAV, we need to be able
to uniquely identify vCards.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.440
So there's a requirement for any
vCard that's stored on the server.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.450
So it has a unique ID attached to that.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:07.740
Most of the clients will take care of that
when they store the contacts on the server.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.620
So, a little bit more about the CardDAV.

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:13.699
So CardDAV again, is based on existing standards.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:19.200
We use XML, we use HTTP, we use
WebDAV, and ACLs on top of that.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.080
And as the payload, we have vCard.

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:28.669
So it tells you how to use Address
Book collections over the network.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.960
So it also defines where these resources are stored.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:40.900
So it tells the client where their Address Book
collections are and defines a hierarchy of objects.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.810
So in the end there will be vCards in some path on a server.

00:19:45.809 --> 00:19:50.539
So CardDAV defines that nomenclature as well.

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:56.940
And finally, CardDAV has extensions,
just like CalDAV has extensions

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.190
for calendaring, for freebies [phonetic], and whatnot.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.970
CardDAV has extensions for contact-specific domain.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:12.660
So for example, if you want to do a search, there's
a CardDAV feature for doing search against contacts.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.610
And these are called "reports.

00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:19.909
>> So we use reports to discover your
Address Book collection for example.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.850
We use reports to do searches against the server.

00:20:22.849 --> 00:20:30.359
So these are extensions on top of the DAV
protocol and that are unique to CardDAV.

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:37.349
So, here are all the nomenclatures
about vCard, WebDAV, and CardDAV.

00:20:37.349 --> 00:20:46.619
So all the good RFCs are there, SSL, there's DAV,
there's HTTP, and extensions that we use in CardDAV.

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:52.029
So the server implements a method for
creating new Address Book collections.

00:20:52.029 --> 00:21:01.309
So creating an Address Book on the server and that is
using the-- make a collection extension to DAV protocol.

00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:08.279
And all of these are still-- the vCard protocol
itself, excuse me, CardDAV specification is still

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:15.139
in ratification going through final runs of comments
and should be standardized as an RFC momentarily

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.970
in the next weeks or months, but soon, we hope.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:23.769
So without further ado, let me invite Brendan back.

00:21:23.769 --> 00:21:27.269
And he'll show you how Address
Book Server on the client works.

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:35.069
>> So about this time, you should be
starting to notice a theme in these demos.

00:21:35.069 --> 00:21:42.250
So now, I'm going to add a CardDAV account.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.190
Oops sorry.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:50.000
I suppose-- I was hiding the account
configuration for CardDAV.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.089
[ Laughs ]

00:21:55.089 --> 00:21:57.539
>> So again, we create an account.

00:21:57.539 --> 00:22:04.920
I'll give it a different name.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:10.680
>> And you'll see now, again, I have my private
contacts on the CardDAV server, they've been downloaded.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.640
CardDAV has groups.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.120
So we have our supplier, Intel.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:18.219
So again, and also I can do directories.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.110
And so if I go in here, you can actually
see-- I can search the CardDAV server

00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:23.679
And again, I'm doing a directory search.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.060
This time it's going through CardDAV.

00:22:25.059 --> 00:22:27.190
The previous times were Exchange.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.080
So, what you'll notice now is actually, we've-

00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:36.599
Address Book is really starting to come
of age as a network contact base manager.

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:40.230
And so, we started to get this
hierarchy of different sources.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:45.110
And one of things we thought was really important is
to allow you to use these in different environments.

00:22:45.109 --> 00:22:48.469
So we want people to be able to use
it in a pure corporate environment

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.400
where you would likely only have one Exchange account.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.920
We also want you to be able to use it at
home, so that you can actually have it

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.250
so that you've got your private contacts or your
personal contacts separated from your Exchange contacts,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.130
but still being able to use both in that home environment.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.370
So as you can see, so that in the
UI they are very separated.

00:23:06.369 --> 00:23:11.619
But also when you're looking for a contact, you often
just want to find the contact, no matter where it is.

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:13.269
So, we've added these higher level constructs.

00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:19.389
So, all contacts will actually look across all of the
different sources through all of my private contacts.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.270
So you'll see the brown folder and all
of brown folders that go beneath that,

00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:28.240
it will actually get an aggregate
of all of those different sources.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.470
Um, you can also do things like setup smart groups.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:38.509
And smart groups would actually again,
search across all of those different sources.

00:23:38.509 --> 00:23:54.710
So if I go back to mail and I show the People Picker, you
can see-- it also reflects all of these different sources

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.750
and in much the same way as the
hierarchy from the Address Book.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.369
Now you can actually address people
directly from the People Picker.

00:24:02.369 --> 00:24:07.719
So hopefully you can see, we've tried to keep
to it as simple as possible and as uniform

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.710
as possible only really changing
it where absolutely necessary.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.000
Thank you.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.730
[ Applause ]

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.539
>> Alright, thank you again, Brendan.

00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:24.289
So, what are the applications that we
support for Address Book Server accounts?

00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:29.240
So as Brendan showed you, the contacts are
available for all the Apple applications.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:36.130
So if you are using mail, if you are using calendaring,
if you are using iChats, the contacts are stored either

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:43.060
on Exchange server or on the Address Book Server, they will
be available through all the applications you'd expect.

00:24:43.059 --> 00:24:46.609
And what about the Address Book Server itself?

00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:49.639
So, this is a feature in Mac OS X Server.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:55.730
And in Mac OS X Server, you have the usual
suspects for administering the service.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:25:00.620
So you will use server preferences, you will
use serveradmin, or you can use serveradmin

00:25:00.619 --> 00:25:03.339
from the command line, or if you're really geeking

00:25:03.339 --> 00:25:09.000
out then you could actually use the web
interface to the serveradmin back-end.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.190
So let me move on to a demo.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:15.700
So let me show you how that is all set up.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.590
OK, so first we have server preferences.

00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:26.189
So for Address Book Server, we have a module in server
preferences and that's basically an on-off switch.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:30.970
So out of the gate, when you were setting
up Mac OS X Server for the first time--

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.480
Mac OS X Server Snow Leopard for the
first time, you would have had an option

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.720
to enable all the usual services including Address Book.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.920
So this would come on for you during setup.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:48.310
So nothing much there, on and off,
and [inaudible] for contacts.

00:25:48.309 --> 00:25:55.179
So if people have large attachments in their vCards,
attachments being binary objects in the vCards,

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:01.440
for example large pictures, you may want to
limit the size of individual Address Books.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.210
But for the admin interface that's
really all the customization we need.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.680
Everything else is set up out of
the box, it works out of the gate.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.450
No tweaking necessary.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:16.490
But if you do want to configure further
aspects of the Address Book service,

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.650
you can use the server admin application.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:25.930
So in server admin, of course we have
a-- let me bring back the overview.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:28.170
So this tells you that the server is running.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:36.930
What you'd expect from server-- server admin, we can
view some of the logs for access log and error logs.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.070
And we have additional settings.

00:26:39.069 --> 00:26:42.779
So these settings are not available
through server preferences because we see

00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:47.220
that these advanced configuration
options that are not typically changed.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:55.720
So the default out of the box configuration is fairly
good standard to use and it will provide your users

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.549
with the expected services that
we think are most useful for that.

00:26:59.549 --> 00:27:04.230
So we define the location where we store the contacts.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:11.259
So if you are using a setup where your server may not
necessarily always retain its data on the boot volume,

00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:17.289
you may want to use a data volume to store the Address
Book Server documents, so you can change that here.

00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:20.579
And you can also change the directory gateway settings.

00:27:20.579 --> 00:27:29.449
So this is the way for the Address Book server clients
over CardDAV to query contacts in a directory system.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:36.350
So that's something that uses the CardDav
reports feature that I mentioned earlier.

00:27:36.349 --> 00:27:43.319
And for authentication, this the way you'd
actually bind a SSL certificate for the service.

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:48.220
Or you could say, use a redirect,
which means that any client

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:54.650
that would connect using the standard
non-secured port for the Address Book Server,

00:27:54.650 --> 00:28:02.269
which now will be redirected to
the SSL secured port for access.

00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:06.190
[Applause] And-- thank you Eric [phonetic].

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:10.340
And this will also be available in other services.

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:14.079
So for example, iCal server has this same option.

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:18.509
So let me revert these settings
and just go back to server admin.

00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:21.519
So, a little bit more about the directory gateway.

00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:28.759
So this is a way for you to provide the Address Book Server
clients on the desktop a way to search your directory.

00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:35.430
So not using Directory Services on the desktop, not using
LDAP on the desktop, but using CardDAV as the conduit.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.200
So what are the benefits of that?

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:43.220
So, then you don't have to have-- if you're using--
if you have people who are outside the Firewall,

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.910
you wouldn't have to have holes in the
Firewall for accessing different protocols

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:52.110
because CardDAV would be using HTTP, you might proxy that.

00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:54.029
You could route that easily.

00:28:54.029 --> 00:29:00.519
So this is probably more acceptable protocol to some
network administrators versus Directory Services or LDAP.

00:29:00.519 --> 00:29:04.900
So let me show you what this looks like on the client side.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:11.650
So here, I have an Address Book application
configured for Address Book Server account.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:19.720
So, I have my adapted DC server here, I have an account for
CardDAV here, and I also have configured an LDAP gateway.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:25.250
So here, I had to type-in the LDAP information by hand.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.400
So this is one of the account types
that Address Book now has.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.970
So as you saw in earlier demos, Brendan
showed you how to configure Exchange

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:39.299
on the Address Book and we have CardDAV, obviously.

00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:46.619
Address Book now supports multiple accounts and there's
really, really no limit to what information you are going

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:50.019
to access to from your Address Book application.

00:29:50.019 --> 00:29:57.029
So for LDAP, the directory search notes
appear in the old directory's note.

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:59.569
So this is kind of confusing, no?

00:29:59.569 --> 00:30:06.929
Because my server is bound to itself, so it is using Open
Directory on the local system and I have configured LDAP

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.269
on the client for Address Book on the client here.

00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:16.150
And I'm also connected to the CardDAV
account and its directory search gateway.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.560
>> So if I perform a search here for John Appleseed.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:21.779
So I get three distinct results.

00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:28.470
One for each source: one for the LDAP search
note, one for the Directory Services support,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.049
and one for the Address Book service search.

00:30:32.049 --> 00:30:38.629
So I can get rid of the LDAP service by
deleting it from the Address Book accounts.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.760
So I can do that easily here.

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:51.180
So now, I don't have the LDAP search note anymore, but
I'm still left with the directory gateway that's served

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.730
by the Address Book Server feature in Address Book.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:01.150
And if my users are in this kind of environment--

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:07.080
if your users are in this kind of environment where
you have configured their systems to always be bound

00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:12.659
to directory system, and that happens to be
the same directory system that is also used

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.720
by the Address Book Server, then this is kind of
redundant, like we don't want to have your users

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.490
to receive duplicate entries for any searches that they do.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.410
So this is not necessarily ideal.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.700
So let me show you how to disable
that feature for this configuration.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:37.170
So I quit Address Book and go back
into the server admin interface.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.050
So I can deselect both of these options.

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:46.480
So this means that I'm disabling the directory
gateway for this server configuration.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:54.470
So, knowing that all my users are using directory bound
systems and they will automatically get the directory search

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.850
in Address Book or mail or whatever applications.

00:31:57.849 --> 00:32:02.589
I don't need to provide the directory
gateway through CardDAV in addition

00:32:02.589 --> 00:32:06.349
to all the other search methods the clients already have.

00:32:06.349 --> 00:32:13.969
So if I now go back to my user and bring up Address Book,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.970
you'll notice that the directory service
note is just a singular note again.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:24.549
So Address Book was smart enough to collapse the search
notes into the single search note that's available to it.

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:30.759
And if this was just the CardDAV account
or the Address Book Server account,

00:32:30.759 --> 00:32:37.750
it would show only the Address Book Server account here
assuming that the system wasn't bound to a directory system.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:46.170
So, that's the way you could tailor the settings through
server admin, to suit your particular environment.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:51.490
So, let me go back to server admin again.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.000
Oops.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.569
[ Pause ]

00:32:58.569 --> 00:32:59.929
>> And while we wait, OK.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.320
So we return.

00:33:01.319 --> 00:33:04.939
So that is the way to disable the directory gateway.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.230
And a little bit more detail about the directory gateway.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:11.180
So what is the difference between
user accounts and shared contacts?

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:16.640
User accounts are exactly that, these are users
who can log-on to the system that have been created

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:23.210
to using work group manager or are in the
actual directory environment as users.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:28.430
Shared contacts are contacts that have been
created using for example, directory app.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:35.269
So depending on your usage environment, if you have lots
of users who have stored contacts using other applications,

00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:41.960
then you may want to enable or disable one
of these options depending on your settings.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.529
So let's bring that back up and that's server admin.

00:33:46.529 --> 00:33:52.920
So OK. So we have a great UI to
administer the service and have ways

00:33:52.920 --> 00:34:00.360
of easily enabling secure transport layer,
enabling certificate use, and what not.

00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:07.000
But under the hood, there are many more
options that are not available through the UI.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.489
So let me hide server admin.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.949
And bring up the command line.

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:16.639
So this is your uber-geek way of administering the service.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:24.699
So for example, if I use the server admin command
line tool, if I can type it correctly, A-D-M-I-N,

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:33.230
Address Book settings, oops, server admin
Address Book-- settings Address Book.

00:34:34.559 --> 00:34:42.929
There. So here are all the settings that are
configurable inside the Address Book Server.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:49.849
So for example, I can look at where
my logs are stored, grep CardDAV.

00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:59.519
So I can see for example, that my access log is stored
in var log CardDAV d which is most likely the case.

00:34:59.519 --> 00:35:05.030
So here, we have var log CardDAV
d and we have the access logs.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.630
For some reason, I may not want to have
these stored in the standard location.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:18.480
So I can actually change the setting and
apply some custom path to the access log.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.949
So let's say, I want to keep it in my
temp directory for whatever reason.

00:35:23.949 --> 00:35:34.659
So let's call it CardDAV-accesslog
and call it TMP/CardDAVaccesslog.

00:35:34.659 --> 00:35:37.829
So I have just now changed the setting for the logging.

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:40.840
And this hasn't taken effect yet
because I haven't restarted the service.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:49.760
So I can see like is there a file
called TMP CardDAV, no such file.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.650
And I can also use the server admin
interface to recycle the service.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:58.320
So I can start stop Address Book.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.330
So now, I have just killed the service.

00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:10.449
So any clients would have lost their connection.

00:36:10.449 --> 00:36:12.539
And I can start it again.

00:36:12.539 --> 00:36:18.750
And now, if I look at the logs, the log
has just moved in to the temp directory.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:24.230
So there are ways of tailoring some of the
settings in the Address Book Server itself

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.650
by using the server admin command line interface.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.160
So this is just one of those settings.

00:36:30.159 --> 00:36:41.009
And a full list of the settings that we have implemented
is available just running the server admin command.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:46.830
And this tells you everything that we have for
authentication and error logs and what not.

00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:55.500
So this might be useful for tailoring some of
the server settings to be more site specific.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:03.599
And yeah, so this is a supported way of configuring
the Address Book Server from the command line.

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:09.279
And there's also a uber-, uber-geek
way of configuring the services.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:21.720
So this is using the webserver that's embedded
into the server admin interface in Mac OS X Server.

00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:27.589
So I could read these settings that I
just showed using the web interface.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:37.030
And here, I have let's say, .log,
here's an error log, oops, error log.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:44.820
So I have the access log and other settings now
available through the web interface as well.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:53.730
So this is extremely high end way of customizing
some of the settings for the Address Book Server.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:38:01.670
So, now, we have gone through the contacts
solutions on Mac OS X on different platforms.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:13.159
So we have contacts on the iPhone, we have contacts on
your desktop using Address Book, we have contacts available

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:18.269
on a server using Address Book
Server new to Mac OS X Snow Leopard.

00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:27.929
And that's the whole gamut of how you could use Apple
services to basically involve your life with either contacts

00:38:27.929 --> 00:38:34.960
on a phone, calling people, or emailing people,
or storing your contacts on Mac OS X Server.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.490
So, that concludes the presentation part.

00:38:37.489 --> 00:38:42.039
So for more information, you can go to Apple's evangelist,

00:38:42.039 --> 00:38:45.809
Mark Malone who's the Evangelist for
Internet and Server Technologies.

00:38:45.809 --> 00:38:49.739
For iPhone specific content, you
can go to the iPhone developer site.

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:53.359
And of course, there's Mac OS X Server site on apple.com.
