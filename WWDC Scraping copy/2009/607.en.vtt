00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.540
>> Welcome to the session on Services & IT--

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.889
>> Hang on.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.620
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.429
We got-- I didn't talk to you about this.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.439
We have some leftover business from the
keynote that I want to take care of.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.010
On behalf of Apple, I want to actually
finish this demo here, so--

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.740
[ Laughter ]

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.469
[ Applause and Cheers ]

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.070
>> Everybody get your iPhone out,
alright, get your iPhone out.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.689
Hold it up here and make a straight line.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.000
It would be great.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500
[ Laughter ]

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.840
[ Noise ]

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.000
>> God damn this is hard.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
[ Laughter ]

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500
[ Noise ]

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.500
[ Balloon Popping]

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000
[ Cheering ]

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.599
[ Applause ]

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:19.579
>> I think this is the first session I've ever done
in 12 years of being in Apple wehre I'm the sane one.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.159
[Laughter] So you're in trouble, but
thank you all for coming here today.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.640
I think what we're going to show you
today is something really remarkable.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.629
You might not have heard a lot about it
in the press, buzz or in the data sheets.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:36.569
But what you're going to see right now is definitely going
to change the way you're going to work on the computer.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:43.299
You will not work on your computers the same way
again after today, and you will be owned by us.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:52.920
Arrrr! [Laughter] So, I am Sal Soghoian and that is
Steve Hayman and welcome to our session here today.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.320
[Laughter] Yes, those are the same slides, OK.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.159
So this was interesting.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.289
It just came out, you know, yesterday
we had our keynote and so,

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.930
this is one of the quotes from Rob Griffiths in Macworld.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.950
"I think this may be one of the more exciting areas
of change in 10.6 for it really turns Services menu

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.560
into something that literally any
user can take advantage of."

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.250
And it is phenomenal what has happened
here in the convergence

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.129
of multiple technologies into a
single point on your computer.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.990
I also want to show one other quote.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.730
This one is from my Aunt Sarah, who
[laughter] epitomized the whole point

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:43.250
about automation, and this-- I run into this all the time.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.699
Everybody we're so busy in our lives that we
don't take time to step back just for a moment

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.629
to learn something that can actually move us forward.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.689
So, I want you to spend a couple minutes today, just step
back from your busy life and invest a couple of minutes

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.129
in absorbing this and making this work for you.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:11.710
So, we're going to talk about [laughter],
so we're-- never leave slides unattended.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.170
[Laughter] So we're going to talk today
about delivering power at the Point-of-Need,

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.559
and we're going to talk a little bit about that.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.590
And all of us who use computers know that computers
are the most powerful for us when the tools

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.710
that we need are nearby the things that we have selected,
and are pertinent to the items that we have selected,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.189
so that they work on that kind of data and we're
not bothered with other choices and other options

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.849
that get in the way of our flow of thought.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.739
And we call this Point-of-Need, and
you're going to see why in just a second.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.140
So today, you're going to learn, these are the mandatory
slides we had to do, changes in Service for Snow Leopard

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.509
and using Services to manage networked
computers, blah, blah, blah.

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.340
OK, so we're going to look at this
from a couple different viewpoints.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.840
One of the viewpoints we're going to look at
is from the IT or the administrator's viewpoint

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.840
of that you're actually controlling a network of people.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.610
So we're going to say "Well, what kind of
tools can we create that make it easier for you

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.870
to do your job on this side of the screen?"

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.000
And we're also going to look at it from the client's
viewpoint as well, as to what kind of tools can you make

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.379
that are going to make their lives easier and
make it easier for them to do the right thing

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.920
that makes the whole workflow work easier.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.629
So these are the 2 viewpoints I want you to keep in mind.

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:41.540
There are actually 3, but keep
these in mind as we go along today.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.620
So, Services architecture has been around
quite a while and it's basically the concept

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.300
that if you have some information selected in one app, you
can use the power of another app to manipulate that data

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.009
and bring it back into the current app that you're in.

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:03.319
And this technology has existed for quite some time
in Mac OS X, and prior to that, in next step as well.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:09.209
And this is what we're going to be talking about today
and what we've done to change this and move it forward.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.810
So Point-of-Need, what is the Point-of-Need?

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.649
Well, let's say we have an audio
file selected in the Finder.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:22.779
And I'm a user and I want to take that audio file
and I want to convert it to like an AAC high quality

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.889
or an Apple loss list or something else.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.209
So where do I go for assistance on doing that?

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:29.879
Do I look over here?

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.199
Well, do I look over here?

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.219
Well, how about over there?

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.170
Do I look up here?

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.379
Well, if we look up there then we get all these
nice menus but there's nothing on this menus

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.750
that has to do with converting an audio file.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.420
So, let's look in the area around what
I have selected and what my focus is on,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.720
and that area is what we call the Point-of-Need
because this is where I need assistance,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.020
this is where I need my tools right here.

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:57.129
My focus is on this point.

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.029
Well within that point, there is a menu that
we provide that's called the Action menu.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:10.199
And this menu is contextual to a degree, in that it
will change based upon the file or the multiple files

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.849
that you have selected, but it really
deals with file management kind of things

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.960
that are gleaned from the Finder's File menu.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:21.659
So it's just the subset of those put in a closer location.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.910
Convenience is nice but the functionality that
we're looking for, for the audio file is not there.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:38.490
Well that's OK, because since the existence of Mac OS X,
there's been this phenomenal technology called Services

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:47.000
that has allowed you to change the name of any audio
file from simplified Chinese into traditional Chinese.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.649
[ Applause ]

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:55.949
>> Yes, the Services menu.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:03.110
And although many of you might look at it and realize
that yes, it is a treasure trove of app functionality

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.740
and goodness, it's been delivered in a manner
that looks pretty much like a dorm room closet.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.180
Yes, the Services menu.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.490
It is pseudo-contextual in that some of
the things that are grayed out changed

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.870
to be some other things that are grayed out.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:31.399
It's not convenient, it's not configurable, it's
not customizable, and it's just downright messy.

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:36.699
But all of these changed when Apple made this.

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:39.149
Now, how is he going to make this bridge?

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:47.949
OK. [Laughter] So with the smaller area to work
with and one of these required as the input device,

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:53.800
it made us rethink our whole strategy
about delivering functionality to the user.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.860
So that if you do something with this device
like take a picture, we need to figure out a way

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:06.860
that we can provide some contextual functionality that's
convenient to you, that gives you the power that you want

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.090
so that you can do something like email the photo.

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:12.589
It's a whole different kind of strategy.

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:21.819
Point-of-Need tools like these are best functioned
when they are contextual, they are convenient,

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:25.620
they are configurable and they are customizable.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.120
When you have all of those, you have a really
great environment to work in as a user.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:38.940
Now on the phone, they are contextual and convenient but
we can still take these concepts and apply them to the OS

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.040
which is exactly what we did in Snow
Leopard, starting with contextuality.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:51.629
So now, in Snow Leopard, if you have an audio file selected
and you go to the Action menu, you actually see a service

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:58.330
down there that has something to do with an audio file,
right there where you need it at the Point-of-Need.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.230
If you have an image file selected,
Services dealing with images will appear.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:09.820
If you have an RTF file selected, Services
dealing with them, if you have a PDF file,

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.890
Services dealing with them will appear as well.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:18.220
So it is contextual based upon the kind
of data that is currently selected.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.710
In addition, it's convenient because not
only do you have the current Services menu

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.940
that has now been reorganized and made much cleaner.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:36.180
You also have-- [Applause] You also have the
Action menu and an Applications Contextual menu.

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:40.719
So in the Finder you have 3 different
locations to get access to this as well.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.019
In most applications, you have a
Contextual menu and the Services menu.

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:50.250
In addition, we handle other kinds
of data besides files and folders.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.649
For example, if you have text selected,
we tie in with the Data Detector

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:57.559
so that you can do things with text within a word processor.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:07.149
Or if you're on a browser like Safari and you control click,
you can bring up Services that pertain to the selected text.

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:14.350
If you are in the terminal and you have text selected, you
could even bring up your favorite Services for doing things

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.529
in the terminal, because the terminal
support is contextual Services as well.

00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:24.439
>> Even in iChat, you can select text in your chat
and bring up Services to do things whatever, you know,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.720
bring in import data URLs, those kinds
of things into your conversation.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.639
So we've gone a step further, not only do
we make them contextual and convenient,

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:37.649
but now we've also made them configurable.

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:41.449
[ Applause ]

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:52.360
>> Woo! Yes for the first time you can now enable
and disable your Services, and in addition to that,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.779
you can assign keystrokes to them so that
that's the applause one right there, right.

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:00.110
[ Applause ]

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.279
>> So you can add your favorite keystrokes to whatever
you want to do so you don't even have to bring

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:09.169
up a contextual menu, you just type the keystroke and
the Service fires off with whatever you have selected.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:16.019
And then one step further beyond that, we figured out
how to customize them using the power of Automator.

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:21.360
Automator that we introduced back in Tiger
has grown and grown in functionality and use.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:28.720
It is basically a visual way to construct a workflow
by dragging different parts of automation recipe

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.600
into an ordered pattern and then running that.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.649
You can save those as workflow files and then execute them.

00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:39.799
Well, we took this great architecture and
we tied it with the Services architecture

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:44.149
so now you can use Automator to create your own Service.

00:11:44.149 --> 00:11:50.049
This is our new Template Picker when you open up
Automator and you see that Services one of the options.

00:11:50.049 --> 00:11:57.500
When you select Choose, you'll get a new workflow
with an Input Settings bar across the top.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:03.279
In this Input Settings bar, you can indicate the
input data type, well are you working with text

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.240
or you're working with files those kinds of things.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.970
Which application do you want to run this
Service in, and do you want to run them

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.649
in all Services or just a particular one.

00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:15.980
And do you want the results of the
workflow replace the selection.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.990
So this really changes the way that you work.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:26.440
And when it comes to input data types, we tie them with
data detectors so we support the standard text ones

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:34.560
of URLs addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, those
kinds of things, as well as the standard file types,

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:39.359
some are, you know, favorites audio files, movie
files, you know, files and folders of those kind.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.810
And for those that use Remote Desktop,
and how many of you use Remote Desktop?

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:48.009
Whoa! Nader look, whoa,
he's beaming, he's beaming.

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:49.939
You are Nader's children, he's beaming.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.000
[ Laughter ]

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.429
>> So what we've implemented here is that if you have
Remote Desktop installed on your computer remote desk--

00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:03.799
remote computers becomes a data type that you can
select, so this means that within Remote Desktop,

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:10.789
you can contextually click computers or computer lists
in the Remote Desktop window and apply Services to them.

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:14.879
Woo! Steve is going to go crazy
on that one, yeah you're right

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:17.289
Yeah, he's frothing over there.

00:13:17.289 --> 00:13:23.500
So and you could also chose to have no input so that your
Service just runs on its own, maybe does get some data

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.600
from the web and brings it to you or whatever you want.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.920
But basically once you've decided your input type and you
just declare what kind of application you're working in,

00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:34.409
then you add Automator actions
like you do to any other workflow.

00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:43.269
And because they are Automator actions, you can do things
like show when run, and then when you save your Service,

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:47.340
it automatically gets put into the Services' architecture.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.509
So that when you have the appropriate
data type or file type selected,

00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:56.730
your Service that you just created
appears on the menu, you can execute it.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.170
And if you chose to have some UI appear, it will appear.

00:14:00.169 --> 00:14:05.699
You can then choose the parameters for
applying the Service and then execute it

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.790
on the selected items right in the desktop.

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:11.509
Yeah.

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:15.220
[ Applause ]

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:22.639
>> So, Services in Snow Leopard are contextual,
convenient, configurable, and customizable.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:25.090
That's a dramatic step forward.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:29.629
And let me show some of them to you.

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:35.299
So here we have 4 different kinds of
data files in the Finder, in the folder,

00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:39.209
and I've selected I go to the contextual
menu, I can chose rotate clockwise

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.389
and it will apply right to the file in the desktop.

00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:48.899
If I select a PDF file I can encrypt it on
the fly, if I like, OK type in the password.

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:49.389
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:54.649
>> Yes, the password was Apple, that's correct.

00:14:54.649 --> 00:14:56.740
[ Laughter ]

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.899
>> And if I chose the audio file over here, if I select
the audio file, I can bring up and say like encode

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:07.480
to iTunes audio format and pick the kind of format
that I want like iTunes Plus and apply that to it right

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.420
in the desktop, I can even take, for example, an
RTF file and I can bring up the contextual menu

00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:16.399
and convert it to an HTML version if I like.

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:22.299
So you can see that having a tool at
the Point-of-Need is really handy.

00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:27.439
My focus stays right there I don't
have to open that file up into Preview,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.040
save it again as something else, do something else.

00:15:30.039 --> 00:15:32.029
I'm on my workflow, I'm focused on it.

00:15:32.029 --> 00:15:34.659
I can get my job done.

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:38.389
Now this also applies to other kinds of files.

00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:46.889
For example here I have an invitation for a cookout,
it has an address, I can select the address,

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:53.340
and the data detectors will sense that there's an
address selected and it brings up the Just-The-Service

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.480
for them [laughter] and I could say,
who do I know near here in this address

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.279
and it instantly tells me I got this friends of mine.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:04.709
If you want, if this was actually connected to
the web, we can draw Google map and bring them up.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.440
I did the easy way, OK.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.110
And if I have a phone number selected here,
I can say, well, where is this area code,

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:16.720
and have it show me where that area code is
right in the Dictionary app, if I want to.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.290
[Applause] Very powerful, very
cool kind of things that you can do

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:29.490
with Services available for you right at the Point-of-Need.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.740
So let's bring this back.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:40.259
So Services are contextual, the 4 Cs:
Convenient, configurable, and Customizable.

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:41.250
We've got that.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.500
So if you meet any press people, you
go, "I must tell you about Services.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.830
They are contextual, convenient,
configurable, and customizable.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.650
You will write on this, yes you will."

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.330
[Laughter] OK.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.440
So now, now that we've established basically
the, you know, the story of Services.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:04.210
This was a little ground work for the few of you who
might not have remembered the tragedy that was Services.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.759
[Laughter] Whoa!

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:08.180
Whoa! That was brittle.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.650
OK, so let's look at how this pertains to the world of IT.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:17.970
Well as an IT professional, you're
always-- it was supposed to go that way.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.860
You're always, you know, you're dealing with,
you know, setting up administrative computers.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:28.569
You're managing network computers.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:34.559
You're creating assistance tools for clients.

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:36.679
So, you know, you're doing lots.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.960
You have many different roles and these are 3 of the
viewpoints that we were talking about earlier right?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.920
How can you use Services to help you when you're, you
know, administrating your own computers, you know,

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.380
what are the kind of things that you can do with Services?

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:55.200
Can you better integrate it with the Finder so that,
you know, you can just select something in the finer run

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.980
that run the shell stuff on it right there.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.829
Is there a way to extend what the terminal does now
that we've seen that that is contextual as well.

00:18:02.829 --> 00:18:08.230
Is there a way to gather data about your network
and about what's going on and then put that into

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.880
like a report or something like that, you know.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.450
These are the kind of things that
you use on your own machine,

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:17.240
not necessarily managing somebody
else, but just for yourself.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.500
Will Services play a role there?

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.519
In addition, if you are in a scenario
where you are managing other computers,

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:28.379
how can Services be of assistance to you there?

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:35.150
I mean, for example, is there a way to automate
classroom setup and clean up software installation,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.860
any kind of thing dealing with Remote Desktop
or managing multiple computers, you know,

00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:43.339
doing an SSH into a computer or something like that.

00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:45.859
These are the kind of things that
you can now put under your fingers

00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:49.619
or put under your keyboard command
using the new Services in Snow Leopard.

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:56.119
And then finally, what are the kinds of tools that you
can make and distribute on machines that make it easier

00:18:56.119 --> 00:19:01.429
for your clients to cooperate, to be
good citizens, to do things correctly.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:06.779
For example if I was in a classroom and I wanted them to
turn in their homework, could I make that a simple Service

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:12.029
that they could just select something and the file
would automatically check into the server correctly.

00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:13.259
Those kinds of things.

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:18.650
So we're going to look at that now and I'm going to
get out of the way and let the madman go to work.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.490
>> You might not know it, but you've been
watching Services in action at WWDC all week.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.990
It might surprise you to know that not everybody at--

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:31.190
not every engineer at Apple is the
phenomenal typist that you think we all are.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.120
People seem to be typing things
awfully rapidly in their coding demos.

00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:37.689
I don't know if you've noticed
that but that's actually a Service.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.930
We have an internal tool that you can't have that's
attached to a Service that types things like this,

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.840
and you can look like a much better
typist than you actually are.

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:55.429
So that is a Service that has been around for a long
time and it was written in Objective-C and that was hard.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.509
My hats off to the guy that wrote that Service.

00:19:57.509 --> 00:19:59.480
It's the one that we all use in our demos.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.980
But Services used to be hard.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.890
They used to be hard to write.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.700
In fact I remember when they were--
when they were really hard to write.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.750
I haven't done--

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.109
[ Applause and Cheers ]

00:20:12.109 --> 00:20:14.219
>> You're going to have to, you know, to bear with me.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.600
I haven't done the NeXTSTEP 3.3 demo in, you know, 15 years.

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:20.349
I hope I can remember which mouse
button I'm supposed to use.

00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:27.109
[Laughter] But back in the day, back in the day, there
were some pretty cool Services that shipped with NeXTSTEP.

00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:32.379
One of which I happened to like was a tool that
would let you take a document for instance,

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:38.620
you could choose a file somewhere over here in
the documentation and I can't edit these files.

00:20:38.619 --> 00:20:40.649
I'm not root, I'm an ordinary user logged in here.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:47.350
But we had a service kicking around that let's you click
on a file and say Services "open sesame, open as root."

00:20:47.349 --> 00:20:53.609
And what that would do would be to ask you for your
15 years ago root password, holy mackerel [laughter].

00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:56.039
Oh, it's the same as today, yeah, OK.

00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:01.930
[Laughter] So this is actually launched back on next tip.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.299
This actually launched another copy
of TextEdit but it launched as root.

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:12.039
I have been pining for this service on the Mac
forever, and I'm going to write it in front of you.

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:15.079
Well no, I'm not going to write it, I'm
going to use one that I wrote back at home.

00:21:15.079 --> 00:21:18.699
But first, I'm just going to refresh my memory about this--

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.100
this was a pretty cool service,
this open sesame tool would do that.

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:24.439
And now who wrote that?

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.660
Oh yeah, I wrote that, yeah.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.380
[Laughter] [Applause] I wrote that with this other guy.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.490
I don't know-- now stop.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.009
I don't know what happened to the other guy.

00:21:37.009 --> 00:21:37.539
How's he doing?

00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:39.029
Is he still around?

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:43.279
[Laugher] But, he helped me.

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:44.839
The names are in alphabetical order.

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:48.679
Just for the record, they're in alphabetical order.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.690
But you can have Services like
that today, running on Mac OS X.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.210
And they're easy to build with Automator.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.200
Automator lets you create a brand new
service, and thank you to the kind of folks

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.370
at VMWare for letting me run NeXTSTEP on here.

00:22:00.369 --> 00:22:04.569
But Automator lets you create a
service really, really easily.

00:22:04.569 --> 00:22:10.529
So I happen to have on here, some other files that
I can't edit, but I could use my different key now.

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:14.490
I could Control-click on this and have a Services
Menu that actually opens, this thing as root.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.829
This is a little AppleScript application.

00:22:16.829 --> 00:22:26.899
It's going to prompt me for my root
password, and wait a minute, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.690
And that's actually launched another-- it's
figured out what application owns this file.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.190
And it's used AppleScript and do shell
script with administrator privileges

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.880
to open another copy of that application as root.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.070
And I can now edit this file and completely
change the documentation on the system

00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:44.059
to suit my whims, and to put my name first on the list.

00:22:44.059 --> 00:22:48.819
So [laughter] these things turn out to be
particularly easy to write with Automator.

00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:53.490
I want to try and write a few from scratch here for you.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:59.039
Let's see, so how about this, let's
make a service for the Finder.

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:01.869
Let's make a new service that's going
to take, you start up Automator here,

00:23:01.869 --> 00:23:04.939
you say you want to make a service,
and what do you want the input to be?

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.430
Sal mentioned this before but up at the top, you say, what
sort of input is this particular service going to take?

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:16.150
I want one that takes the selected folder in the Finder,
and then that's the first action of your Automator Workflow.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.340
Whatever comes next is being passed the
Finder's current idea of a selection.

00:23:20.339 --> 00:23:24.959
So I'm going to toss in a little bit of AppleScript here.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.700
One of the great flexible Automator actions
of all time is this one here, run AppleScript.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:35.509
This will actually run locally an AppleScript that
will be passed the Finder on a previous action.

00:23:35.509 --> 00:23:42.359
And I'm going to do something that's been-- I've been
wanting for a long time, tell application terminal

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:45.169
to activate, to come to the front,
and then I want to do this.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.160
I want to cd to that folder

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.320
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:23:49.319 --> 00:23:52.359
>> Yeah-- no, I did close the quote.

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:55.319
Alright, alright.

00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:57.309
[Laughter] I would have got that in a minute, alright?

00:23:57.309 --> 00:23:59.629

of input, this is a very wordy language
though, have you ever noticed this?

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.600
[Laughter] Of the input.

00:24:12.599 --> 00:24:16.399
Of the, the, the input, 'cause you can do that, and not now.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.200
[Inaudible] So anyway, what's this going to do?

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.009
What's this going to do?

00:24:19.009 --> 00:24:19.629
Here's a little quiz.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.940
This is a thing that's going to
take the selected, oops, do shell,

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:29.210
do shell CD quoted form of, yeah--
no, no it's not do shell.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.299
Do shell in terminal 'causes it to open a
new terminal window running this command.

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:33.950
Do shell script, that's a different thing.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.240
I've done something else.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.029
We may do the Graham Kerr trick of switching.

>> [Inaudible] thank you, thank you.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.590
I'm so glad, you know, I'm so glad
we're having this rehearsal.

00:24:45.589 --> 00:24:48.669
We don't usually have this many people
come to the rehearsal [Laughter].

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.440
You know, we always rehearse a week ahead,
and then next week, you're all coming back.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.210
It's going to be great.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.200
It's going to run like clockwork.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.029
This is fantastic having an open rehearsal.

00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:58.960
We should need to do this more often,
would you please take note of that.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.100
Thank you AppleScript experts in the crowd.

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:05.240
So if I save this thing, and I get to
give it a name, this is going to go hide

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:11.269
in my Library Services folder, new terminal window here.

00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:15.639
Now, I've got something where I can pick some
folder in the Finder and I can Control-click on it,

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.910
maybe I've got a little, oops, that's
wrong, I got it, no, no, no, no.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.230
New terminal window here, that's going to
launch terminal and CD me over to that folder.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.549
[Applause] Please, no, no, no, no, no.

00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:26.129
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:26.770
>> What?

00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:29.139
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.380
>> What? What about a keystroke?

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.360
Gosh, Sal that's a fantastic idea.

00:25:34.359 --> 00:25:35.519
You could put a hot key on this.

00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:38.750
This is something that you thought you
were going to be doing all the time,

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:44.539
over here in the Keyboard Preferences pane, you have all
the available Services and you can enable and disable them,

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:46.869
and then you can pick one you like
and this is the greatest thing ever.

00:25:46.869 --> 00:25:49.309
You can attach a hot key to it.

00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:55.409
And in fact, you can have a shell script or AppleScript that
doesn't do anything to its input like an arbitrary script.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:59.590
So long as it's sitting in the Services
folder, you can hang a hot key off of it here

00:25:59.589 --> 00:26:03.369
and expand your massive typing
ability to run arbitrary scripts.

00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:06.859
So if I can find this one, which I
just created here, what did I call it?

00:26:06.859 --> 00:26:08.309
I can't remember it.

00:26:08.309 --> 00:26:12.740
New terminal window here, dum dee dum, dum,
this would be one that works with the Finder.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.230
These are contextuals, there's one of
them here, says, new terminal window here.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:20.049
Yeah, I want that one, and I want
to add control option command key.

00:26:20.049 --> 00:26:20.789
How about that?

00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:22.269
That will be my hot key.

00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:28.109
And now, wherever I go in the Finder,
whatever folder I happen to pick, you know,

00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:29.929
pick this folder here, this guy's folder.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:37.830
I can go control option command key,
and we'll just try it one more time,

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:40.099
and maybe just avert your eyes for a moment here.

00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:43.990
We're going to go like this, and we're going
to go do this, and this doesn't do anything.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.859
So there's no point of telling you.

00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:55.509
So [laughter], I've blown this one here, dum dee dum, dum.

00:26:55.509 --> 00:26:56.349
How did I mess this up?

00:26:56.349 --> 00:27:00.689
I'm not that hosed, a new terminal
window here, folders in Finder.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.070
I'm going to go back and do the
remainder of the demo in NeXTSTEP.

00:27:03.069 --> 00:27:07.189
I think that would be more [laughter],
more exciting, you know what, you know--

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.390
>> Drag the folder on the terminal.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.980
>> "Drag the folder on the terminal" -- No, I
know you can drag the folder on the terminal.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.529
[ Laughter ]

00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:19.079
[ Applause ]

00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:22.129
>> Alright, I don't really want to
put a terminal hot key on this one

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.600
because I got better ones I want to put terminal hot key on.

00:27:25.599 --> 00:27:35.039
My favorite program, and apparently yours, judging
by the response, is of course Apple Remote Desktop.

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:36.250
[Applause] Are you happy, I mentioned it?

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.220
Are you happy there, Nader.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:45.460
So Apple Remote Desktop also supports the idea of a Services
Menu except in its case, it's taking the selected computers,

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.640
and passing them in to your Automator action.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.880
So you can now write a workflow that where you
choose some computers in Apple Remote Desktop,

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.230
and then you have a context menu where you
can run your script on those computers.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:02.509
Automator already comes with a whole bunch of actions
that are designed to operate on a list of computers.

00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:04.200
But you can write your own as well.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.430
And since I was so successful on the last
one, we're going to try another one here.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.150
I want to do a minor variation on that kind of thing.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:17.560
I want to make a service where we take the selected
computers in Remote Desktop and we're going to run a script

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:20.369
that launches an SSH session to those computers.

00:28:20.369 --> 00:28:22.899
That would probably be a useful thing.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.930
I have a list of computers coming
in here, repeat with a computer,

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.490
and we're going to do several computers at once, and input.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.440
We're going to try this, tail application terminal.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.140
This is really me typing, not typing a hot key.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:47.030
Activate, do script SSH Apple at
the internet address of a computer.

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:51.980
We're getting passed objects from Apple Remote Desktop.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:57.089
And we're building a little loop here that's going to
tell terminal to essentially go and find the IP address

00:28:57.089 --> 00:29:00.639
of the computer that just came in,
and create a new SSH window here.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.420
So I'll save that new SSH window.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.559
Cross my fingers and as many other
body parts as I can cross here right

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:13.639
at the moment [laughter], pick one, and new SSH window.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.610
Oh, how do you like that?

00:29:15.609 --> 00:29:16.149
There you see.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:20.550
It's doing SSH to that computer.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.480
[Applause] And it's doing SSH to all 8 of them, right?

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.579
It will take all 8 of them there and
do 8 [laughter] SSH windows for you.

00:29:26.579 --> 00:29:28.789
These things are pretty easy to build.

00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:31.920
I mean, Automator gives you this
whole infrastructure and it was a lot.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.160
Trust me, it was a lot harder back in the day
to code this kind of stuff up with Objective-C.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:44.009
So, I want to try one more relatively elaborate
ARD one here, 'cause I'm feeling a little cocky

00:29:44.009 --> 00:29:47.009
because that one-- that one actually worked.

00:29:47.009 --> 00:29:51.990
You could build workflows out of the
existing Automator access but that's no fun.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.950
I want try to create something new.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.680
Here's an example of a kind of thing I do all the time.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.840
I pick a computer on a list and I fill
this in, send UNIX command, host name.

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:05.000
Alright you know, something that I want to do and I
want to run that as the user root on this computer,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.720
and then ARD runs it an it puts it in the window and I
go, oh, yeah, OK, there's the hostname, when in fact,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.769
they want to do the hostname on all the computers.

00:30:10.769 --> 00:30:11.579
So I do it all over again here.

00:30:11.579 --> 00:30:13.449
>> I do all this clicking.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.870
And then if I want to do a new command, I edit it again.

00:30:15.869 --> 00:30:17.389
I wanted to speed this up a little bit.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:21.540
I am running commands on a list of computers all the time.

00:30:21.539 --> 00:30:29.519
If you're like me-- you're like me [laughter] you've
been oh, come on, you've been waiting a long time

00:30:29.519 --> 00:30:36.809
for the Bourne shell to rise the position of prominence
as a Mac programming language that it has needed, right?

00:30:36.809 --> 00:30:38.200
This is been a long time coming.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:44.059
If you put the time into learning the Bourne shell in
1975, and you haven't been bothered to learned anything new

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:47.629
since then, this is the tool for you because
you can now apply scripts to these things.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:52.070
So I'm going to do-- I am going to
attempt to build a little script here.

00:30:52.069 --> 00:30:55.329
Let's make another-- another Automator action here.

00:30:55.329 --> 00:30:58.470
This one is also going to take a list of computers.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:06.009
A list of computers and Remote Desktop and-- I'm going
to slum it a little bit and do another AppleScript here.

00:31:06.009 --> 00:31:08.269
Now there are two AppleScript things in Automator.

00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:13.900
One of them for Remote Desktop runs the
script on all 8 selected computers out there.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:21.550
I want the one that runs a local AppleScript on this
computer here, because here is what I'm going to do.

00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:22.089
We're gonna do this.

00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:26.049
We're going to say tell the application Remote Desktop.

00:31:26.049 --> 00:31:30.669
It's good, you know, put end in there
while you're doing it, this is good style.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.560
We're going to tell it activate.

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:38.159
We're going to tell it display
dialog, what command do you want?

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.960
Default, answer.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.910
This is how you in AppleScript prompt for a string of text.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.730
Set command to text returned of the result.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.519
Now I've determined a command that
the user would like to run.

00:31:50.519 --> 00:31:53.660
I would now like to execute this command on all 8 computers.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:32:02.070
Said T to make new, send, UNIX command
task with properties, name, run this.

00:32:02.069 --> 00:32:07.549
This is me creating on the fly a new
send UNIX command in Remote Desktop.

00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:10.779
The script I want it to run is
the command that we just typed

00:32:10.779 --> 00:32:13.119
and the user we want to run it on-- now this is dangerous.

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:13.859
Now just be careful.

00:32:13.859 --> 00:32:19.500
We're going to run this command as the user root on
all the computers and we're going to say execute T,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:25.859
that's our new task, on input which is all the
computers that just came from the previous action.

00:32:25.859 --> 00:32:29.969
Alright, on input, pardon me.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.509
Yeah, it already flowed.

00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:34.009
I'm going to be real careful here, believe me.

00:32:34.009 --> 00:32:40.670
So this is a script that's going to prompt me for a
command and then execute it on a bunch of computers.

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.660
Run something dangerous [laughter].

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:50.930
And this might be not a bad time to go and
add-we'll a hot key to this one too [laughter].

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:56.769
Running with scissors, I should have called this one here.

00:32:56.769 --> 00:33:04.019
So run something dangerous-- yeah [laughter].

00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:06.700
What was that command shift U you for UNIX tool?

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.840
Good idea, yes, we'll do command shift U.

00:33:08.839 --> 00:33:14.980
So I've got a hot key now that will run
something dangerous here on all these computers.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:20.099
What command, date, ohh, that was good, OK.

00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:22.049
There. So there's all the output.

00:33:22.049 --> 00:33:24.980
You know I maybe want to do another command.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.230
Well command how full is the boot disk.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.759
Well there it is, here's all the output over here.

00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:31.990
And we'll run another command, rm-r~Nader [laughter].

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:36.809
Oh, maybe we won't do that.

00:33:36.809 --> 00:33:41.869
So this is a-- I think a tremendously
useful tool by which you can take the kind

00:33:41.869 --> 00:33:44.729
of workflows you do every day and stick hot keys on it.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.870
You can sit in here for a Remote Desktop and just type--

00:33:46.869 --> 00:33:52.139
type commands all the time and they're suddenly
being spread across all these different computers.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:58.250
So these are some examples that Sal and I discussed of
scripts that might be very useful to the computer user.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.960
But what we are doing now?

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.190
I'm so excited that 2 out of 3 worked.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.850
>> So we were looking at different scenarios?

00:34:04.849 --> 00:34:06.250
>> Oh yeah, that's right scenarios.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:11.079
>> So we're looking at from the administrator's point of
view of what kind of tools you can make on your own machine

00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:13.299
to make it easier for you to do your job.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.550
What kind of tools can you do to
make it easier to manage computers--

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.660
>> Yeah.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:18.899
>> As you kind of stepped on.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.480
>> OK, I'm with you, yeah, yeah.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:26.119
>> And then what kind of things can we do that
make it easier for your clients to do their jobs?

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:28.239
>> Are there any workflows like that, Sal?

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:28.419
>> Yeah.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.150
>> So, well, let me show you a simple one--

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:30.470
>> Alright.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:32.469
[ Laughter ]

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.149
[ Applause ]

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.889
>> That was amazing.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.160
>> Undo everything I just did.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.980
>> Undo everything you just did.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.500
Yeah, right.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.769
>> They're actually--

00:34:47.769 --> 00:34:49.199
>> We do have a panic script for that.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.169
>> That was a good question.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:53.220
He actually asked if there's a script for
that but, yeah, that's a good question.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:55.969
So here's one.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:58.089
I'll show you my UNIX prowess.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.430
Here's a simple idea.

00:35:00.429 --> 00:35:03.859
I'm in text edit-- I have a list of names.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:09.470
Even though it now supports all the wonderful
transformations and substitutions and everything,

00:35:09.469 --> 00:35:12.689
you still can't sort the text that's selected.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:18.269
So I'm going to make a simple sort tool
that my clients can use to sort text.

00:35:18.269 --> 00:35:24.610
To do such a thing, I just go to Automator, I'm going
to choose Service, and I'm going to take as input text

in any application and replace that text.

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:32.009
I'll do run shell script here and
I think there's actually-- this--

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:36.730
I had a bet with Steve as to what the
shortest command I could possibly use.

00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:54.409
So that was good news here.

Sort selected paragraphs.

00:35:58.949 --> 00:36:07.989
OK, and now I can close that and then I'm
over here and I should be getting that soon.

00:36:07.989 --> 00:36:11.359
We have the crowded Services menu here.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.910
OK, and sort selected paragraphs is right there.

00:36:14.909 --> 00:36:15.969
Voila!

[ Cheering ]

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:26.759
>> So this is a classic example of if I can
do it, you can do it kind of story, right.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:32.240
They always bring up the pathetic person who doesn't
know how to tie their shoe to do the simple sort command.

00:36:32.239 --> 00:36:37.879
So, that's one example of a kind of
tool that you can use with your clients.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.369
But we have one here that we're going to show
and I'm going to need assistance on this.

00:36:42.369 --> 00:36:46.139
So this is our classroom of students over here.

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:51.319
Let's move some of this stuff out of
the way, and that, and that, and that.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.769
And this is our class room.

00:36:52.769 --> 00:36:58.030
And they all have homework assignments and we want
to be able to have an easy way that they can check

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:03.550
in their homework assignments and I can see when
the assignments are coming in so I can get them,

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.190
so that they don't leave the class without
turning in their homework assignments.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:15.690
And we also have a folder here that contains
folders for each one of them and what we're going

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:21.659
to do is do we have assistance
here, somebody, Sean, somebody.

00:37:21.659 --> 00:37:25.569
We need you to check in your homework.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:29.050
So what he's going to do over there is
I'm going to do, you want to do Sean.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.320
So hold on, hold on.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.350
Let me make these windows so that we can see the results.

00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:38.869
So Sean is there, Sean is over here, Sean is everywhere.

00:37:38.869 --> 00:37:45.190
OK, so we're watching Sean and he's
going to select the file and he's going

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.909
to run the service that we call check in class work.

00:37:48.909 --> 00:38:07.309
If you want to check in your class work
and it mounts it and copies it across.

00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:11.509
[Humming]

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.810
OK, no homework today.

00:38:14.809 --> 00:38:21.190
Everybody gets an A.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:25.059
And what's happened?

00:38:25.059 --> 00:38:25.889
Oh, what's happening?

00:38:25.889 --> 00:38:26.379
Leave it alone.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:26.780
There it goes.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.470
Done.

[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:38:29.639 --> 00:38:42.440
>> You'll notice here that we had a folder action on the
Sean folder so that once the file gets in the folder,

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:47.970
the folder gets turned green and we can
see that Sean did turn in his homework.

>> I almost needed the balloon for that one.

So these are just, you know, some of the simple
ideas that you can come up with for manipulating data

00:39:06.849 --> 00:39:10.299
on their side doing things that
are helpful for them as well.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:28.580
And I think that I have, let's see, if I
have that and-- see, did it pull it up.

So here's a couple of photos that I have
selected of some people I met at conference,

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:18.710
great shots and I want to share them too with them
so I go up to the iPhoto, choose Service for that

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:24.909
and oh no, the Service didn't get installed, OK.

00:40:24.909 --> 00:40:25.469

Sends, it figures out who's in the photo,
sends this email photo to everybody.

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:34.739
So as punishment for that I will post these
for you guys to use yourself and get them.

00:41:38.239 --> 00:41:40.199
[Applause] So let's go back to the slides here.

00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:40.859
>> Why not.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.289
>> Alright.

00:41:42.289 --> 00:41:48.210
Ah. Argh! It's a killer demo too.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:53.829
So what can you do to advance Services and to use them more?

00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:55.319
How can you take it to the next level?

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.590
Well the first thing that you've
seen is the run shell script action.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:04.070
And it's a really great one to use because it
has all of your favorite shells in it as well

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.980
as also support for perl, python, and ruby.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:13.679
So you can create workflows that contain series of
these actions linked together and do whatever you

00:42:13.679 --> 00:42:17.349
like to do that's insane and crazy
or just actually productive.

00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:20.809
You can also use the run AppleScript action

00:42:20.809 --> 00:42:26.029
and now with Snow Leopard we've
introduced something new with AppleScript.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:29.000
It's called AppleScript Cocoa or AppleScript Objective-C.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.380
It's got a couple different names
but basically within this environment

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:38.829
and within Xcode AppleScript can call any
Cocoa framework call that you want to make

00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:43.389
at all directly from within the language, so.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:52.469
[Applause] So not only can you call the shell using the
do shell script command, now you can just get straight

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:56.769
at any Cocoa call that you to do, anything
Objective-C can get at we can get at with here.

00:42:56.769 --> 00:43:02.679
So you can combine these as a way to
extend your abilities using Services.

00:43:02.679 --> 00:43:06.569
Also, you can make your own custom
Automator actions as well.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:13.410
For example, you can create actions with different
templates, you can create a Cocoa-based action

00:43:13.409 --> 00:43:16.730
if you want to write your run code in Objective-C.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:22.110
If you want to write your run code in shell you can use
the shell template and create an Automator action that's

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:25.360
in shell or you can use the new
the Cocoa AppleScript template

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:31.320
and create yourself an AppleScript-based
Automator action as well.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.039
And how do you publish your Services?

00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:39.550
If you have an app already and you want to take advantage
of Services there's a couple things that you can do.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.690
One is that you can learn how to publish it.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:49.190
There's a session coming up here, 109 Pasteboard
Services and Interoperability on Thursday at 2

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:53.679
and Peter Ammon was nice to loan
me a couple slides that basically explained

00:43:53.679 --> 00:43:57.129
that you declare the Services in your app's info.plist,

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:02.720
the Pasteboard server reads that
and then publishes it to the menu.

00:44:02.719 --> 00:44:11.589
And within your plist this is basically how you declare this
kind of things using these various tools and objects here.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:17.460
In NSMessage your send types, what kind of data
you're working with and then whether you want it

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.260
to be there even if the selection is empty.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:26.510
So go to that session and learn how to
publish Services for your existing app.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:34.160
Another way to make your app take advantage of Services is
just make it scriptable and then people can write Services

00:44:34.159 --> 00:44:37.440
to your app using your app for
anything that they want to do.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:43.980
There is a Scriptability Lab on Wednesday at 12 that
you're going to want to attend if you're interested

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.420
in learning how to make your app support Apple events.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:55.500
So summary, we've seen that Services in
Snow Leopard address the Point-of-Need.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:02.809
They deliver power right where you need it, when you
need it and they are contextual, they are convenient,

00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:08.309
they are configurable, and they're customizable as well.

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:12.059
For more information, don't contact Matt Drance.

00:45:12.059 --> 00:45:14.769
Poor Matt, he's overloaded with a bunch of stuff anyway.

00:45:14.769 --> 00:45:19.699
I want you to go to macosxautomation.com.

00:45:19.699 --> 00:45:29.019
It's a great website, new website, and it hosts
AppleScript and Services and it hosts Automator.

00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:31.019
Complete sites for each one of those.

00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:35.679
In addition we're going to have a new site
going up shortly, macosxautomation.com/training.

00:45:35.679 --> 00:45:41.289
If you're learning-- interested in learning any of
these languages you can watch videos, learn from them

00:45:41.289 --> 00:45:44.400
and you can take tutorials and classes on that as well.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.610
And that's macosxautomation.com/training
