WEBVTT

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.050
>> Good afternoon everybody.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.769
My name is Kjell Bronder.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.210
I'm Engineer on the Podcast Producer team and I'll be
presenting today with Eric Circlaeys, a fellow Engineer.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.359
We have a great session and it's full of a lot of fun demos
for you and really going to be taking an in-depth look

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.269
at Podcast Composer and we're going to show you how easy
we've made it for you to create really powerful workflows

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.350
that you can customize for your organization.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:46.989
We're going to step back to start off and we're
going to come back to what Podcast Producer is

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:57.640
Podcast Producer is a full end-to-end solution that really
makes it easy to capture, process and deliver your content.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.649
I'm pretty sure there's a lot of
administrators out here that are responsible

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.730
for a podcasting solution from some sort.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.650
And in that environment, you have two types of customers.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.840
On one side, you have your clients who need to
capture their content and distribute their knowledge.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.740
On the other side, you have your audience.

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:24.449
These are the clients that are
going to consume this content.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.780
What Podcast Producer does is it creates
a real invisible bridge in between.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.700
We make it really easy for your clients on one
side to capture the content and completely seamless

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.570
for your audience to consume the content.

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.849
There's a lot of things happening underneath, but we
make it really transparent for both of your customers

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.729
and to show you that, I'm going to do a real quick demo.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.890
So I'm going to move over to the
demo machine and what I'm going

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.349
to do is I'm just going to create
a real quick video podcast.

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:12.719
Just going to choose Video here and Podcast Capture,
I'm going to turn this way and start the recording.

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.629
Welcome to Podcast Composer In-Depth.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.389
This is going to be a great session.

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:20.559
We've tons of stuff to show to you and we're
going to have a lot of fun with our demos.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.699
I hope that you take home that Podcast Producer is just a
great solution for capturing and distributing your content.

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:33.229
Just have to click Pause here and all
I have to do now is publish my content.

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:37.099
Then choose the Podcast here, which is Invisible Bridge.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:47.030
I'm going to call this Podcast Producer
and it's a full end-to-end solution.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.050
And now I hit Submit.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.000
Now Podcast Capture takes care of
uploading all of the content to the server.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.569
Podcast Producer takes care of everything
else and that's the whole point.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.229
For your customers, for the individuals in your organization
or institution that have the expertise or the knowledge

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:13.500
that you want to distribute, we make it
extremely easy for them to capture this content

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.430
so that they can concentrate on
their presentation or lecture.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.150
Then on the other side, you have your audience.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.659
Well they already have their ways of consuming content.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.439
They're used to using iTunes.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.439
They have certain devices that they're used
to using for watching all of their content.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.109
So you want to make sure it's completely seamless for
them and that they don't have to change their ways,

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.580
you know download any other applications
or plug-ins to consume this content.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:50.760
Another really important point about Podcast Producer is
that we leverage a lot of different technologies underneath

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.649
and something that we believe very
strongly in is that technologies are great,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.730
but they are only as great as their usage is simple.

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:05.479
You want to make sure that it's really, really easy
for your customers to leverage this technology.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.889
Maybe a lot of your experts in their domain,
they might not be experts in video processing.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.959
They might not know how to encode
multiple different formats.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.819
They might not know how to publish out
to the web, nor should they have to.

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.610
Also with Podcast Producer, we go beyond that.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.040
We've brought in things with imager
analysis to do really cool transitions.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.290
We do a lot of really cool things by leveraging some
complex technologies, but we take all of that complexity

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:39.910
out of the solution for your customers so they don't see it
and we create this fully invisible bridge in between those

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.300
who have the knowledge and those who want to consume it.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.620
So now that our content has been processed on the
Podcast Producer system, let me play it back for you.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:57.379
See, I'm just going to open up my iChat here and let's
go to iTunes and we're going to refresh our feed here.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:08.269
If you've been to our other demos this week,
you've seen that we've changed our titling,

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:12.579
we've changed our intro video and
here we've branded our podcast

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.259
and that's what this whole session is going to be about.

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.620
We're going to show you how you can brand your
podcast very easily with Podcast Composer,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.470
how you can use all of the new transitions,
how you can have animated watermarks

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.510
and you can put in your own altra-videos.

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.509
We've made this so extremely easy
and all it takes now is just dragging

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.539
and dropping your content into Podcast Composer.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:43.379
So what I'm going to do now, is I'm going to pass it over
to Eric and he's going to walk you through Podcast Composer.

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.689
>> Thank you, Kjell.

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:50.919
Good afternoon everyone.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.910
I think for the end user this is really magic but for us,
this is where the power of the workflows comes into play.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.540
So now, I would like to take a deeper look under the
covers and see how all that content gets produced

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.170
with Podcast Producer and Podcast Composer workflows.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:20.129
Podcast Producer workflow is kind of a recipe
of how you're going to create a podcast.

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:28.509
I don't know if you remember in Z1, well in Z1
to create a workflow, you needed to be a guru.

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.159
Now I know there are some in the room today
and they created crazy workflows out there,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.670
but still this isn't really easy for everyone.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.870
So we wanted to simplify that and to give
you an example of how it was complicated,

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.470
then just imagine all the things you had to do.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.800
You had to speak XML fluently.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.730
You had to know about every single bits
and bytes of that Podcast Producer.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:05.020
You had to deal with the actions, the resources, all
the credentials and even care about the parallelism.

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:12.269
Well, this is great if you want to spend hours working
on crazy things, but we wanted to bring that to any user.

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:20.689
On Snow Leopard, on Podcast Producer 2, we kind
of proved the idea of very simple application

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:27.579
that represents sequentially what we think are the
most common steps for creating a Podcast workflow

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:32.469
and that's what I'm going to show you
right now in action with Podcast Composer.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:46.990
Podcast Composer is the new tool in Snow Leopard to create
workflows and deploy workflows with Podcast Producer.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:56.550
It simplifies all the work with seven
identified stages and these are the seven stages.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:03.449
This is just simple as filling up all these pages one after
the other to create your own customized workflow using

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:07.469
and leveraging all the cool technologies
we've introduced in Leopard and Snow Leopard.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:14.880
But before even going to through these steps one after the
other, I would like to talk to you a bit more about the UI

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:23.290
and specifically about the navigation
and browsing user experience.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.460
We've made it brand new.

00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:32.230
Actually, the main stage you are working on
is always centered in the middle of the window

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.009
so then you can have a nice look
about what you have just set up before

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:39.720
and what you are going to do right after this page.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.910
It's also very simple to actually navigate
through all these different stages.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:50.799
You can just click on the stages, you can use
the swipe movement, you can use the scroll wheel,

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:59.209
you can even go in the mini icons and actually select the
stage you're interested in or use the shortcuts to navigate.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:06.290
The coolest one we have added is the ability to double
click on the title of this page and have an overview

00:09:06.289 --> 00:09:11.909
of the complete workflow and then jump
to the stage that you are interested in.

00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:18.850
So now you have seen how easy it is
to navigate, let's go into each stage

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.180
and see what you could do to customize your own workflow.

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:25.919
The first one, in formation stage,
is really straightforward.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:31.309
This is where you're going to add the title
the author, and the description of this workflow.

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:37.799
All this information is going to show up in the
applications such as Podcast Capture so when one

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:44.389
of your customers is going to connect to Podcast
Capture and select a workflow, it will then see the name

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:49.909
and use the description to find
the correct workflowings to use.

00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:53.740
Once you're done with that, it's time
to work on the most important stage.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:59.320
This is the step that defines what
this workflow is going to be used for.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:05.370
This stage acts like a finale taking all
the input sources produced by Podcast Capture

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.450
and making a single source video
for the rest of the workflow.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.790
There are three different importers.

00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:16.969
There is the single source importer, which is very simple.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:25.840
It takes one input source coming from the video recording
or the screen recalling or even the audio recording.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.870
You can actually even restrict a workflow to
only work for a certain type of single source.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:37.740
Maybe you'd like to create a workflow that only works
for screen recording so then any user in Podcast Capture

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.799
that does a screen recording will
see that particular workflow.

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:46.750
We have also added what we call
the Automatic Chapter Generation.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:53.990
That's a nice feature because you could do any type of
screen recording using keynotes for presenting any type

00:10:53.990 --> 00:11:01.409
of content or using a PDF or using any other
presentation tools and we're going automatically to detect

00:11:01.409 --> 00:11:06.230
out of the video the different
chapters in between the slides.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.980
That is done automatically for you.

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:15.000
Then there is the dual source, which
is a new feature in Snow Leopard.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.919
To give you a little description
about dual source, it's super easy.

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:23.789
The Podcast Capture captures two
sources, the screen and the video sources

00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:27.059
where the talking head is going
actually to present the content.

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:31.059
The dual source importer is going
to build a picture-in-picture

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:35.059
of those two sources for the rest of the workflow.

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:42.519
Well, we provide bi-fold four different compositions
to lay out those two videos that we receive

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.179
and then generate this picture-in-picture movie.

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:52.279
There is the keynote composition that you
all have seen in the two previous sessions.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:56.980
There is the overlay that shows all
the time the two content on the screen.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:06.060
There is the overlay with fade, it shows the main
content all the time and when it's necessary,

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:10.059
it shows up the talking head and
finally we do have the theater that shows

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:12.919
up always the two content with nice transitions.

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:19.649
About these transitions, we have added a
nice feature called automatic transitions.

00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:25.230
Since we are capable of detecting in the slides if
they have change in a forced amount of time or not,

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:30.680
we are capable of triggering an action and such
action could be an animation to do something nice

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:34.129
with those two contents we have captured.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:41.129
For example, it's like moving from one
source to another in the transition.

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:46.360
Again, we are capable of adding markers
automatically in the videos so then you can jump

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:52.539
from one slide to another in quick time or in iTunes.

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:56.199
Finally, we have this Montage feature.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.930
Montage is really nice because it gives
you the ability to submit any type

00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:05.370
of documents that Quick Look could actually render.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.990
Quick Look is one of the technologies we
had in Leopard that is still available

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.860
in Snow Leopard and could even do better things.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:21.230
With Quick Look, we could extract images out of some
documents such as PDF, such as keynote presentations,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:28.230
such as pages documents and with all those images, we are
going to be able to build a slideshow and produce a video

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:35.060
out of that to be then podcasted on your different services.

00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:40.299
If we go in the configuration panel
for Montage, you can set the duration

00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:44.599
for every image that we extract from documents you send.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.580
You can also change the transition to some
of the transitions we do provide by default.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:55.400
Again, we can automatically generate the chapters for you.

00:13:55.399 --> 00:14:01.269
Once you are done with these importer
settings, it's time to brand your content.

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:06.799
I can select Draw Source for the demo
and let's talk about the editing.

00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:08.969
This is where you're going to brand your content.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.639
This is where you're going to set the
introduction video of your company.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:17.809
This is where you're going to select
the layout of your bumper title.

00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:23.069
Maybe also customize your content by adding
a watermark and changing the outro movie

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.590
and I'd like to show you all these
different possibilities here.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:31.110
There are these four vignettes
and each of them are configurable.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.399
This is the introduction movie.

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:41.100
By default, we provide some different introduction movies
like the Apple Podcast or the Camera Flash or the Eye.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.899
but it would be great to use mine.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:48.319
So I'd rather set a file here I would like to use.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:58.680
So let's move that to the backstop and I have my
personal track intro video and I would like to use it.

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:03.669
Let's just add it to this vignette.

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:07.179
Now it's time to configure my bumper title.

00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:12.839
This is an automatically generated title that's
going to be added in my podcast with the metadata

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.430
that will be submitted from Podcast Capture.

00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:19.819
This is a Flying Title composition,
a different one we had in V1.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.250
We've added two other ones.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.919
We added the Carousel and the Reveal.

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:30.169
For example, the Carousel shows up the
logo and then the title and the author.

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:37.699
Maybe I would like to use my own logo in that
particular case so just drag and drop the logo.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:45.100
Maybe you'd like to only see the title and not the author
and then you are done in the settings for Carousel.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.639
The one I really like is Reveal.

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:51.159
Reveal is this type of composition
that shows all the information

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:56.929
with that typical layout, but let's remove the organization.

00:15:56.929 --> 00:16:01.709
Then you can also set up the transition
in between those two elements.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:07.330
You can change by picking one of the
transitions you may like for this configuration.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.330
Let's select Zoom Dissolve.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:15.810
Then it comes to the content itself.

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:20.709
This is a nice preview of what could be
the dual source so you can get an idea

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.450
about how it's going to look like for one of your podcasts.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.160
I'd like to use my own watermark.

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:28.610
You see by default, there is this Apple logo.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:33.060
Again, if I want to use my watermark,
I just drag and drop file.

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:39.629
I'd like it on the left, maybe
a bit bigger, more opacity.

00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:44.700
We've also introduced this concept of introduction overlay.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.390
We've provided three different overlays.

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:49.319
One I really like is the Ticker one.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.700
Maybe you'd like to add it at the beginning
of your content some additional information.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:03.009
In my case, since I'm also using a bumper title, I
would like to show in the Ticker only the description.

00:17:03.009 --> 00:17:11.170
It means at the beginning of my content I will
have a nice description ticker showing up.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:17.529
You could also decide to remove elements as
easy as just clicking on it, deleting it.

00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:20.680
That's very simple and then add
it back using this buzz button.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:30.700
In my case here, I would like to use the new exit
that my audio and video department has created for me.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:37.539
I'm pretty all set now and if I would like to have a nice
looking preview, I could use the scheming over my vignette

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:44.950
to have a nice view of the different settings I've
set or maybe what I would like to have is a preview,

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:50.830
a simulation of all these elements stitched
together and that's what this button is for.

00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:55.230
I could click on this button and have a nice preview of it.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:02.799
This is my introduction video, this is my zoom
dissolve, then my bumper title I'm going to use,

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:12.680
my content with my watermark, the
description ticker should appear, here it is,

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.380
and then finally my altra-video, it's as easy as that.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.010
I would like to give you.

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:23.349
[ Applause ]

00:18:23.349 --> 00:18:24.539
Thank you.

00:18:24.539 --> 00:18:27.690
I would like to give you some tips and tricks here.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:33.870
You maybe want to actually remove all
the settings and styles from scratch.

00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:39.000
Just simply click Command and Delete
and then you'll erase everything

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.089
and you'll be able to start really from something clean.

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:44.990
Let me have this back for the rest of the demo.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:50.140
Something else, maybe you want to have multiple
different sizes for the Preview Simulator.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.080
The default one is that big.

00:18:52.079 --> 00:19:02.369
If you want it bigger, actually just use the Option key
while clicking and you'll get something much bigger.

00:19:02.369 --> 00:19:10.000
Once you've branded your content, then it's time
to define what are going to be the exporters,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.289
the different formats for your finished podcast.

00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:18.420
That's very important because people are
going to consume this data differently

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:25.630
and that's why we've titled these exporters, the default
one we provide, are very tightly coupled with Apple devices.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:31.900
We do provide the right codex, the right
encoders for the Apple TV, for the Apple iPhone,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.550
for audio only devices and also for cellular.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:44.549
You could use this QuickTime exporter to pick
one of these different choices automatically,

00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:50.039
but what if you would like to create your
own encoding and tune it for some reasons.

00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:56.899
Well, we have this product called Compressor
and if it's installed in this machine,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.830
then you'll be able to see directly
from Podcast Composer and here it is.

00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:11.039
In that particular case, you'll have then access to all
the default settings they provide and they have a few.

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:19.210
The nice thing is they have this interface to create even
more encoding settings and if you create it and put it

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:24.370
in the default compressor repository, it's
going to show up directly in this interface.

00:20:24.369 --> 00:20:31.429
Let's select one default like the MP3
and maybe another one that could be,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:39.220
I don't know, like H264 streaming, let's say this one.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.900
There are two ways of using Compressor.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.840
The first one, the easiest one is to use
Compressor with Xgrid which means we are going

00:20:47.839 --> 00:20:55.349
to call the Compressor task the same way we're calling the
QuickTime task, so it's going to be scheduled with Xgrid.

00:20:55.349 --> 00:21:02.709
This could also leverage Qmaster if you had a Qmaster
cluster somewhere in your company and by leveraging Qmaster,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:12.100
it means that at the time the Xgrid task is
going to compress, is going to relay to Qmaster

00:21:12.099 --> 00:21:19.469
so the Xgrid job is going to send the request to Qmaster
to actually start the encoding on the Qmaster system

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:25.589
and Xgrid is going to then look at this task
to finish every couple of minutes for example.

00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:32.659
Once you're done with all your different formats,
then it's time to define where you're going

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.700
to post and publish all this information.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:45.910
By default, we leveraged Podcast Library and in this
Podcast Library, we publish all the things we have.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:52.570
We published original sources, we published the preview
files, for example, we generate a poster image for you.

00:21:52.569 --> 00:21:55.240
We also published what we call the Edit Master.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.349
This is a high quality master regenerate
out of the editing stage.

00:21:59.349 --> 00:22:05.539
Just before encoding to all the different
formats, we regenerated high quality versions

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:08.799
that is going to be posted to the Library.

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:14.279
And then we publish all these different
formats we have just selected before.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:19.869
The cool thing about key words is we could add
different key words that are going to be added

00:22:19.869 --> 00:22:24.959
to all these different movies and since
we are talking about the Podcast Library,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:32.620
then we are going to create automatically key words
feeds for you so everyone could actually access to some

00:22:32.619 --> 00:22:38.579
of the content that's been tagged with these key
words from our RSS automatically for you.

00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:44.250
But you may want to actually publish
to some other destinations.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.049
So we provide a set of different destinations here.

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:50.509
For example, you may want to push
the content to add the Apple Wiki.

00:22:50.509 --> 00:22:56.849
So let's push it, let's push some elements
such as maybe the iPod and iPhone version.

00:22:56.849 --> 00:23:06.859
You enter all your credentials right in the tool and
select the destination folder or destination blog on Wiki.

00:23:06.859 --> 00:23:10.099
This is just as easy as that.

00:23:10.099 --> 00:23:17.809
You could also archive that using file transfer to any
file server using FTP, SFTP, WebDAV[assumed spelling],

00:23:17.809 --> 00:23:22.309
WebDAV over SSL There are many different
file transfer protocol we do support.

00:23:22.309 --> 00:23:27.559
You could also leverage file cast server
using a watch folder or a casual content

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:32.849
that pushed your content to some other shared folder.

00:23:32.849 --> 00:23:35.490
There is this nice cool new feature here.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.700
You can also chain workflows.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:43.480
So, yes, you could chain workflows you create with
Podcast Composer, but this is also very useful if we'd

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.730
like to chain a workflow you have written manually.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:56.480
So for example, you may use Podcast Composer to
write this very complex workflow done for you,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.289
but you would like to add like two or
three tasks manually that you have written.

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:05.789
So it's the place where you are going to
call your small subset of tasks right there

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:10.730
by specifying first what are going to be the
input sources and then by specifying what's going

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.160
to be the workflow you would like to chain here.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.029
And I think this is really useful.

00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:27.819
Then it's time to notify people and also notify services
that some content has been generated and published.

00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:31.009
So there are two ways for notifying people.

00:24:31.009 --> 00:24:34.089
You can notify people by email.

00:24:34.089 --> 00:24:39.539
By default, we do notify people under the
Submitting User and the Administrator

00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:43.279
but you can also notify any user you want.

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:50.720
Again, put your own credentials in this tool and this is
going to take care of everything for you and it's going also

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:57.870
to generate a nice body with all different links to
these different destinations you've selected previously.

00:24:57.869 --> 00:24:59.969
We've added iChat and this is my favorite.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.529
It leverages a Java server.

00:25:01.529 --> 00:25:08.819
We have a Mac OS X server and it produces
what you have seen in the previous demo.

00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:16.509
But maybe you'd like to tell your service or iTunes
U that some content is now available in the Library.

00:25:16.509 --> 00:25:24.420
Let's imagine that you have registered some of your
feeds into the iTunes Podcast Directory or into iTunes U

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.310
and then it's time to tell them that
there are some new content available

00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:32.089
and it's time to synchronize those two services.

00:25:32.089 --> 00:25:34.769
But you could also do that with your own service.

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:44.509
Maybe you could decide then to ping one of your services
to tell them that some new content is available.

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:51.420
And finally, you have a nice summary
of the workflow you have just created.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.029
This workflow is dual source.

00:25:54.029 --> 00:26:05.369
It encodes the result in four different formats, publishes
it in three different locations and notifies some users

00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:13.009
and some services and this is Podcast
Composer and this is your workflow.

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:19.180
[ Applause ]

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.620
So as I said before it generates
automatically a poster image for you

00:26:22.619 --> 00:26:30.989
but you could also set this poster image manually
so every single input sources that are going to run

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:35.289
through this workflow is going to be actually
generated, the poster images are going

00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:38.539
to be the same for all of these different submissions.

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:41.779
The nice thing I wanted to show you is this one.

00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:48.720
Even if this workflow looks really sequential, well
this application takes care of everything for you

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:56.170
and it also generates the most optimal workflow
to run on Xgrid and if you look at these numbers,

00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:05.150
this workflow has about 27 tasks and the maximum
parallelism is about to be 10, which means at some point

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:12.230
in the execution it's possible to have like 10 of these
tasks executed at the same time if you're grid is big enough

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:17.180
and that's really important because as you've seen,
it's really easy to build a workflow with this tool,

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:23.810
but it also takes care of generating
the most optimal workflow for your grid.

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:33.569
Two or three additional quick things, from this
application you can open remotely the workflows you have

00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:41.069
on different servers so it's as easy as just opening
the remote panel, selecting to your workflow,

00:27:41.069 --> 00:27:50.119
selecting to your server and having the least
of all the different workflows like this.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:58.150
It's also as easy as one click to deploy
workflow automatically on the server by clicking

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.990
on this button or directly from the File menu.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:07.549
Another interesting point is you could also
make sure that this workflow is correct.

00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:14.990
So if I would like to look at this workflow, it's actually
telling me that the Qmaster isn't set properly and yes,

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.549
I've just enabled it but I have no information entered here.

00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:27.589
You can very easily use this tool to also check that you
aren't missing information so that it is totally safe

00:28:27.589 --> 00:28:31.939
for you to run this workflow on the server for your users.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:38.500
One last point, Podcast Composer
generates sales content workflows.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:45.170
It means it's going to embed every single resource you have
added to this workflow, including all the compositions,

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.680
all the templates and then all your
images, videos and so on and so forth.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:57.920
If you want to share this workflow with other people, then
you'll have all the resources you need to actually run it

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.519
on a machine and you don't have to actually
share also all these resources separately.

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:04.009
Thank you very much.

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:08.890
[ Applause ]

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.220
>>Thanks Eric.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.500
So you guys like that?

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.069
>> Yeah.

00:29:12.069 --> 00:29:13.579
>> You're going to use it?

00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:18.500
Great. So what you just saw in
this demo, let's recap real quick.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.230
There's three types of workflows that
you can create with Podcast Composer.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.140
You can create a single source like you had in Leopard.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.509
It's real easy to create a real good-looking dual
source workflow and you can use the new Montage feature

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:33.319
to submit all different types of documents.

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:40.299
We've made it really, really easy so you can just drag and
drop all your different resources and brand your podcasts.

00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:46.210
We've also built in support for all the
different devices straight into the application.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.860
We've also made it extremely easy for you
to publish and notify different services.

00:29:50.859 --> 00:29:55.479
But there's something else about Podcast Producer.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.849
The whole solution of Podcast Producer
is extremely customizable.

00:29:58.849 --> 00:30:02.809
We've always made it so that you
can extend Podcast Producer to fit

00:30:02.809 --> 00:30:05.500
into your organization and it can then meet your needs.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.099
Well Podcast Composer is no exception.

00:30:08.099 --> 00:30:14.329
As you saw with the Quartz Composer compositions that
we're using for let's say dual source, for the titling

00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:19.839
and the transitions, well since these are Quartz Composer
compositions, that means that if you want to write your own,

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:23.049
you could integrate them into Podcast Composer.

00:30:23.049 --> 00:30:28.809
All it takes is you just drop them in the
application support folder for Podcast Composer.

00:30:28.809 --> 00:30:30.559
The same thing goes for templates.

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:37.210
So if you want to write email template, or a blog-posting
template, you can create your own, drop it into the folder

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:42.019
and then anybody who uses Podcast Composer
will have access to those templates.

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:47.970
As Eric mentioned, there's also the compressor settings,
so now you can create your own very custom settings

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.920
if you have a particular need, or a
particular device that you need to target.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.029
And that's what I'm going to show you now.

00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:58.170
I'm going to show you how you can
customize Podcast Composer.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.190
So we're going to switch back here to the demo machine.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.509
And I've got some comps already prepared here.

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:09.779
So I don't, if you remember in the first demo we saw,
what I want to start off with was the animated watermark.

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:13.609
So let's go here to my little folder.

00:31:13.609 --> 00:31:21.519
So I've got this little Quartz Composer composition
that was really easy, really not very complicated.

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:22.930
It's just a few patches.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:29.740
And all it is, is it takes in the, it takes in the logo,
and it just animates it by rotating it around the Y axis.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.269
And you can see just real simple like that.

00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:35.869
So how do I get this into Podcast Composer?

00:31:37.109 --> 00:31:43.799
Well, if I open Podcast Composer here,
it's pretty much as you'd expect.

00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:51.909
I can just go here, grab my Quartz Composer composition,
drag it in here, and now I've got my rotating title

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.960
and I can still do everything I
could so with an image, right.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.860
I can make it more, a little more darker, I can
change the sizing, I can move it into the corner.

00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:01.579
This is great with Quartz Composer compositions.

00:32:01.579 --> 00:32:03.250
You can do the same thing with movies.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:08.480
So your watermark can be anything from an image
to a movie, to a Quartz Composer composition.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.259
So that's how you make and wrote an animated watermark.

00:32:13.259 --> 00:32:20.140
So the next one I want to show you is how
to create a very a simple title composition.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:26.990
And as Eric explained, we have 2 types of, of
compositions, titling compositions in Podcast Composer.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.390
The first is what we call a bumper
title, which comes before your content.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.180
And then we have an overlay title
that goes over your content.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.340
So I'm going to show you how to
build a bumper title real easily.

00:32:37.339 --> 00:32:42.929
So we've created this bundle format in, in, for
Podcast Composer that's in the documentation

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:46.080
and it's going to be documented how to create it.

00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:51.259
And just for the sake of the demo, I'm really going
to concentrate here on the composition itself.

00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:56.650
And I'm going to start off here with this
composition here, which is pretty empty.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.550
And I'm going to build up the title for you.

00:32:58.549 --> 00:33:02.529
So let me just set this up properly
so we can all see what's going on.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.880
So we're just going to put this up here.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:16.890
So for the, the titling composition to be able to work with
Podcast Composer, it needs to abide to a certain protocol.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:22.120
And what you can see up here on the
left here is, is basically this.

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:24.869
These are the ports that you're
providing to Podcast Composer,

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:28.279
so it can pass the information to your composition.

00:33:28.279 --> 00:33:31.940
And in this example, you can see, you
can specify the titling information,

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.110
maybe an author, date, copyright and so on.

00:33:35.109 --> 00:33:36.750
I want to do a real simple one.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.220
And we're just going to use the title, so I
can get rid of all of these other supports

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.289
so it looks, so it's not quite so hectic here.

00:33:44.289 --> 00:33:50.029
Now what I need to do in Podcast, in Quartz
Composer is generate an image out of this string

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:52.529
and then put it out on, and render it out to the screen.

00:33:52.529 --> 00:34:01.480
So to do that, I'm going to go to my patch library,
just going to bring up my image with string patch,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.349
drop that in here, and I'm also going to need
some way of rendering this to the screen.

00:34:05.349 --> 00:34:09.360
And the easiest way to do that in Quartz
Composer is with the billboard patch.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.120
So I'm just going to drop this here.

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:17.559
And now you're going to see, I've got my titling
information coming from Podcast Composer,

00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:20.070
just going to attach it to the string here.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.100
And I've got my image coming out which
I'm just going to connect to my billboard.

00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:28.159
And you can now see that I have
my title being rendered to screen.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:30.839
But it's not quite the right size.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.420
So there's a few parameters I can play with.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.260
The first thing is, I want it to
have the right aspect ratio.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.910
And to do that I just need to know, get some
information about the rendering destinations.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:47.269
So this patch is just going to tell me, is going to give
me information about what size I'm rendering to screen.

00:34:47.269 --> 00:34:57.119
So we're just going to connect the width here, the
height, and I'm just going to make this text a bit bigger.

00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:58.969
You see now we're on two lines.

00:34:58.969 --> 00:35:01.349
And I might even want to make this just a bit wider.

00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:03.179
And there we go.

00:35:03.179 --> 00:35:05.859
You can see I've got my title on screen.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.890
That's great.

00:35:06.889 --> 00:35:11.069
But you see a lot of what we do, and what
really makes Quartz Composer powerful is

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.990
that I can animate all my content.

00:35:13.989 --> 00:35:19.250
So I, basically here with the exposition you can
see here I can play with where my content is.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:25.380
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to use a timeline to animate this.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.160
And so I don't have to, this is what
the final patch is going to look like.

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:32.569
I'm just going to steal this timeline here.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:41.090
Oops, that's not what I want to
show you yet, we'll get there.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:42.059
So this is the timeline.

00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:47.599
And if I bring up Inspector here, I can
show you what the timeline looks like.

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:54.429
And if we look at how the ex, what I've set up for a graph
for the exposition, you can see that I'm starting off at -2.

00:35:54.429 --> 00:35:58.159
Because when the exposition that -2
well the text is completely off screen.

00:35:58.159 --> 00:36:03.109
And then I'm going to end up at +2 where my text, my
screen is, my text is all the way off to the right side.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:07.200
So basically, I'm going to fly my text in from
the left, and it's going to slow down a bit,

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:10.139
and then it's going to accelerate
off and then fly off to the right.

00:36:10.139 --> 00:36:15.059
And that's what this little timeline is doing.

00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:19.750
So all I have to do now is take my exposition,
and I connect it here to my billboard.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.010
We start and stop this.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:27.250
We can now see that my text is going
to fly in, and then just fly off.

00:36:28.949 --> 00:36:29.759
That's great.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.520
Maybe I'll want to do one last thing here.

00:36:31.519 --> 00:36:33.679
And I'm just going to add some alpha to it.

00:36:33.679 --> 00:36:39.419
So we have the nice little effect of when it flies
in it fades in and when it flies out it fades out.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.700
So to do that I just have to set the color on the billboard.

00:36:42.699 --> 00:36:46.739
So if it's black and it's completely
opaque, well then it's going to be,

00:36:46.739 --> 00:36:49.489
the text is going to be black and
you're not going to see it.

00:36:49.489 --> 00:36:53.549
So to do that, I just need to get a
color pack, generate a color here.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.620
And the color lets me set different things.

00:36:55.619 --> 00:36:57.329
But what I'm really interested in is in the alpha.

00:36:57.329 --> 00:37:01.340
And if we go back to the timeline patch, you can see here

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.230
that I already have a graph set
laid out for the alpha as well.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:09.199
We start at 0, because at 0 you won't be
able to see it, it'll be completely black.

00:37:09.199 --> 00:37:13.119
And we'll fade up to 1 where it'll be
completely opaque and we can see the text.

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:18.359
At the same time, when we fly out, so if I bring up
the exposition, you can put both on the same graph.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.390
We'll fade out the content.

00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:26.379
So now if I just hook this to the color,
and I hook the color to the billboard,

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:31.369
can bring this here, can make it a bit bigger.

00:37:31.369 --> 00:37:34.199
And we can play it again.

00:37:34.199 --> 00:37:40.329
And see, now my text flies in, fades in, and
it's going to fade out while it flies out.

00:37:40.329 --> 00:37:41.159
So there you go.

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:44.349
That's how you can create Quartz Composer composition.

00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:47.210
But now how do I get this into Podcast Composer?

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.490
Well that's pretty easy too.

00:37:48.489 --> 00:37:51.139
And I'm going to show you that right now.

00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:58.119
So I'm just going to go to the bottom here,
my simple title, where I have my PQC file.

00:37:58.119 --> 00:38:02.779
And I'm going to open up a new
window here, and we're going to go

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.870
to the application support folder for Podcast Composer.

00:38:06.869 --> 00:38:09.170
And you're going to see, there's a lot of folders in here,

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:13.750
because there's a lot of things that
you can set for Podcast Composer.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:20.059
And here, we created a composition for the bumper
title, so all I have to do here is grab my simple title,

00:38:20.059 --> 00:38:23.980
and I'm going to copy it into the bumper folder.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:31.369
Now, if I launch Podcast Composer, it's going
to automatically pick this new title up.

00:38:31.369 --> 00:38:35.279
And if I double-click here, you're going to
see now in the pop-up I've got my simple title.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.870
[ Clapping ]

00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:41.099
>> And that's how you can create your own title.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:47.470
And it's going to fly out.

00:38:47.469 --> 00:38:52.109
So that's how to create your own
title in the Quartz Composer.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:57.180
The next thing I want to show you is the email templates.

00:38:57.179 --> 00:39:02.219
We ship by default a real good looking
email template that works great in mail

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:06.109
on the desktop, or even on, mail on the phone.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.550
But it uses the Podcast Capture icon.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:12.019
And I can imagine that maybe there's a few
of you out there that for your Podcast,

00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:16.389
you want to brand these notification emails
with the, the logo of your corporation.

00:39:16.389 --> 00:39:18.159
Well it's very easy to do that as well.

00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:25.309
And we have these PMU bundles that
allow you to create mail unit bundles.

00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:28.259
And these are basically your mail templates.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:32.590
So in the same way, you'll see here, I
have the corporation logo that I want

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.730
to use here that I've dropped into the folder.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.780
And all I have to do for this thing is in the same way,

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:44.000
is if I go back to the application support,
let's close down the compositions here.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.590
Go to templates, mail, and I can drag this in here.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:40:02.820
And now if I re-launch Podcast Composer, and I go down to
the notification step, and if I want to add an email now,

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.210
you'll see that now Podcast Composer's
automatically detected that there are different types

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.699
of mail templates installed on the system.

00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:14.199
So I can use the Apple generic one, or
maybe I want to use my corporation's one.

00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:18.710
Now we'll be documenting how to use and how
to create all of these different bundles,

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.990
but it's going to be really straightforward and
it's going to be very easy for you just to drop in,

00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:27.000
in your corporation, or your organization's
logo, so you can have your own emails.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.429
And the same thing is going to go for your blog
postings and all different other kind of templates.

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:34.579
So that's the email template.

00:40:34.579 --> 00:40:39.449
See, so now we get to have some fun.

00:40:39.449 --> 00:40:46.460
I don't know how much, how many of you have been
following what's happened with Quartz Composer,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:51.630
and well since their session is right now, you
probably don't know this yet, quite yet, either.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:55.700
But they have new support in Snow Leopard for 3D models.st=yl8

00:40:55.699 --> 00:40:59.609
And you know, we like to have fun
with all the new technologies.

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:06.090
So I've downloaded this 3D model of a billboard that,
you know, I can play around with, it's kind of cool.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:11.710
But what's really cool is with Quartz Composer
I can put images onto the different meshes.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:16.340
So if I want to, I could put any
kind of video on my billboard.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.680
So that's what we did.

00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:26.769
So let me show you what happens if I drag this one
in to my dual source composition template folder.

00:41:26.769 --> 00:41:28.309
Here we go.

00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:31.809
Just copy that in there.

00:41:31.809 --> 00:41:38.719
And this is just to give you an idea how you can brand
your own dual source compositions and how you could go out

00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:40.599
and really have fun with Quartz Composer.

00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:45.289
But it's also a great third party integration point
if you're a third party out there that knows how

00:41:45.289 --> 00:41:50.340
to use Quartz Composer and you're really good
at it, you can write some really great bundles

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.289
of stuff and integrate with Podcast Composer.

00:41:53.289 --> 00:42:00.759
So this is, you see now that I've got my little billboard
down here, so you see wow, it doesn't look that different.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:07.390
Well, until we zoom out, and you might kind of recognize
the building in the back there with the two billboards.

00:42:07.389 --> 00:42:08.549
So that's kind of small.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:09.850
So let's play that in a bigger screen.

00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:18.809
And of course, you can play around, you can
animate your three different, your 3D models.s=tylY

00:42:18.809 --> 00:42:22.360
What, it's having trouble finding the screen.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.390
So there you go.

00:42:23.449 --> 00:42:28.599

00:42:28.739 --> 00:42:32.219

always playing with Quartz Composer.

[ Chuckles ]

00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:41.730
>> So that was the demo for how to
customize Podcast, Podcast Composer.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:46.769
So what you should take home from here.

00:42:46.769 --> 00:42:52.420
Well, as with Leopard, Podcast user workflows
are still as powerful and easy to use.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:59.980
But with Podcast Composer, we've made it easier than ever
for you to customize and create really beautiful podcasts.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.869
But we haven't stopped just there.

00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:05.869
We let you extend it and incorporate
your own content extremely easily.

00:43:05.869 --> 00:43:09.480
And if the third party is out there,
we have tons of little hooks for you

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.119
to bring in your content and your own expertise.

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:19.529
Podcast Composer also ties in with all of the new
features that we've been talking about all week.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:23.400
You saw that there's direct integration
with a Podcast library.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.730
We tightened straight with a dual source, so you can
choose all your different layouts with Quartz Composer.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:32.610
We tie in with iTunes U, we have the
Pro Apps Integration for the Compressor.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:37.030
So it ties right in and it's really at the
center of the whole Podcast user workflows.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:44.830
So for those of you who've been to our presentations
before, you know we can't just stop there.

00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:51.299
We always like to push it a bit further and show
you how powerful Podcast user workflows are.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:57.000
And we've kind of had some fun, and I guess
it's time for this year's crazy workflow.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.489
[ Clapping ]

00:44:04.489 --> 00:44:09.000
>> So, we know that transcription is a really
important thing for a lot of you out there.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.539
And for those of you who were here last
year, we showed you a really early prototype

00:44:12.539 --> 00:44:16.360
from MacSpeech that allowed you to automate everything.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.900
But we know that a lot of you need this
transcription integration like yesterday.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.710
So we worked on a little demo.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:30.050
And I think we're going to show you how you can integrate
Podcast Producer with external services really simply.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:36.780
And to do that, I'm going to bring up
Circlaeys and Sons Transcription Service.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.800
So we've got Eric Circlaeys and his son Nader.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.670
[ Chuckles ]

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:48.889
>> And what we're going to do is I'm going to
launch straight into, the one more thing demo.

00:44:48.889 --> 00:44:54.299
So what I'm going to do here.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:59.830
Oh, to do this, I'm going to give about two or three
sentences that we're going to have them transcribe.

00:44:59.829 --> 00:45:01.639
But I need some type of topic.

00:45:01.639 --> 00:45:05.759
And just so you guys don't think this is all
staged, you're going to have to give me a topic

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.870
that I'm going to have to invent some sentences about.

00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:08.789
>> Beer.

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:09.079
>> Beer.

00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:09.650
[ Chuckles ]

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:19.309
>> How come I wasn't even expecting that one?

[ Chuckles ]

00:45:19.769 --> 00:45:23.000
>> So, I'm going to log into Podcast Capture.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:37.579

00:45:37.579 --> 00:45:40.929
>> Okay. Getting sick yet?

No.

[ Silence ]

00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:50.279
>> So beer is a very popular drink.

[ Laughter ]

00:45:53.039 --> 00:45:59.139

00:45:59.139 --> 00:46:00.480
[ Laughter ]

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.219
>> My favorite beer is Guiness.

00:46:03.219 --> 00:46:03.469
[ Clapping ]

00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:12.819
>> So, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
publish this to a workflow that we have set up here.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.000
And we're going to call this beer.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.739
[ Silence ]

00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:25.369
>> Do talk.

00:46:25.369 --> 00:46:31.789
Okay. So while this is processing,
I'm going to explain what's happening.

00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:38.469
What we've done with this workflow is the, so Podcast
Capture is uploading into the Podcast User Server.

00:46:38.469 --> 00:46:40.259
And what is the Podcast User Server doing?

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:44.230
Well the first thing it's going to do is it's
going to create a low res version of the,

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.030
of the, the content that we just submitted.

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:52.019
What's happening then is that the low res
version is being transferred to

00:46:52.019 --> 00:46:55.960
the SFTP to Circlaeys and Sons Transcription Service.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:02.579
And they've written a little app here, that I can
show you real quick and give you a little look at,

00:47:02.579 --> 00:47:05.460
that allows him to transcribe the content.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:10.059
And he forgot his headset.

00:47:10.059 --> 00:47:14.019
So he's going to be transcribing, so
Eric's going to be writing in French,

00:47:14.019 --> 00:47:16.019
and he's going to be translating this straight.

00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:19.559
And Eric, and then Nader's going
to be writing it in English.

00:47:19.559 --> 00:47:26.710
They're going to transcribe it and they're going to
create the TextML files straight in this application.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:32.559
And then, in QuickTime, something that you may not
have heard yet, is that there's a new TextML importer

00:47:32.559 --> 00:47:40.769
that allows you to import TextML tracks as subtitles,
and the same thing goes for closed captioning tracks.

00:47:40.769 --> 00:47:43.739
But while they're processing this, we can paralyze it.

00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:48.719
So not only with Xgrid can we paralyze tasks
in parallel, but we can put them in parallel.

00:47:48.719 --> 00:47:53.549
So while they're transcribing, we're
also encoding the iPod version with all

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:56.570
of the video editing and the Quartz Composer compositions.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:03.400
And what's going to happen then is once the iPod version
is finished encoding the Xgrid is going to use one

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:08.329
of the new features of Xgrid in Snow Leopard,
which is what we call the retry task.

00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:13.259
So what it's going to do is it's going to
poll the out-going folder on the SFTP Server

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:17.530
from the transcription service to
see if the transcription is ready.

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:22.950
If it's not ready, with the retry task
the job can tell the Xgrid controller

00:48:22.949 --> 00:48:26.099
to reschedule it in a certain amount of time.

00:48:26.099 --> 00:48:31.559
So you don't have to lock up a whole
CPU just polling the SFTP Server.

00:48:31.559 --> 00:48:34.719
How are we looking?

00:48:34.719 --> 00:48:41.819
So once the task has figured out that the, the
transcriptions are available, it'll just download them,

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:46.240
and then it'll add them into the final content.

00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:48.039
So, let's take a look at the content.

00:48:48.039 --> 00:48:54.279
Going to go to iTunes here.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.230
Well, going to refresh this.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:00.429
So we have back-up content in case.

00:49:00.429 --> 00:49:02.000
And here we go.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.500

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:12.570
>> And you can see here that iTunes
has popped up the subtitle track here.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:17.950
And that we have two subtitles, English and French.

00:49:17.949 --> 00:49:19.909
So, let's see how good a job Eric.

00:49:19.909 --> 00:49:19.989
[ Chuckles ]

00:49:19.989 --> 00:49:23.179
>> Eric and Nader did.

00:49:23.179 --> 00:49:29.619

>> And you know transcription is great,
but you know, you can also translate it.

00:49:40.199 --> 00:49:42.549
>> So beer is a very popular drink.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.519

possible for you to integrate with.

So this is a work phone.

I think it's going to be really useful to a lot of you.

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:07.880
And, you know, when we started showing
this off, a lot of people really wanted it.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.119
So we'll be talking about it at the lab on Friday.

00:50:10.119 --> 00:50:12.880
So if you have any interest, please come and talk with us.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.599
And we'll also be working on making it sample code.

00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:19.839
And we'll be documenting it, so it will, make
it as easy as possible for you to integrate

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.980
with your existing transcription services.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:30.099
[ Clapping ]

00:50:30.099 --> 00:50:33.719
>> Okay. But then, that ended up
being a kind of a useful demo.

00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:36.529
So, we've got one more last thing.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:43.570
And we've got a little fun demo here and
as always the point of this is to show you

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:49.650
that since Podcast User Workflows rely on Xgrid, they
can do anything you can write a command line tool to do.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:53.730
So we've got a little thing we've prepared for you.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:59.519
And something we've noticed in education, and what we think
is kind of cool is a lot of people are using technology

00:50:59.519 --> 00:51:02.159
to make the classroom a lot more interactive.

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:08.699
And there's some cool tools out there, like
Mobile AP that allow you to have web applications

00:51:08.699 --> 00:51:12.369
to have students interact with
the lecturers, or the professors.

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:19.369
So they can ask questions, they can vote on polls,
they can leave comments, all sorts of things.

00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:26.909
So we randomly selected a few of you, and I'm going to
invite you to come up right here in front of the stage.

00:51:26.909 --> 00:51:29.529
And strangely enough, they're all
in the front row, I don't know why.

to open this up to everybody.

Didn't say it was an easy quiz.

00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:24.439
>> Question number two.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.059
>> Question number two.

00:54:28.059 --> 00:54:29.119
Wow, there's some good ones.

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:31.119
So how did you tell it was in Paris?

00:54:31.119 --> 00:54:31.699
>> [Inaudible].

00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:32.119
>> Shorter.

00:54:32.119 --> 00:54:32.889
[ Laughter ]

00:54:32.889 --> 00:54:35.900
>> But you know it's kind of hard to tell in a picture.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.519
The easiest way to tell is the base.

00:54:38.519 --> 00:54:42.550
Something you might not know though is that,
so the Statute of Liberty was a present

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:45.280
by the French Republic to the United States.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:51.700
But it's Eiffel who actually constructed and designed
structure that holds up the Statute of Liberty.

00:54:51.699 --> 00:54:54.129
So that's why there's one in Paris.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:59.289
So question number three.

00:54:59.289 --> 00:55:01.980
This one's a bit harder.

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:05.050
It's Tokyo.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.170
See there's cherry trees.

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.519
[ Chuckles ]

00:55:06.519 --> 00:55:09.929
That wasn't Anaheim.

00:55:09.929 --> 00:55:12.309
[ Chuckles ]

00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:15.119
>> Okay, is our workflow finished?

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:15.500
>> Yes.

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:19.369
>> It is? Let's see how you guys did.

00:55:19.369 --> 00:55:27.239
So what we did, before we start playing it back, is we're
going to use Podcast Producer and with a command line,

00:55:27.239 --> 00:55:32.579
with all of our command line tools, we're
using Mobile AP as the web application.

00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:38.279
So what everybody up here was doing is they were logged
into Mobile AP on their iPhones, and they had the questions,

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.240
and they had the different results, the different,
the multiple answers that they could choose from.

00:55:42.239 --> 00:55:45.729
And they would choose them, and they would submit.

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:47.530
This goes into the database on the Mobile AP,

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:52.660
and then when the Podcast Producer Command ran it
knew what time we started and stopped the recording.

00:55:52.659 --> 00:55:56.989
And it could interrogate the database
to find out what answers were written.

00:55:56.989 --> 00:56:00.699
Then we then kind of used Quartz Composer
because, yes, I have always have to have fun

00:56:00.699 --> 00:56:04.529
in Quartz Composer, to do some fun little animations.

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:07.000
So here's what it looks like.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.369
>> [Inaudible].

00:56:09.369 --> 00:56:16.359
>> Took a while to start.

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.950
So, this worked right, we should see who voted.

00:56:19.949 --> 00:56:22.139
And you can see, what.

00:56:22.139 --> 00:56:22.809
>> Wow.

00:56:22.809 --> 00:56:24.079
>> People voted.

00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:25.849
>> Wow it really [inaudible].

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:31.029
>> So, some people got it.

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.940
I think some people had already seen the answers.

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:36.070
Question number two.

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:40.840
So let's see how they did.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:52.620
New York, got a lot of people, one
person got it right, two, ooh three.

00:56:52.619 --> 00:56:54.420
[ Chuckles ]

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.760
>> And one last one.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.950
This was the hardest one.

00:57:01.949 --> 00:57:07.449
[ Silence ]

00:57:07.449 --> 00:57:07.509
[ Chuckles ]

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.860
[ Laughter ]

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:14.670
>> See it took a while to figure it out.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:16.789
Yeah, it's still thinking about it.

00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:17.239
>> Oh London.

00:57:17.239 --> 00:57:18.579
>> Okay. Cool.

00:57:18.579 --> 00:57:22.940
So this is just to show you what you can do.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:30.730
[ Clapping ]

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:31.909
>> So just to give you an idea.

00:57:31.909 --> 00:57:34.750
I mean you can really do whatever
you want with Podcast Producer.

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:38.440
And if you want to write your custom
one workflows, you can really, I mean,

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.050
the bounds are only limited by your imagination.
