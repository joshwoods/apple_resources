WEBVTT

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.640
>> Welcome to the What's New in Wiki Server 2 session.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.910
My name is John Anderson and I'm
the Manager of the Wiki Server Team.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.219
Today, we're going to be talking about some of the new
features in Snow Leopard's Wiki Server including the ability

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:34.280
to create wikis from the web and there are a lot of
implications from this that we're really excited about.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.200
Next, we're going to show you how you can search
across all the wikis on your server simultaneously

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.420
and see updates for all the wikis that you care about.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.310
We're also going to show you an iPhone-optimized
version of the wiki server and we're going

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.130
to show you web-based personal calendars, which allow you

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.820
to access not only read your calendar
but invite people to new events.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.850
We're going to show you how you can
view documents online without needing

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.829
to download them using server side Quick Look.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.489
And finally, we will be showing you some
new tools that we provided theme developers

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.119
so that you can extend the server in more ways than ever.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.710
Now, before I do that, I'm going to get in to some of
the features that wiki server already has in Leopard.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:18.529
And first and foremost in that is a great WYSIWYG editor,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.230
and this means that anyone can edit
pages and it's extremely unintimidating.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.210
However, for those of you that
actually do want to use markup,

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.019
we figured that the most well-known
markup there is, is HTML.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:33.810
So you can code your pages by hand in HTML if you want to.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.710
Now, of course, there is one asterisk
here, one caveat and that's that with HTML,

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.059
you have a risk of cross-site scripting
and something where one use or can put data

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.799
on a page that gets executed as another user.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.709
In order to safeguard against that, we have a very versatile
HTML scrubber which you can configure however you want.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.780
But by default, it's configured
to drop any scripting attributes

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.150
and tags that could be used to
exploit other people's sessions.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.439
We also have a built-in weblog server
and that includes podcasting support.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:14.909
So if you turn that on, you can send podcasts out
either via a great Web UI or through Podcast Producer.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.289
We have searchable mailing list archives.

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:24.219
This means you can enable an email address that you can send
to, which will get cc'd out to everybody that's in the wiki

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.990
and also will get archived online for easy retrieval.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.550
We, of course, in Leopard offered a
web-based calendar for wikis which means

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.980
that your wiki can contain its own calendar.

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.979
We've enhanced that for Snow Leopard
as well to allow for multiple calendars

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:45.449
in multiple colors and to allow for subscription in iCal.

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:51.959
But, of course, everybody here is probably here to
see what's new for Wiki Server 2 in Snow Leopard.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.950
And first and foremost, the thing that's
really big for us this year is the fact

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.449
that wikis are no longer tied to Open Directory groups.

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:06.810
That means that [applause]-- that
means that a wiki is just that.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.590
It's just a wiki.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.200
It's not necessarily tied to any particular
entity in the directory and this means

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.119
that you can create or manage wikis from the web.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.110
That means somebody can make a wiki from
a Windows machine, from a Mac machine,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.510
and they don't need to be bound to Open Directory to do so.

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.329
It means that groups can have more than one wiki.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.760
So instead of having to make duplicate groups in
your directory to handle all the different wikis

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:35.419
that a particular Open Directory group
wants to have, it's much more versatile now.

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:41.459
You are actually allowed fine-grained access permissions
which means that you can actually pick a combination

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.390
of groups and individual users and choose which of them
have read access and write access and most importantly,

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.129
and this always seems to be a big applause line, you can
have a multiple admins for a wiki now as well [applause].

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.900
This is a big one as well.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.530
There's no need any more to run an OD
Master on the Wiki Server [applause].

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:10.759
And for those of you that are familiar with Snow-- with
Leopard, you may be familiar with ServicesLocator records.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:16.930
It's-- I'll probably get a combination of confusion and
happiness here, but for anybody who's familiar with them,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.900
ServicesLocator records are now
obsolete in Snow Leopard [applause].

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:30.579
So, when you make a decision to create wikis and
set them up with all these different attributes,

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:33.419
you're going to find that you have an awesome new problem,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.550
and that problem is that you're going
to have a ton of wikis on your server.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.660
Even within Apple's deployment, we set
up a server with our engineering group.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.790
We set up a server for ourselves to use.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.230
And then started and invited a couple--
inviting a couple of other groups to use it

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.009
so that we could get people actually
hammering on our Wiki Server and, you know,

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.480
test the performance with more and more users.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.700
We've now found that that single server that
we've deployed and that we're, unfortunately,

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.439
still managing in our engineering
group, now hosts about 500 wikis.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:10.459
And so, we found that we needed to do
something to make it easier to search

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.120
across all the wikis on a particular server.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.079
And our solution to that problem is
something we would like to call "My Page."

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:24.529
This is something which allows you to access all the--
search across all the wikis that you have access to

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:30.669
and you can also see updates for all of the
pages in all the wikis that you care about.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.350
You can set up a lot of different filters here, but
instead of talking about it, I'm actually just going

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.650
to bring Skip Baney on stage to show it to you.

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:40.779
So, Skip.

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:41.889
>> Good morning, everybody.

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.199
I hope you all are enjoying your WWDC so far.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.740
Here's the new Snow Leopard Server homepage.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.170
It access sort of launch pad to all of the web-based
services that you have enabled on your machine.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.310
Since I'd like to get started by showing
you how to create a wiki on the web,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.959
I'm going to go ahead and navigate to the wiki listing page.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:10.699
Now, in order to facilitate demoing this morning,
we've created a fictional startup called Twunk.

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.019
We're all big fans of Twitter in our group and, you know,
there are just not enough third-party Twitter clients

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:19.849
out there, so we decided to create our own.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.780
We already have funding and marketing
wikis and the essentials.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.849
We're at the point where we're
ready to start building something.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.430
So go-- let's go ahead and create an engineering wiki.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.160
I'm going to go over into the sidebar and
click on the Create a New Wiki button.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.480
And up appears our wiki setup assistant.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.879
I'm going to go ahead and give it a name.

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:48.009
Let's give it engineering, and a short description.

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:52.589
[ Pause ]

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:54.859
>> Go ahead and click Next.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.300
And with Leopard, we shipped a ton of great themes.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.480
And in Snow Leopard, we've added even more, including
our default Apple theme which I've selected here.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.120
I'm going to go ahead and click Next.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.069
And the last thing I get to do is to
choose the wiki's access control settings.

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:16.740
You can choose to make this wiki publicly accessible or only
accessible to certain users or groups in your directory.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:23.430
Now since this is a dead wiki, I'm going to limit
access to the people in the engineering group.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.970
Go ahead and select that.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.470
And because I have the Send the Email checkbox selected,
a welcome message will be sent out to all the members

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.790
of that group letting them know this wiki-- they have
been just invited to this wiki and provide a link back.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:44.629
So with that, I'm going to create, and
my wiki's provisioned and ready for use.

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:49.110
I can go ahead and click a second time
and I'm taken directly to the wiki

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.350
where I can go ahead and get started adding new content.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:58.820
Now, we're really happy with the way creating
a wiki works on Snow Leopard and we hope

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:02.050
that you and your users will feel the same.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:08.610
I'm going to go ahead and close this window
and go back to the wiki listing page.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.740
Now, you'll see that our engineering
wiki is now on the list.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.009
Because I'm the person who created the wiki, I have the
ability to delete it on the web as well and I can choose

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:24.240
to hide updates from this wiki from the updates list,
which is a feature I'll go into in just a moment.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.250
But, as John mentioned, when you do
make it this easy to create wikis

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.689
on the web, it becomes really difficult sometimes.

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:34.960
You have content spread out over a number
of different locations so you need--

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:42.100
we enhanced our search technology to allow you
to search across multiple wikis on your server.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:48.310
So as a developer in Twunk, I want to
know what features that we're supposed

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:50.289
to be building now that we're getting started.

00:08:50.289 --> 00:08:56.019
So I'll go ahead and search for features in
the Quick Search filter or Quick Search field.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:05.879
And here I have a mix of likely searcher mashes
across a number of different wikis or user blogs.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:10.830
I could go ahead and click on one of these items and be
taken to that page directly but I'm going to go ahead

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.610
and hit Enter and go to the full
search results listing page.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:22.100
Here I can further refine my search
by any combination of type or tag.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.950
Because I'm not really interested in blog posts, I'm
going to go ahead and filter those out of the list.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:33.170
And I'm only interested in pages that are
exclusively tagged with the keyword "features."

00:09:33.169 --> 00:09:39.069
So I'm going to go ahead and click on Features,
and there, I have exactly what I'm looking for.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:46.030
Now, I can go ahead and save this as a smart filter
for use later by clicking on the link in the sidebar,

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:52.839
and I'll call this Project Features, and click Save.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.879
There you have it.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:10:07.039
Now, one thing I'd like to show-- one last thing I'd like
to show you is that we've added the ability to star pages.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:14.509
Now, because starred pages can be used as
criteria in filters and saved as smart filters,

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:19.789
this makes it a really useful to find
just the content that you're looking for.

00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:26.079
>> The last thing MyPage features that I'd like to
show you is the Updates List which I'll navigate

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.070
to by clicking on Updates in the primary header.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:38.260
The Updates list acts as a real-time activity stream
of all the pages that you're watching on the server.

00:10:38.259 --> 00:10:43.029
Here, I have a list of unread page
updates since the last time I visited.

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:48.850
I can click on one of the blue status
messages in the list to open a summary

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.090
of the recent activity that happened on this page.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.600
Here, one-- the page has been edited,
a couple of comments have been added.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.480
If this is not enough information for me, I can go ahead
and click on the title to go directly to that page.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.930
But if that's enough for me to get an idea of
what's happened on that page, I can go ahead

00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:12.739
and continue scanning through items in the list.

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:22.389
We've made the page dynamically resizable so that
all the items that can fit on screen will show there.

00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:27.100
And this is really useful if you're on
the small display device and you want

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.570
to get-make maximum use of the available space.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:40.800
We've also added rich application like keyboard
shortcuts such as using the Spacebar, Page Up,

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:47.319
Page Down as well as well as the up and down
arrow keys so you can quickly scan through items.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.410
Now, once I've looked at everything
and I'm ready to clear out the list,

00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:58.350
I can mark the items as read and
they quickly fade out of view

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.690
Now over on the Sidebar, we have some
common default filters that you might use.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:11.680
One is all items, the other is all of the items that I've
created or edited, all the starred pages that I have as well

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:15.979
as all the pages that are explicitly
tagged with the word Hot.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:22.659
We also include all the smart filters that
you may have saved on the Search page.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:28.379
Now, smart filters combined with starring and
tagging make it really easy for you to find all

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:32.429
of the content that you're looking for on your server.

00:12:32.429 --> 00:12:37.589
Now, you may have noticed that while I was talking,
a few new updates have come in through the list

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.440
because as I mentioned this is a real-time activity stream.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:47.420
We found it really useful to keep this list open throughout
the day and keep abreast of what's happening on your server.

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:54.129
Now, the updates list is really helpful
but you're not always at your desktop.

00:12:54.129 --> 00:12:59.580
So that's why we've created a custom
version for the iPhone that allows you

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.150
to keep abreast of updates while you're on the go.

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:09.639
So I'm going to ahead and close Safari and
launch the iPhone simulator to show you.

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:16.009
Go ahead and open Safari on the phone.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:22.610
And just like the desktop version, we're
presented with the primary updates list.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.779
I have access to all of my default and custom filters.

00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:35.769
I can go ahead and click on the selector here in
the header and I'll go ahead and choose the save--

00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:38.829
smart filter that I created just a few moments ago.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:45.070
I'm going to list the updates and I see just those items.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:51.200
Now, I can click or tap on one of
the items to go into a detailed view.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:59.360
And here, I see the page title, the wiki or blog
that the page came from and the full page content.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:05.990
I can tap on the Details button and
have access to the page's metadata.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.560
There is a change recently.

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:10.209
So I'll go ahead and tap on Show
Changes and see what's happened.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:17.180
It seems that John's prioritizing
the icon for the phase one features.

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:21.549
I can tap on the button again and hide changes.

00:14:21.549 --> 00:14:25.250
And I commented on this page recently
and it looks like someone's replied.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.789
So I'm going to ahead and tap in and see the comments.

00:14:30.789 --> 00:14:32.829
Yeah, I'm not sure if agree either.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:40.320
So I'm going to go ahead and click on the Plus
button to add a new comment straight from the phone.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:50.070
Let's discuss this at the next meeting.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.610
Post and the comment is added.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:15:05.810
Now, I'll go ahead and return to the page detail
view and just like the updates list on the iPhone

00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:13.179
or just like on the desktop, we have access
to star pages, we can add tags or remove tags.

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:19.500
And up in the header bar, we have the up or down arrows
to allow you to quickly stand through page updates.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.539
Now, this is really helpful when you're on the go.

00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:29.889
You can triage new activity that comes in on your
machine and we just found it to be really useful.

00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:32.500
Go ahead and return back to the updates list.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:40.240
And just like My Page on the desktop, we have access to
the Wiki listings, blog listings as well as the ability

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.620
to search across all pages on your server.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:49.179
We think that viewing the wiki on an iPhone
is a fabulous experience in Snow Leopard

00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:55.019
and the new My Page features make it easier than ever
to keep up-to-date with all the activity on your server.

00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:58.009
So with that, I'd like to go ahead
and return things to John.

00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:03.370
[ Applause ]

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.909
>> Thanks Skip.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:10.149
So, the next thing I'd like to
talk about is the Web Calendar.

00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:15.610
Now of course like I said in Leopard, we offered a
Web Calendar for Wikis but we now actually allow you

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.769
to access your personal Web Calendar as well.

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:24.399
And this is kind of neat because this is a
stand-alone service but if you have a Wiki running,

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:28.350
then it gets completely integrated into My Page.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:33.200
Now this is a full-featured calendar
client which has full time zone support,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.629
support for recurrences, you can even receive meetings.

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:39.759
You can see here, I have a notification for a new meeting.

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:43.799
And you can send meetings and actually
browse people's free and busy schedule right

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.879
from the web as you enter people's names.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:49.200
So this is definitely a full-featured calendar client.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:56.759
The really cool thing about this is that this is
actually a complete CalDAV calendar client built entirely

00:16:56.759 --> 00:16:57.470
in JavaScript.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.050
So it's talking directly to the calendar server.

00:17:00.049 --> 00:17:07.500
You can embed it in any web page with just a couple of tags,
so you can add it to your own Internet site if you want to.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.779
And that also means that since it's
talking directly to the calendar server

00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:20.500
in a standards-based way then you can subscribe with only to
this calendar from any calendar client and you can sink it

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:26.289
with any CalDAV client and that includes iCal
and it also means that any changes that you make

00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:31.740
on your web calendar will also show up an iCal on the phone.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.000
So that's Web Calendar.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.599
And next stop, I like to move into Server-side Quick Look
and this is always such a fun thing to demo to you guys

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:46.399
that I'm basically just going to hand the stage
back over to our engineer Andrew who's going

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.250
to give you a look at Server-side Quick Look.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.980
So, Andrew?

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:58.319
[ Applause ]

00:17:58.319 --> 00:17:59.750
>> Thanks John.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.110
So I am really excited to be showing you Quick Look today.

00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:06.389
This is something we have worked
really hard on in Snow Leopard.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:11.009
In Leopard, we made it really easy to attach
documents to wiki pages and blog posts.

00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:14.940
And this is one of the things that we're
continually getting feedback on that our users love.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.799
So let's take a look at how we've improved
that even more with Quick Look in Snow Leopard.

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:24.750
So I'm going to start on My Page here which
is our great way to see updates on our server.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.400
And on the right, I'm going to click on Star Pages where I
flag some wiki pages I'm going to be using in my demo today.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.450
And I'm going to switch over to all here.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:39.200
So the first page I want to show you is something that
our marketing team has been using to explore ideas

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.269
around our new revolutionary Twunk
brand which is a White Elephant, right.

00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:49.240
So I'm going to click on Elephant research here and I
can see that we're already off to a pretty great start.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.380
We've got Babar on there which is a good one.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.830
So I've been working on the pages
documents through the week.

00:18:54.829 --> 00:19:00.069
So my entire time at WWDC had been pretty
busy and I'm going to add that to this page.

00:19:00.069 --> 00:19:02.549
So in the Toolbar, I'm going to
click on the Pencil icon right here.

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:10.250
And I'm going to get rid of this
text that someone has left me.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.519
And back on the Toolbar, I'm going to click on the
Paperclip icon which is going to let me attach a file.

00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:24.720
And click on Choose and grab that pages
where I've been working on and click Attach.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.930
And you can see that this is a really great
way to share files with your team members.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:34.500
But the problem is you've got to
know all these awesome new problems.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.160
Because it's so easy to attach files to
wiki pages, you end up with a lot of them.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.940
So more often than enough, you get more than one attachment
on a page and it's often hard to know which one you need.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.930
And so what happens is you end up
downloading these sometimes large documents

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.279
over sometimes slow internet connections.

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:54.730
You get them to your desktop and you realize, "Oh,
hey I don't have the right software to open this."

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.069
So when we looked at this, we realized that we'd already
solved this in Leopard on the desktop with Quick Look.

00:19:59.069 --> 00:20:01.859
So what we've done in Snow Leopard is
brought that right over to the Wiki Server.

00:20:01.859 --> 00:20:08.009
So whenever we attach a file, and we click See, the Wiki
Server is automatically rendering a web compatible version

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:11.319
of that file that can be viewed in any
standards-compliant browser on any platform.

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:14.009
So let's take a look at that.

00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:17.759
[ Applause ]

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:24.829
>> So because this is a multipage
document, we get thumbnails down the left

00:20:24.829 --> 00:20:27.679
through which I can scroll through like this.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:33.539
And then in my server I see the page number, and I
really get indication on where I am in the document.

00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:38.990
And as I click in these thumbnails, you
see the preview changes in the main panel.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.870
This is pretty cool.

00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:45.349
So as Skip and John have both mentioned, we're a new
twitter start off and as such we're pretty struck for cash.

00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:52.949
So I'm going to go back to My Page where I've flagged a
funding presentation, wiki page that we've been working on.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.600
So we're working on this PowerPoint
presentation to show potential investors

00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:58.240
and trying to get some cash together, right.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.089
So let's go ahead and preview that
PowerPoint file in the web.

00:21:04.089 --> 00:21:09.230
So, just like before, we can flip
through the pages of the presentation.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.900
If this presentation had presenter's notes or
notes or annotations, they will show up right here.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:21.330
So, one thing I haven't shown you about Quick Look
is that I can resize its window up, and back down.

00:21:21.329 --> 00:21:25.029
[ Applause ]

00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:27.500
>> And you notice that the preview stays
beautifully centered right in the web browser.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.480
And as in my server, the main area,
we got some options here.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.920
So the middle one is I can download this attachment so
I've Quick Look it and I know this is the one I want,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.200
so I can download it right to my
laptop or my desktop or wherever I am.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.910
But on the left here, we have this Fit to
Screen button which lets me go full screen

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:48.600
and I can see our previews in all
their glory and pan around.

00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:57.109
This is really great.

00:21:57.109 --> 00:22:00.869
So from looking at this page, there's something funny here.

00:22:00.869 --> 00:22:03.229
I think I'm missing an attachment.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:09.620
So the good thing about Quick Look is that we've
built that into the document revisions on wiki page.

00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:14.719
So if you're not familiar with the Leopard Wiki Server,
we've a really great way of seeing changes to a page

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:21.100
by viewing its document history and as each person
has made a change, you see a summary of their change.

00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:27.769
And it looks like John made a really helpful edit to
this page and deleted the file I need at my demo today.

00:22:27.769 --> 00:22:29.369
So luckily, Quick Look is to the rescue.

00:22:29.369 --> 00:22:33.059
I'm going to go back and look at this
revision and I can Quick Look this attachment.

00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:37.000
Yeah, this is the numbers presentation that we
were-- or the numbers that we were looking at.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.009
I'm going to click Restore, click OK and
that attachments now back in the page.

00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:45.970
[ Applause ]

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.470
>> So the last thing that I want to show you about
Quick Look is support for your custom file types.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.350
This is something we've worked really hard
on Snow Leopard to make sure that it's going

00:22:53.349 --> 00:22:56.519
to work with your custom applications as well.

00:22:56.519 --> 00:23:00.759
There's one thing that I should mention here that this
requires that the Quick Look generator be installed

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:03.519
on the server but there are no dependencies on the clients.

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:06.220
So any client from any web browser can
view the files as long as Quick Look--

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.329
the Quick Look generator is installed on
the server for that particular file type.

00:23:09.329 --> 00:23:15.549
So I just got an email this morning and
it has our latest application walkthrough.

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:21.579
So I'm going to type in iPhone
walkthrough, create a new page here.

00:23:21.579 --> 00:23:28.750
And it just so happens that we're using a really great
application called OmniGraffle to do our walkthrough.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:34.450
And I'm going to choose that Graffle
file right here and click Attach.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.630
And you notice a few things.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.930
So Safari for-- in Snow Leopard is automatically
recognizing that the OmniGraffle file is a bundle.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.720
So in plain language that means that it's a folder.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.940
So what we're doing here is on the wire, we're zipping the
file and transferring it and as the Wiki Server receives

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.820
that zipped file, we're inspecting the zip file and
recognizing that there is a Quick Look of a document inside.

00:23:53.819 --> 00:23:56.659
So like before, I can Quick Look this document.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.380
This is an OmniGraffle file, and remember
[applause] that client has no [applause]--

00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:05.879
the client does not have OmniGraffle installed here.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.510
So like before, I can resize the window and I can pan.

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:15.049
So we can actually step through the
stages of our iPhone application.

00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:16.720
This is really great.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.049
So I hope you'll agree that our Quick Look
is an awesome feature in Wiki Server 2

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:23.519
and lets you preview documents on Wiki pages and blog posts.

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:28.569
So these are the-- this has been a real productivity
boost that Apple on our internal Wiki Server particularly

00:24:28.569 --> 00:24:31.970
when a lot of us are around on campus during the
day and we don't have access to our desktop machines

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.019
and maybe on laptops that don't have the right software.

00:24:34.019 --> 00:24:38.009
So with that I'd like to pass this back to John.

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:43.680
[ Applause ]

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.720
>> There are few additional features
that I'd like to go over.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.000
We're not actually going to demo them
today but they're important enough

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.950
that I figured that we should talk about them.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:57.029
All of these things again are standalone services
so they will run independently of the Wiki Server.

00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:00.829
But the cool thing is all of these are
available inside at My Page integrated

00:25:00.829 --> 00:25:06.159
with everything else if the Wiki Server is running.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.610
The first one that I think everybody is going to be really
happy about is web-based password change [applause].

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:20.470
This does require, in order to turn this on, you do need
to have SSL enabled on your web server for obvious reasons.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:26.769
But, it means that you can actually direct your
users now to a website to change their password.

00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:29.879
And this works with any Open Directory system.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:35.630
So depending on your setup, you can actually use the
web-based password change integrated with the Wiki Server

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.060
to even change your active directory
passwords, so that's pretty cool.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:47.789
[Applause] Next up, I'd like to
talk about server side email rules.

00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:51.549
We actually did some work with
the mail server to set this up.

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:56.399
And again, this is integrated in the
Wiki Server if you have it enabled.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:02.009
This means that you can filter all of your email before
it arrives in your inbox, and this is a great boon

00:26:02.009 --> 00:26:08.039
to iPhone users who want to-- who don't want to open up
their inbox and see a bunch of mailing list stuff show up.

00:26:08.039 --> 00:26:14.359
Hand in hand with that of course,
we also offer vacation notices.

00:26:14.359 --> 00:26:18.179
And so this means that you can set a
timed email rule to automatically apply--

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:23.180
to automatically reply to every message that
comes in during the time period when you're away.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:30.380
And so that's some of the additional features we've added
that we've integrated into the Wiki Server if it's running.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:35.310
Next I'd like to talk about some of the new
tools that we have for theme developers.

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:40.879
And now of course in Leopard, you could do a lot
to extend your Wiki and customize it using themes.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:47.670
So you can add your own functionality, you can add your
own CSS, but we've added a lot of new stuff in Snow Leopard

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.380
that we're actually pretty excited about.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:56.720
I would suggest that anybody that wants to brush up on
creating themes for the Wiki Server were actually going

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.809
to have some documentation reference
at the end of this session.

00:27:00.809 --> 00:27:08.359
However, right now, I'd like to just kind of recap by going
over what makes up at any page sent out by the Wiki Server.

00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:11.429
So the first thing that we send out is the Theme CSS.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.190
This is your CSS and it defines the look
and feel and the visual presentation

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.250
of the Wiki Server when your theme is selected.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.359
The next thing we send out is the required System CSS.

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:28.669
We send this out last because it generally defines the
overall layout of the page as well as the look and feel

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:33.150
and icons for all of the toolbars
and functionality that we add.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.190
We next send out the System JavaScript.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:41.000
This basically creates all the functionality
you've seen here for Quick Look and editing pages,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.480
all of that client-side functionality
sent out at this point.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.200
And next, we send out the Theme
JavaScript, and this is your JavaScript.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.180
And this is primarily what we're
going to be getting into today.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:57.180
But this is where you can actually add
your own functionality to supplant our own.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:04.150
So the first thing that we've added-- that we've used really
heavily internally and decided to go ahead and document

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.280
for you guys here is the concept of shared instances.

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:14.000
Now, this is something that we'd borrowed from Cocoa,
there's a lot of things in Cocoa that have shared instances

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.259
and we did this by extending the class functionality that's
present in the really great prototype JavaScript library.

00:28:22.259 --> 00:28:27.559
So in JavaScript, you would generally create
a JavaScript class by using Class.create.

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:34.299
We added some thing called Class.create.WithSharedInstance
and this is basically going to create a global

00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:39.480
that you can refer to an instance of your
class by and it will create it on demand.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:45.700
So this is a great way to make your pages continue
to perform well but add your own functionality to it.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.559
And if I should go through this
example code, you can see here,

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:52.079
I've created my class using Class.create.WithSharedInstance.

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:57.309
And the first argument I'm passing to this
function is the name of the shared instance.

00:28:57.309 --> 00:29:00.970
So this is the name by which I'm going
to refer to this instance of this class

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.940
and it will get created automatically
whenever it needs to be.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:10.470
However, the second argument I'm sending which is a
Boolean, that's optional, if you passed through here,

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.240
then your class will get automatically
instantiated when the document is loaded.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.880
And this is actually even faster than
attaching something to the window loading.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.900
This is going to happen as soon as the document object
is available, so that means that there's no delay

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:29.450
when adding your own functionality to page like there would
be if you attach something to the window's unload handler.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:34.590
And then of course, you define the prototype
with an initialized method as is dictated

00:29:34.589 --> 00:29:38.779
by the structure of the prototype library.

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:43.660
So that showed instances and that's a great way to add
your functionality without having to hook into some

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.420
of the methods that we have or hack
into some of the methods we have.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:52.470
You can just add your own functionality in the themes
and have it automatically pull out when any page loads.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:57.390
When you're doing this of course, one of the things that
we've found we needed to do and we've figured you would

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:01.100
as well is to start listening for events
that happened on the Wiki's content.

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:08.389
And this is how you can actually add your own functionality
to these pages and do it much easier than you could before.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.420
If any of you are really familiar
with Cocoa, this is basically--

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.539
we kind of stole this from the
idea of the NSNotificationCenter.

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:18.349
>> You have these messages that get sent out.

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:20.179
You can publish your own messages.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.370
You can subscribe to them and you can subscribe
to some that are sent out by the Wiki Server.

00:30:24.369 --> 00:30:32.329
And you can see in this sort of poorly drawn cloud
here that there's a ton of these messages that we send

00:30:32.329 --> 00:30:40.259
out when people Quick Look documents, attach things,
change content, start and finish editing, tag, everything.

00:30:40.259 --> 00:30:46.230
So to show you an example of how you would set up
and how you would listen for these notifications.,

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:52.000
you could see here I've created a class
again with Class.createWithSharedInstance.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.430
I have an initialized method here that tells
the publisher shared instance that I would

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.100
like to subscribe to a message using publisher.subscribe.

00:31:02.099 --> 00:31:08.250
The first argument I pass to this is the call back
I want to be ran when that message gets thrown.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:17.829
And then of course the message that I want to listen for,
and then you could see below that I've defined my call back.

00:31:17.829 --> 00:31:18.859
This is really cool.

00:31:18.859 --> 00:31:24.179
I think that, you know, it takes a little bit, maybe
to wrap your head around it but I think to that end,

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:30.240
we have a great demo that's going to show you what's
possible with some of the notification API in Snow Leopard.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.109
So Andrew, I would like to bring you up to show that to us.

00:31:34.109 --> 00:31:38.439
>> So we spent some time last week writing
a little showcase of this new notification

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.900
on Class.createWithSharedInstance
technology on Snow Leopard.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:47.120
And what we've come up with is a way of providing
syntax highlighting for code snippets in a wiki page.

00:31:47.119 --> 00:31:52.419
This is all done as part of a custom theme and I've
created a new wiki already called Developer Demo

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.740
and to this I've applied the custom theme.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:03.970
So, I'm going to go ahead here and create a
new page and let's call that Code Snippet.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.610
I'll click Create.

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:09.629
And those of you familiar with the Leopard Wiki
Server might notice that we have a new button here

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.610
in the toolbar and as I mouse over that.

00:32:12.609 --> 00:32:16.019
It's going to tell me that I can intact--
insert some syntax-highlighted code.

00:32:16.019 --> 00:32:22.000
So when I click on that, we get this neat little dialog
that lets me either paste or type in that Code Snippet

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.180
and I've got one prepaste on here, not that one.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:35.100
I'm just going to paste that in--
sorry, excuse me, give me a second.

00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:39.339
And choose the language, and this is Python since
this is calculating the Fibonacci sequence of numbers.

00:32:39.339 --> 00:32:42.529
[Applause] And click OK.

00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:45.009
And you see that that code is inserted in the page.

00:32:45.009 --> 00:32:49.240
So using the new notifications, we're going
to listen for when this page is getting saved.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.519
And when it is, we're going to transform
this code and make it really pretty.

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:56.009
So I'm going to click Save here and there we go.

00:32:56.009 --> 00:33:00.629
[ Applause ]

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:04.710
>> So let's take a look at how you can achieve
something fairly similar on your themes.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.720
Just a disclaimer here first, I'm not going
to cover the structure of a Wiki theme.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.370
If you're interested in that, you can download last year's
Extending Your Wiki Server Session which should be available

00:33:13.369 --> 00:33:18.229
on iTunes or look at the documentation that we're
going to reference at the end of this session.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.519
Also for the syntax highlighting,
were using a third party library.

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:26.650
But you could pretty much substitute any library
or write your own if you're feeling adventurous.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.070
So with that said, let's look at this code.

00:33:30.069 --> 00:33:34.629
So the WWDC JavaScript file is our
main JavaScript file in our theme.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:40.350
And like what we've been talking about, I'm creating this
new code snippet controller share instance on the page.

00:33:40.349 --> 00:33:43.829
So this is going to be available
globally as code snippet controller.

00:33:43.829 --> 00:33:46.740
And because I'm passing through here
as a second argument that they're going

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.630
to structure, this gets created on page load.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:54.550
So just like other prototype-extended classes, the
first thing that's get called here is initialize.

00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:57.509
So whenever we initialize this new
object, this function gets called.

00:33:57.509 --> 00:34:02.440
And my first step is to check that we're on a
page that has some sort of editable content.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:08.039
And I'm doing that by using prototype mutation to
look for something that has an ID of editable content.

00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:13.539
And that is this ID that we applied for our Wiki
Editor which is on both Wiki Pages and blog post.

00:34:13.539 --> 00:34:17.529
And if we don't find that, I'm returning this
new keyword in Snow Leopard called invalidate.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.900
So invalidate is-- it's something that's
going to destroy the shared instance

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.420
in a case that you may not want it anymore.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.539
And in this case, if I'm not on the page that's editable,
so I'm not on the page on which I can insert code,

00:34:28.539 --> 00:34:30.590
then I don't want to have this
shared instance hanging around.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:34.420
And this invalidate keyword is
going to clean that up for you.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.099
So the next 2 lines are something I'm going to skip over.

00:34:37.099 --> 00:34:41.019
The first one is for adding the custom
toolbar button and the second one is

00:34:41.019 --> 00:34:45.019
for initializing the code snippet dialog in the background.

00:34:45.019 --> 00:34:50.900
So this is using some DOM manipulation, the builder
library, script.aculo.us library, the prototype library.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.680
If you're interested in that, you
can download the source code

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:56.460
from our session website and look at that in more detail.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:01.920
But the interesting part of the
initialize method is the last 2 lines here.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.079
So here we're asking this publisher shared
instance to watch for whenever we go both into

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:08.809
and out of an idle edit mode on the page.

00:35:08.809 --> 00:35:15.480
And we're doing that by calling publisher.subscribe
and we're listening for both DID_START_EDITING

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.329
and DID_FINISH notifications, DID_FINISH_EDITING
notifications.

00:35:19.329 --> 00:35:25.559
And when we get those call backs, we're calling
REMOVE_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING and ADD_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING.

00:35:25.559 --> 00:35:32.739
So I'm going to scroll past the next few methods which
like I said before are just repeating some UI magic

00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:36.369
in the background and scroll right down
to this ADD_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING function.

00:35:36.369 --> 00:35:40.889
So what's actually happening behind the
curtain whenever we insert code into the pages,

00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:42.359
is we're just adding a pretag to the markup.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.930
It's really simple.

00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:45.899
And when we come back out of editing mode,

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.930
we get the DID_FINISH_EDITING notification
and this function gets called.

00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:54.379
So the first step is to use the prototype $$
notation to find all the pretags on the page.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.690
And after we've got those we use a little closure
here and then we're calling our third party library

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:04.530
to make those pretty so to add colors, to
add line numbers, to add formatting depending

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.120
on the lines that we've chosen to pop up.

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:13.880
And on the flip side of that, when we go back into Edit
Mode, we want to strip by to all that extra formatting rate,

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.440
so we're pretty much doing the opposite
of what ADD_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING does.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:21.800
So this is a really simple example of what you
can achieve with the new notification stuff

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.380
and the Class.createwithSharedInstances in Snow Leopard,
I would really encourage you to check the stuff either

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.039
if you're a theme developer, I think
you'd like getting involved in this.

00:36:29.039 --> 00:36:30.969
It's helped us a lot in Snow Leopard.

00:36:30.969 --> 00:36:34.230
I would also encourage you to download,
adopt, and extend this sample code.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.539
It's fairly simple and it's fairly well commented,
so you should be able to follow it pretty easily.

00:36:38.539 --> 00:36:42.170
So with that, I guess I can't wait to see your
custom themes and I like to pass it back to John.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.220
[ Applause ]

00:36:43.219 --> 00:36:49.219
>> Thanks Andrew.

00:36:49.219 --> 00:36:53.859
So you've seen today how it's really
easy to create new wikis via the web.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:37:00.599
We provided a way to search across all wikis and see
information for wikis you care about really easily.

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:04.610
We've shown you how you can view
all of your documents without having

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:06.730
to download them using server-side Quick Look.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:12.719
We've talked about some of the stuff on how wikis
are created without groups and we've shown you some

00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:19.489
of the things you can do as a theme developer
to extend the wiki in more ways than ever.

00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:25.559
I would suggest if you're going to start with writing a
theme that you consult our award-winning documentation

00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:28.920
and extending your Wiki Server is a great place to start.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.619
This is against Leopard but the basic
theme API has not changed for Snow Leopard

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:37.179
with the exception of things we went through today.

00:37:37.179 --> 00:37:41.429
I would also suggest if you're going to write
some of the things like Andrew showed you today,

00:37:41.429 --> 00:37:47.909
that you look at a couple of the libraries that we based
the Wiki Server on, primarily being a prototype of course

00:37:47.909 --> 00:37:53.279
and script.aculo.us as well which is what we
use to build a lot of our UI onto the screen.
