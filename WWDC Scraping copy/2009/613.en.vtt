00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.169
>> Thanks.

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.699
[ Applause ]

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:17.769
My name is Kjell Bronder.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.269
I'm an engineer on the Podcast Producer team.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.019
And I'm going to be presenting today
with my colleague Eric Circlaeys.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.859
And we're here to really take a look at all of the great new
features that we have in Podcast Producer in Snow Leopard.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.159
To start off though we're going to recap and
look at why podcasting is such a powerful tool.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:43.209
But also address some of the challenges that come
with creating a lot of content and being able to scale

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.920
and produce a lot of content on a very regular basis.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:55.250
And the whole goal here is to show you how Podcast Producer
not only allows you to create really rich and cool content,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.240
but also allows you to scale and publish
tens or hundreds of Podcasts every week.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.070
And all of this is just really to set the stage so we can
show you all of the great new features that we have for you.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.889
And I'm sure that's why most of you are actually here today.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.579
So let's get started.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.590
So podcasting, how many of you here
consume Podcasts on a regular basis?

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.780
OK, that's a lot of people and that
makes my job easier because I don't have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.930
to explain to you what podcasting really is.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.920
But there is something I want to spend a few minutes talking
about and that's why podcasting is such a powerful tool.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.460
And I think these three words really recap it really well.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.000
It's whatever, wherever, whenever.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Whatever, there are so many topics
covered by Podcasts out there.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.760
If there's a topic that you are interested in,
I'm sure you can find a Podcast that covers it.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.359
Just look at the Podcast directory
on the iTunes store or on iTunes U.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.140
The wealth of information there is unbelievable.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.700
And wherever, this comes to the mobility of podcasting.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.320
It's got mobility built right into its name.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.639
I can take my Podcaster wherever I want.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.879
I listen to my MRP Podcast on my way to work and
I watch my Ted Talks on the treadmill at the gym.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.969
But wherever is not just bringing my content wherever
I want to go, it's getting from all around the world.

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.930
My Podcasts come from all over the US,
from Canada, from France, from England.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.520
And I don't even know where half of
my Podcasts actually even come from.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.310
And whenever, this is the whole idea of time shifting.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.870
I get to choose when I want to listen
to the content I'm interested in.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.810
And this is really the WWW of media.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:43.659
So how many of you are involved in way or
another in actually producing podcasts today?

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.819
Cool, so that's quite a few of you.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.549
So I'm sure you're already aware that there's a whole
wealth of tools out there to create really good content.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.060
And Apple ships some of the best and easiest
tools to create all these videos or audio content.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.699
But the challenge comes when you want to create a lot of
content and you have to do this on a very regular basis.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:11.989
This creating the content then becomes
a very labor-intensive process.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.570
And it requires a lot of resources.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.829
Also, in certain organizations, you probably have
certain individuals who are experts in their field

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.070
and you want to distribute their knowledge.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:33.280
These experts might not be experts in video editing or
might just not have the time to spend to create the content.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.000
So one of your challenges is to make it as easy as possible
for them to capture the content they want to deliver.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:47.030
But it's not just creating the content,
you also have to publish this content.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.310
And there are tons of different ways of
getting your content out into the world.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.390
And there seems to be every other
week that there's a new web technology

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.849
that appears for getting your content out there.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.180
And the same thing with creating your content.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.960
This can be a very labor intensive and manual process.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.040
So we really need a way if you're
going to be creating a lot of podcasts

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:13.549
on a very regular basis, a way of automating this.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.270
And that's for the customers who are creating
the content, but what about your audience?

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.009
Well your audience already has their ways.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.110
They already consume their content and are
used to consuming it in a particular way.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.139
So to make your podcasts as popular as possible,
you really want to make it as easy as possible

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.719
for your audience to consume that content.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.700
And really just fit into or onto the
devices that they're used to using.

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.750
And that's where Podcast Producer comes into play.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.589
Podcast Producer makes it really, really easy to
capture your content that you want to produce.

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:54.989
But it also automates all of these manual tasks and
labor-intensive tasks that we've been talking about.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.160
And the goal here is that first for
the person who's creating the content

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.500
and they're capturing their content, it's just a few clicks.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.519
But also for you the administrators,
everything is automated.

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:12.810
So once you set up the system, all you get to do is just
watch the blinking lights on the beautiful excerpts.

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.729
So let's take a look at Podcast Producer.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.500
Podcast Producer is a full end-to-end solution.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.730
It provides a real easy way of capturing content.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.160
It can be video, it can be a screen
capture, come from other applications.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.290
This content is then automated, is processed
in an automated fashion on your servers.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.490
Once the content has been processed,
we deliver it to your audience.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.810
But another key point of Podcast
Producer is a fully scalable solution.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.819
So you can scale Podcast Producer to publish
tens or hundreds of podcasts every week.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:01.430
But I'm going to bring up Eric on stage real quick and he's
going to show you how easy we've made it for the end users

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.660
to capture the content and how easy
it is for your audience to consume it.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.360
So Eric.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.939
>> Thank you Kjell.

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:14.899
We have a lot of things to demonstrate to you this week.

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:21.449
And as a first demonstration, I would like to show you
how easy it is to create a podcast with Podcast Producer.

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.920
And for that I'm going to recall a short video that Podcast
Capture, which is the front side of the Podcast Producer.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.009
Let's move to the demo machine.

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.389
[ Background noise ]

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.209
OK? So this is Podcast Capture.

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:42.839
I'm going to use one of the podcasting
types we provide by default.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:46.659
A very simple one, the single video source to begin.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:52.820
And I'm going to use the iSight video, oh look at my hair.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.920
OK, so Kjell you should have told me that.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:06.140
That is a very short video to demonstrate how easy it is.

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:06.349
[ Background noise ]

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.770
Welcome to Apple World Wide Developer Conference 2009.

00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:15.269
My name is Eric Circlaeys and this is my very first podcast
made on a Mac with Podcast Producer on Snow Leopard.

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:21.279
I've just clicked the stop button, I'm
done, I have nothing to record anymore.

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:25.419
Let's publish this to the system.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.890
And let's put an official title for this.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:36.610
And a description, let's say belated format.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.819
Then I press submit.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:45.169
Once I press submit, there is no next step.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.850
I am done.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:52.760
Podcast Producer takes care of about
everything else for me automatically.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:57.269
And the content is going to be ready
really quickly, in a few seconds.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:06.699
Thing is, thanks to Atom and RSS, we're going to be
notified automatically when the content gets ready,

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:13.750
which means any user that subscribe to my feeds are
going to receive that notification in Safari or iTunes

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.720
and then will be able to consume that right away.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:25.930
To come back to the invisible bridge that Kjell
addressed earlier, both the user that shares the content,

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:33.169
that shares the knowledge and the user that consumes
it both have nothing to deal with in between.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.610
Podcast Producer does the rest
automatically for them magically.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.340
That's the whole point about Podcast Producer.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:47.230
To bring the technology to the user
seamlessly and to make podcasting very easy.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:55.440
OK, let's imagine you're an expert on a specific domain
and you are delivering a lot of lectures every week.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.740
Well, you don't have the time to think
about what remarking your content,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.440
you don't really want to know how
to add an introduction movie.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.890
You don't want to care about all these different formats you
have to generate for all those different devices out there.

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:13.399
And you don't have to care about all these destinations.

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:18.980
Your role is to actually deliver
the content, deliver the knowledge.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.690
And Podcast Producer made that super easy.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:29.110
So notice I have just received an iChat which tells me as
submitter that the contents, that the content is available.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.379
And let me show you this content through iTunes.

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:36.210
And I will dig into this later in the presentation.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.500
So, let's click here.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.010
And let's watch the result.

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:46.279
[ Period of silence ]

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.549
[ Music ]

00:09:49.549 --> 00:09:55.759
The content has been branded automatically for me
with a nice introduction video, my company video.

00:09:55.759 --> 00:10:02.639
Then we generate an introduce, we generated a titling
automatically with metadata submitted with Podcast Capture.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:06.120
And finally, the content itself with a watermark.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.850
And at the end, the exit video was added.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.019
Thank you very much, back to Kjell.

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:17.079
[ Applause ]

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.759
>> OK. Eric, you put me back on slide.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:21.939
>> Sure.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.040
>> Slides.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.549
Thank you.

00:10:25.549 --> 00:10:27.769
So you've seen how easy it is.

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:30.379
So Podcast Producer is three main pieces.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:35.769
It's a real solution that makes it really easy
to capture, process and deliver your content.

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:41.100
And we're going to dive into these three pieces
and really look what's happening underneath here.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.950
The first piece is the capture piece.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:49.879
We have a great application called Podcast Capture which
ships on all Mac OS X clients in your utilities folder.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:53.460
Makes it really easy to capture video and audio recordings.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.580
So you can use like what Eric just
did, your built in iSight.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.410
But we also have support for remote camera.

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:06.419
So your typical use case for example is a DV camera
hooked up to a Mac mini at the back of a lecture hall.

00:11:07.539 --> 00:11:12.980
So what, basically what would happen in that case is
let's say your professor would walk into the lecture hall,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.060
walk up to the lectern machine, choose
the room they're in and just press start.

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:23.859
The camera at the back of the room that's been set
up by your AV staff will just automatically start.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.879
When they're done giving the lecture, all the professor
has to do is press stop and the content will be submitted

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:33.500
and published to the Podcast Producer
server who will take care of the rest.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.389
But Podcast Capture also lets you do screen capture.

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:40.319
So you can capture the screen if you're doing
a presentation for example with Keynote.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.690
This is really powerful.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:49.030
But maybe you are really proficient with all of the
capture tools that we talked about earlier or the content

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:52.009
or the video production tools that we talked about.

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:56.590
But you just don't want to worry about encoding your
video to all these different formats and publishing it

00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.000
out via all these different ways of publishing your content.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.759
Well Podcast Producer can take care of that last mile for
you as well using the file submission in Podcast Capture.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:12.019
You can just take your produced video and upload it
to Podcast Producer and let it take care of the rest.

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:18.019
But where this is really powerful is Podcast Capture
just sits on top of the command line tool, Podcast.

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:23.059
So you can just man Podcast today on your machines
and you'll see we have a whole suite of tools

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:26.269
that let you control cameras and submit content.

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:30.240
And what this does is it gives you the
possibility to create your own custom frontend

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.210
if you have a particular need in your organization.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.389
And if you were at yesterday's session for the server
state of the union, you saw this is what they've done

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:40.610
at New York University for example with a custom webpage.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.169
So that's for the capture piece.

00:12:44.169 --> 00:12:46.659
Let's talk about the processing.

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:49.579
Podcast Producer is a full server process.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.670
And it manages several resources
such as cameras and workflows.

00:12:53.669 --> 00:12:58.799
We're going to talk a bit more about workflows are,
but you can think of them as the podcasting recipe.

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:06.339
It works with other server technologies like
Xgrid and it enforces all of the access controls.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.990
And it's administered right in Server Admin.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:15.659
And we leverage a lot of the underlying services that
every, that you're used to seeing on Mac OS X server.

00:13:15.659 --> 00:13:21.879
Like Open Directory for Authentication, the web server
for distributing your content and other servers.

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:27.159
But one, one service that we really leverage a lot is Xgrid.

00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:29.610
Xgrid is Apple's grid technology.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.669
It's what allows us to process podcasts in parallel.

00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:38.620
So let's go back to our university use case.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.610
And let's say I've got 10 lecture
rooms that I want to capture from.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.450
And starting at 9:00 AM and they capture until 10:00 AM.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:50.610
Well at 10:00 AM, I've got 10 videos that are
being uploaded to my Podcast Producer server.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:57.909
By leveraging Xgrid, we can then process all of this
content in parallel if you have enough Xgrid agents.

00:13:57.909 --> 00:14:04.240
But let's say next semester, well you want
to move to 20 rooms to capture content.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.340
Well you can achieve the scalability very easily with Xgrid.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:15.610
By just adding some more Xgrid agents, your system is now
capable of processing the same amount of, the same amount,

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.310
all this extra content, sorry, in the same amount of time.

00:14:20.309 --> 00:14:23.209
And we also leverage Xsan, which is a growable file system.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:28.440
So once you start growing and producing more and
more podcasts, you can just grow your file system.

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:32.769
So I mentioned workflows.

00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:35.240
Workflows are the DNA of the Podcast Producer system.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.129
They're the recipe.

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:39.200
They tell the server what to do with the content.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.230
They define the processing that's going to happen to the
video and how you're going to publish all your content.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:49.970
But where this is really powerful is
underneath they're just Xgrid jobs.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.690
And Xgrid has the capacity of running
any command line tool or UNIX command.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:15:00.030
So if you can write a command line tool to do a
specific thing that you need your workflow to do,

00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:02.569
you can integrate it with your Podcast Producer workflow.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.600
And this means that Podcast Producer
workflows are fully customizable.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.460
But we didn't stop there.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:15.120
We created a full suite of command line tools
to make it really easy to do some of the tasks

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.210
that we expect a lot of you are going to want to do.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.240
And who better than Apple to write
the command line tools that are going

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.500
to leverage all the Apple technology
that's there already to do it?

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:31.350
So we have command line tools to do video editing,
encoding, publishing and all different kinds of tasks

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.720
that you're going to need in your workflows.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.730
And we leverage tons of different technologies.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:45.840
We go from leveraging Quartz Composer and QuickTime for
video editing to Kerberos to Xgrid, we even use Ruby.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.509
I mean you use a lot of different technologies.

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:52.720
And there's a wonderful talk at 10:30 on Friday
that's really going to go in and talk about all

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.009
of these technologies and show you how we use them.

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:57.509
So I encourage you to go see that.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:03.040
The final piece of Podcast Producer is the delivery.

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:08.939
We take care of publishing and notifying your
users when your content has been processed.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.530
And we also make it so it's very
easy for your audience to consume it.

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:16.559
And we make sure that it just fits and it works
on their iPhones, their iPods or their Apple TVs.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:20.989
And that they can access this content through
the applications that they're used to using.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.049
So that's Podcast Producer in a nutshell.

00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:31.000
It's a great solution for capturing,
processing and delivering your content.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.039
And it's already been a great success.

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:35.389
We started shipping in Leopard.

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:41.559
And it's been of course a great success in
higher education which is just this natural fit.

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:45.419
But we also have K to 12 customers
that are doing some really cool things.

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:51.379
Like we have students who submit content to Podcast
Producer and Podcast Producer creates feeds and podcasts

00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:56.059
for the parents so the parents can see what
their children have been doing at school.

00:16:56.059 --> 00:16:59.109
And of course in business there
are tons of different applications,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.879
like employee training is one that comes out right away.

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:06.480
But maybe you're in a company that has a
distribution channel all around the world.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.240
What better way than podcasting to inform
all your distributors about your new product?

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:19.159
And one point that I really want to drive
home is the scalability of the solution.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.529
You can start, you can set up Podcast Producer on
an all-in-one server and have a great solution.

00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:27.950
And once you start producing a lot
more podcasts, you can start growing.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.890
And you can grow all the way up to a full data center.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.440
Just for podcasting.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.890
OK, so now everybody is up to speed
on what Podcast Producer is.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.030
And this is where we're going to
have some fun and we're going to talk

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:45.490
about all the great new features we've got in store for you.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.700
And there are a lot of them.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.710
Right off the bat, I get to talk about
my favorite one, which is Dual Source.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.289
And this is kind of you know in Leopard it was great.

00:17:56.289 --> 00:18:02.579
You could, you could capture your screen capture, you
could capture your screen and you could do video recording.

00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:04.129
But we wanted to go even further.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.880
Why not have both and make it your
video even more appealing?

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:14.260
So in Snow Leopard we have Dual Source which
allows you to capture any two video sources.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:18.950
So these can be local cameras, these can be
remote cameras, these can be at your local screen.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.750
You can capture everything you want.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.380
And this is really ideal for lectures or
presentations because you can capture your Keynote

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.640
and have your talking head underneath and show up.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:37.040
And we've built some custom, we've built a lot of different
layouts for you that you'll be able to choose from.

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:39.180
And these are all based on Quartz Composer.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.269
So that means if you want to develop your
own Quartz Composer layout, you can do that.

00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:46.930
And so this is a great third party
integration point as well.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:51.400
So we had Dual Source working and it was great.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.580
But you know it just kind of sat there.

00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:56.319
And we wanted to do something a bit more.

00:18:56.319 --> 00:19:00.480
And we started looking at it, and we're like we've got all
this information, we've got the slides from the presentation

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.029
that we just recorded and we've got the head.

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:08.460
So what we decided to do is well, you know when you've
got the slides, that's really what you want to concentrate

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.400
until you've had time to read through them.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.200
And then you know seeing the talking head is great

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.470
because it you know provides branding
for the content and everything.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.549
So what we do is we do an image analysis.

00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:23.539
And we look at your primary input and we detect
when it's been stable for a certain amount of time

00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:29.649
and once your readers have had time to read through
the slides, we can then trigger a transition.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:35.080
So for example, we can push back the slides
and swing in the presenters head for example.

00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:39.730
Or maybe just have the presenter's
head appear or even just switch.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.110
And we have different ways of doing this.

00:19:41.109 --> 00:19:44.299
And since we're already doing this image analysis,

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:48.180
we can detect when the slides change,
so why not insert chapter markers.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.490
So we do that automatically for you.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.700
And this is all done completely automatically.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.350
So that means your presenter doesn't
have to worry about a thing.

00:19:56.349 --> 00:19:58.349
Everything gets done on the server.

00:19:58.349 --> 00:20:01.689
And this is what the UI looks like.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.440
Eric's going to demo this in a few minutes.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.390
I think we've really got a great Dual Source story for you.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.740
Podcast Composer.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:16.910
So I talked about workflows and I talked about how
powerful the Podcast Producer workflows were in Leopard.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.100
You could really customize them, you
could put in your own command line tools.

00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:24.569
If you wanted to do PDF color separation, you could do that.

00:20:24.569 --> 00:20:28.629
But with anything that's powerful,
there was some complexity behind it.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.340
And it was sometimes a bit of a challenge because you have
to deal with these bundle formats that incorporated XML

00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:38.019
and you basically had to break open
a text editor to customize them.

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:42.539
And we really want as many people out
there creating workflows as possible.

00:20:42.539 --> 00:20:46.809
So we've created this beautiful
application which is Podcast Composer

00:20:46.809 --> 00:20:51.250
which really makes it fun and intuitive
to create workflows with.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.809
And this Podcast Composer is a great
application and it lets you create workflows

00:20:55.809 --> 00:20:59.149
for three different types that we have in Snow Leopard.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.830
We have the single source workflows
which are like what we had in Leopard

00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:05.839
where you can capture either your
video or your screen capture.

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:13.299
It supports Dual Source and here's where you can set if
you want the automatic transitions or chaptering or not.

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:17.169
But we also have this other great feature which is Montage.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:22.509
Montage let's you submit an array of
documents to the Podcast Producer system,

00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:27.849
leveraging Quick Look technology it will create slide
show out of these documents and generate a movie.

00:21:27.849 --> 00:21:33.230
And I think we're going to see
some really cool uses of this.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:38.759
But we also wanted to make it really easy for
you to set up the video editing and branding of

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:42.700
and then make it easy for you to brand your own podcasts.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:48.380
And for every podcast that goes through your
workflow, it receives the same branding.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.040
And also with Podcast Composer you can deploy
your workflow straight from the application.

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:55.920
Workflow management is built right
into the application for you.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.560
And this makes it really easy to get
your workflows out onto your servers.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.089
And here's a screenshot.

00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:09.480
And Eric's also going to demo this in a few minutes.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.670
In Leopard, we took care of publishing the content for you.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.050
We knew how to publish to many different destinations.

00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:22.029
We could publish to the blog server, to iTunes
U, to tons of other different destinations.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.440
But we realized why not host the content?

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.900
We have all the metadata.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.940
We have all the main content.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.840
Why not host it for us?

00:22:30.839 --> 00:22:35.889
And why not create a content centralized
repository to host all this content?

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.250
So this is what we've done with a Podcast Library.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.339
You know have the possibility in Snow Leopard

00:22:41.339 --> 00:22:46.470
for the Podcast Producer system to
host your content and serve it up.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:52.319
And we're using industry standards that
are Atom and RSS to serve up your content.

00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:55.099
And we're not just serving up in any old boring way.

00:22:55.099 --> 00:22:58.349
We've created this notion of what we call Smart Feeds.

00:22:58.349 --> 00:23:03.099
And think of this as like Smart Folders that you're
used in the finder, just served up over the web.

00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:10.819
So you get to specify a query and all of the content that
replies to that query will then be served up in this feed.

00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:13.109
So let's say you want to create a user feed.

00:23:13.109 --> 00:23:18.549
So basically all the content that a user has
ever submitted will show up in that user's feed.

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:28.269
So all of your content will be, will show up in your
podcast library and we'll be serving it up via Atom and RSS.

00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:33.879
Another point that's really important here is this
simplifies integration with exterior services.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.230
We're publishing everything over Atom and RSS.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:43.480
So if your exterior service knows how to ingest
Atom or RSS, you can just pull the content straight

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:53.150
from the podcast library and you no longer have to write a
custom call to push out to your servers or to your service.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:59.340
Also one of the reasons we're using Atom and
we're really pushing Atom is it allows you

00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:02.009
to have multiple enclosures for an episode.

00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:08.849
So with RSS for example, if you're going to publish an
iPod video in audio only and then an Apple TV version,

00:24:08.849 --> 00:24:13.289
you have to maintain three different feeds for each podcast.

00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:16.029
Well, now with Atom you don't have to do that anymore.

00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:22.099
You can have one single feed that has every,
has all three enclosures inside of that episode.

00:24:22.099 --> 00:24:30.139
So I'm going to bring Eric back up on stage and
he's going to demo these three new features.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.509
>> Thank you Kjell.

00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:32.839
Now the fun begins.

00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:36.429
There is this nice cool feature in
Podcast Capture I really like as well

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.789
which is the Dual Source recording
and I like to demonstrate that to you.

00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:42.649
So let's move to the demo machine.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.890
I'm going to record myself delivering a
really quick Keynote presentation on Paris.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.440
And then we'll discuss about what's
happening behind right after.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.940
So, here's my Keynote presentation in Podcast Capture.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.299
So let me connect.

00:24:57.299 --> 00:25:05.109
And I'm going to use one other, one other
podcasting type, the Dual Source one.

00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:10.579
You have then two previews, one from
the screen and one from the iSight,

00:25:10.579 --> 00:25:13.419
could be also remote camera if
you have one concealed somewhere.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.120
And I'm going to run the recording.

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:21.089
And run the slides.

00:25:21.089 --> 00:25:23.889
Welcome to this year's issue of the essence of the monument.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:30.930
Today we're going to talk about one of the most
famous cathedrals in the world, Notre Dame de Paris.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:36.330
Notre Dame took over 200 years to be built.

00:25:36.329 --> 00:25:42.139
With its flying buttresses, gargoyles and roses
windows, Notre Dame is considered to be one

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.910
of the finest French gothic architecture monument.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.269
I hope you enjoy the session and see you next time.

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:54.250
So I've just stopped the recording using a short cut.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.000
The default one is actually Command F2.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.549
You can set up that in Podcast
Capture, that's really useful.

00:25:59.549 --> 00:26:02.440
And I'm going to publish that the same way as before.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:08.190
Oh in a minute here I do have access to the
workflow picker and my previous demonstration

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.880
since I had only one workflow for
the user that was connected.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.510
Actually all that was automatically set up for him.

00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:18.539
In that case, I have access to
multiple workflows so I do have

00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:24.269
to pick the current one associated
to the speech I've just run through.

00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:33.809
So let's put a nice title here then a good description.

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:38.859
And let's submit that to Podcast Producer.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:49.610
OK. While this is processing, I would like to talk
to you about the, what's happening behind the scenes.

00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:57.849
As Kjell explained, once you press submit Podcast Capture is
going to send all the metafiles and all the metadata files

00:26:57.849 --> 00:27:04.969
to Podcast Producer and Podcast Producer is going to
trigger the workflow associated to your information.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.740
Workflows are really the heart of Podcast Producer.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:14.470
This is what is going to drive all the
different actions on your metafiles.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:19.630
And I'd like to show you this workflow right
now, one new to you which is Podcast Composer.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:27.730
So Podcast Composer is there to provide in Podcast
Producer 2 to easily create and deploy workflows.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:32.870
It's, it really simplifies all your work with seven stages.

00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:38.419
These stages and this flow is really the,
is all the workflow you have to care about.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:45.310
It's the information, the import, edit,
export, then publish, notify and summary.

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:48.879
And we're going to dig into the details of each of these.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.560
So let's start with the information.

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:53.429
This page is really straightforward.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.680
This is where you're going to put all the information needed

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.820
to tell this workflow has a nice
title and has a description.

00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:07.359
These are going to show up in Podcast Capture for
example when the user needs to pick one workflow.

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:09.629
The next stage is really the first active stage.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.860
This is where you're going to define what
this workflow is going to be used for.

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:15.159
There are three possible choices.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.920
You could use this workflow for its single source recording.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.660
This is the old case scenario where
you could submit a screen capture

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:28.750
or a local video recording or even an audio recording.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.589
Then you have Dual Source.

00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:35.750
This importer is going to take the two sources
that you have generated with Podcast Capture,

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.450
the screen capture as well as talking head video.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.420
And this, this one is going to
generate for you a single video file,

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.259
a picture in picture video file
for the rest of the workflow.

00:28:46.259 --> 00:28:48.740
Then you have the Montage feature.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:56.789
The Montage importer is creating for you video out of all
the documents you may have submitted to Podcast Capture.

00:28:56.789 --> 00:29:03.589
So this could be PDF documents that could be
images, pages document, Keynotes presentation.

00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:08.649
And that leverages Quick Look technology
to extract images of all these documents.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:14.470
And then with Quartz Compositions we're
going to build a slideshow of this.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.750
Then it's time to brand your content.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:24.359
In that particular stage you will be able to set a
particular introduction movie, the one from your company

00:29:24.359 --> 00:29:28.899
to set the layout of your podcast title.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:35.550
Then maybe you like to set a watermark or another title for
the content you have submitted and finally the actual video.

00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:41.250
I don't want to go too much into detail since we're
going to bring, tell you more about this tomorrow

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:45.380
in the Podcast Composer session, but nevertheless
I'd like to show you how easy it is just by drag

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.670
and dropping content, how you can
brand very easily your workflow.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.279
So I have this nice introduction video here.

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:55.329
[ Music ]

00:29:55.329 --> 00:30:00.230
And if I want to set my workflow with
this introduction video, guess what.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:04.039
That's just as easy as drag and dropping this content here.

00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:07.599
Then for my watermark, this is exactly the same.

00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:13.289
I just drag and drop this content here and then
the content will be automatically watermarked.

00:30:13.289 --> 00:30:18.899
Maybe I like to go into the details of
that and put the watermark on the left.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.759
Change the size of the watermark and change the opacity.

00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:25.690
And when I'm done, I click done and that's it.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.789
I've branded my company.

00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:28.190
[ Applause ]

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:32.490
Thank you.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.710
[ Applause ]

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.860
Once you are OK about this look and feel,

00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:41.000
it's time to decide what are going to
be the formats you'd like to publish.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.690
Well, mostly formats are tightly
coupled with devices out there.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.470
So we provide valuable, easy encoding
settings for you for the iPod iPhone,

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:54.200
for Apple TV, for the audio only devices and cellular.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:00.470
But if you want to go deeper and actually tune and
create your own encoding settings for some reasons,

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:07.170
well if you have Compressor installed on this machine, then
Podcast Composer will be able to see it and will allow you

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.610
to pick one of the settings you've
already configured with Compressor.

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:17.490
Which give you almost no limit for inputting settings.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:24.079
So once you're OK with all these formats, it's time to
decide where you're going to publish all that content.

00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:31.069
By default, we are leveraging Podcast Library, which is
a new way of publishing of the content to a single point.

00:31:31.069 --> 00:31:35.419
And then distributing using standardized technology.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.060
But maybe you'd like to use different ways and
still publish your content directly to the Wiki

00:31:40.059 --> 00:31:45.099
or maybe archive the content using File Transfer Protocol.

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:49.549
Maybe you may have Final Cut Server installed
somewhere, you'd like to leverage that.

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:53.569
Or you'd like to archive it to some
other shelf file system you have.

00:31:53.569 --> 00:32:00.419
It's even possible to call another workflow and
maybe you wrote something very small by yourself

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:05.720
and you'd like to chain that with this workflow
you've just created with Podcast Composer.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:12.680
Then it's time to notify some people that the
content has been published and it's also maybe time

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:19.310
to notify some services that the content is available
and can be now synchronized with your service.

00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:24.289
That's the case with iTunes U or
maybe the iTunes podcast processor.

00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:32.039
And for the user, you could send an email, but kind
of really like this new one which is an iChat message.

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:35.440
And finally this is a summary of this workflow.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.910
Well, it's really a stretch forward.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:42.200
I'm doing a Dual Source, encoding to three different
formats, publishing my content to the library

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:49.180
and sending an iChat message to some people and
I just received one iChat message as you see.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.100
Then you can save this workflow
locally and work on that later.

00:32:53.099 --> 00:32:55.169
Or you can deploy it right away on the server.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:33:00.370
Now this is Podcast Producer and this is your workflow.

00:33:00.369 --> 00:33:02.279
Let me close this.

00:33:03.569 --> 00:33:10.159
Before showing you the result on iTunes like I did before,
I'd like to talk to you a bit more about the library.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:16.060
And for that I'm going to open the same field
as was previously when Kjell that opened

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:18.559
with Producer but using the Atom feed instead.

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.240
And that's going to show up in Safari.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.809
So this is the essence of the monument feed.

00:33:23.809 --> 00:33:25.710
And this is an Atom feed.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:32.720
And as you can see, the cool thing of that is we have
the ability now to put multiple attachments per episode.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:38.299
And in the case of the one I just recording, I
have the iPod iPhone version, the Apple TV version

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:42.230
and the audio version available
right away in this specific episode.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:47.730
And again all that is standardized technology
which means anyone that could actually read XML

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:54.400
and ingest XML could benefit from that and build some
nice UI right on top, on top of all that.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:01.140
The library is creating feeds and is
managing all the feeds for you automatically.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.780
At the top level of the library, you do have
plenty of feeds created for you automatically.

00:34:04.779 --> 00:34:09.210
There is, there are these feeds per
user that are submitting content.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:12.240
But we also have feeds per workflows.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:16.750
For instance I do have access to all
the content I have submitted so far.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.340
Same for Kjell for example.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.250
It's as easy as that.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.019
So let's move back to iTunes to look at the results.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.519
Let's refresh.

00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:31.530
[ Music ]

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.000
Same as before.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.920
[ Music ]

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.000
It's nicely branded.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.550
[ Period of silence ]

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.820
And then it, this is the Dual Source.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:52.059
As Kjell explained, we've introduced two additional feature.

00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:55.079
The first one is the automatic transition.

00:34:55.079 --> 00:35:00.199
So when we detect for a certain amount of time
that there is no more animation in the slides,

00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:03.069
then it's time to trigger a nice animation.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:06.380
So this is what's happening here automatically for you.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.500
The nice thing about that is well since we
are capable of detecting those animations,

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:16.579
well it's also possible to actually add different chapters.

00:35:16.579 --> 00:35:21.179
So then you can start at some point
in your presentation automatically.

00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:26.369
And again, all that has been done for you
by Podcast Producer as you may have seen

00:35:26.369 --> 00:35:29.599
in Podcast Capture, I just clicked record and stop.

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.980
No one is even here actually.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.320
So back to Kjell, thank you.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:39.450
[ Applause ]

00:35:39.449 --> 00:35:42.179
>> Thank you Eric.

00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:43.879
[ Period of silence ]

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.690
So we just talked about the Podcast Library, you just got

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:50.420
to see the Podcast Library in the
demo that Eric just showed you.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:56.789
And we've, we just also mentioned that it's a really
great solution for integrating with other services.

00:35:56.789 --> 00:36:01.619
So we've worked really hard and we've
worked really tightly with the iTunes U team

00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:05.719
to make the integration with iTunes U as simple as possible.

00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:08.009
And we now have this one click setup.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:12.480
So for those of you who are used to setting iTunes pages,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:20.070
now all you have to do when you create a course
page is point iTunes U at your podcast library feed

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.900
and it will automatically generate
the full course page for you.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:29.389
This means it's going to grab the title, the
description, even the logo image from the feed

00:36:29.389 --> 00:36:32.759
and all of the content that's ever
been published to that feed.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.200
And automatically populate your
new course feed, your course page.

00:36:36.199 --> 00:36:41.210
So you no longer have to go in and manually
upload all of the different content.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.760
[ Applause ]

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.540
And this also means that whenever new content
is going to land at your Podcast Library,

00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:53.820
we'll now notify iTunes U which
will pick it up automatically.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.380
I think this really is going to
make Podcast Library the easiest way

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.550
to host your content and getting your content to iTunes U.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.380
And as podcasting becomes even more and more popular and
it's almost becoming a service, a business critical service,

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.680
so in Snow Leopard we now have high availability.

00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:20.219
This means that both the Podcast Producer server
and the Xgrid controller have automatical fail over.

00:37:20.219 --> 00:37:27.359
So this means if someone trips over one of the power cables
in your server room, your end users will not even see it.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.160
It will be completely transparent to them.

00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:35.009
The whole solution will continue working because your
other Podcast Producer nodes will pick up the load.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.790
[ Period of silence ]

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:45.570
We also realize that a lot of you out there who
are creating podcasts have invested previously

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:51.050
into other Pro Video applications and maybe
even continue investing in these applications.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:56.630
But you want it to tie in and leverage these investments
which is capital but also you've had to learn these tools.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:01.450
So now in Snow Leopard, we've got really
great integration with these tools.

00:38:01.449 --> 00:38:08.509
As you already saw in Eric's demo, you can now
leverage Compressor straight from Podcast Composer.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.310
This means that you can leverage any of
their predefined custom encoding settings

00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:16.699
or you can even create your own with
Podcast, with Compressor, sorry.

00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:24.379
And for those who don't know, Qmaster is Compressor's
grid technology that allows you to do segmented encoding.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.690
So if you already have a Qmaster
grid that you want to leverage,

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.340
that's now possible with Podcast Producer in Snow Leopard.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:37.750
Podcast Producer knows how to talk to the Qmaster, submit
your content to Qmaster, let it encode your content

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:43.949
and then it'll come back to Podcast Producer
where it can finish processing and be published.

00:38:43.949 --> 00:38:49.460
We also now know how to publish to Final Cut Server
in case you're using that in your environment.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:56.750
And as you saw in Eric's demo, it's so easy
to add you know a custom Compressor setting.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:01.380
You just click plus, Compressor and there
you go, it's going to use Compressor.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.510
The web application.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:12.690
Now in Snow Leopard, we will be, we will be shipping and by
default you'll have a web application for Podcast Capture.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:17.639
[ Applause ]

00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:23.829
This means from all modern web browsers, you'll be able
to access Podcast Producer and submit content to it.

00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:29.380
This makes Podcast Producer completely accessible from
Mac OS X, from mobile devices, especially like the iPhone,

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:33.050
from Windows and any other platform
out there that is web savvy.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:36.340
And this is what it looks like.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.760
It looks right straight like the Podcast Capture.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.850
You can do video.

00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:45.889
And even the new features like Dual Source are
integrated straight into the web application.

00:39:47.949 --> 00:39:50.589
And now you've seen all of these cool features.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:56.240
And I'm sure all you want to do is run back to your hotel
and set up Podcast Producer and start playing with it.

00:39:56.239 --> 00:39:58.919
Well, even that we've made super easy.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:06.019
I don't know how many times per week I have to
set up a Podcast Producer system just to test.

00:40:06.019 --> 00:40:08.809
And you know I'll admit I might be a bit lazy.

00:40:08.809 --> 00:40:16.900
So now we've made it that just in four clicks and I have
to type my password twice, I'll set up Podcast Producer.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.630
And we'll set, they've got two different types of setup.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:25.619
We have the express setup which is the fore fix I've
just talked about that will set up an all-in-one system.

00:40:25.619 --> 00:40:28.699
There's also the standard setup
mode which makes it really easy

00:40:28.699 --> 00:40:31.939
to integrate Podcast Producer into
your existing environment.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.500
So if you already have particular
services like Open Directory or Xgrid

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.980
or already a shared file system, we can now leverage those.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:44.929
And this is once you've set it up,
you'll have a great launch page.

00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:50.000
It'll bring you straight to Podcast Capture or to the
library or jump you straight into Podcast Composer

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.630
so you can start creating your first workflow
and having fun with that application.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:41:00.460
So here I'm going to bring Eric back up on stage and he's
going to show you how easy it is to set up Podcast Producer.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.690
>> All you have seen so far are really
exciting new features in Podcast Producer.

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:12.710
There is one I like to share with you and that's
the how easy it is to set up a Podcast Producer 2.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:21.769
So let's move to a freshly installed machine and let's
do together an install of Podcast Producer all-in-one.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:30.380
OK. So I've just installed Snow Leopard
Server from the DVD you got yesterday.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.180
And in the server assistant the brand new Server assistant,

00:41:34.179 --> 00:41:39.239
I've just entered a private IP
address, click next, next, next, next.

00:41:39.239 --> 00:41:43.859
And at the end automatically it
configured for me the DNS server.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.190
The networking environment and here it is.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.150
So nothing more.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.400
And from there I'd like to set
up Podcast Producer all-in-one.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.190
So I've selected my service, my server.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.730
I'm going to go to the settings.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.980
In the services I'm going to say I'd like
to set up Podcast Producer on this machine.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:08.769
I'm going to click on that service
and in the offer view tab,

00:42:08.769 --> 00:42:12.199
there is the button here which
says configure Podcast Producer.

00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:14.379
This is the magic button.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:19.260
So you click on this one and here is
the Podcast Producer setup assistant.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.680
So from there we're going to count together
how many clicks I'm going to do, alright?

00:42:23.679 --> 00:42:29.730
So this is really straightforward,
this is just hello from the assistant.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:33.329
So one, thank you.

00:42:33.329 --> 00:42:35.940
Here well I'd like to do an express setup.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:41.019
That's what I want, so that's the setup I
recommend too, an all-in-one on one machine.

00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:45.730
So I'm going to click and that's going to be perfect.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:49.760
Here I need to set what is going to be the
administrator for all my podcasting environments.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.210
So let's say it's going to me.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:57.960
[ Period of silence ]

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.280
I enter a really complicated password.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.070
[ Period of silence ]

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:02.809
Three.

00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:04.190
[ Laughter ]

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:12.130
OK. And well I'm done, this is the summary of
what the setup assistant is going to do for us

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.829
and the last click is actually doing the work for us.

00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:20.849
So while it's actually doing all the stuff let's
discuss about what's happening in the background.

00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:24.869
So first it's going to set up an
Open Directory master for you.

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:29.409
Then it's going to create the associated
accounts needed for Podcast Producer.

00:43:29.409 --> 00:43:31.329
Then you're going to make an Xgrid controller.

00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:33.690
So it's going to set up an Xgrid controller for you.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.490
You also need an Xgrid agent to run the jobs and tasks.

00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:39.519
So we're going to set up the agent for you.

00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:45.659
Then the NFS because maybe you'd like to
expand this all-in-one to two or three servers.

00:43:45.659 --> 00:43:49.569
Once this is done, it's time to
set up Podcast Producer service.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:54.230
So, in that particular case, we need to install the library.

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:56.230
We need to configure the default feeds.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.809
We need to install the default workflows.

00:43:58.809 --> 00:44:03.190
And we need to make sure that Podcast
Producer uses Xgrid and uses Open Directory.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:08.039
And when all this is done, it's time to
start all the services in the right order

00:44:08.039 --> 00:44:11.119
and this is what's actually happening right now.

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:15.589
So I don't know if you remember how easy it
was if you want to set up a Podcast Producer.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.240
I'm pretty sure you'll like this interface.

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:26.429
So here it is.

00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:27.009
[ Applause ]

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.540
But I'd like to show you it's not fake.

00:44:30.539 --> 00:44:34.150
So I'd like to do a recording and
then show you all that is working

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.220
with all the different features we've talked previously.

00:44:37.219 --> 00:44:42.419
So for that I'm going to run a manual submission but instead
of using Podcast Capture on the deck that you all know,

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.869
I'd like to show you the web application.

00:44:45.869 --> 00:44:48.219
So let's connect to the web application.

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:50.339
[ Period of silence ]

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:57.400
Let's use my Eric credential and
boom I'm on the web application.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:03.180
This works on any modern web browser and
the cool thing is it looks totally similar

00:45:03.179 --> 00:45:05.129
to the experience you have on the next step.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:12.030
So you can do a single source recording, Dual Source
recording, audio recording, all that with remote cameras.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.560
And you can do manual file submission.

00:45:15.559 --> 00:45:16.920
We talked earlier about Montage.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.510
I'd like to address that now.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:23.280
I think it should be cool to do single source recording.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.780
It's cool to record those streams, cool
to record the iSight and do some stuff.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:32.110
It's even better when it comes to Dual Source
because you seen the demo of Dual Source

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:36.160
at the same time I'm recording the
stream and talking heads, it's nice.

00:45:36.159 --> 00:45:40.719
But I do have these slides, I do have these
documents, I do have all these images that I'd

00:45:40.719 --> 00:45:43.019
like to show you from my Origin site as well.

00:45:43.019 --> 00:45:46.329
And that's why we designed Montage for.

00:45:46.329 --> 00:45:49.500
So if you have some content you'd like to share,

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.969
it's time then to submit your content via the
file submission and select the Montage workflow.

00:45:54.969 --> 00:46:00.189
And the Montage workflow is going to create, to create
for you automatically a video out of all this content.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.440
Let me demonstrate that to you.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.099
I have a PDF document here.

00:46:04.099 --> 00:46:10.769
OK, that's a PDF about the essence of
the monument at Notre Dame de Paris.

00:46:10.769 --> 00:46:13.449
And I do have some images here.

00:46:13.449 --> 00:46:17.019
OK, so these are really nice images.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:24.620
So I like to create the movie out of all
these and be able to run that on my iPhone.

00:46:24.619 --> 00:46:30.679
So let's name that Notre Dame de Paris
with a one four, put that in this folder.

00:46:30.679 --> 00:46:35.879
So this is going to be all the documents I'd like to submit.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:39.900
Then let's create an archive of that.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.789
And let's submit that with the web interface.

00:46:42.789 --> 00:46:55.599
So first let's take the zip file, then enter a nice title,

00:46:58.119 --> 00:47:02.369
simple description for the sake
of the demo, oh I need a workflow.

00:47:02.369 --> 00:47:05.389
Let's use the Montage workflow for that.

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:07.250
And click publish.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:12.590
The file again is going to be submitted into the Podcast
Producer and Podcast Producer is going to process it.

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:15.600
So while it's processing, let me go back to the assistant.

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:19.089
[ Period of silence ]

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:23.510
So if you remember, previously I selected the express setup.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:26.880
So the express setup is really
for an all-in-one configuration

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.240
but what if you already have an
Open Directory service running.

00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:34.889
What if you already have an Xgrid controller somewhere else?

00:47:34.889 --> 00:47:41.049
And like to create a setup of Podcast Producer
using the services for you automatically

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:44.160
as automatically as we've seen with express setup.

00:47:44.159 --> 00:47:48.449
Well in that particular case, you select this one.

00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:54.509
So it's going to ask you a couple of questions like what's
the main administrator for these podcasting environment

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:59.030
that you have on your, on your existing Open Directory?

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:03.090
Then you may, it will ask you where do you
want to put all the different information,

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:06.800
all the data about the Podcast Library
and the Podcast Producer server?

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.300
So instead of using the default
shelf point, you could decide to put

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.730
that to somewhere, somewhere else shelf folder.

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:21.740
And then if you have an Xgrid setup
somewhere and you'd like to join it,

00:48:21.739 --> 00:48:26.269
it's time to do it right there and
actually join your existing system.

00:48:26.269 --> 00:48:28.780
And once you're done again press continue.

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.810
It is going to communicate with all these
different services, make sure everything is agrees

00:48:33.809 --> 00:48:36.829
about all what's going to happen to podcasting.

00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:39.340
And then it's done for you automatically.

00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:48.489
I hope you like how now your, you're going to
customize, how you're going to set up Podcast Producer.

00:48:48.489 --> 00:48:51.969
And I hope we made it very easy for you.

00:48:51.969 --> 00:48:56.529
So let's see now if the content has been published.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:01.110
If I go back here I do have a link to my podcast library.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:04.860
So if I go here and here, it's not there yet.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:09.230
Since I am an administrator, we're
going to look at exhibit admin.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:16.070
Oh, this server is fresh one, Podcast Producer 2.

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.539
My credentials are Eric.

00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:25.900
But this by the way is a tool that administrators
are going to use to actually have a full view

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.389
of all the workflows running on your system.

00:49:28.389 --> 00:49:35.659
So it's really nice because then you'll be able to see what
is the power used for the, all the grid you've just about.

00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:37.710
So it's really great.

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:42.220
[ Period of silence ]

00:49:42.219 --> 00:49:49.799
From there while it's still processing, I'd like to
give you some additional information about the library.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:54.090
So the library is called a specific
place in the file system,

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:58.030
where all the metafiles and all
metadata are going to be stored.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:02.550
And the nice thing of that is the library
still has a flag on the file system.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.080
I mean we don't put information databases,

00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:10.039
we don't put information everywhere
on other internal infrastructures.

00:50:10.039 --> 00:50:12.009
Every, everything is flat.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.940
So if you'd like to remove items from the
database, just remove it from the file system,

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.300
you have to rebuild everything and it's done.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.960
Later, you'd like to add additional content from last year,

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.740
you add it and it automatically all the
feeds are going to be rebuilt for you.

00:50:25.739 --> 00:50:28.899
And I think this is pretty interesting.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.849
So it's almost done.

00:50:29.849 --> 00:50:35.420
Let's see now if some of the content has been published.

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.940
OK, go in my feed.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:42.769
Let's download it on the file system
so I can run it in QuickTime 10.

00:50:42.769 --> 00:50:48.000
Oops, let's look for QuickTime 10, then.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.940
[ Period of silence ]

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.000
And see how it looks like.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.039
[ Period of silence ]

00:50:58.039 --> 00:51:02.079
[ Music ]

00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:09.670
So let's play it again nice branding,
pretty sure you know about that.

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:15.369
Nice titling again and with Quick Look
we had extracted from all the files

00:51:15.369 --> 00:51:18.659
that I have just submitted, we have extracted the images.

00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:23.489
And if these images are actually in portrait
mode, then we have, we did cut it in two.

00:51:23.489 --> 00:51:27.879
So then all that is totally readable
and playable in the iPhone very nicely.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.430
This was my PDF document.

00:51:31.429 --> 00:51:35.269
It's almost done and then we'll see
all the images that I have submitted.

00:51:35.269 --> 00:51:35.829
[ Period of silence ]

00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:40.329
And these are all the images.

00:51:40.329 --> 00:51:45.569
The cool thing with Quick Look is you can even
see all the different chapters of my movie.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:50.340
And so you can actually jump to this
different places in my documents.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.870

00:51:54.869 --> 00:51:55.989
And stop again.

00:51:55.989 --> 00:51:56.969
Thank you very much.

00:51:56.969 --> 00:51:58.009
Back to Kjell.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:02.890

00:52:02.889 --> 00:52:06.230
>> That new chapter UI is really cool.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.539
So we just looked at some of the
new features in Podcast Producers.

00:52:09.539 --> 00:52:13.309
And these are some of the many, many
features that we've been really working on.

00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:15.320
So let's recap real quick.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:19.410
We have this brand new application
Podcast Composer which makes it really fun

00:52:19.409 --> 00:52:22.210
to write Podcast Producer workflows with now.

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:26.590
We have a new centralized location for hosting
all of your content with the Podcast Library.

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:31.230
And it's going to make it really easy
to integrate with exterior services.

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:37.300
With the Dual Source you can make really,
really rich picture in picture podcasts.

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:41.850
We've got a great story with iTunes U and we're going to
make it really easy for you to get your content to iTunes U.

00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:45.319
And we really think the Podcast Library
is going to become the easiest way

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.430
and the best way to get your content out to iTunes U.

00:52:48.429 --> 00:52:55.730
With the web app you can now access Podcast
Producer from any web capable platform.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:53:01.460
High availability in the Pro video applications
integration, is also some services that are really great.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.309
Now we've made this really easy to set up.

00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:07.099
So you can just go home and play with it right, right away.

00:53:07.099 --> 00:53:13.210
We've got a lot of related sessions, still
a few more sessions coming this week.

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:17.909
So tomorrow we're going to be going and
looking at Podcast Composer in depth.

00:53:17.909 --> 00:53:20.679
We're really going to show you how to
get the most out of the application

00:53:20.679 --> 00:53:23.899
so that you can write the best workflows possible.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:32.070
We're also going to show you how you can customize and add
more content into Podcast Composer to make it even better.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:36.390
Deploying Podcast Producer on Friday where we're going
to spend half the, the first half of the session looking

00:53:36.389 --> 00:53:40.599
at best practices for setting up
Podcast Producer in big environments.

00:53:40.599 --> 00:53:46.000
But the second half we're going to spend looking at the
library and kind of explaining how the library works

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.409
and how you can customize it for your organization.

00:53:49.409 --> 00:53:54.889
And then on 1030 on Friday the0re's an awesome session
where we're going to do something that Apple rarely does.

00:53:54.889 --> 00:53:59.299
We're going to give you a sneak peek behind all of
the technologies that were developed and we're going

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:04.269
to show you how we leveraged all of the
Mac OS X technologies to develop a lot

00:54:04.269 --> 00:54:07.519
of the features that are in Podcast Producer.

00:54:07.519 --> 00:54:09.009
We've got two labs this week.

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.310
There's one right after this session.

00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:14.820
So we'll be, the whole team will be down
there to answer any questions you have.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:20.309
And we have one, so I think actually the
time is changed to noon on Friday since it's

00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:24.460
after the Deploying Podcast Producer session.

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:30.820
With that, oh if you have any more questions or you'd
like some more information, please contact Mark Malone.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:33.330
The email is podcastproducer@apple.com.

00:54:33.329 --> 00:54:36.670
And at this time I'd like to invite the
rest of the Podcast Producer team on stage

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:41.750
and Nader is going to moderate for Q and A.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.920

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.340
So thank you.
