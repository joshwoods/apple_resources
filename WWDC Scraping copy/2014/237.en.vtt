00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:11.626
>> Hello.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:17.576
[ Applause ]

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.406
Thank you very much
for coming today,

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:20.426
and if you're watching later

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:21.826
on video thanks so
much for watching.

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:25.206
I'm Ken Kocienda, and
this session is called

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:27.296
"A Strategy for Great Work."

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:31.746
So I think we all
try to do great work.

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:34.556
I certainly always
try to do great work.

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:36.886
Regardless of the
results and the outcome,

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:40.516
certainly the effort is directed
towards doing something great.

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:42.236
I think that's probably
the same for all of you,

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:44.006
that's why you're here
at the conference today,

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.196
that's maybe why you're
watching later on video.

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:50.216
Now this is a subject,
that's very important to me,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.586
I like talking about it,
I like thinking about it.

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:56.646
And I was last on stage
in 2012 with a talk called

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:59.246
"Basics + Habits,"
where I talked

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:01.106
about some technical concerns,

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:03.166
some real certain nuts-and-bolts
things about how to set

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.176
up a project and then how

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:06.996
to run projects once
you have them going.

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:10.256
But, again, this is very
tactical, sort of down

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:14.216
into the details, things
like code review and working

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:17.656
with your other people that
you might have on a team.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.636
So today it's different.

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:22.726
I would like to in
this session talk

00:01:22.726 --> 00:01:26.716
about some higher level ideas,
kind of move it up to the level

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:29.156
of strategy rather than tactics.

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:34.876
And so I went out and got a
helpful quotation from Wikipedia

00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:37.856
to sort of think about
what the difference

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:40.496
between strategy and tactics is.

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:44.866
And so tactics are the actual
means used to gain an objective,

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:47.706
while strategy is the
overall campaign plan,

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:50.856
which may involve complex
operational patterns, activity

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:53.386
and decision-making that
lead to tactical execution.

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:56.356
Certainly, the complex
operational pattern sounds

00:01:56.356 --> 00:01:58.716
like programming to me, right?

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:00.416
Definitely.

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.476
So I think that really sort

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:06.336
of strategy is you're having a
big idea of what you might want

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:09.876
to do, and that really should
hopefully be driving what you

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:11.946
actually do to accomplish
the goal, right?

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:15.636
So today I'd like to talk
about some of these ideas,

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.676
these high level
ideas that inspire

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:19.706
and inform my everyday work.

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:24.426
But really this session
is not sort of how

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:26.826
to make a great project
in 21 days, right?

00:02:26.826 --> 00:02:29.786
I mean it's not going to be,
it's never that simple, right?

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:31.756
Every time you see
something like that X

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:36.056
or 21 days it's never,
ever, ever that simple.

00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:40.276
So it's not simple; you
kind of need a plan for kind

00:02:40.396 --> 00:02:41.846
of attacking the problem here.

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:46.506
And so today how I'm going
to do that is tell you some

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:50.016
of my stories, projects
that I've been involved in.

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:52.946
But, you know, but there's
kind of like a note of caution

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:55.586
when you hear stories
and maybe try

00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:57.326
to apply it to your own life.

00:02:57.326 --> 00:02:58.676
And I have an example here.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:01.606
Let's say you're in Las
Vegas and you see somebody go

00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:04.076
by who is carrying
a big pile of chips

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:07.006
over to get them cashed in,
and you stop the person.

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:10.116
You say, "Wait, what did you do
to get that big pile of chips?"

00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:14.336
And the answer comes,
"I put it all on 14."

00:03:15.846 --> 00:03:21.656
Okay, so it's true, but not
so useful to you, right?

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:23.706
You go over and put
it on 14, you may

00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:26.306
or may not get the same
result, most likely not.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:30.226
So hopefully the stories
will be interesting to you,

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:34.796
but the real goal before, during
and after the story, right,

00:03:34.886 --> 00:03:38.446
particularly after is to extract
out the lessons from the stories

00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:42.056
because I think the
lessons if you take them

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:44.926
in the aggregate starts
stringing together some lessons.

00:03:45.736 --> 00:03:47.626
That sort of points
toward a strategy,

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:48.886
it certainly does for me.

00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:55.516
So today eight stories, 11
lessons, take all those lessons,

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:59.646
put them together and really
that is what informs my work.

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:02.036
And, again, of course, I'm
always trying to do great work,

00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:04.076
so hopefully this
will all come together

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:05.296
in a nice big circle at the end.

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:09.046
So to begin with the stories.

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:13.936
Number one, the story is
"Like a Crystal Ball,"

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:19.356
and the lesson is know a
good idea when you see it.

00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:25.206
So I joined Apple in June of
2001, and if you think back

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:30.606
to that time, Mac OS X,
version 10.0, was released

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:32.626
about three months before.

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:35.496
Now that's kind of
a long time ago.

00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:37.006
When you think about
it the browser

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:40.446
on the platform was
Microsoft Internet Explorer,

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:43.326
and that's the browser
that's shipped

00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:45.756
with the operating
system from Apple.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:52.066
Not only that, there
was no framework to load

00:04:52.246 --> 00:04:55.236
and render web content, right?

00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:57.166
So we just had an
app, but no framework.

00:04:57.166 --> 00:05:00.566
So my job, along with someone
else, a fellow named Don,

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:01.646
we joined the same day.

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:04.506
Our job became make
Apple a web browser

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:06.996
and an Objective-C
Framework, too.

00:05:07.686 --> 00:05:11.006
Again, load and render web
content and make that available

00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:13.226
as an API to you all,
to the developers.

00:05:13.756 --> 00:05:18.466
So we started looking
at some options.

00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:20.466
Well, what were the options
available at the time?

00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:23.636
And you see sort of the
leading candidates there.

00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:28.366
Some of these were commercial
products, kind of a buy option.

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:31.376
Some of them were Open
Source projects out there

00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:33.676
in the world going on.

00:05:33.676 --> 00:05:35.716
We could go and make perhaps,

00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:37.516
adopt that source
code for our project.

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:38.726
We could also start
from scratch,

00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:42.116
we considered it, absolutely.

00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:45.606
So my job was to begin to do
some technical investigation

00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:49.276
of particularly the
Open Source options.

00:05:51.046 --> 00:05:52.916
And I downloaded Mozilla.

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:56.626
There's one story, I took
about a week, I remember,

00:05:56.896 --> 00:05:59.886
to try to just get Mozilla
to build on the Mac.

00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:05.506
And I remember at one point one
of the steps in this long recipe

00:06:05.506 --> 00:06:07.956
of steps that needed to get
done to get Mozilla to build,

00:06:08.316 --> 00:06:10.136
I needed to rebuild the C,

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:14.056
metro work C library,
was one of the steps.

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:16.226
So this was not a
straightforward thing,

00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:18.236
but I eventually got it
building and, you know, okay.

00:06:18.756 --> 00:06:23.696
But this process went
on for weeks, and I went

00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:26.126
and got these programs.

00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:28.006
The commercial products,
you know,

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:29.896
what I did for that
was got them running

00:06:29.896 --> 00:06:32.676
and started doing some
performance analysis

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:34.966
and say Unicode compatibility.

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:38.616
And so between the commercial
products, those test results,

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:41.786
and the Open Source projects,
some sort of reckoning

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:45.236
of how much source code was
there, how easy it would be

00:06:45.236 --> 00:06:46.586
to adapt it and so forth.

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:49.836
Some test results, I
printed out on paper,

00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:54.116
but I didn't have a demo.

00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:56.376
No demo, just test results.

00:06:57.056 --> 00:06:59.996
So right about that time we
got a new engineer on our team,

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:00.836
a fellow named Richard.

00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:05.596
And so I showed him, described
to him basically as I described

00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:09.066
to you what I'd been doing,
showed him the test results.

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:11.976
And he said really what
have you been doing?

00:07:12.256 --> 00:07:13.876
Six weeks and this
is all you have?

00:07:14.846 --> 00:07:16.716
So I was like, well, yeah.

00:07:16.716 --> 00:07:18.606
I just kind of shrugged and
said that's what I have.

00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:20.296
So he just didn't
think very much

00:07:20.296 --> 00:07:21.796
of that, and so he went away.

00:07:21.796 --> 00:07:24.606
And two days later
he had a demo.

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:27.906
He took one of those
options, KHTML,

00:07:28.356 --> 00:07:31.636
which is the web rendering
engine that was part

00:07:31.636 --> 00:07:35.596
of the KDE desktop
environment for Linux.

00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:39.216
He grabbed that source code,
got it running on a Mac,

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:43.986
just did whatever kind of
hacks that he needed to do

00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:48.626
to get it running, and had
Konqueror, the KDE's browser,

00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:51.796
running on a Mac in an X window.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.286
This was amazing.

00:07:55.816 --> 00:07:58.336
It was absolutely amazing.

00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:00.406
We were just standing
there and like looking

00:08:00.956 --> 00:08:03.926
at a browser running on
the Mac, that's like --

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:09.376
it was like a crystal ball,
it was absolutely amazing.

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:12.846
And we saw all the people who
were involved in, you know -

00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:15.036
not only us on the project,
but then decision makers

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:18.476
at the company - saw that
KHTML was our future.

00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:20.926
This was just like he'd opened

00:08:20.926 --> 00:08:23.276
up this tunnel to,
like, the future.

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:24.976
It was absolutely amazing.

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:29.896
And so the lesson from
this experience is

00:08:29.896 --> 00:08:31.236
to know a good idea
when you see it.

00:08:31.876 --> 00:08:36.956
I mean really for me, I kind
of felt like a bumbling idiot.

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:41.186
There I was for six weeks
trying to figure out what to do

00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:44.506
and really had nothing,
and someone new came in

00:08:44.506 --> 00:08:48.836
and in two days he had
the future right there

00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:49.736
that we could use.

00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:53.446
Now sort of the sub-lesson

00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:55.256
for this is really
what does this mean,

00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:56.366
know a good idea
when you see it?

00:08:56.366 --> 00:08:59.346
Is even if something like this
happens to you and you're made

00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:01.556
to look like an idiot,
it doesn't matter.

00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:02.346
I didn't care.

00:09:02.936 --> 00:09:04.226
It shouldn't matter
to you either

00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:06.696
because there's actually
some, a couple of good things

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:08.256
about this experience.

00:09:08.406 --> 00:09:11.396
Number one, I had a great new
team member who I was going

00:09:11.396 --> 00:09:14.236
to be now involved with, who was
going to be helping me to kind

00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:19.336
of make this project happen,
and he really proved in two days

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:22.056
that he was really good.

00:09:22.056 --> 00:09:24.906
And so it was just like,
boy, the next day, well,

00:09:24.906 --> 00:09:26.406
we kind of know what
to do, right?

00:09:26.406 --> 00:09:28.366
We're going to start
making this future real.

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:34.346
And so that's kind of the
story of "Like a Crystal Ball,"

00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:36.876
but there's a bonus
lesson here, too.

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:39.036
Not only know a good
idea when you see it,

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:44.496
but kind of this extra lesson
of make demos and prototypes.

00:09:44.946 --> 00:09:48.496
If you're starting on
a new idea don't --

00:09:48.496 --> 00:09:52.176
test results, that's all well
and good, but you should also

00:09:52.446 --> 00:09:56.696
at the same time make something
that you can actually begin

00:09:56.696 --> 00:10:00.996
to use like you want to use the
real thing that you're going

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:02.596
to be making ultimately
in the future.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:06.866
Get that, open up your own
tunnel to the future, right?

00:10:06.946 --> 00:10:12.076
Get something in front of you
and working as soon as you can.

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:14.346
So that's "Like a Crystal
Ball": Know a good idea

00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:17.466
when you see it, and make
demos and prototypes.

00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:27.186
So the next story, number
two, is "The Black Obelisk,"

00:10:27.186 --> 00:10:29.556
and the lesson is don't try to
solve every problem at once.

00:10:29.586 --> 00:10:31.896
So continuing right
on from the end

00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:34.506
of that last story:
KHTML, fantastic.

00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:39.086
The more we looked at the code,
the more we were confident

00:10:39.086 --> 00:10:42.826
that this was really
the way for us to go.

00:10:42.826 --> 00:10:44.746
But really what do
we do now, right?

00:10:44.746 --> 00:10:46.856
I mean what do we do, right?

00:10:47.106 --> 00:10:50.136
And so, as you can imagine,
Open Source we go and it's part

00:10:50.136 --> 00:10:55.126
of the KDE desktop, so we went
and we downloaded all of KDE.

00:10:55.126 --> 00:10:57.716
But the thing is we
only wanted KHTML,

00:10:57.716 --> 00:11:02.266
only the HTML rendering
engine, and we also wanted KJS,

00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:03.526
the JavaScript engine.

00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:08.046
So the job became to
sort of draw a line

00:11:08.046 --> 00:11:13.176
around just the HTML part of
this whole desktop environment

00:11:14.066 --> 00:11:16.236
so that we could just
extract that and use it.

00:11:16.236 --> 00:11:19.446
And this turned out to be
about 100 source files.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.476
It seems tractable.

00:11:22.096 --> 00:11:24.976
So the next step was to bring
those files over to the Mac

00:11:25.366 --> 00:11:27.876
and start compiling them,
one at a time, right?

00:11:28.106 --> 00:11:31.746
Of course, it didn't compile

00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:33.256
because we just took
this source code

00:11:33.256 --> 00:11:36.546
that expected this whole other
desktop environment around it,

00:11:37.426 --> 00:11:40.766
and now we just sort of pulled
the whole rug out from under it.

00:11:41.126 --> 00:11:42.966
So, you know, it didn't compile.

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:45.116
We had a whole bunch
of missing things,

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:47.946
and so we just began
stubbing them in,

00:11:48.016 --> 00:11:49.816
stubbing in missing
functions one at a time.

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:52.456
And these were very,
very light stubs.

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:56.166
These were only stubs
in header files, right?

00:11:56.166 --> 00:12:00.256
So we only wanted to sort of
define the problem in terms

00:12:00.256 --> 00:12:02.916
of all of the missing things
that we needed to add.

00:12:03.206 --> 00:12:05.686
This was very, very slow work.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.246
It took about another six
weeks - six weeks was kind

00:12:08.246 --> 00:12:10.696
of a magical number
for this project.

00:12:11.016 --> 00:12:13.316
This took about six
weeks of just compiling.

00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:19.086
It would be like 10, 11 hours
of compiling every single day.

00:12:19.266 --> 00:12:24.486
So it was pretty
painstaking, and then even

00:12:24.486 --> 00:12:25.996
at this step nothing linked

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:28.256
because as I mentioned
these are only header files.

00:12:28.606 --> 00:12:30.106
So we were only running,
we weren't --

00:12:30.106 --> 00:12:31.956
I made a custom make file,
I said don't even try

00:12:31.956 --> 00:12:36.036
to run the linker, just like try
to show us what we were missing.

00:12:36.416 --> 00:12:42.646
So after we were done with that,
right, we had another six weeks

00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:46.366
to get everything to link,
actually going in and finishing

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:49.116
out sort of the header
file, actually putting

00:12:49.456 --> 00:12:52.126
in some stub implementation
for everything.

00:12:52.456 --> 00:12:55.396
And even then we had lots
of crashes because in a lot

00:12:55.396 --> 00:12:56.906
of functions that
returned strings,

00:12:56.906 --> 00:12:58.866
we returned empty strings,

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:01.416
and obviously that's
not really what a lot

00:13:01.416 --> 00:13:02.506
of the code was expecting.

00:13:02.506 --> 00:13:05.956
So we also added in a
whole lot of log statements

00:13:05.956 --> 00:13:09.356
to our implementation, saying,
yes, this is not implemented

00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:11.156
at all, I mean it
returns a value,

00:13:11.156 --> 00:13:14.596
but sort of not implemented
at all, partially implemented.

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:16.736
Yes, we think we're pretty
close, and implement it.

00:13:16.736 --> 00:13:21.846
So we had a whole bunch of log
statements that we would see;

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:24.646
we had a whole bunch of messages
getting written to the log

00:13:24.646 --> 00:13:26.366
as we actually tried
to use the program.

00:13:26.696 --> 00:13:29.616
And after this whole
process of many, many weeks,

00:13:29.866 --> 00:13:33.756
we eventually wound up with a
Mac program that used KHTML,

00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:37.576
and then one day
the lights came on.

00:13:37.926 --> 00:13:40.006
So my coworker, Richard, was
actually off on vacation.

00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:42.036
He was really kind of
doing this, sort of leading

00:13:42.036 --> 00:13:44.926
up the effort to get things
to link and not crash so much,

00:13:44.926 --> 00:13:47.066
and then I came in and
took over the process

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:52.756
and actually got the first
thing to draw on the screen.

00:13:53.236 --> 00:14:01.326
So I loaded a URL, in this
case www.yahoo.com, and reams

00:14:01.326 --> 00:14:03.556
and reams and reams
of log messages go by,

00:14:03.616 --> 00:14:05.066
and the program didn't crash,

00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:07.606
and then there was a
short pause, and it drew.

00:14:08.036 --> 00:14:10.956
The Black Obelisk [applause].

00:14:10.956 --> 00:14:20.276
So this is the first thing
that WebKit, and Safari ever,

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.916
you know, what became
Safari, ever rendered.

00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:26.256
Now, see, it's a little bit of
a secret, as it actually turns

00:14:26.256 --> 00:14:28.786
out that this was a reversal,
that Obelisk should have been

00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:31.926
on the other side of the
screen, but we fixed that sort

00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:34.226
of little geometry
problem very soon after.

00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:37.596
But you can imagine that once
I got this going, go ahead

00:14:37.596 --> 00:14:39.666
and fetched everybody who
was disclosed in the project,

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:40.996
and we're all sitting
around sort of like

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:46.966
"2001 Space Odyssey" with this
Black Obelisk, going "whoo."

00:14:47.296 --> 00:14:49.926
So that was a very
happy, happy moment.

00:14:50.186 --> 00:14:54.906
Now the lesson from this
experience is don't try

00:14:54.906 --> 00:14:56.316
to solve every problem at once.

00:14:56.386 --> 00:15:00.226
At this point we had
almost no knowledge

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:03.556
of now the innards
of KHTML worked.

00:15:03.946 --> 00:15:06.906
This was simply a
mechanical process

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:11.136
of making the compiler happy,
making the linker happy,

00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:14.276
making it so the program
didn't crash when we tried

00:15:14.276 --> 00:15:15.146
to do something with it.

00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:17.746
It was all very,
very mechanical.

00:15:18.346 --> 00:15:20.486
The compiler says
there's something missing,

00:15:20.896 --> 00:15:23.476
go add that thing so that
it's no longer missing, right?

00:15:24.286 --> 00:15:27.586
Now it turns out, of course, a
web rendering engine is a very,

00:15:27.586 --> 00:15:29.146
very complicated
piece of software,

00:15:29.496 --> 00:15:34.076
and but we just didn't have
the bandwidth to think about it

00:15:34.076 --> 00:15:35.276
at this point as we were trying

00:15:35.276 --> 00:15:36.766
to just get those
lights to come on.

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:40.466
That began to happen as
soon as we had a program

00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:41.866
that would no longer
crash, right?

00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:44.226
So don't care.

00:15:44.336 --> 00:15:47.076
If you're trying to
attack a new, big problem,

00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:49.236
and you've got this big
problem space, particularly

00:15:49.516 --> 00:15:52.356
if that problem space is new
to you, just try to figure

00:15:52.356 --> 00:15:53.726
out what the most
important thing is

00:15:53.726 --> 00:15:55.226
to do first and do that.

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:58.846
Don't think about the whole
problem or try to operate

00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:03.536
on solving the whole
problem at one time, right?

00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:07.506
So don't try to solve
every problem at once,

00:16:07.616 --> 00:16:11.106
and that's "The Black Obelisk."

00:16:11.636 --> 00:16:16.386
So the next story, number
three, is "The Hardest Problem.

00:16:17.136 --> 00:16:20.886
And the lesson is find smart
friends and listen to them.

00:16:21.186 --> 00:16:24.106
So fast forward to
the fall of 2003,

00:16:24.106 --> 00:16:27.356
and my job became
editing to WebKit.

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:31.956
So we wanted to use WebKit
to edit HTML mail in mail.app

00:16:32.346 --> 00:16:36.936
on Mac OS X, and we wanted to
make editing in WebKit look

00:16:36.936 --> 00:16:39.276
and work like a text
editor, okay?

00:16:39.276 --> 00:16:43.116
So the problem that
we were trying

00:16:43.116 --> 00:16:44.966
to solve is somewhat
obvious, right?

00:16:44.966 --> 00:16:49.036
A lot of other platforms,
in particular Windows,

00:16:49.036 --> 00:16:52.756
sends HTML mail from
Outlook, and we wanted

00:16:52.756 --> 00:16:55.656
to not only render it, which we
could now that we had WebKit,

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.616
but we also wanted to edit it.

00:16:57.856 --> 00:16:59.056
Because if you think about it,

00:16:59.056 --> 00:17:02.386
before WebKit had editing
the web content would show

00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:05.665
up in your mail message as an
attachment in our TF document

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:07.695
with a big blinking
insertion point after it,

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:09.586
you could just kind of delete
the whole thing with one --

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:13.066
delete an entire web
page with one back space.

00:17:13.096 --> 00:17:15.326
So that's not what we wanted,
we wanted to be able to get

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.056
into the details
of the web content

00:17:17.056 --> 00:17:18.016
so we could edit it, right?

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:24.006
So now, the hardest problem I
have ever, ever worked on in my,

00:17:24.266 --> 00:17:25.786
well, many, many years

00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:29.626
of programming is arrow
navigation through web content.

00:17:29.626 --> 00:17:30.906
Now what do I mean by that?

00:17:31.256 --> 00:17:35.826
So picture a tiny little
web document, like this,

00:17:35.886 --> 00:17:38.906
and what you do then is you hit
the arrow key the right number

00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:41.696
of times and the insertion
point winds up at the end.

00:17:41.806 --> 00:17:44.556
That's it: just go
character by character,

00:17:44.556 --> 00:17:45.686
have the insertion point show

00:17:45.686 --> 00:17:48.086
up in the right place each
time you press the arrow key,

00:17:48.416 --> 00:17:51.226
and then similarly
press the arrow key

00:17:51.226 --> 00:17:52.136
to go back the other way

00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:53.856
and send the insertion
point back to the start.

00:17:54.116 --> 00:17:54.876
That was it.

00:17:55.286 --> 00:17:57.456
This turned out to be
very, very difficult.

00:17:57.456 --> 00:17:58.426
Now why is this?

00:17:58.456 --> 00:18:01.426
Because, you know, unlike
say an RTF document,

00:18:01.426 --> 00:18:04.656
which is just a series of
characters and indexes into,

00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:06.926
basically an array
of characters,

00:18:08.476 --> 00:18:10.466
web content is a tree structure.

00:18:11.066 --> 00:18:14.796
So if you see on the top
where the insertion point is

00:18:14.796 --> 00:18:19.096
at the end, and then if you look
at the model, the web document,

00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:21.416
the insertion point
would blink at the end

00:18:22.316 --> 00:18:26.936
if in the web document, the
insertion point was there

00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:32.076
or there or there
or there, right?

00:18:32.476 --> 00:18:35.046
So what I had here was a
complex model of view relations

00:18:35.046 --> 00:18:39.736
where the model changed, but
the view didn't change, right?

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:43.266
So now to begin thinking
about this I used the DOM,

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:45.286
the web DOM, the
document object model,

00:18:45.286 --> 00:18:49.486
the API for addressing web
content, and used positions

00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:52.956
in the web content
to try to understand

00:18:53.086 --> 00:18:54.816
where to make the
insertion point blink.

00:18:55.206 --> 00:18:57.556
And so, as I just illustrated,
I came up with this notion

00:18:57.556 --> 00:19:00.116
of then equivalent
DOM positions.

00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:04.306
DOM positions that would
make different DOM positions,

00:19:04.416 --> 00:19:06.086
but that would make the
insertion point blink

00:19:06.086 --> 00:19:07.966
in the same spot, okay?

00:19:08.656 --> 00:19:12.636
So I started writing some
code: very simple, right arrow,

00:19:12.636 --> 00:19:15.576
algorithm here, get the
insertion point position

00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:18.536
in a DOM position,
then find this function

00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:21.296
and use this function,
equivalent downstream position

00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:23.466
to find the DOM position

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:25.956
that would still make
the insertion point blink

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:28.366
in the same spot, but was closer
to the end of the document.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.256
And then go to the next position

00:19:31.256 --> 00:19:32.696
and then set the
insertion point there.

00:19:33.036 --> 00:19:35.476
Now that seems reasonable,
but kind of focus

00:19:35.476 --> 00:19:38.866
in on these two important
functions here, right?

00:19:38.866 --> 00:19:40.716
Well, naturally it's
just a program, right?

00:19:40.716 --> 00:19:43.196
I mean so if you wanted perfect
results the functions need

00:19:43.196 --> 00:19:43.996
to work perfectly.

00:19:43.996 --> 00:19:46.276
And the problem with that was

00:19:46.276 --> 00:19:48.456
that equivalent downstream
position was implemented

00:19:48.456 --> 00:19:50.446
in terms of get next
DOM position,

00:19:51.216 --> 00:19:54.276
so sometimes I would have
this feedback process going

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:57.726
where bizarre things happened
because a bug would then feed

00:19:57.726 --> 00:20:00.716
into itself, right, and cause
something that was very,

00:20:00.716 --> 00:20:03.976
very difficult to understand
and diagnose simply by looking

00:20:03.976 --> 00:20:06.356
at the result in the view.

00:20:06.636 --> 00:20:09.346
So it was complicated,
right, to get right.

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:12.156
And then other issues
come up, as well.

00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:14.536
What if you're already at
the end of the document,

00:20:14.536 --> 00:20:16.326
the visual end of the document?

00:20:16.326 --> 00:20:18.746
As you know, if you've
ever probably viewed source

00:20:18.746 --> 00:20:22.026
on an HTML document, there's
often many, many things,

00:20:22.026 --> 00:20:23.516
at the very least sort

00:20:23.516 --> 00:20:26.026
of a closing body
tag, closing HTML tag.

00:20:26.296 --> 00:20:28.046
A lot of times there's
script content.

00:20:28.086 --> 00:20:30.716
There might be style content.

00:20:30.716 --> 00:20:34.886
There could be any sort of
information that's not visible

00:20:34.976 --> 00:20:36.956
after the visible
end of the document.

00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:40.626
And by DOM position it will,
you know, if you just kind

00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:43.156
of send it off to a position
it will merrily go there,

00:20:43.156 --> 00:20:45.336
and there won't be a place for
the insertion point to blink,

00:20:45.336 --> 00:20:46.526
so this was a problem, as well.

00:20:46.886 --> 00:20:49.276
And then what if you
want to move by word

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:52.126
because the ultimate goal was
to make a text editor, right?

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:53.716
So you hold down the
option key and arrow,

00:20:53.716 --> 00:20:56.446
and then you move word by word,
not character by character.

00:20:57.096 --> 00:20:59.386
And so I was nowhere,
I was stuck.

00:20:59.686 --> 00:21:03.326
I was working on this,
well, just for the sake

00:21:03.326 --> 00:21:05.566
of argument say six
weeks, the magical number,

00:21:07.636 --> 00:21:11.006
but for many weeks
without really feeling

00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:12.376
like I was making progress.

00:21:12.886 --> 00:21:13.636
So I asked for help,

00:21:13.796 --> 00:21:16.636
and fortunately I had some
very smart people in my team,

00:21:16.636 --> 00:21:18.456
which of course the
other stories have

00:21:18.456 --> 00:21:19.416
already illustrated.

00:21:19.716 --> 00:21:23.346
And I explained the problem to
them, much as I just did to you,

00:21:23.656 --> 00:21:25.816
and their solution
came back very,

00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:28.106
very clear that DOM
positions were too low level.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:32.206
I was trying to build
a very complex edifice,

00:21:32.206 --> 00:21:36.036
but I was using too
fundamental an abstraction

00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:37.936
to get the job done.

00:21:37.936 --> 00:21:39.356
So I needed a more
powerful abstraction.

00:21:39.356 --> 00:21:40.736
So they came up with
one, they gave me one.

00:21:40.736 --> 00:21:41.946
They called it VisiblePosition.

00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:46.686
And all this was, this is C++
code, so this is C++ class

00:21:46.986 --> 00:21:49.926
that represented a
place in a document

00:21:49.926 --> 00:21:51.166
where the insertion
point can blink,

00:21:51.586 --> 00:21:55.766
and then secondarily a
library called visible-units

00:21:57.006 --> 00:21:58.886
that could take a
VisiblePosition and move

00:21:58.886 --> 00:22:01.406
by words, lines and
documents, okay?

00:22:01.406 --> 00:22:02.826
So they gave me this design.

00:22:03.356 --> 00:22:07.276
Now the point is that I
still had the hard work

00:22:07.276 --> 00:22:14.516
of figuring everything out, but
now I had a complete outline

00:22:15.576 --> 00:22:19.656
of all the code that I needed,
every place, word by word, well,

00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:21.976
I knew now there was actually
a place in the document,

00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:25.606
there was a stub function
that was where the move word

00:22:25.606 --> 00:22:29.096
by word code should go,
where that should live.

00:22:29.776 --> 00:22:34.806
And so this, really this set of
abstractions really helped me

00:22:34.806 --> 00:22:37.066
to just organize
the work and figure

00:22:37.066 --> 00:22:38.446
out where this solution
should live.

00:22:38.776 --> 00:22:41.656
It also made it easier to
think about the problem

00:22:41.656 --> 00:22:44.716
so that I wound up with fewer
of these kind of functions

00:22:44.716 --> 00:22:47.826
that fed back on each other
producing bizarre results.

00:22:48.986 --> 00:22:52.306
So when you're blocked
don't be blocked.

00:22:53.486 --> 00:22:55.516
Find smart friends
and listen to them.

00:22:55.516 --> 00:22:58.476
In this case they said
VisiblePositions, visible-units.

00:22:58.476 --> 00:23:06.736
I said, OK, I will do that, and
it worked, it absolutely worked.

00:23:06.936 --> 00:23:09.336
I certainly went back and
got some more of their help,

00:23:09.336 --> 00:23:11.436
some details, but this
was the big, big help.

00:23:11.796 --> 00:23:13.296
Find smart friends
and listen to them,

00:23:13.296 --> 00:23:14.836
particularly when you're stuck.

00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:16.236
Do not stay blocked.

00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:21.436
And this is how I got through
my hardest programming problem.

00:23:24.076 --> 00:23:30.416
And so the next story,
number four, is "QWERTY,"

00:23:31.056 --> 00:23:34.216
and the lesson is work
should explain itself.

00:23:35.926 --> 00:23:38.296
So fast forward to 2005 now,

00:23:39.806 --> 00:23:43.356
and I joined the iPhone
development project pretty

00:23:43.356 --> 00:23:44.016
early on.

00:23:44.516 --> 00:23:48.226
And initially I joined to work
on WebKit because it seemed

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:51.266
like a good match for my
skills and experience at Apple,

00:23:51.266 --> 00:23:54.126
but I soon transitioned
to work on keyboards.

00:23:57.076 --> 00:24:00.166
So now if you think about
it, right, and this is kind

00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:03.396
of what we had when we
started with the iPhone.

00:24:03.396 --> 00:24:06.676
We had a screen, and
we had this notion

00:24:07.576 --> 00:24:08.906
that the keyboard
would be on the bottom

00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:10.386
and the app content
would be on the top.

00:24:10.686 --> 00:24:13.056
And, of course, the
big question was, well,

00:24:13.056 --> 00:24:16.546
what should the keyboard
do, how should it work,

00:24:16.736 --> 00:24:17.686
what should it look like?

00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:20.686
And if you had seen even

00:24:20.686 --> 00:24:23.596
from the very beginning the
Steve Jobs' announcement

00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:27.046
of the iPhone, the original
announcement in 2007,

00:24:27.046 --> 00:24:30.006
he pointed out very,
very clearly this virtue

00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:32.766
of the iPhone that it didn't
have those plastic keys

00:24:32.766 --> 00:24:35.626
on the bottom, we could draw
the keyboard and make it look

00:24:35.626 --> 00:24:36.816
like whatever we wanted.

00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:42.066
So now jumping back to the
beginning of that story,

00:24:42.066 --> 00:24:45.386
because Steve on stage was
the end of that story, right,

00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:49.036
we didn't have plastic keys
so we needed to experiment

00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:51.316
of what we were going
to do, right?

00:24:51.816 --> 00:24:53.636
How were we going to
replace those plastic keys

00:24:53.636 --> 00:24:54.306
with software?

00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:59.396
And we came up with many, many
ideas for how we would do this.

00:24:59.396 --> 00:25:02.666
Now there are a lot of
challenges, particularly

00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:04.756
at the beginning, when we
were all new with dealing

00:25:04.756 --> 00:25:07.936
with a touchscreen keyboard,
particularly touchscreens

00:25:08.226 --> 00:25:11.286
in general and touchscreen
keyboards, specifically.

00:25:11.936 --> 00:25:14.106
So one of the challenges is
that small targets are hard

00:25:14.106 --> 00:25:15.686
to tap, it's pretty logical.

00:25:15.686 --> 00:25:17.676
I'm sure you even
experienced that now,

00:25:17.676 --> 00:25:20.866
the smaller the targets get the
more difficult they are to tap.

00:25:21.176 --> 00:25:26.356
And not only that, but as you go
for a target, as you get close

00:25:26.356 --> 00:25:29.296
to it your finger covers up the
thing that you're looking for,

00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:31.876
so the smaller that it is
the more difficult it is

00:25:31.876 --> 00:25:34.536
to do some fine-grained
adjustments as you get close.

00:25:35.506 --> 00:25:38.076
So these were - we,
in our experiments,

00:25:38.076 --> 00:25:40.356
we were seeing the result.

00:25:40.356 --> 00:25:41.496
This was very challenging

00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:42.946
to make a keyboard
that worked, at all.

00:25:43.316 --> 00:25:45.846
And so in the beginning,
we were pretty clear,

00:25:45.846 --> 00:25:47.666
or at least we thought
we were clear,

00:25:47.886 --> 00:25:50.356
that bigger keys would
be the solution -

00:25:50.356 --> 00:25:52.196
this would solve both problems.

00:25:52.906 --> 00:25:57.986
So I have an example of
something in the spirit of one

00:25:57.986 --> 00:26:01.496
of the experiments we
tried, not an exact example,

00:26:01.756 --> 00:26:03.926
but something very, very much
in the spirit of what we tried,

00:26:03.926 --> 00:26:05.426
and I call it the
keyboard keyboard

00:26:05.616 --> 00:26:08.336
because if you think about, you
know, other things in the world

00:26:08.336 --> 00:26:10.716
that accept a lot of
touch input, right,

00:26:10.716 --> 00:26:13.916
well it's a piano
keyboard, right?

00:26:14.376 --> 00:26:17.986
So you could maybe conceive of
a keyboard that looks like this.

00:26:19.496 --> 00:26:21.156
So now how does this work?

00:26:21.156 --> 00:26:22.906
Well, I'm going to try to -
I'm going to type the T key,

00:26:23.136 --> 00:26:24.626
and so how do you get a T?

00:26:24.806 --> 00:26:28.496
Well, you look on all the
keys, and you do make a chord,

00:26:28.496 --> 00:26:36.846
multitouch motion, to find all
the keys that have a T on it.

00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:41.006
Okay, so then we could go T.

00:26:41.006 --> 00:26:44.946
H, H has actually got two of the
same keys as T, but H is only

00:26:44.946 --> 00:26:47.496
on those two keys
and the, T-H-E.

00:26:47.496 --> 00:26:50.116
So you can see how
this would work, right,

00:26:50.116 --> 00:26:51.766
a chording keyboard, right?

00:26:52.396 --> 00:26:55.606
And this is good
because the keys are big.

00:26:57.136 --> 00:26:59.696
You can even maybe think of like
it's just like home keys, right?

00:26:59.696 --> 00:27:01.806
You just kind of keep your
five fingers right on top

00:27:01.806 --> 00:27:05.526
of the keys and, you know, you
can use the keyboard like that.

00:27:05.716 --> 00:27:08.036
And so it's easy to press the
correct key, so that's good,

00:27:08.036 --> 00:27:10.366
but it's bad because there's
a learning curve, right?

00:27:11.016 --> 00:27:13.766
The first-time experience
is a mystery.

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.886
You see this alphabet soup
on this thing that looks

00:27:16.886 --> 00:27:17.746
like a piano keyboard.

00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:19.506
Well, how do I use this, right?

00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:21.286
And so we were thinking
that, well,

00:27:21.286 --> 00:27:23.506
the solution would be
we'd have a tutorial

00:27:23.796 --> 00:27:25.976
to teach the people how
to use the keyboard.

00:27:26.356 --> 00:27:29.666
Now it's actually, you know,
this is not - this is an idea

00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:32.706
that actually has
some history at Apple

00:27:32.706 --> 00:27:35.416
because the original Mac
shipped with a tutorial

00:27:35.646 --> 00:27:37.416
to teach people how
to use the mouse,

00:27:37.416 --> 00:27:39.546
since that was new, right?

00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:43.516
So we figured we'd come up
with a tutorial, and you think

00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:47.496
about it, is that
even if we didn't have

00:27:47.496 --> 00:27:49.456
that keyboard keyboard,
but if you imagine

00:27:49.456 --> 00:27:51.546
that if we did we could maybe
even come up with a keyboard

00:27:51.546 --> 00:27:53.406
that used music to
try to teach people

00:27:53.406 --> 00:27:55.306
that you could maybe
play a tune, right?

00:27:55.586 --> 00:27:58.476
So it wasn't the craziest
idea in the world.

00:27:58.476 --> 00:28:01.576
But after each of these
experiments and each

00:28:01.576 --> 00:28:04.186
of the times that we thought
through how to make a tutorial,

00:28:05.966 --> 00:28:07.456
we always came back to QWERTY

00:28:08.536 --> 00:28:11.116
because you all already
know how to use it.

00:28:11.826 --> 00:28:15.246
There's no need for
a tutorial, right?

00:28:15.246 --> 00:28:18.516
You see the thing,
and instead of, gosh,

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:21.046
what is this, and
how do I use it?

00:28:22.146 --> 00:28:26.106
Right? Instead of that you have
this, where you look at it and,

00:28:26.106 --> 00:28:28.056
okay, it's different
because it's a touchscreen

00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:33.456
and it's small, but we're sort
of calling on and invoking,

00:28:33.686 --> 00:28:36.636
right, a lot of these kind
of these familiar notions

00:28:36.636 --> 00:28:38.826
that you're already very,
very comfortable with.

00:28:39.336 --> 00:28:43.306
So that's why we wound up with
this and ultimately, right,

00:28:43.816 --> 00:28:48.686
we have this today because we
thought it was more important

00:28:48.986 --> 00:28:52.166
that the work should
explain itself, right?

00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:53.926
You already know
how to use QWERTY.

00:28:54.006 --> 00:28:55.326
We don't need a tutorial.

00:28:55.966 --> 00:28:58.956
And so this was really
the key to that decision,

00:28:59.436 --> 00:29:03.336
key I guess is a funny
word, but it's the keyboard.

00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:07.866
But it's the real reason why we
chose to go with QWERTY because,

00:29:07.866 --> 00:29:13.976
again, we thought that
work should explain itself.

00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:18.636
So the next story, number five,
"Every Word on Every Keystroke."

00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:23.416
And so the lesson is choose the
simplest thing which might work.

00:29:24.636 --> 00:29:28.076
So continuing on
in the development

00:29:28.076 --> 00:29:31.296
of the iPhone keyboard, it
became my job to do the work

00:29:31.296 --> 00:29:32.566
to make QWERTY possible, right?

00:29:32.566 --> 00:29:37.016
We had this challenge of small
keys, difficult to tap now,

00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:40.166
and of course you all don't
care about my problems,

00:29:40.166 --> 00:29:43.426
you just want to type quickly.

00:29:43.526 --> 00:29:45.996
So the software was
going to need to help.

00:29:46.726 --> 00:29:50.236
And so the eventual solution
for that was auto correction,

00:29:50.536 --> 00:29:53.886
which is, of course, what you
meant and not what you did,

00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:57.126
taking what you did and figured
out what you meant from it.

00:29:57.716 --> 00:30:04.446
And, of course, there's quite a
bit of smart people have thought

00:30:05.046 --> 00:30:10.426
about text processing
and text prediction,

00:30:10.716 --> 00:30:14.366
and so some of the terms that
are in the state of the art,

00:30:14.366 --> 00:30:17.256
you know, then as now
Bayesian statistics

00:30:17.256 --> 00:30:19.886
and Stochastic programming,
Conditional Random Fields.

00:30:20.036 --> 00:30:24.126
And a lot of these involve
large statistical models

00:30:24.786 --> 00:30:27.856
to make them work, that they
rely on, language models.

00:30:28.386 --> 00:30:32.346
And these were not going to
be possible given the hardware

00:30:32.346 --> 00:30:34.206
and software environment
of the original iPhone.

00:30:35.036 --> 00:30:38.506
Not only that, but
I last studied math

00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:42.516
in the eleventh grade,
which was in the'80s,

00:30:42.516 --> 00:30:43.946
and it was in the early'80s.

00:30:43.946 --> 00:30:49.316
So I was kind of looking
at Stochastic programming,

00:30:49.316 --> 00:30:50.596
oh, okay, well, you know.

00:30:50.596 --> 00:30:53.166
So really what I decided was
I needed something simple

00:30:53.866 --> 00:30:55.566
because math is hard, okay?

00:30:56.516 --> 00:31:00.846
[ Applause ]

00:31:01.346 --> 00:31:07.906
And so here is a little bit
of an idea, a little bit

00:31:07.906 --> 00:31:11.406
as to how this auto
correction works, right?

00:31:11.606 --> 00:31:15.756
Certainly, in the, you know,
way back then and the first time

00:31:15.756 --> 00:31:17.906
that I tried to get
this idea together.

00:31:17.906 --> 00:31:19.636
So you're typing a letter, "I."

00:31:19.966 --> 00:31:24.766
Well, since the keys are small
maybe you meant those keys,

00:31:24.766 --> 00:31:25.306
as well.

00:31:25.306 --> 00:31:28.676
So "I" was highlighted,
but maybe you missed

00:31:28.676 --> 00:31:31.446
and maybe you meant one
of the keys around "I."

00:31:31.786 --> 00:31:35.226
Okay, and then you type a
T, and, well, similarly,

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:37.576
maybe you meant one of
those letters around it.

00:31:37.576 --> 00:31:39.376
So even just with
two characters,

00:31:39.866 --> 00:31:42.726
you can see that there are
a number of possibilities.

00:31:43.506 --> 00:31:44.246
All right.

00:31:44.246 --> 00:31:47.836
And so in one column are
words that are real words

00:31:47.836 --> 00:31:49.606
and are going to be in
an English dictionary,

00:31:50.136 --> 00:31:54.486
and in the other column there
are just those words that are -

00:31:54.556 --> 00:31:57.196
they're letter combinations,
but they're not words.

00:31:57.646 --> 00:32:02.616
We have words that, the one
column has words that are

00:32:02.616 --> 00:32:06.816
in the dictionary and the
other column has just letter

00:32:06.816 --> 00:32:08.056
combinations that aren't words.

00:32:08.376 --> 00:32:10.596
And so what do you do with this?

00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:12.356
This is now raw material, right?

00:32:12.916 --> 00:32:17.266
And so auto correction, really
ultimately sort of a big part

00:32:17.266 --> 00:32:19.736
of it, is just speculation,
you know.

00:32:19.966 --> 00:32:20.906
Did you mean this one?

00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:21.676
Did you mean that one?

00:32:21.676 --> 00:32:22.396
Did you mean the other one?

00:32:22.396 --> 00:32:23.636
Did you mean this one?

00:32:23.886 --> 00:32:25.546
And this involved many, many,

00:32:25.546 --> 00:32:28.606
many dictionary lookups
to just check.

00:32:28.606 --> 00:32:29.956
Are these letter combinations?

00:32:29.956 --> 00:32:31.456
Are these words in
the dictionary

00:32:31.456 --> 00:32:33.826
that is selected by the user?

00:32:33.856 --> 00:32:37.536
So I needed something that
worked really, really fast.

00:32:37.536 --> 00:32:42.946
And so the idea was offered to
me that, well, you could maybe

00:32:42.946 --> 00:32:44.766
as the user is typing
just kind of send

00:32:44.766 --> 00:32:48.076
that dictionary lookup stuff
on a background thread and sort

00:32:48.076 --> 00:32:49.636
of post the results
back when it's done.

00:32:49.636 --> 00:32:51.976
And, of course, being back
then we didn't have GCD,

00:32:52.296 --> 00:32:54.776
and so the Pthreads would
have been the solution.

00:32:54.776 --> 00:32:56.646
And it's like, I'm scared
of multithreaded code.

00:32:56.646 --> 00:32:58.686
It's hard; it's hard
to get right.

00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:01.816
I'll tell you a secret, it's
just like there was actually -

00:33:01.816 --> 00:33:04.406
I did have one little
bit of multithreaded code

00:33:04.656 --> 00:33:07.196
in the keyboard in the beginning
to do some initialization,

00:33:07.426 --> 00:33:09.886
and that was as large
a source of bugs -

00:33:09.886 --> 00:33:12.456
it was a tiny little piece
of code, and that was

00:33:12.456 --> 00:33:14.996
as large a source of bugs,
dealing with app startup

00:33:15.456 --> 00:33:18.936
and you launch an app and then
suspend it, it was a huge source

00:33:18.936 --> 00:33:22.796
of bugs even if it was
just a little bit of code.

00:33:23.026 --> 00:33:24.536
And so I wanted to
keep multithreading

00:33:24.676 --> 00:33:27.776
out of auto correction, which
was much more complex, right?

00:33:27.906 --> 00:33:29.616
Because I wanted us
to keep things simple

00:33:29.616 --> 00:33:31.216
because I can understand simple.

00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:35.176
All right, multithreading
is hard.

00:33:35.176 --> 00:33:37.606
I can't even like make
an egg and breakfast

00:33:37.606 --> 00:33:38.356
in the morning, right?

00:33:38.356 --> 00:33:40.836
I make the egg, make
coffee, then make the egg,

00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:41.986
keep it single threaded, right?

00:33:42.966 --> 00:33:46.016
Because otherwise I wind
up with a messy kitchen.

00:33:46.016 --> 00:33:47.666
OK, so keep it simple.

00:33:48.406 --> 00:33:51.976
So here is actually
a little algorithm

00:33:52.106 --> 00:33:53.156
for searching a dictionary.

00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:55.936
Word list on one side,

00:33:56.656 --> 00:34:00.396
and a little algorithm
on the other side.

00:34:00.696 --> 00:34:03.746
And this was actually
thought up by the same fellow

00:34:03.746 --> 00:34:05.116
who did the KHTML demo.

00:34:05.526 --> 00:34:08.956
And so he came up with that
good idea, and as part of some

00:34:08.956 --> 00:34:10.746
of our other experiments,
and, boy,

00:34:11.266 --> 00:34:13.286
I saw that good idea
and I used it.

00:34:13.476 --> 00:34:13.936
So what do you do?

00:34:13.936 --> 00:34:17.406
You have a list of words in a
dictionary, you memory map it,

00:34:17.406 --> 00:34:20.295
you iterate the list once
to find the line endings,

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.786
you store those addresses
in a pointer array,

00:34:23.036 --> 00:34:25.876
you can then binary search and
you can find whether a word is

00:34:25.876 --> 00:34:28.545
in the dictionary
really, really fast.

00:34:29.196 --> 00:34:31.466
Really, really fast, and so next

00:34:31.466 --> 00:34:33.596
after that I wrote a
custom C++ string class

00:34:33.596 --> 00:34:38.076
that could wrap any string
in that memory map area.

00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:40.626
Each of those strings were
null terminated on the end,

00:34:40.626 --> 00:34:43.176
so you could just kind of
go and wrap an address,

00:34:43.176 --> 00:34:46.896
and you have a string, as long
as you're at a line start.

00:34:46.896 --> 00:34:49.005
And so this turned out to
be really, really fast.

00:34:49.005 --> 00:34:51.766
I could check dictionary
membership in microseconds,

00:34:52.106 --> 00:34:55.036
even on the original
iPhone hardware.

00:34:55.286 --> 00:34:57.696
So this was now really,
really fast.

00:34:57.696 --> 00:35:01.116
And so what this did was
it made speculation really,

00:35:01.196 --> 00:35:05.666
really cheap, and that in turn
made auto correction possible.

00:35:05.726 --> 00:35:11.796
So I could go from this and
take all of those permutations,

00:35:11.836 --> 00:35:15.796
even for as long a word as
you might find in a language,

00:35:16.346 --> 00:35:20.726
and actually go and figure out
whether that word is going to be

00:35:20.726 --> 00:35:21.806
in the dictionary or not

00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:24.336
and whether similar
options would be as well.

00:35:24.866 --> 00:35:26.646
And this turned out
to be so fast

00:35:26.956 --> 00:35:29.626
that I stored no state
for the current word.

00:35:29.876 --> 00:35:31.426
I didn't store previous results.

00:35:31.426 --> 00:35:34.426
All I did was actually store the
string for the user's typing.

00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:38.186
If we think back here, all
I've had stored is I T.

00:35:38.646 --> 00:35:39.416
What have you typed?

00:35:39.576 --> 00:35:42.436
The actual characters
that were lit up, right?

00:35:42.436 --> 00:35:43.506
Not the neighboring ones.

00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:46.556
But the only thing
stored was the characters

00:35:46.556 --> 00:35:47.956
that were lit up, okay?

00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:49.466
So only store that string.

00:35:49.706 --> 00:35:52.396
So it's actually, I reran
the entire algorithm

00:35:52.396 --> 00:35:57.646
on every keystroke from
scratch, which means of course

00:35:57.646 --> 00:35:58.736
that it searched the
whole dictionary,

00:35:58.736 --> 00:36:01.986
70,000 plus words,
on every keystroke.

00:36:03.326 --> 00:36:06.036
Because, to me, this
was the simplest thing,

00:36:06.036 --> 00:36:07.276
as I was thinking about it,

00:36:07.276 --> 00:36:09.576
it was the simplest
thing which might work.

00:36:10.196 --> 00:36:12.696
And by coming up with
sufficiently fast

00:36:13.066 --> 00:36:15.006
implementations of this,

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:18.056
it turned out that the
simplest thing did work.

00:36:19.846 --> 00:36:21.926
Simple is often speedy,

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:26.296
and simple was something
I could understand.

00:36:26.586 --> 00:36:28.576
And when there are
bugs I could understand

00:36:28.576 --> 00:36:30.186
where those bugs
might have been,

00:36:30.846 --> 00:36:35.486
and that's every word
on every keystroke.

00:36:36.006 --> 00:36:38.646
Choose the simplest
thing which might work.

00:36:39.346 --> 00:36:41.556
And again if you're kind of
looking from the beginning

00:36:41.556 --> 00:36:44.766
of a project trying to think
to the end of a project

00:36:44.766 --> 00:36:46.706
and what you might have
when you're all done,

00:36:46.926 --> 00:36:48.246
that's why it's termed this way,

00:36:48.246 --> 00:36:49.906
choose the simplest
thing which might work.

00:36:50.096 --> 00:36:52.156
If you did actually have a
crystal ball you could tell

00:36:52.156 --> 00:36:53.476
whether maybe your
idea would work.

00:36:53.906 --> 00:36:55.626
But I think this is,
even from the beginning,

00:36:55.626 --> 00:36:57.986
if you kind of think
of the simplest thing

00:36:57.986 --> 00:37:00.716
which could possibly just
give you what you need,

00:37:01.156 --> 00:37:02.136
go with that first.

00:37:02.326 --> 00:37:04.306
I think that's a good idea.

00:37:05.226 --> 00:37:11.326
And so the next story,
number six,

00:37:12.516 --> 00:37:13.966
is "We Only Need One
of These, Right?"

00:37:14.476 --> 00:37:17.436
And the lesson is only
show your best work.

00:37:18.016 --> 00:37:22.296
And so fast forward to 2009.

00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:25.696
I joined the efforts
to develop the iPad,

00:37:26.026 --> 00:37:27.836
and the iPad needed a keyboard,

00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:31.876
and so it's by this point I had
two signs pasted onto my back -

00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:33.646
one said "Kick me,"
and the other one said

00:37:33.646 --> 00:37:34.646
"Because keyboards."

00:37:34.976 --> 00:37:42.466
So it was sort of something
that seemed to be in my area.

00:37:42.786 --> 00:37:45.636
And so I noticed that in
landscape, you turn an iPad

00:37:45.636 --> 00:37:49.176
to landscape, that the number
of keys that you could fit

00:37:49.176 --> 00:37:51.066
across the top was
close to the size

00:37:51.066 --> 00:37:52.606
of a full-sized desktop
keyboard.

00:37:53.006 --> 00:37:56.476
And so here is a representation

00:37:56.476 --> 00:38:00.346
of a full-sized desktop
keyboard, and there is the size

00:38:00.346 --> 00:38:02.486
of the keys that we
could fit on an iPad.

00:38:02.486 --> 00:38:05.006
And if you see, overlay
one on top

00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:07.836
of the other, it's pretty close.

00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:12.806
It's not exact - the iPad
is smaller - but it's close.

00:38:12.866 --> 00:38:14.656
And so I was thinking
that, hey, well, you know,

00:38:14.656 --> 00:38:16.146
it's not exactly the same size,

00:38:16.146 --> 00:38:18.346
but auto correction
could maybe help you

00:38:18.346 --> 00:38:20.046
to type comfortably, right?

00:38:21.396 --> 00:38:26.006
So, yes, big keys across the top
that seemed like a good idea.

00:38:26.386 --> 00:38:30.026
But then we also had the
question in our minds of what

00:38:30.026 --> 00:38:31.276
if you wanted more keys?

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:32.666
We now had space for them.

00:38:33.156 --> 00:38:34.286
Allocating the space

00:38:34.286 --> 00:38:37.046
on the original iPhone
keyboard was tortuous

00:38:37.046 --> 00:38:41.326
because we couldn't even
fit the period character

00:38:41.616 --> 00:38:44.396
on the first keyboard
that you saw.

00:38:44.396 --> 00:38:46.316
We had to put that onto
a secondary key point.

00:38:46.786 --> 00:38:48.376
And so we didn't
have that problem.

00:38:48.376 --> 00:38:49.916
Now we could have more keys.

00:38:49.916 --> 00:38:52.386
We had the room for them,
and so you can imagine

00:38:52.386 --> 00:38:54.456
that we can start
getting some more keys.

00:38:54.456 --> 00:38:56.916
In this case I put in
shift and caps lock and tab

00:38:56.916 --> 00:38:59.306
and a couple extra
characters off at the side.

00:38:59.646 --> 00:39:01.716
And then I direct your
attention to this here,

00:39:01.716 --> 00:39:05.666
so we would have a switch that
would allow you to go very,

00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:12.096
very quickly between the
one with the big keys

00:39:12.286 --> 00:39:16.516
and then the one
with the more keys.

00:39:16.886 --> 00:39:20.626
And sort of similar to what we
have where you change to numbers

00:39:20.626 --> 00:39:23.756
and punctuation, but this was
really keeping the letters the

00:39:23.756 --> 00:39:26.266
same and just bringing
in more keys.

00:39:27.086 --> 00:39:29.496
And so, you know, a bunch of
us who were working on this,

00:39:29.496 --> 00:39:32.386
we thought this was the
best of both worlds.

00:39:32.386 --> 00:39:34.646
It was cool, right?

00:39:35.126 --> 00:39:42.346
So I got to demo this for
Steve, which is a gulp.

00:39:42.906 --> 00:39:46.876
And so, so bringing
the iPad, you know,

00:39:46.876 --> 00:39:49.226
you kind of have the demo
room, and go in there and he's

00:39:49.226 --> 00:39:50.386
in there, and it's
like "He's in there."

00:39:50.686 --> 00:39:54.596
And then, okay, so you put
the iPad in front of him,

00:39:54.596 --> 00:39:57.816
and fortunately the
work explained itself,

00:39:58.246 --> 00:40:00.826
so the description was
as short as we're looking

00:40:00.826 --> 00:40:03.796
at iPad keyboard options
today, here are two options,

00:40:03.796 --> 00:40:05.536
press the switch key, done.

00:40:05.626 --> 00:40:07.916
So he did.

00:40:08.416 --> 00:40:09.746
He looked at the first keyboard,

00:40:09.956 --> 00:40:14.026
and he pressed the switch
key, saw the animation.

00:40:14.686 --> 00:40:16.056
He looked at the
second keyboard,

00:40:16.806 --> 00:40:20.346
he pressed the switch key again,
he saw the first one come back.

00:40:20.956 --> 00:40:23.056
A third time, presses
the switch key,

00:40:23.476 --> 00:40:27.976
sees the second one come in, and
he looks at this for a moment,

00:40:27.976 --> 00:40:30.166
and then he looks
up at me and says,

00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:35.356
"We only need one
of these, right?"

00:40:35.356 --> 00:40:36.726
And he's looking at me.

00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:43.556
And so I gulped a
couple more times.

00:40:43.556 --> 00:40:48.016
And so and he says, "Well, which
one do you think we should use?"

00:40:48.506 --> 00:40:52.626
And I said, "Well, you know,
I think we should use the one

00:40:52.626 --> 00:40:56.146
with the bigger keys because
it's just easier to type,

00:40:56.146 --> 00:40:57.916
it's close to the size of
a full-sized keyboard."

00:40:57.916 --> 00:40:59.806
And he said, "Okay,
we'll go with that one."

00:41:00.516 --> 00:41:09.696
[ Laughter & Applause ]

00:41:10.196 --> 00:41:11.426
And that was it, really.

00:41:11.426 --> 00:41:13.256
I mean that really was it.

00:41:13.256 --> 00:41:16.156
It was just quick, and so
that's why we wound up with this

00:41:16.156 --> 00:41:18.416
and then ultimately today, this.

00:41:18.546 --> 00:41:22.216
And, of course, the lesson
is only show your best work.

00:41:22.556 --> 00:41:25.966
Perhaps more than anyone
else, Steve understood this.

00:41:26.716 --> 00:41:29.586
Go out and think of all
the ideas that you can

00:41:29.586 --> 00:41:33.426
and not only just think
of the ideas, but get them

00:41:33.426 --> 00:41:35.806
and make them and
use them and live

00:41:35.806 --> 00:41:37.586
with them and think about them.

00:41:37.676 --> 00:41:41.576
And then try to figure
out which is the best one.

00:41:41.816 --> 00:41:45.186
So what was interesting
to me about that story is

00:41:45.186 --> 00:41:47.116
that even though I was
under a lot of pressure,

00:41:48.016 --> 00:41:51.176
when he asked me which one
I thought was better I knew,

00:41:51.476 --> 00:41:55.146
but I didn't have the
courage to just go in there

00:41:55.146 --> 00:41:56.706
and show him the one

00:41:56.706 --> 00:41:59.716
that I thought was really
the best the first time.

00:41:59.946 --> 00:42:03.376
It needed his extra
prodding, that little bit

00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:05.886
of extra investigation, that
little bit of extra poking

00:42:05.886 --> 00:42:07.556
to say, wait a minute, right?

00:42:07.906 --> 00:42:09.136
Which is the best one?

00:42:10.166 --> 00:42:11.506
Which is the second best one?

00:42:11.506 --> 00:42:14.506
Let's not show the
second best one, right?

00:42:14.566 --> 00:42:16.126
Only show your best work.

00:42:16.806 --> 00:42:21.996
You have to go through all of
the effort to generate lots

00:42:21.996 --> 00:42:27.286
of ideas to come up with
one that's really worth it.

00:42:28.076 --> 00:42:30.386
And that's "We Only Need
One of These, Right?"

00:42:30.736 --> 00:42:32.776
Only show your best work.

00:42:33.616 --> 00:42:40.856
Okay, story number seven,
is "Let's Try It 2% Darker,"

00:42:41.706 --> 00:42:45.036
and the lesson is iterating
quickly leads to better work.

00:42:45.526 --> 00:42:51.716
And so 2012 I joined the effort
to develop iOS 7 and, of course,

00:42:51.716 --> 00:42:57.666
as you know one of the big goals
for iOS 7 was a whole new look.

00:42:58.326 --> 00:42:59.846
And you ask the question, well,

00:42:59.976 --> 00:43:01.836
how do you make all
of these choices?

00:43:01.836 --> 00:43:04.926
And a lot of times coming up
with these new design ideas,

00:43:05.256 --> 00:43:06.996
it felt like a game
of Whac-A-Mole

00:43:07.616 --> 00:43:10.506
because every decision
affects every other decision

00:43:10.506 --> 00:43:11.946
that you make, right?

00:43:11.946 --> 00:43:14.856
You change one thing, and you
have these things over there

00:43:14.856 --> 00:43:17.286
that kind of familied well with
the thing the way it was before,

00:43:17.286 --> 00:43:19.486
and now it doesn't seem
like that, now it seems

00:43:19.486 --> 00:43:24.356
that the thing that you've just
changed doesn't really work well

00:43:24.356 --> 00:43:25.616
with everything else.

00:43:26.056 --> 00:43:29.426
And so this required a
tremendous amount of tuning,

00:43:30.026 --> 00:43:32.116
iterating and iterating
and iterating,

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:37.016
version after version,
effort after effort to try

00:43:37.016 --> 00:43:38.596
to get things so
that they all looked

00:43:38.766 --> 00:43:39.766
like they belonged together.

00:43:40.676 --> 00:43:45.116
And so if you kind of break
that down from the process

00:43:45.116 --> 00:43:49.096
of actually trying to do that
work, one design iteration most

00:43:49.096 --> 00:43:51.946
of the time looks
like this, okay?

00:43:52.486 --> 00:43:54.926
A guy, like me, will bring
a demo to the designer.

00:43:56.136 --> 00:43:57.916
The designer will have feedback.

00:43:58.346 --> 00:43:59.206
I'll take notes.

00:44:00.526 --> 00:44:03.536
I'll then go away to
make those changes

00:44:04.286 --> 00:44:05.586
that the designer has requested.

00:44:06.656 --> 00:44:11.336
Then we schedule the next demo,
and then we have that next demo,

00:44:11.336 --> 00:44:14.596
and we go back to the beginning.

00:44:14.596 --> 00:44:17.636
So this process can
take hours or days

00:44:18.316 --> 00:44:21.036
because people are busy, right?

00:44:21.036 --> 00:44:23.816
And sometimes, you know, it's
just hard to get together.

00:44:24.726 --> 00:44:27.566
And so we wanted a
way to go faster.

00:44:28.306 --> 00:44:29.686
Can we go faster?

00:44:29.686 --> 00:44:31.966
And so one of my very,
very smart friends, again,

00:44:31.966 --> 00:44:34.226
smart friends, it's a real key,

00:44:34.226 --> 00:44:35.856
one of my very smartest
friends came

00:44:35.856 --> 00:44:37.766
up with this idea of settings.

00:44:38.356 --> 00:44:39.496
And what are settings?

00:44:39.496 --> 00:44:42.226
Well, settings are
tunable values, right?

00:44:42.226 --> 00:44:45.526
You take all of the settings
that you might want to tune

00:44:45.876 --> 00:44:48.226
and put them in just an object

00:44:48.226 --> 00:44:50.106
that just is a bag
of properties.

00:44:50.586 --> 00:44:53.276
You use KVO, so that
when you change one

00:44:53.276 --> 00:44:56.966
of those properties the parts of
the system that are interested

00:44:56.966 --> 00:45:00.626
in those values changing
can know about it.

00:45:00.886 --> 00:45:02.266
She also came up
with this way to save

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:06.036
and restore these options,
and then there was also a way

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:08.016
that you could have
settings, which own settings,

00:45:08.016 --> 00:45:10.766
which own settings, so you
could have a tree of settings.

00:45:11.026 --> 00:45:12.426
And also came up
with an editing UI,

00:45:12.606 --> 00:45:14.226
and it's the editing
UI I want to show you.

00:45:14.226 --> 00:45:16.866
So here's just a very simple
example, a very simple app

00:45:17.536 --> 00:45:19.966
that lets you manipulate
geometric shapes.

00:45:20.046 --> 00:45:23.076
So I've got now one blue
circle, and you can go

00:45:23.076 --> 00:45:27.556
and with the settings UI you
can then bring up a hud right

00:45:27.556 --> 00:45:31.936
in the app, twiddle a
couple of sliders and change

00:45:31.966 --> 00:45:35.866
from one blue triangle to
three red triangles, great.

00:45:37.106 --> 00:45:39.006
And then similarly we
can go to this other one

00:45:39.006 --> 00:45:41.446
that actually support
those nested settings,

00:45:41.446 --> 00:45:44.726
that would use sort of iPhone
style, side-to-side navigation

00:45:44.726 --> 00:45:46.626
to show you the different
levels of settings.

00:45:46.906 --> 00:45:49.086
And so if I take the red
triangles and move it back

00:45:49.086 --> 00:45:52.146
to the settings for the
blue circle, you have this.

00:45:52.196 --> 00:45:53.416
And so what did this do?

00:45:53.416 --> 00:45:54.806
This did something
very important.

00:45:55.176 --> 00:45:56.816
This reduced iteration time

00:45:56.816 --> 00:46:01.046
because once you had the right
settings surfaced in the app,

00:46:01.526 --> 00:46:03.476
you could sit with the
designer, an engineer could sit

00:46:03.476 --> 00:46:06.946
with the designer, and try
many, many, many options.

00:46:07.536 --> 00:46:10.886
And so we got to the point where
you kind of tried to figure

00:46:10.886 --> 00:46:12.326
out what control
center could look like,

00:46:12.326 --> 00:46:13.556
and the designer
could say, well,

00:46:13.556 --> 00:46:15.146
what if we made it
2 percent darker?

00:46:15.146 --> 00:46:18.636
I don't even know if you can
see that up on the big screen?

00:46:18.636 --> 00:46:22.316
It's the point of it, is that
we were trying to get tuning

00:46:22.806 --> 00:46:26.356
to this level, 2 percent
darker, 2 percent darker

00:46:26.576 --> 00:46:30.046
on your left than on your right.

00:46:31.196 --> 00:46:34.066
We wanted that level
of polish and attention

00:46:34.066 --> 00:46:37.416
to every single value in the OS.

00:46:37.826 --> 00:46:40.476
So when we had a tuning
session like this, it was great

00:46:40.476 --> 00:46:45.236
because I could just go back to
my desk now, copy the defaults

00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:47.516
that got saved from
the tuning session,

00:46:47.806 --> 00:46:50.266
copy those to the new
defaults, and commit.

00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:54.696
It's great, and this made
it cheap and easy to tune;

00:46:54.696 --> 00:46:57.626
we could just do it over and
over and over and over again.

00:46:58.556 --> 00:47:01.966
And this was the way that we
wound up with just a handful

00:47:01.966 --> 00:47:03.476
of blur styles for iOS 7

00:47:03.476 --> 00:47:04.946
that are used consistently
everywhere.

00:47:05.366 --> 00:47:08.086
It was very, very difficult
to come up with those,

00:47:08.086 --> 00:47:09.476
with that set of blur styles.

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:12.496
And this is how we did it by
just iterating and iterating

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:15.226
and making iterating
easy and cheap.

00:47:15.576 --> 00:47:16.926
The lesson really, right,

00:47:16.926 --> 00:47:19.436
is iterating quickly
leads to better work.

00:47:19.546 --> 00:47:24.106
I think my experience from
iOS 7 was there was a direct

00:47:24.106 --> 00:47:29.306
correlation between how easy we
made it to try out new things

00:47:29.556 --> 00:47:32.586
and what the quality of
the final work product was.

00:47:36.996 --> 00:47:39.306
And so that's "Let's
Try 2% Darker,"

00:47:39.466 --> 00:47:48.506
and the lesson is iterating
quickly leads to better work.

00:47:48.506 --> 00:47:50.616
Okay, story number eight.

00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:54.876
Three lessons from
making this session.

00:47:55.156 --> 00:47:59.486
And so this is not
the original session.

00:48:00.196 --> 00:48:02.826
I wrote an entirely
different set of slides.

00:48:03.336 --> 00:48:05.526
And not only that.

00:48:05.526 --> 00:48:07.506
I did three full
rehearsals with them.

00:48:07.506 --> 00:48:10.006
I like to rehearse a lot
before, I mean it's important

00:48:10.036 --> 00:48:12.186
that this session
goes well for you all.

00:48:12.186 --> 00:48:13.626
You all came here, and I want

00:48:13.626 --> 00:48:15.206
to make sure they're
giving you a good product,

00:48:15.206 --> 00:48:17.356
I mean so I put a
tremendous amount of effort

00:48:17.356 --> 00:48:19.036
into preparing the
slides and rehearsing.

00:48:19.636 --> 00:48:23.386
And so with that other set of
slides I used up a big portion

00:48:23.386 --> 00:48:26.116
of my time rehearsing
that set of slides.

00:48:26.196 --> 00:48:30.506
See, the good thing was, it
was done way ahead of time.

00:48:30.626 --> 00:48:31.686
It was great.

00:48:31.686 --> 00:48:33.696
It felt good to just
be like preparing

00:48:33.696 --> 00:48:36.386
for WWDC can be really,
boy, it just always seems

00:48:36.386 --> 00:48:39.026
like everything is down to
the wire, and this year, boy,

00:48:39.026 --> 00:48:40.416
I was really ahead of time.

00:48:40.606 --> 00:48:42.986
But I had one more review
for the content that I had

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:45.476
in my slides, just go over
the material and the content,

00:48:45.476 --> 00:48:48.946
particularly because I'm talking
about some past Apple work.

00:48:48.946 --> 00:48:51.566
And it turns out, yeah, that
version just got shot down.

00:48:51.796 --> 00:48:52.946
Yeah, you can't show that.

00:48:53.556 --> 00:48:55.516
There were just issues
that couldn't be resolved.

00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:57.916
The details aren't
important, but there's kind

00:48:57.916 --> 00:49:01.556
of the one big detail which is
I don't have a session anymore.

00:49:03.436 --> 00:49:06.286
Three weeks ago I had
something that was rehearsed,

00:49:06.486 --> 00:49:12.566
and two weeks ago I didn't know
if I was going to be here today.

00:49:12.566 --> 00:49:15.336
So I needed to rewrite.

00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:17.326
And there were three
important lessons

00:49:17.326 --> 00:49:19.156
that I took away from that.

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:25.536
And the first was during this
review session, where the person

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:29.526
who I was submitting my
slides for review to,

00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:31.346
said "You can't show that."

00:49:32.656 --> 00:49:35.926
He didn't raise his voice, it's
just like "You can't show that."

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:41.766
And here's why, he gave me the
reasons, but he was very calm.

00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:47.476
And even after, I mean it was
clear, it was bad news to me,

00:49:47.896 --> 00:49:51.236
and even he found me later
and made sure that I was okay

00:49:51.516 --> 00:49:54.776
with this decision that was a
very hard one to share with me.

00:49:55.886 --> 00:50:00.706
And so the lesson from this is
be kind to people, but be honest

00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:02.046
about the work, right?

00:50:03.056 --> 00:50:07.876
There's no reason to like be
shouting and berating people

00:50:07.876 --> 00:50:10.276
who are trying hard
and doing their best.

00:50:10.596 --> 00:50:13.566
If you have ever found
me in a lab or maybe even

00:50:13.566 --> 00:50:15.086
with what little
time we have left

00:50:15.086 --> 00:50:17.356
in the conference before
it ends, if you find me

00:50:17.356 --> 00:50:22.236
in a lab today, I hope I
will do my utmost to be kind

00:50:22.236 --> 00:50:25.496
to you personally because
I'm so glad that you're here

00:50:25.496 --> 00:50:27.286
and so glad you're
contributing to our platform.

00:50:27.976 --> 00:50:29.886
And I want to see you
do great work, too.

00:50:29.886 --> 00:50:32.876
But if you show me a piece of
work, I'm going to be honest

00:50:32.876 --> 00:50:34.906
on what I think about it.

00:50:34.906 --> 00:50:36.956
And those things just
need to be kept separate,

00:50:37.106 --> 00:50:39.906
the personal kindness and
the honesty about the work.

00:50:40.276 --> 00:50:46.966
And, secondly, it's kind of
like sort of this different side

00:50:46.966 --> 00:50:47.866
of the same coin, is

00:50:47.866 --> 00:50:50.506
that I didn't take his
feedback personally.

00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:56.986
And the lesson is to separate
yourself from your work.

00:50:57.826 --> 00:51:03.576
Now and I always invest a
tremendous amount of care

00:51:03.576 --> 00:51:08.536
and emotion into my work, it's
my nature, I can't help it.

00:51:08.826 --> 00:51:12.716
But after I'm done making
something and bring it

00:51:12.716 --> 00:51:15.446
to the stage that
it's ready to demo,

00:51:15.556 --> 00:51:20.226
I just try to then divorce
myself from that thing

00:51:20.666 --> 00:51:27.126
that I just sweated over
making because that's not me,

00:51:27.406 --> 00:51:29.516
that thing that I
just made, all right?

00:51:30.316 --> 00:51:34.326
I'm ready to accept whatever
feedback anybody has and ready

00:51:34.326 --> 00:51:36.266
to go and do the
next thing, right?

00:51:37.186 --> 00:51:40.886
So you need to kind of divorce
yourself, when you get feedback,

00:51:41.266 --> 00:51:44.026
people hopefully are not
giving you the feedback,

00:51:44.056 --> 00:51:46.516
they're giving you the
feedback about the work.

00:51:47.176 --> 00:51:49.026
So separate yourself
from the work,

00:51:49.026 --> 00:51:50.956
regardless of how
much time and effort

00:51:51.296 --> 00:51:54.656
and how much investment
you have in it.

00:51:55.226 --> 00:51:58.646
And the third lesson
is, well, obviously,

00:51:58.646 --> 00:51:59.856
I needed to get back to work.

00:51:59.856 --> 00:52:03.866
If I wanted to have a
show, right, at all,

00:52:03.866 --> 00:52:08.076
I needed to figure
out how to make a set

00:52:08.076 --> 00:52:09.086
of slides that would work.

00:52:10.046 --> 00:52:11.716
And the lesson here is
that you're never done.

00:52:12.036 --> 00:52:17.656
Kind of seems like some sort
of nightmare, if you think

00:52:17.656 --> 00:52:20.246
about it one way it's that
you're never done, really?

00:52:20.636 --> 00:52:22.406
But you think about it,
no, we're never done.

00:52:22.996 --> 00:52:28.446
We loved the first version of
the iPhone when we shipped it,

00:52:28.926 --> 00:52:31.636
and then we went right back
and we made version two.

00:52:31.636 --> 00:52:34.786
And earlier this week we
showed iOS 8 and Yosemite

00:52:34.786 --> 00:52:37.046
and a whole bunch of
other great things, right?

00:52:37.046 --> 00:52:38.246
You are never done.

00:52:38.556 --> 00:52:41.686
If you're committed to
working in this industry,

00:52:41.686 --> 00:52:44.296
working in high tech,
right, you are never done.

00:52:44.296 --> 00:52:46.216
The world keeps moving;
you've got to try

00:52:46.216 --> 00:52:47.156
to keep moving with it.

00:52:47.416 --> 00:52:49.936
So do the best that you
can do at any one time.

00:52:49.936 --> 00:52:52.036
And basically you're always
shipping your latest demo,

00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:54.476
if you think about it that way,
it's just that these demos get

00:52:54.476 --> 00:52:56.546
to be very, very polished,
polished to the point

00:52:56.546 --> 00:52:58.546
where you're going
to actually share it

00:52:58.546 --> 00:53:00.606
with the rest of
the world, right?

00:53:01.706 --> 00:53:07.526
So still on this idea, this
is a quotation that's actually

00:53:07.766 --> 00:53:10.706
up on the wall -
very, very large.

00:53:10.706 --> 00:53:14.996
In Cupertino, a quote from
Steve Jobs, and he said,

00:53:14.996 --> 00:53:16.906
"If you do something and
turns out pretty good,

00:53:17.266 --> 00:53:18.916
then you should go do
something else wonderful,

00:53:18.916 --> 00:53:22.956
not dwell on it too long,
just figure out what's next."

00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:26.876
And I think this is true, not
only when you do something

00:53:26.876 --> 00:53:30.276
that turns out well, but it's
even as in the case for me,

00:53:30.276 --> 00:53:32.196
for this session, I did
something that didn't turn

00:53:32.196 --> 00:53:35.016
out so well, I needed to
figure out what was next.

00:53:35.986 --> 00:53:39.166
I could give up, or I could
try again, and I tried again,

00:53:39.366 --> 00:53:40.326
and I'm very glad that I did.

00:53:40.326 --> 00:53:41.526
I'm very happy to be here today.

00:53:41.976 --> 00:53:46.876
And so the kind of the big,
sort of joined up lesson

00:53:46.876 --> 00:53:51.066
from this section is that the
stories and lessons never end.

00:53:51.066 --> 00:53:53.396
I thought this was going to be
a session just about stories

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:56.606
and lessons and had no idea
that I had started a process

00:53:56.606 --> 00:53:58.156
that would teach
me more lessons.

00:53:58.956 --> 00:54:06.276
And so those are my
stories, and there they are.

00:54:07.376 --> 00:54:11.576
Again, and I think, I hope,

00:54:11.676 --> 00:54:15.386
at least that you found
them entertaining,

00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:21.716
but really I think the important
part is these, the lessons,

00:54:21.936 --> 00:54:24.196
that you can take out from
them, because you're never going

00:54:24.196 --> 00:54:28.966
to find yourself in exactly
the same situations that I did.

00:54:29.896 --> 00:54:32.506
But I think that you'll
find yourself in situations

00:54:32.506 --> 00:54:34.296
where you can apply some

00:54:34.296 --> 00:54:37.326
of these ideas usefully
and productively.

00:54:38.386 --> 00:54:40.656
So, again, those are my stories.

00:54:41.306 --> 00:54:45.026
And so now I ask you,
I urge you, to go out

00:54:45.026 --> 00:54:47.716
and make your own stories,
tell your own stories,

00:54:48.496 --> 00:54:50.766
extract the lessons
out from them, right?

00:54:50.966 --> 00:54:54.676
And then figure out how you're
going to use that experience

00:54:55.136 --> 00:54:57.536
to go and do some more
great work of your own.

00:54:58.046 --> 00:54:58.736
So thank you very much.

00:54:59.516 --> 00:55:07.220
