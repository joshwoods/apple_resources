WEBVTT

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:13.586
>> Hello everyone.

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:20.776
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:22.806
>> So I'm Mike Stern.

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.236
I'm a User Experience
Evangelist at Apple,

00:00:25.906 --> 00:00:27.706
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:30.026
And sticking around,
after a really long day

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:31.196
of very technical content.

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:34.736
Now, this presentation is going
to be a bit different, right?

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:35.916
This is about design.

00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:40.046
And in particular, it's about
designing intuitive interfaces.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.806
I'd like to start with
a little exercise.

00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:47.456
Imagine if you will that
you're at your house,

00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:50.696
and you're in your kitchen,
and the phone rings.

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:52.576
And the person on the other end

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:54.816
of the line has some really
exciting news for you.

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:58.516
They tell you that
you've won some money.

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:02.136
Not just a little bit of
money, but like a lot of money.

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:06.476
And they also tell you that
in order to claim your prize,

00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:10.266
you need to call a phone number.

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:14.326
And then, they hang
up the phone.

00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:18.166
And so you're sitting there
in your kitchen, and you need

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.776
to write down this phone number.

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.976
And you need to write down
this phone number before you

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:23.766
forget it.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:28.106
So you're looking around
for something to write with.

00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:30.306
Your iPhone is not
around, right?

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:32.686
And you're casting
around, and you're starting

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:34.586
to get a little panicky
because you really want

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:37.556
to remember this number, and
right before you forget it,

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:40.446
you see a pen and a piece
of paper, and you write

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:41.166
down the phone number.

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.036
So that's a pretty
simple scenario, right?

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:46.426
That was the end of
the story, by the way.

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:49.626
[Applause] Thank you, thank
you very much [laughter].

00:01:51.926 --> 00:01:54.706
So you had this very clear
objective, which was to write

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:58.526
down this phone number, and you
found a pen and a pad of paper

00:01:58.526 --> 00:02:02.146
with which to accomplish
that task, and then you wrote

00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:03.036
down the phone number.

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:04.686
And that was it.

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:09.686
Well, it's not really
quite that simple.

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:10.675
You were under pressure.

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:12.326
You were stressing
out a little bit,

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:14.856
and when you're stressed out,
that can affect your memory.

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:16.786
And it can affect your ability

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.966
to perform basic
cognitive tasks,

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:21.876
such as remembering a phone
number and writing it down.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:26.036
Or picking out a pen from
a bunch of similar objects,

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:28.226
things that look
just like a pen.

00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:31.856
And assuming that you can
remember the phone number,

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:34.696
and find the pen and
paper, and write it down,

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.206
you have to also consider,
what are all the skills

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:38.856
that are necessary
for you to write?

00:02:39.716 --> 00:02:41.426
For starters, writing
involves a lot

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:43.626
of coordination and dexterity.

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:46.516
Just ask a 3-year-old.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.616
They totally suck at
writing [laughter].

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:55.026
And so did all of you, and so
did I, when we were that age.

00:02:55.826 --> 00:03:00.056
We went from writing like
this-- to writing like that.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:04.676
Or at least something like this.

00:03:04.876 --> 00:03:07.866
Writing with a pen takes
years and years of practice,

00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:11.726
and there's all of these small
little skills that you need

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:13.016
to learn along the way.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:15.506
They're so fluid and
natural to you now,

00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:17.316
but they weren't always so easy.

00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:21.416
You had to gain the eye-hand
coordination to be able to pick

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:24.006
up and manipulate small objects.

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:28.266
And it took years to learn
how to hold a pen properly,

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.166
and position your
wrist on the table,

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:31.546
and your arm for stability.

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:34.916
You had to learn how to
draw basic letter forms.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.426
Or write along a straight line.

00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:39.386
You needed to learn the
difference between upper case

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.526
and lower case letters.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:42.096
The list goes on.

00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:46.566
But you don't think about any of
those things when you're sitting

00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:48.876
in your kitchen and writing
down that phone number.

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:56.486
All of those years of writing
with different types of pens

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.086
and pencils and markers

00:03:58.086 --> 00:04:01.676
and crayons have given
you this tremendous amount

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:02.696
of muscle memory.

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:05.536
And that muscle memory frees you

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:07.726
to remember something
like a phone number.

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:11.646
If you had to consciously
remember all

00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:14.826
of those individual skills,
it would be pretty difficult

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:21.986
for you to have accomplished
that task.

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:26.396
In other words, it's easier
for you to have written down

00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:28.666
and remembered that phone
number because the act

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.236
of writing is so intuitive.

00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:33.306
Using software is no different.

00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:37.016
The more apps behave
as we expect them to,

00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:39.316
the more intuitive
they are to us.

00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:43.286
The more intuitive apps are
to us, the easier it is for us

00:04:43.286 --> 00:04:45.426
to concentrate on
our true objectives,

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:50.056
whether that's communicating
with friends, capturing memories

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.566
of loved ones, checking
the weather,

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:55.046
or exploring the cosmos.

00:04:56.916 --> 00:05:01.376
The very best user interfaces
are so intuitive, so natural,

00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:05.216
that they just sort of
disappear, and allow us to focus

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:07.006
on what truly matters.

00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:09.636
That is what we call intuitive.

00:05:10.996 --> 00:05:16.056
So with that in mind, what
makes an app intuitive?

00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:19.476
Well, I've put together
a list of what I believe

00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:21.356
to be the top five
characteristics

00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:23.586
of intuitive user and
interface designs.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:27.046
And this is not an
exhaustive list.

00:05:27.586 --> 00:05:31.086
We could be here for hours
and hours and hours talking

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:33.386
about all of the things that
makes something intuitive.

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:35.226
We would order pizza,
get drinks,

00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:36.496
it would be a lot of fun.

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:40.666
But unfortunately, we don't
have the time for that today.

00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:43.696
This list of five things
I think are the most basic

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:45.266
and essential characteristics

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:48.076
of what makes an iOS
or Mac app intuitive.

00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:52.026
And I also want to point out up
front here that what's intuitive

00:05:52.026 --> 00:05:55.646
to one person may not be
so intuitive to others.

00:05:56.436 --> 00:06:00.126
I mean, this is intuitive
if you're an airline pilot.

00:06:00.896 --> 00:06:03.656
Every button, every switch,
every display is there

00:06:03.656 --> 00:06:05.016
for a very good reason.

00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:06.276
You know where everything is.

00:06:06.776 --> 00:06:07.686
Totally natural.

00:06:08.256 --> 00:06:13.766
I'm pretty sure this
doesn't work [laughter].

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:17.746
I also want to point out
that these are the most

00:06:17.746 --> 00:06:18.966
fundamental things.

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:20.166
The most basic things.

00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:23.066
But design is just like
anything else in life.

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:26.606
I mean, sometimes the most basic
things are the most important.

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:28.676
The most consequential.

00:06:29.826 --> 00:06:32.066
I've been designing for many
years, and I've seen time

00:06:32.066 --> 00:06:34.296
and time again, even
the most seasoned,

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:38.416
the most experienced designers,
who make poor quality designs

00:06:38.446 --> 00:06:40.646
because they've lost
sight of the fundamentals.

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:45.166
Now, in order for a
pen to be intuitive,

00:06:45.436 --> 00:06:47.336
it needs to get some
very fundamental

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:49.306
or basic things just right.

00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:55.006
It needs to be wide enough to
grip firmly, but not so wide

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:57.086
that it can't be
manipulated easily.

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:02.166
If a pen is too thin, or too
wide, it becomes intuitive

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:03.756
because we become aware of it.

00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:06.926
We're trying to think how are
we going to write with this pen?

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.176
It doesn't feel quite right.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:11.916
Or if a pen was too short,

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:15.216
we would not know how
to hold it, right?

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:17.966
We would pick it up with our
fingertips and we'd be writing

00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:19.726
with it, it'd be going
all over the place,

00:07:19.726 --> 00:07:22.446
and what we write
wouldn't look very good.

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:24.836
We'd be very conscious
of the pen itself.

00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:29.216
Or if a pen was too long,
there'd be an opposite problem.

00:07:29.286 --> 00:07:31.536
The top of the pen would be
swinging all over the place,

00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:33.746
it would feel heavy,
our hands would strain.

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:36.556
Again, we'd be very
conscious of the pen itself.

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:40.606
Designing a pen to have
the right diameter,

00:07:40.906 --> 00:07:43.836
or the right length,
seem like pretty basic

00:07:43.836 --> 00:07:45.136
and obvious things, right?

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:50.976
Yet, there are countless pen
and app designs that fail

00:07:50.976 --> 00:07:53.136
because their designers
have lost sight

00:07:53.516 --> 00:07:54.736
of these fundamentals.

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:58.506
And before we dive in, I'll
just say one more thing,

00:07:59.676 --> 00:08:02.266
which is that being intuitive
is not very intuitive.

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:04.766
It's actually pretty
difficult to do.

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:07.166
You have to understand the fact

00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:09.656
that you're not designing
just for yourself.

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:12.656
You're designing
for other people.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:16.206
And those people, they don't
know the things that you know.

00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:19.456
And they frankly probably
aren't as passionate

00:08:19.456 --> 00:08:21.006
about your app as you are.

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:24.776
So they're going to tend
to be a bit impatient,

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:27.936
easily frustrated,
fickle, right?

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:31.376
Designing an intuitive
interface isn't possible

00:08:31.376 --> 00:08:33.765
until you can get
out of your own head.

00:08:33.926 --> 00:08:36.726
You need to recognize your
own assumptions about things.

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:39.666
About who the people
you're designing for are,

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.346
what they're trying
to accomplish.

00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:43.645
What they know, what
they don't know.

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:47.946
You need to see clearly, and
you need to hear clearly,

00:08:48.826 --> 00:08:53.066
and figure out what it is that
you can do to help them succeed.

00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:57.376
If you can do that, you will
have done an amazing thing.

00:08:58.836 --> 00:09:02.556
People will appreciate the
fact that you cared enough

00:09:02.556 --> 00:09:04.436
to make a great user experience.

00:09:05.396 --> 00:09:07.356
So let's dive in, and find

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:09.196
out what the top five
characteristics are,

00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:11.976
starting with platform savvy.

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:15.476
Now, let's go back
to pens again.

00:09:15.996 --> 00:09:21.036
You see this particular
pen, but you're not going

00:09:21.036 --> 00:09:22.586
to have any trouble
writing with it,

00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:25.916
because you've used thousands
and thousands of pens before,

00:09:26.676 --> 00:09:29.376
and those experiences, writing
with all those different pens,

00:09:29.376 --> 00:09:31.726
has given you this
generalized understanding

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:33.176
of how all pens work.

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:37.196
They have shaped your
expectations, and they're going

00:09:37.196 --> 00:09:38.526
to influence your behavior.

00:09:39.836 --> 00:09:42.926
And when you pick up that
pen, and you write with it,

00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:45.746
sure enough, it works
like you expected it to.

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:48.776
And if it didn't, you'd
become frustrated.

00:09:52.516 --> 00:09:54.666
When someone uses your
app for the first time,

00:09:55.186 --> 00:09:57.756
they do so with all
sorts of expectations

00:09:57.756 --> 00:09:59.306
about how it's supposed to work.

00:09:59.306 --> 00:10:03.676
Now, these expectations
are formed and affected

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:06.596
by so many different factors,
but the most important

00:10:06.596 --> 00:10:11.266
of those is that individual's
experience using other iOS

00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:12.196
or Mac apps.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.686
Those could be ones that
were built into their device

00:10:15.686 --> 00:10:18.566
when they purchased it, or
they could be ones that many

00:10:18.566 --> 00:10:22.506
of you here today
have made for them.

00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:24.496
Now, let's just take
a look at an example.

00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:28.066
Swiping a table row to
reveal some actions.

00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:31.086
In particular, let's look
at swiping a table row

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:33.656
to reveal some kind of Delete
button or Trash button.

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:36.336
Now, we're all really
familiar with this.

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:40.516
And we first encountered it
maybe with Mail, and we thought,

00:10:40.516 --> 00:10:42.446
hey, that's kind of neat, right?

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:46.456
I don't have to go open the
E-mail to see the Trash button

00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:47.446
so that I can delete it.

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:49.156
I don't have to go into
some kind of edit mode,

00:10:49.606 --> 00:10:51.836
I can just use a gesture
to delete it right away.

00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:54.776
And after doing this
a couple of times,

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:56.736
well you got into
the habit of it.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:11:01.406
You started to learn to expect
this behavior, this interaction.

00:11:02.836 --> 00:11:05.006
Now you open Notes for
the very first time.

00:11:05.176 --> 00:11:07.606
Never seen this before,
and, you know,

00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:09.496
notes looks a little
bit different from Mail,

00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:11.066
but not completely different.

00:11:11.826 --> 00:11:12.876
There's some similarities.

00:11:13.056 --> 00:11:16.096
Like Mail, everything is
arrayed in a scrollable view,

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:19.296
and there's these little gray
lines that separate them,

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:22.136
and you know, you figure

00:11:22.136 --> 00:11:24.786
that like E-mail messages,
Notes can be deleted.

00:11:25.776 --> 00:11:30.246
So you think to yourself,
well I should be able to swipe

00:11:30.326 --> 00:11:31.656
to reveal a Delete button.

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:34.086
You don't even have
to think about it.

00:11:34.546 --> 00:11:36.436
In fact, you probably don't.

00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:40.306
You try swiping to delete,

00:11:40.306 --> 00:11:44.186
because unconsciously you
believe that it should work.

00:11:44.406 --> 00:11:45.886
Intuitively, you
think it should work.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.376
And when it does,
you're rewarded

00:11:48.376 --> 00:11:50.516
with the outcome
that you expected.

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:53.226
And if it didn't, you
would be frustrated.

00:11:53.686 --> 00:11:55.306
You would say "why
did they not do that?"

00:11:55.966 --> 00:11:57.616
It makes so much sense, right?

00:11:57.916 --> 00:12:00.736
You now have to figure out how
you're going to delete a Note.

00:12:02.026 --> 00:12:04.486
Swiping to delete is
a platform convention,

00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:06.156
and it's among thousands
and thousands

00:12:06.156 --> 00:12:07.916
of different platform
conventions

00:12:08.546 --> 00:12:10.706
that iOS users have
come to expect.

00:12:12.186 --> 00:12:14.976
And not only do they expect
swipe to delete to work

00:12:14.976 --> 00:12:17.466
in whatever situation it would
make sense for it to work,

00:12:18.056 --> 00:12:21.976
they expect every aspect
of that interaction

00:12:22.316 --> 00:12:24.546
to match their previous
experience.

00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:27.836
From the sense of
direct manipulation,

00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:31.506
to how far they need to drag
the row to reveal the buttons,

00:12:31.966 --> 00:12:34.856
maybe even the color and the
size of the button itself.

00:12:35.816 --> 00:12:39.666
Any deviations from these
things, no matter how small

00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:43.546
or insignificant, could be
incorrectly perceived by them

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:45.676
as being meaningfully different.

00:12:46.536 --> 00:12:49.276
Or maybe they just
get this vague sense

00:12:49.376 --> 00:12:50.756
that something's
not quite right.

00:12:51.966 --> 00:12:54.176
Being consistent with
platform conventions,

00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:56.206
in other words, is
a very good thing.

00:12:57.146 --> 00:13:02.286
Gestures like pinch, swipe,
pan, tap, they should work

00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:06.286
in very consistent ways, no
matter what type of app we use.

00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:10.886
Same is true for controls,
like switches or buttons,

00:13:11.966 --> 00:13:15.936
or navigation bars,
tables, and tab bars.

00:13:16.656 --> 00:13:22.596
And there are also powerful
conventions about the labels

00:13:22.596 --> 00:13:24.856
that we use to convey
certain actions,

00:13:24.856 --> 00:13:26.246
or the icons that we use.

00:13:27.076 --> 00:13:30.466
Now, this symbol may have
not been immediately familiar

00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:31.796
to you the first
time you saw it,

00:13:32.406 --> 00:13:34.666
but after you shared
something a couple of times,

00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:38.896
you started to get a sense of
what that symbol represents.

00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:42.166
You know what kind of
functionality is accessed

00:13:42.586 --> 00:13:44.146
by tapping that button.

00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:49.336
And these conventions that
exist, at least for iOS and Mac,

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:51.706
are not at all arbitrary.

00:13:53.016 --> 00:13:55.926
Swiping to delete
isn't just intuitive

00:13:55.926 --> 00:13:58.706
because of the thousands and
thousands of apps that support

00:13:58.706 --> 00:14:00.396
that same interaction.

00:14:01.186 --> 00:14:04.906
It's consistent, or
sorry, that's a part of it,

00:14:04.906 --> 00:14:06.036
but it's not the whole story.

00:14:06.036 --> 00:14:08.186
It's intuitive to
us because it's

00:14:08.186 --> 00:14:11.786
like the real-world experiences
that we all share together.

00:14:12.596 --> 00:14:15.656
It's like crossing something
off of a list, or you know,

00:14:15.656 --> 00:14:17.366
being a 2-year-old
and eating food

00:14:17.366 --> 00:14:18.746
and swiping it out of your way.

00:14:18.746 --> 00:14:20.996
Right? You don't want it
anymore, so you're going

00:14:20.996 --> 00:14:22.706
to swipe to get rid of it.

00:14:23.416 --> 00:14:26.526
There is countless, countless
conventions that exist

00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:29.016
for any platform for
which you're designing,

00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:31.936
and it's important to recognize
what those conventions are,

00:14:32.186 --> 00:14:35.026
because that's what
people are going to expect.

00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:39.686
But sometimes it's necessary
to break those conventions.

00:14:40.586 --> 00:14:42.766
Now, this is actually
not that common,

00:14:43.196 --> 00:14:47.546
but maybe you're designing an
app that's never existed before.

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:49.236
A new type of experience.

00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:51.636
Or you're designing
for a new type of user,

00:14:51.636 --> 00:14:53.506
a new type of scenario,
or context?

00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:57.006
Maybe you're just trying
to solve a problem that we,

00:14:57.006 --> 00:15:00.176
at Apple, or other, you
guys have never tried

00:15:00.176 --> 00:15:01.576
to solve before, right?

00:15:01.576 --> 00:15:03.236
So there is no precedent
to follow.

00:15:03.926 --> 00:15:07.876
Now, if that's the case for
you, you have a responsibility

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:12.196
to tell people, to inform
them that you have decided

00:15:12.196 --> 00:15:14.766
to do something different
with your app.

00:15:15.696 --> 00:15:17.396
Now, let's take a
look at an example.

00:15:18.166 --> 00:15:19.236
This is Leo's Fortune.

00:15:19.236 --> 00:15:21.106
We saw that it won
ADA yesterday.

00:15:21.996 --> 00:15:24.266
That's Leo, up there,
on the wooden scale.

00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:27.046
Now, as you can see,
there's only one button

00:15:27.046 --> 00:15:28.356
on the screen, the Pause button.

00:15:28.356 --> 00:15:31.006
Everything else is
done through gestures.

00:15:31.606 --> 00:15:33.976
And these gestures,
they're intuitive,

00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:35.386
but they're not standard.

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:36.716
They're not really obvious.

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:39.646
So the game provides
instruction.

00:15:39.646 --> 00:15:41.676
It teaches you about
them one at a time.

00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:44.636
You use your left thumb
to move left and right

00:15:44.636 --> 00:15:46.276
so that he moves
forward and backwards.

00:15:46.866 --> 00:15:49.976
Or you swipe up your
right thumb to inflate Leo

00:15:49.976 --> 00:15:53.096
so that he can hop over
obstacles like this ledge.

00:15:54.156 --> 00:15:57.656
These are non-standard
interactions and the developers

00:15:57.656 --> 00:16:01.036
of this game knew that they had
to educate people about them,

00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:03.256
or else players would
be confused,

00:16:03.256 --> 00:16:04.666
and they would become
frustrated,

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.416
quit and delete the game.

00:16:06.816 --> 00:16:08.966
Wouldn't be a very good
experience for them.

00:16:10.186 --> 00:16:13.006
Now, that's all I'm going to
say when it comes to onboarding

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:16.576
and help today, because we
have an entire hour dedicated

00:16:16.576 --> 00:16:17.226
to this topic.

00:16:17.786 --> 00:16:19.666
It's a really great
presentation,

00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:21.986
and I encourage everyone
here to go.

00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:24.896
It's Thursday, in the Mission.

00:16:25.396 --> 00:16:26.636
I'll see you there.

00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:32.186
The next characteristic of
intuitive user interfaces is

00:16:32.976 --> 00:16:34.796
that they're easy to navigate.

00:16:36.216 --> 00:16:39.866
Now, intuitive navigation
systems do three things

00:16:40.126 --> 00:16:40.816
really well.

00:16:41.556 --> 00:16:44.016
First, they just tell
you where you are.

00:16:45.176 --> 00:16:49.356
The clock app, with its tab bar,
does a really good job of that.

00:16:49.536 --> 00:16:52.376
Makes it perfectly clear
what your location is.

00:16:52.996 --> 00:16:55.806
And I'm sorry it's so low on the
screen, I know everyone is going

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:57.576
to have to crane their
necks in order to see it.

00:16:59.246 --> 00:17:00.916
Now apps that use
a Navigation Bar

00:17:00.916 --> 00:17:03.476
and have a title also
do a really good job

00:17:03.476 --> 00:17:04.506
of telling you where you are.

00:17:04.506 --> 00:17:06.156
The title serves that purpose.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.976
The next thing that
they do is they show you

00:17:08.976 --> 00:17:10.356
where else you could go.

00:17:11.256 --> 00:17:12.866
They show you what
your options are.

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.715
So the phone app,
again with a tab bar,

00:17:15.715 --> 00:17:16.766
does a very good job of it.

00:17:16.766 --> 00:17:19.496
It just means having everything
on screen and visible.

00:17:19.896 --> 00:17:20.425
Pretty simple.

00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:25.205
And the third thing that they
do is they explain what's there.

00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:29.786
Meaning the navigation
system informs you

00:17:29.786 --> 00:17:32.326
about what's contained
within each section.

00:17:32.326 --> 00:17:34.716
You don't have to go
to every single section

00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:35.946
to figure out what's inside.

00:17:37.316 --> 00:17:39.496
So let's take a step
back for a second, right?

00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:42.766
Why do we need navigation
to begin with?

00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:47.056
We need navigation because
there's way too much information

00:17:47.056 --> 00:17:49.946
and functionality in
any given app to display

00:17:49.946 --> 00:17:52.056
on screen at one point in time.

00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:56.176
So we group things together.

00:17:56.376 --> 00:18:01.236
Make these categories, or
sections, and these categories

00:18:01.236 --> 00:18:05.286
that we come up with, they need
to be understandable and logical

00:18:05.346 --> 00:18:07.176
to people who are
using your app.

00:18:08.386 --> 00:18:12.656
It shouldn't feel like a mystery
what's behind or what's inside

00:18:12.986 --> 00:18:15.146
of each of these
category labels.

00:18:15.146 --> 00:18:20.806
So the phone app succeeds
because each of these icons

00:18:20.806 --> 00:18:24.986
and labels that's used makes the
content inside self-explanatory.

00:18:24.986 --> 00:18:27.676
Meaning, it provides a good
explanation of what types

00:18:27.676 --> 00:18:31.136
of key information or
functionality is contained

00:18:31.136 --> 00:18:36.206
within each section of the app.

00:18:36.476 --> 00:18:40.406
So in other words, intuitive
navigation systems answer three

00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:41.506
basic questions.

00:18:42.136 --> 00:18:42.956
Where am I?

00:18:44.216 --> 00:18:45.336
Where else can I go?

00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:48.416
And what will I find
when I get there?

00:18:49.536 --> 00:18:51.996
Now, these seem like
really basic things, right?

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:53.356
Everyone here is
kind of smirking,

00:18:53.356 --> 00:18:54.926
it's like totally obvious.

00:18:55.696 --> 00:18:58.556
But it turns out that
designing a navigation system

00:18:58.556 --> 00:19:02.266
that can accomplish these
three things well is pretty

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:03.486
challenging to make.

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.686
So with that in mind, I
have a few tips for you

00:19:06.686 --> 00:19:09.696
about how you can make
your navigation system

00:19:09.996 --> 00:19:10.866
really intuitive.

00:19:11.406 --> 00:19:13.276
Starting with progressive
disclosure.

00:19:13.276 --> 00:19:16.426
Now, if you're not familiar

00:19:16.426 --> 00:19:18.616
with what this term
is, it's pretty simple.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.746
It just means not
showing things to people

00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:24.386
until they actually need it.

00:19:24.656 --> 00:19:28.476
Now, you do that by kind
of creating a little bit

00:19:28.476 --> 00:19:32.176
of a deeper hierarchy, or adding
a few more steps in a process.

00:19:33.306 --> 00:19:35.436
Now this seems like it
might take more time to get

00:19:35.436 --> 00:19:38.046
to your destination,
or get the outcome

00:19:38.046 --> 00:19:40.556
that you're after,
but it's worth it.

00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:44.646
Because it makes decision making
simple and un-intimidating

00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:46.226
at every stage of the process.

00:19:46.736 --> 00:19:48.486
So ultimately, you're
able to get

00:19:48.486 --> 00:19:51.676
to your destination more
quickly and more confidently.

00:19:52.706 --> 00:19:55.436
Unless, that is, you
use category names

00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:58.396
that aren't logical,
or not meaningful.

00:19:59.446 --> 00:20:01.906
So in this situation, if
you're reading the slide,

00:20:01.906 --> 00:20:04.016
we're picking a mode of
transportation for getting

00:20:04.016 --> 00:20:05.776
from one place to another.

00:20:06.436 --> 00:20:08.276
And if we're doing
that, the first choice

00:20:08.276 --> 00:20:10.356
that we have is do
you want to go by air

00:20:10.356 --> 00:20:11.616
or do you want to go by land?

00:20:12.126 --> 00:20:14.376
Now, that makes a
lot of sense, right?

00:20:14.376 --> 00:20:16.616
Those things are kind of
mutually exclusive choices.

00:20:17.386 --> 00:20:20.986
And these labels are pretty good
because if we're going to go

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:24.096
by air, we figure
that one of the items

00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:27.956
in that category is going to
be a choice to go by airplane.

00:20:28.676 --> 00:20:32.106
Or if we're going by land, we're
going to have the options to go

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:33.776
by car or maybe by rail.

00:20:34.446 --> 00:20:36.586
We don't know all of the choices
that are contained inside,

00:20:36.586 --> 00:20:37.956
but we get an inkling.

00:20:38.176 --> 00:20:39.266
We get an understanding

00:20:39.266 --> 00:20:41.306
about what things
are contained within.

00:20:42.296 --> 00:20:45.786
Now, if we decide to go by
land, we get the second choice.

00:20:46.326 --> 00:20:49.556
This is a disastrous
set of labels for us.

00:20:50.586 --> 00:20:54.936
Now, we can go take a mode of
transportation that uses fuel,

00:20:54.936 --> 00:20:57.346
or it doesn't use
fuel, but now all

00:20:57.346 --> 00:20:58.396
of a sudden we're
thinking about,

00:20:58.396 --> 00:21:01.336
well okay a car uses fuel.

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:07.036
But if I want to take a
train, does that use fuel?

00:21:07.746 --> 00:21:10.216
I mean, it's like, steam power?

00:21:10.566 --> 00:21:12.356
Fuel? Or coal?

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:14.506
Right? What if it's electric?

00:21:14.616 --> 00:21:17.136
What if I'm taking
light rail, you know?

00:21:17.136 --> 00:21:19.486
Maybe that's no fuel, I
mean it's electricity,

00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:21.326
but it could be solar powered,

00:21:21.326 --> 00:21:23.546
or wind powered,
or nuclear powered.

00:21:24.126 --> 00:21:26.396
Instead of getting to where
I want to go, I'm asking all

00:21:26.396 --> 00:21:29.896
of these esoteric questions
about the nature of fuel

00:21:29.896 --> 00:21:31.806
and the meaning of
that word, right?

00:21:31.946 --> 00:21:33.406
These are not very good labels.

00:21:34.046 --> 00:21:36.276
That uncertainty is
causing hesitation,

00:21:36.276 --> 00:21:39.766
and it's making me aware
of the interface itself

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:41.086
and trying to decode it.

00:21:42.126 --> 00:21:45.206
Again, use progressive
disclosure, but make sure

00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:47.486
that it doesn't feel like
you're trying to figure

00:21:47.486 --> 00:21:48.956
out what's behind door number 3.

00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:53.836
Now, the next tip I have
is about being predictable.

00:21:54.826 --> 00:21:56.546
Everyone likes surprises, right?

00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.986
Except when it comes
to navigation.

00:21:59.346 --> 00:22:01.856
With navigation, we
do not like surprises.

00:22:02.646 --> 00:22:06.086
When navigation changes on
us unexpectedly and in ways

00:22:06.086 --> 00:22:08.536
that we can't explain
or rationalize,

00:22:09.196 --> 00:22:11.396
we can get really
confused and tripped up.

00:22:12.376 --> 00:22:14.756
So let's take a look
at how this can happen.

00:22:15.596 --> 00:22:17.806
So let's say we're making
a banking app, right?

00:22:17.806 --> 00:22:20.386
And we have a few
choices to select from.

00:22:20.996 --> 00:22:23.966
And then once we
register and then log in,

00:22:24.406 --> 00:22:26.196
there's a few other
sections that are added.

00:22:26.516 --> 00:22:29.346
So the navigation has changed,
but I guess I can explain

00:22:29.346 --> 00:22:32.126
to myself why things changed
in the way that they did.

00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:34.706
Or maybe the bank
decides they're going

00:22:34.706 --> 00:22:38.536
to add this awesome new feature
of giving away free cash, right?

00:22:38.796 --> 00:22:40.236
I want to bank at this bank.

00:22:40.696 --> 00:22:41.746
This is a great feature.

00:22:42.646 --> 00:22:43.696
So they put it right at the top,

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:45.176
because they think their
customers are really going

00:22:45.176 --> 00:22:45.576
to love it.

00:22:45.956 --> 00:22:48.616
But then someone comes to
their senses and decides

00:22:48.616 --> 00:22:50.736
that they're not going to be
able to give away that feature

00:22:51.126 --> 00:22:53.966
of free cash much longer,
so they de-emphasize it

00:22:53.966 --> 00:22:56.136
and they reduce its
visibility in the list

00:22:56.136 --> 00:22:57.336
by pushing it to the bottom.

00:22:57.896 --> 00:22:59.146
So it's changed.

00:23:00.186 --> 00:23:03.066
Or let's say we looked at
the analytics of the app,

00:23:03.066 --> 00:23:05.426
and we've talked to all the
people who are using it,

00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:07.686
and we figured out that
people really want mostly

00:23:08.226 --> 00:23:11.096
to find locations or figure
out how to contact the bank,

00:23:11.096 --> 00:23:12.646
so we move that stuff
to the top.

00:23:13.596 --> 00:23:17.036
Now there's hundreds of reasons
why navigation can change.

00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:20.566
Some of them are good, some of
them are bad or just terrible,

00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:22.336
but whatever the reason is,

00:23:22.336 --> 00:23:27.286
there's always this downside
retraining people on how

00:23:27.286 --> 00:23:30.366
to do something that they're
familiar with, takes time,

00:23:30.366 --> 00:23:32.066
and it can be really
frustrating for people.

00:23:32.496 --> 00:23:34.176
I mean I think we've
all had this experience

00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:36.426
where we've been going to
like a website or using an app

00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:39.516
for a very long period of time,
and then it was redesigned,

00:23:40.256 --> 00:23:41.636
and all of a sudden
we're thrown off.

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:43.986
We have to study the
interface and figure

00:23:43.986 --> 00:23:45.376
out where things went to.

00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:47.056
We had just been used

00:23:47.056 --> 00:23:49.006
to pressing the red
thing over there, right?

00:23:49.006 --> 00:23:51.886
We weren't even reading
the label, and now we have

00:23:51.886 --> 00:23:54.216
to study it, and figure
out where that went to.

00:23:54.756 --> 00:23:57.366
Even the smallest changes
can really trip people up.

00:23:58.016 --> 00:24:00.596
So by all means, change your
interface when you need to,

00:24:01.016 --> 00:24:03.436
but do it carefully, and
don't do it frequently.

00:24:04.856 --> 00:24:08.226
Now, the next point
is really obvious.

00:24:08.826 --> 00:24:10.876
But it's worth talking
about anyway,

00:24:11.286 --> 00:24:14.886
and that is that selection
needs to be immediately obvious.

00:24:15.666 --> 00:24:20.166
On iOS tab bars, for example,
we use color to show selection.

00:24:21.596 --> 00:24:22.596
And we also use shape.

00:24:23.446 --> 00:24:24.556
So on the left-hand side,

00:24:24.556 --> 00:24:26.776
you can see sometimes
icons get filled in,

00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:28.676
and on the right
side you can see

00:24:28.676 --> 00:24:29.796
that sometimes they get thicker.

00:24:30.966 --> 00:24:33.526
Now part of the reason for
this is that it makes it easier

00:24:33.526 --> 00:24:36.126
to show the selection color,
to see the selection color,

00:24:36.996 --> 00:24:38.166
but there's another reason

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:40.666
for using a thicker
or filled in shape.

00:24:41.556 --> 00:24:43.846
So let's take a look
at the clock app again.

00:24:44.546 --> 00:24:46.706
Now we can all see, unless
you're sitting in the back,

00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:48.806
that the world's
clock is selected.

00:24:48.806 --> 00:24:51.146
It's very obvious right?

00:24:51.146 --> 00:24:54.316
Well let's say we
didn't have enough time

00:24:54.316 --> 00:24:57.276
to design a totally different
set of icons for the active

00:24:57.276 --> 00:25:01.576
or selected state, so instead,
we just use the off state,

00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:05.146
but we tinted it red, and we
put that into the interface.

00:25:06.256 --> 00:25:07.936
Well, right off the
bat, you can see

00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:10.116
that selection is
a lot less obvious.

00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:13.726
And it's really not obvious
if you're color blind.

00:25:14.856 --> 00:25:16.776
Now, just as a common practice,

00:25:16.776 --> 00:25:18.326
something to always
remember to do.

00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:20.216
Take screen shots of your app,

00:25:20.276 --> 00:25:22.446
bring them into the graphic
design tool of your choice,

00:25:22.726 --> 00:25:24.766
and desaturate them,
and make sure

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:27.826
that you can still clearly
see state and selection.

00:25:28.056 --> 00:25:29.916
This is a really
important thing to do.

00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:34.846
With the filled in tab bar icon,
it's still at least possible

00:25:35.196 --> 00:25:38.096
to see what selection,
if the color red looks

00:25:38.096 --> 00:25:39.726
like gray to you [applause].

00:25:43.606 --> 00:25:48.466
See. And even if you
can see every color

00:25:48.466 --> 00:25:50.036
of the spectrum just fine,

00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:53.996
using a filled-in shape
makes selection more obvious

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:55.176
for all of us.

00:25:55.726 --> 00:25:57.896
This is a case of doing the
right thing for accessibility

00:25:57.896 --> 00:26:00.266
and improving the
experience for everyone.

00:26:00.786 --> 00:26:03.836
Next, navigation systems

00:26:03.836 --> 00:26:07.026
that are intuitive
maximize continuity.

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:10.636
Now, in a profession,
in a world of UI Design,

00:26:10.706 --> 00:26:12.866
we use this word
flow all the time.

00:26:13.556 --> 00:26:17.446
And all it really means is this
is the experience of moving

00:26:17.446 --> 00:26:19.176
from one place to another.

00:26:19.266 --> 00:26:20.806
One view to the next.

00:26:20.806 --> 00:26:22.736
One state to a different state,

00:26:22.736 --> 00:26:24.216
or section to a different
section.

00:26:25.266 --> 00:26:30.356
And intuitive navigation
system is designed

00:26:30.566 --> 00:26:35.656
to minimize disruption,
or maximize continuity,

00:26:35.756 --> 00:26:38.416
by keeping people
oriented, as they flow

00:26:38.416 --> 00:26:39.556
through the experience.

00:26:40.586 --> 00:26:41.706
So let's take an example.

00:26:42.026 --> 00:26:43.536
This is the photos app for iOS.

00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:46.986
And here we're looking at a
grid of photos, and when we tap

00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:50.716
on one of those photos, it
zooms up, fills the screen.

00:26:51.496 --> 00:26:53.606
And this is really
important for usability,

00:26:53.606 --> 00:26:56.186
because without having
to think about it,

00:26:56.186 --> 00:26:58.896
you know that the
photo you tapped

00:26:58.896 --> 00:27:00.906
on is the one now
you're looking at.

00:27:01.246 --> 00:27:03.856
You get that instantaneous
confirmation, again,

00:27:03.856 --> 00:27:05.026
without having to
think about it.

00:27:05.566 --> 00:27:09.596
And the animation to go back
is just the opposite, reversed.

00:27:10.566 --> 00:27:13.596
And this is also important for
the usability of the photos app,

00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:16.836
because now you're back in the
grid view, and you know exactly

00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:19.046
which photo you had just been
looking at, so you know how

00:27:19.046 --> 00:27:23.106
to proceed forward or backward
from that specific photo.

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:26.446
Now, if this animation
had been done differently,

00:27:27.466 --> 00:27:31.276
instead we tapped on the
photo, and the big photo slid

00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:33.716
in from the right, we
wouldn't have the benefit

00:27:33.716 --> 00:27:35.716
of that continuous experience.

00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:38.836
We would have to remember
which, what the photo looked

00:27:38.836 --> 00:27:41.176
at that we wanted to look
at, and then compare it

00:27:41.176 --> 00:27:42.576
with the image we're
now looking at.

00:27:42.576 --> 00:27:45.006
And the same is true
when we go back.

00:27:45.006 --> 00:27:47.566
We have to remember what that
photo we were just looking

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:50.246
at looked like, and compare it
to the photos in the grid view.

00:27:51.106 --> 00:27:54.226
Now, this is a very simple
UI animation concept.

00:27:55.196 --> 00:27:57.826
But it's a powerful one,
and it's used in all sorts

00:27:57.826 --> 00:27:59.536
of different iOS
apps that we make,

00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:03.286
as well as on the
home screen itself.

00:28:04.236 --> 00:28:09.076
And, what's more, is we use
it all over the place on OS X

00:28:09.186 --> 00:28:11.806
as well, for the
very same reasons.

00:28:16.216 --> 00:28:22.016
Okay. The next tip is
about providing hints.

00:28:22.696 --> 00:28:24.966
Provide hints to
people when they seem

00:28:24.966 --> 00:28:26.636
to be getting confused.

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:28.946
This is the app, Sky Guide.

00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:31.296
Again, also won at
ADA yesterday.

00:28:32.556 --> 00:28:34.256
And it provides information

00:28:34.256 --> 00:28:35.916
about the entire
universe, right?

00:28:35.916 --> 00:28:39.266
You get to see detailed
information about Betelgeuse,

00:28:39.266 --> 00:28:42.996
and countless other
solar bodies that exist.

00:28:43.236 --> 00:28:45.476
Now, you may think
that the way you get

00:28:45.476 --> 00:28:48.556
that information is just
by tapping on a star.

00:28:49.016 --> 00:28:50.096
That's pretty logical.

00:28:50.096 --> 00:28:51.706
That's pretty intuitive, right?

00:28:51.956 --> 00:28:53.736
That's how you get
information about something

00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:55.136
in just about any app.

00:28:55.976 --> 00:28:56.876
But if you thought that,

00:28:57.246 --> 00:29:00.146
you would be 100 percent
completely and totally wrong.

00:29:01.226 --> 00:29:03.536
The real way that you get
information about a star is

00:29:03.576 --> 00:29:05.846
by pressing the i button
over on the right-hand side

00:29:05.846 --> 00:29:06.506
of the screen.

00:29:07.306 --> 00:29:09.566
But if that i button was just
sitting there the whole time,

00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:12.076
well, you wouldn't know
what it represented.

00:29:12.076 --> 00:29:14.006
You might think it's
just general information

00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:18.226
about the app itself, or you
know, like the cosmos, right?

00:29:19.596 --> 00:29:23.416
So to clarify that for
people, Sky Guide does a couple

00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:26.006
of very simple things with
animation to help you out.

00:29:26.666 --> 00:29:30.706
When you select a star,
when you select a star,

00:29:31.816 --> 00:29:34.326
the i button fades in and
it pulses a little bit,

00:29:34.576 --> 00:29:35.886
just draws your attention to it.

00:29:35.886 --> 00:29:39.616
And when you de-select the
star, it just fades out.

00:29:40.246 --> 00:29:43.646
And that gives you
this understanding

00:29:43.646 --> 00:29:45.546
that there is a relationship
between the star

00:29:45.546 --> 00:29:47.326
that you have selected
and the info button.

00:29:48.416 --> 00:29:49.216
It's very effective.

00:29:49.456 --> 00:29:50.156
Very subtle.

00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:52.046
I mean you're not necessarily
even thinking about that.

00:29:52.046 --> 00:29:56.286
And what's even cooler than
that, is that if you happen

00:29:56.286 --> 00:29:59.616
to think that double tapping
a star will also give you

00:29:59.616 --> 00:30:02.046
information about
the star, as I did,

00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:06.286
then the i button will just
keep pulsing every time you tap

00:30:06.286 --> 00:30:07.056
on that star.

00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:10.436
So it's elegantly
redirecting your attention back

00:30:10.436 --> 00:30:13.566
over to the i button,
because they can infer

00:30:13.566 --> 00:30:15.306
by how you're interacting
with the app

00:30:15.756 --> 00:30:18.056
that that's what your intention
is, is to get information

00:30:18.056 --> 00:30:22.216
about the star, and they're
retraining you, redirecting you.

00:30:23.366 --> 00:30:26.976
Okay. And the last and
probably most important tip

00:30:26.976 --> 00:30:30.506
that I have is that
less is more.

00:30:31.756 --> 00:30:35.566
Picking between a smaller
number of choices is faster,

00:30:35.566 --> 00:30:38.766
and easier, than picking from
a larger number of choices.

00:30:38.766 --> 00:30:41.916
I told you I would say a lot of
really dumb and obvious things.

00:30:42.916 --> 00:30:45.956
Now giving people too many
choices can slow them down,

00:30:45.956 --> 00:30:47.136
and it can be intimidating.

00:30:47.656 --> 00:30:50.196
You might think that
you're impressing people

00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:52.786
who are using your app with
how feature-rich your app is.

00:30:53.806 --> 00:30:55.506
But their takeaway
may be very different.

00:30:55.506 --> 00:30:58.306
They may think that your app
is too much for their needs,

00:30:58.306 --> 00:30:59.596
or just too intimidating.

00:31:00.136 --> 00:31:05.076
And when we see a long list like
this, I mean, we all know this.

00:31:05.076 --> 00:31:06.436
We start to skim over things.

00:31:07.226 --> 00:31:09.706
We don't want to spend hours
and hours looking at this app.

00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:12.406
So we're just going to
glance down really quickly.

00:31:12.676 --> 00:31:16.366
But when we do that, inevitably,
we wind up skipping over things.

00:31:16.366 --> 00:31:18.656
And the things that we skip

00:31:18.656 --> 00:31:22.756
over may very well have been the
things that we wanted to select.

00:31:24.046 --> 00:31:26.226
Which means that if we're
skipping over the stuff

00:31:26.226 --> 00:31:28.026
that we wanted to
select, that the people

00:31:28.026 --> 00:31:31.246
who are using your app are
not getting what they want

00:31:31.246 --> 00:31:31.716
out of it.

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:34.666
They're not realizing
your app's full potential.

00:31:35.516 --> 00:31:38.156
And if you can't limit
the number of choices

00:31:38.156 --> 00:31:40.556
that you're offering
to people, again,

00:31:41.036 --> 00:31:44.706
use progressive disclosure to
help keep decision making simple

00:31:45.116 --> 00:31:49.516
and unintimidating at
every step in the process.

00:31:49.626 --> 00:31:53.096
Now, that's a lot
about navigation.

00:31:53.246 --> 00:31:55.156
And I promise I'm going to
talk about other things.

00:31:55.826 --> 00:31:57.796
But I feel like I
would be remiss

00:31:57.896 --> 00:32:00.966
if I didn't use this
opportunity to talk with you

00:32:02.096 --> 00:32:03.196
about hamburger menus.

00:32:09.906 --> 00:32:14.576
[Laughter & Applause] AKA
Slide out menus, AKA sidebars,

00:32:14.576 --> 00:32:18.246
AKA basements, AKA drawers.

00:32:20.016 --> 00:32:23.636
Now, these controls
are very common on iOS,

00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:25.266
and on other platforms.

00:32:26.426 --> 00:32:30.176
And I'm sure many of you here
work on apps that have these.

00:32:30.316 --> 00:32:32.206
You guys made the decision
to put it in your app.

00:32:32.946 --> 00:32:34.166
And I'm sure that you did

00:32:34.166 --> 00:32:36.206
so with the very
best of intentions.

00:32:36.786 --> 00:32:41.966
And I will say that these
controls do a couple

00:32:41.966 --> 00:32:42.926
of things very well.

00:32:43.276 --> 00:32:46.506
For one thing, they save space.

00:32:47.306 --> 00:32:49.636
So rather than taking up a
bunch of room at the bottom

00:32:49.636 --> 00:32:52.126
of the screen for a tab
bar, you're just taking

00:32:52.126 --> 00:32:53.986
up a little bit of area
in the top left corner

00:32:53.986 --> 00:32:55.166
for the hamburger menu.

00:32:55.766 --> 00:33:01.806
And you practically have the
entire height of the screen

00:33:02.086 --> 00:33:05.556
to show options to people,
and if that's not enough,

00:33:06.046 --> 00:33:07.976
you're going to cram more
awesomeness into your app,

00:33:08.546 --> 00:33:10.986
people can scroll, right.

00:33:14.936 --> 00:33:15.896
But --

00:33:16.516 --> 00:33:26.756
[ Laughter & Applause ]

00:33:27.256 --> 00:33:28.906
this is-- I actually
haven't played

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:31.276
around with the latest version
of Xcode, so I really hope

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:32.356
that they haven't changed this,

00:33:34.306 --> 00:33:37.286
I don't believe you'll find a
hamburger menu controller inside

00:33:37.286 --> 00:33:37.786
of Xcode [laughter].

00:33:38.446 --> 00:33:42.126
Now, typically we don't provide
design advice about the things

00:33:42.126 --> 00:33:46.476
that we don't offer to you guys,
but I can't help myself, right?

00:33:46.476 --> 00:33:49.386
I've had so many conversations
with people about this control,

00:33:49.766 --> 00:33:52.106
spending hours and hours
and hours talking about it,

00:33:52.576 --> 00:33:54.456
and you know, I think
it's important

00:33:54.456 --> 00:33:55.666
that we talk about
it here today.

00:33:56.666 --> 00:33:58.656
And again, I'm not going to
say that there's no place

00:33:58.656 --> 00:34:00.366
for these controls
categorically.

00:34:00.896 --> 00:34:02.926
I think there are some apps
that could maybe use one.

00:34:03.616 --> 00:34:06.956
But I will say that their
value is greatly over-stated,

00:34:07.396 --> 00:34:10.386
and they have huge
usability downsides too.

00:34:11.746 --> 00:34:14.116
Remember, the three key things

00:34:14.116 --> 00:34:17.235
about an intuitive navigation
system is that they tell you

00:34:17.235 --> 00:34:19.795
where you are, and they show
you where else you can go.

00:34:20.616 --> 00:34:23.335
Hamburger menus are terrible
at both of those things,

00:34:23.676 --> 00:34:25.755
because the menu is
not on the screen.

00:34:25.996 --> 00:34:26.846
It's not visible.

00:34:26.846 --> 00:34:29.136
Only the button to
display the menu is.

00:34:30.156 --> 00:34:32.795
And in practice,
talking to developers,

00:34:33.186 --> 00:34:34.676
they found this out themselves.

00:34:35.266 --> 00:34:38.346
That people who use
their app don't switch

00:34:38.456 --> 00:34:40.295
to different sections
very frequently

00:34:41.466 --> 00:34:42.525
when they use this menu.

00:34:43.216 --> 00:34:45.136
And the reason for that
is because the people

00:34:45.136 --> 00:34:47.856
who use their app don't
know where else they can go.

00:34:48.255 --> 00:34:51.716
Right? They don't know because
they can't see the options,

00:34:51.716 --> 00:34:53.356
or maybe they saw it
at one point in time,

00:34:53.666 --> 00:34:54.916
but they have since forgotten.

00:34:55.456 --> 00:34:59.086
And if you use this control,
you have to recognize

00:34:59.116 --> 00:35:02.706
that the people who use your
app may not realize the full

00:35:02.706 --> 00:35:04.306
potential of your app.

00:35:06.116 --> 00:35:09.506
Hamburger menus are also
just tedious, right?

00:35:10.176 --> 00:35:13.046
If you want to switch
sections from the Accounts tab

00:35:13.326 --> 00:35:16.826
to the Transfers tab, all you
need to do is tap the button

00:35:16.986 --> 00:35:19.646
and you're there instantly,
and if you want to go back,

00:35:20.036 --> 00:35:22.056
you tap the Accounts
button, and you're back

00:35:22.056 --> 00:35:22.976
where you started from.

00:35:24.096 --> 00:35:28.366
Doing the same thing with the
hamburger menu involves opening

00:35:28.366 --> 00:35:30.636
the menu, waiting for
the animation to finish,

00:35:31.196 --> 00:35:34.526
re-orienting yourself, finding
the option you're interested in,

00:35:34.846 --> 00:35:37.406
tapping that, and then waiting
for the animation to complete,

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:39.406
getting back to where you
were before, and if you want

00:35:39.406 --> 00:35:41.876
to go back, you have
to open the menu again,

00:35:41.976 --> 00:35:46.426
go through that whole process,
and there you are, again.

00:35:47.006 --> 00:35:50.836
It takes at least twice as
many taps to change sections.

00:35:51.496 --> 00:35:52.716
Something that should
be very easy

00:35:52.716 --> 00:35:54.616
and fluid is made
more difficult.

00:35:55.166 --> 00:35:59.266
And the other thing the
hamburger menus quite frankly do

00:35:59.266 --> 00:36:03.016
badly is that they don't play
nicely with back buttons.

00:36:03.806 --> 00:36:05.616
Right? I've seen this a lot.

00:36:06.646 --> 00:36:08.016
Back buttons are supposed to go

00:36:08.016 --> 00:36:09.506
in that top left
corner position,

00:36:10.156 --> 00:36:11.696
but instead there's this
hamburger menu there,

00:36:11.696 --> 00:36:13.766
so people put the back
button right next to it,

00:36:14.406 --> 00:36:16.846
but no longer does this look
like a back button anymore,

00:36:17.346 --> 00:36:18.896
it just looks like this
arrow which is pointing

00:36:18.896 --> 00:36:22.586
to the hamburger menu,
looks ridiculous,

00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:28.156
and sometimes people recognize
that it looks ridiculous,

00:36:28.736 --> 00:36:31.206
so when you drill down into
the hierarchy of an app,

00:36:31.826 --> 00:36:33.366
the hamburger menu goes away.

00:36:34.686 --> 00:36:38.666
Now it takes even more steps to
switch to a different section.

00:36:39.016 --> 00:36:41.576
You have to go back up enough
times to get to a level

00:36:41.576 --> 00:36:44.146
in the hierarchy of an
app to get to a view

00:36:44.146 --> 00:36:45.776
that contains the
hamburger menu.

00:36:46.366 --> 00:36:49.436
Now, sometimes people
will try to solve this

00:36:49.436 --> 00:36:51.106
by putting the menu on
the right-hand side,

00:36:51.106 --> 00:36:53.476
but that's not advisable either.

00:36:54.016 --> 00:36:56.856
That location is a
really important location.

00:36:56.856 --> 00:36:59.876
Usually you can put some kind
of action there, you know,

00:36:59.876 --> 00:37:03.196
like a plus sign to add
something, or an edit button.

00:37:03.736 --> 00:37:10.146
And finally, the downside
of being able to show a lot

00:37:10.146 --> 00:37:13.566
of options is that you
can show a lot of options.

00:37:14.056 --> 00:37:16.096
Is that you will show
a lot of options.

00:37:17.036 --> 00:37:20.876
The potential for bloat
and misuse is tremendous.

00:37:22.256 --> 00:37:24.586
They allow you to add
all sorts of stuff

00:37:24.646 --> 00:37:27.086
that your users don't
really care about.

00:37:28.356 --> 00:37:31.486
Like information about the app.

00:37:31.486 --> 00:37:33.316
Or version history, or credits.

00:37:34.106 --> 00:37:37.066
I hate to break it to
you, but no one cares.

[ Laughter & Applause ]

00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:49.536
And the other thing is that
people wind up taking ads

00:37:49.536 --> 00:37:52.136
and special offers and
making them look just

00:37:52.136 --> 00:37:54.306
like regular sections and
putting it in there too.

00:37:55.666 --> 00:37:56.346
That sucks.

No one wants that either.

have a nasty tendency

to fill with junk.

characteristic

00:38:17.396 --> 00:38:20.736
of intuitive navigation,
or sorry, we're not talking

00:38:20.736 --> 00:38:23.666
about navigation anymore,
intuitive user interfaces,

00:38:24.116 --> 00:38:25.186
is that they are clear.

00:38:26.116 --> 00:38:29.936
Now, this applies to the
information apps present,

00:38:29.936 --> 00:38:31.936
and the functionality
that they present.

00:38:32.406 --> 00:38:33.736
Information and functionality
need

00:38:33.736 --> 00:38:35.966
to be straightforward
and understandable.

00:38:35.966 --> 00:38:38.216
It's easy for people to do
things, so they're not trying

00:38:38.216 --> 00:38:40.776
to decode or interpret
what it is they're saying.

00:38:41.356 --> 00:38:44.436
And clarity is this very broad,
but very powerful concept.

00:38:44.996 --> 00:38:46.706
And just about everything
I've said

00:38:46.706 --> 00:38:50.576
about navigation really boils
down to just being clear.

00:38:51.356 --> 00:38:52.816
Is it clear where you are?

00:38:53.466 --> 00:38:54.966
Is it clear where
else you can go?

00:38:55.346 --> 00:38:56.976
Is it clear what
type of information

00:38:56.976 --> 00:38:58.886
or functions you'll
find when you get there?

00:39:00.236 --> 00:39:03.286
But clarity applies to so much
more than just navigation.

00:39:04.566 --> 00:39:05.976
Now, let's start with language.

00:39:06.906 --> 00:39:10.156
Now obviously, we rely
heavily upon the written word

00:39:10.156 --> 00:39:12.046
to communicate with the
people who use our app.

00:39:12.906 --> 00:39:15.586
But how well do they
understand what we're saying?

00:39:16.226 --> 00:39:18.876
It turns out that that's a
really hard question for us

00:39:18.906 --> 00:39:21.596
to answer, and it's
especially hard to answer

00:39:21.596 --> 00:39:24.286
that question before
they've even had a chance

00:39:24.576 --> 00:39:25.446
to use the app.

00:39:26.306 --> 00:39:28.666
But there are a few
things that you can do

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:31.316
to increase the likelihood
that you're speaking

00:39:31.476 --> 00:39:33.446
and communicating as
clearly as possible.

00:39:34.276 --> 00:39:38.446
Now, here are six ways that you
can be sure that you're being

00:39:38.446 --> 00:39:44.376
as clear as possible, starting
with using simple words.

00:39:45.376 --> 00:39:48.216
Now if you're designing an app
for a large number of people,

00:39:48.476 --> 00:39:50.076
avoid using big words

00:39:50.126 --> 00:39:52.156
that people may have
trouble understanding.

00:39:53.286 --> 00:39:54.016
So here's you.

00:39:55.036 --> 00:39:58.266
And this red circle, that
represents your vocabulary.

00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:02.666
Now, you use words from your
vocabulary to write the text

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.476
that you're going to put
in your app's interface,

00:40:04.476 --> 00:40:07.046
and that's great while
you're developing it,

00:40:07.046 --> 00:40:10.506
but once you shift, along
come some other people.

00:40:11.346 --> 00:40:13.576
And their vocabularies are
different than your own.

00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:17.346
They may not be native
speakers of your language.

00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:20.116
They may have different
educational backgrounds.

00:40:20.666 --> 00:40:22.536
Whatever the reason is,
it doesn't really matter.

00:40:23.156 --> 00:40:25.326
The bottom line is
that the number

00:40:25.326 --> 00:40:27.666
of words you share
in common is limited.

00:40:28.356 --> 00:40:32.436
So use simpler words that
most people will understand,

00:40:32.556 --> 00:40:33.456
most of the time.

00:40:34.006 --> 00:40:37.436
Those words, they may not
be as precise or descriptive

00:40:37.436 --> 00:40:40.456
as you would like them to be,
but it's going to make it easier

00:40:40.456 --> 00:40:43.566
for more people to
enjoy your app.

00:40:44.396 --> 00:40:47.146
The next tip is to avoid jargon.

00:40:47.906 --> 00:40:48.646
People shouldn't need

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:51.066
to be computer scientists
to use an app.

00:40:51.986 --> 00:40:55.216
So, for example, we
say airplane mode.

00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:56.816
We don't say turn off radios.

00:40:57.226 --> 00:41:00.466
Now, turn, off, radios,
those are really basic words,

00:41:01.056 --> 00:41:03.766
but most people don't
understand what radios mean

00:41:03.766 --> 00:41:04.526
in this context.

00:41:04.526 --> 00:41:06.386
They just think it's like
the AM/FM radio they have

00:41:06.386 --> 00:41:06.896
in their house.

00:41:08.106 --> 00:41:09.356
So we use airplane mode.

00:41:09.686 --> 00:41:10.706
It's much more effective.

00:41:11.596 --> 00:41:13.666
And this isn't just about
computer mumbo-jumbo,

00:41:14.196 --> 00:41:15.536
this is kind of about
everything.

00:41:15.846 --> 00:41:19.296
So let's just say we're making
an app about renewable energy,

00:41:19.626 --> 00:41:23.646
and this app is intended to be
used by people who own houses,

00:41:23.646 --> 00:41:26.416
or office buildings or what
have you, and they're interested

00:41:26.416 --> 00:41:28.306
in doing the right thing
for the environment

00:41:28.306 --> 00:41:29.696
or just saving money.

00:41:30.416 --> 00:41:32.946
They're not necessarily
really well informed about all

00:41:32.946 --> 00:41:35.666
of the technologies that
they can choose from.

00:41:36.876 --> 00:41:41.376
Now, they shouldn't need to know
what a photovoltaic module is.

00:41:42.716 --> 00:41:44.666
They're going to say
solar panels, right?

00:41:45.616 --> 00:41:48.596
Photovoltaic what now?

00:41:48.836 --> 00:41:54.446
Right? A better design is one
that leads with solar panels,

00:41:54.606 --> 00:41:58.766
leads with the commonplace term,
and if you want to define it

00:41:58.826 --> 00:42:00.396
for people, that's great.

00:42:00.986 --> 00:42:02.266
You're educating them, right?

00:42:02.266 --> 00:42:05.226
Well, it's kind of synonymous
with photovoltaic modules.

00:42:05.726 --> 00:42:07.986
So now, when that individual
goes somewhere else and they see

00:42:07.986 --> 00:42:10.176
that term, well they're
going to know what it means.

00:42:11.816 --> 00:42:14.056
But there is a bit of
a qualification here.

00:42:14.706 --> 00:42:18.536
And that is that it's
critical to know your audience.

00:42:19.796 --> 00:42:21.906
So in this scenario, we
were designing an app

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.896
which is targeted at a consumer.

00:42:24.726 --> 00:42:27.236
That someone is, it's a
large audience of people

00:42:27.236 --> 00:42:28.146
who I described, right?

00:42:29.316 --> 00:42:31.726
And we don't know
what they know.

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.616
And they probably can't
take anything for granted.

00:42:33.946 --> 00:42:35.636
So we want to use a
term like solar panels.

00:42:36.276 --> 00:42:38.876
But imagine we were designing
an app which was to be used

00:42:38.876 --> 00:42:40.886
by the technicians, the people

00:42:40.886 --> 00:42:43.636
who install solar
panels in people's homes.

00:42:44.576 --> 00:42:45.316
Well, they're probably going

00:42:45.316 --> 00:42:47.696
to be a lot better informed
about the technology.

00:42:48.346 --> 00:42:51.256
Maybe they intuitively or just
naturally would use the word

00:42:51.256 --> 00:42:52.446
photovoltaic modules.

00:42:52.446 --> 00:42:53.406
It's more precise.

00:42:54.216 --> 00:42:55.956
In fact, they would be
embarrassed to use an app

00:42:56.396 --> 00:42:57.516
which says solar panels.

00:42:57.516 --> 00:42:58.886
They wouldn't want
to be caught dead--

00:42:58.886 --> 00:43:00.586
they'd be laughed at
by their colleagues.

00:43:01.986 --> 00:43:03.676
So think about your app.

00:43:04.866 --> 00:43:07.936
Now there's a spectrum, and
it's important to consider,

00:43:08.476 --> 00:43:11.186
are you're targeting a
consumer or a professional?

00:43:12.186 --> 00:43:16.486
Correctly positioning your app
on that spectrum is the key

00:43:17.226 --> 00:43:19.886
to making sure that
your app is intuitive

00:43:19.886 --> 00:43:21.966
for the audience
who is using it.

00:43:23.376 --> 00:43:25.836
Now, the next tip is
about being descriptive.

00:43:27.476 --> 00:43:29.466
So sometimes I see this.

00:43:30.056 --> 00:43:31.136
There's an option
that says Home.

00:43:31.136 --> 00:43:33.876
Well what's on the Home screen?

00:43:33.936 --> 00:43:35.136
I have no idea.

00:43:35.666 --> 00:43:37.546
Home is very undescriptive.

00:43:38.406 --> 00:43:41.496
In fact, it always
suggests to me

00:43:41.496 --> 00:43:43.246
that the person designing
the app probably comes

00:43:43.246 --> 00:43:44.476
from a web design background.

00:43:45.036 --> 00:43:48.866
On iOS, we try to be really
descriptive about what kind

00:43:48.866 --> 00:43:51.856
of content or functionality
you would find on that screen.

00:43:52.516 --> 00:43:54.946
So use better words that
are more descriptive.

00:43:56.446 --> 00:43:59.346
And next, be succinct.

00:44:00.616 --> 00:44:02.086
Brevity is a virtue.

00:44:03.246 --> 00:44:06.126
Next, avoid truncation
[Applause].

00:44:11.856 --> 00:44:15.356
It's really hard to read text
when it's not all visible

00:44:15.356 --> 00:44:18.506
on the screen at
one point in time.

00:44:18.726 --> 00:44:22.406
Being succinct, and using
shorter words will help.

00:44:24.146 --> 00:44:28.456
And finally, you could have the
best copy in the whole world,

00:44:28.526 --> 00:44:29.776
I mean, beautiful prose.

00:44:29.776 --> 00:44:31.916
But it won't do you much good

00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:33.886
if people are having a
hard time reading it.

00:44:34.426 --> 00:44:37.046
So use a type face
which is legible.

00:44:37.796 --> 00:44:41.366
And make sure that text is
large enough for people to read

00:44:41.686 --> 00:44:43.416
at a comfortable
viewing distance.

00:44:43.726 --> 00:44:46.086
Not with their face
pressed against the device

00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:47.746
or the computer screen.

00:44:48.546 --> 00:44:51.606
And if you're making an
iOS app, I highly recommend

00:44:51.666 --> 00:44:52.956
that you use dynamic type.

00:44:53.786 --> 00:44:57.346
This will pretty much assure
that text will be as legible

00:44:57.346 --> 00:45:00.286
as our built-in apps,
and for those people

00:45:00.286 --> 00:45:03.086
who have a hard time
reading, have bad eyesight,

00:45:03.516 --> 00:45:06.966
well they can adjust font size
to suit their individual needs.

00:45:07.506 --> 00:45:12.156
Now, just as important
as speaking clearly

00:45:12.156 --> 00:45:15.986
with words is communicating
clearly with visual symbols.

00:45:16.796 --> 00:45:20.506
In fact, a well-designed icon
can often communicate a concept

00:45:20.506 --> 00:45:24.596
more quickly and more
effectively than any word can.

00:45:24.916 --> 00:45:27.026
But icons are really
tricky to get right.

00:45:28.476 --> 00:45:30.086
I mean, what does
this icon mean, right?

00:45:30.086 --> 00:45:31.216
It means nothing.

00:45:31.276 --> 00:45:33.516
I mean, if I just saw this,
I would think maybe it's

00:45:33.516 --> 00:45:38.256
like a beach ball floating in
a fish tank, or it's a dish

00:45:38.256 --> 00:45:42.096
in a dish rack, or it's like
a super modern door knocker.

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:45.666
Right? Without any context, I
have no idea what this means.

00:45:45.666 --> 00:45:47.196
This is a terrible icon.

00:45:48.146 --> 00:45:50.396
So what kind of icons
will work well?

00:45:51.696 --> 00:45:54.616
Well, there's some icons
which are successful

00:45:54.616 --> 00:45:57.396
because they're internationally
recognizable,

00:45:57.586 --> 00:45:59.106
such as this information sign.

00:45:59.936 --> 00:46:05.076
We've seen information signs in
museums, in malls, and airports,

00:46:05.436 --> 00:46:06.656
and we always know
what they mean.

00:46:06.656 --> 00:46:08.666
It means getting
information about something.

00:46:09.126 --> 00:46:13.746
Next, there's symbols which
are so pervasively used

00:46:13.746 --> 00:46:16.646
in so many types of apps,
like this magnifying glass,

00:46:17.016 --> 00:46:19.106
that we understand what
it's trying to tell us.

00:46:19.526 --> 00:46:21.996
We know that this
relates to searching.

00:46:22.826 --> 00:46:25.936
Even if the particular
form of searching may vary.

00:46:27.786 --> 00:46:31.006
And next, there's icons
that are successful

00:46:31.006 --> 00:46:34.286
because they represent
these real ordinary,

00:46:34.286 --> 00:46:37.776
commonplace objects that
we've all used in our lives.

00:46:38.456 --> 00:46:39.896
We've all owned an alarm clock,

00:46:39.896 --> 00:46:41.786
or we've at least
seen one on TV.

00:46:42.376 --> 00:46:45.306
So when we see this icon that
looks like an alarm clock,

00:46:45.306 --> 00:46:47.486
we know what it's trying
to communicate to us.

00:46:48.726 --> 00:46:50.226
So let's flip this around a bit.

00:46:50.826 --> 00:46:52.756
What types of icons
don't work well?

00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:58.246
Well if your icon needs a label
in order to be understandable,

00:46:59.036 --> 00:47:00.286
that's a really bad sign.

00:47:01.426 --> 00:47:04.796
If your icon represents
a commonplace object

00:47:04.796 --> 00:47:11.646
that many people have never seen
in their life, that's a problem.

00:47:16.766 --> 00:47:19.576
And if you use a
really common icon,

00:47:19.576 --> 00:47:23.346
but in a very non-standard,
unconventional way,

00:47:24.276 --> 00:47:28.016
then it's time to go back to the
drawing board, and start over.

00:47:29.086 --> 00:47:32.386
And also if you ever
catch yourself or someone

00:47:32.386 --> 00:47:35.796
around you says, "Well it
may not be perfectly clear,

00:47:36.316 --> 00:47:39.376
but people will learn what it
means eventually," then I'd

00:47:39.376 --> 00:47:43.026
like all of you people to
meet me over here after,

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:44.826
because I have this
awesome bridge

00:47:45.146 --> 00:47:46.646
that I'd very much
like to sell you.

00:47:47.476 --> 00:47:49.886
Look, it's not that
icons can't be learned.

00:47:50.246 --> 00:47:54.126
It's just that they're
not likely to be learned.

00:47:54.286 --> 00:47:56.176
Why would I find out
what an icon does

00:47:56.236 --> 00:47:57.076
if I don't know what it means?

00:47:57.076 --> 00:47:58.676
Why would I even tap
on it or click it?

00:47:59.336 --> 00:48:00.876
Maybe it's going to do
something destructive?

00:48:00.876 --> 00:48:04.586
And anyway, that's a really
low bar to set for yourself.

00:48:05.106 --> 00:48:08.256
If you want to make a truly
intuitive app, don't settle

00:48:08.316 --> 00:48:10.966
for icons that need
to be learned.

00:48:11.486 --> 00:48:15.656
And I also want to mention
that icons are often used

00:48:16.006 --> 00:48:17.476
because space is limited.

00:48:18.246 --> 00:48:20.606
So they wind up being
kind of small.

00:48:20.646 --> 00:48:25.496
So let's say we're making
an icon of a coffee cup.

00:48:26.476 --> 00:48:30.366
And when we're making it, we're
using like a vector design tool,

00:48:30.366 --> 00:48:32.966
and we're zoomed
into 3200 percent,

00:48:33.346 --> 00:48:36.846
and we want to really get
creative with this, so yeah,

00:48:36.846 --> 00:48:39.196
it's coffee, but you know,
it's hot coffee, so we're going

00:48:39.196 --> 00:48:41.856
to add a little bit of steam,
and we want people to know

00:48:41.856 --> 00:48:43.426
that if they happen
to tip the coffee cup,

00:48:43.426 --> 00:48:45.436
it's going to be okay
because there's a saucer

00:48:45.436 --> 00:48:49.326
that will catch all the coffee,
and you know, who likes boring,

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:51.626
blank vanilla coffee
mugs, right?

00:48:52.066 --> 00:48:53.796
They often have pictures
and logos on them,

00:48:53.796 --> 00:48:57.226
and coffee makes us happy, so
let's put a happy face on it.

00:48:57.996 --> 00:49:00.726
But then when you display it
at the correct resolution,

00:49:01.936 --> 00:49:03.466
all that detail gets
kind of lost.

00:49:04.556 --> 00:49:05.396
Becomes muddy.

00:49:05.826 --> 00:49:09.126
So don't add all those details.

00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:11.886
It's better to render
the same symbol,

00:49:11.886 --> 00:49:13.956
but with less visual detail.

00:49:13.996 --> 00:49:17.846
It will be far more
clear when it's downsized

00:49:17.846 --> 00:49:18.886
to the correct resolution.

00:49:20.046 --> 00:49:21.036
And if that doesn't work,

00:49:21.476 --> 00:49:23.466
just try using a
different symbol altogether.

00:49:24.046 --> 00:49:28.896
Look, it's not always that easy
to come up with a great icon.

00:49:30.216 --> 00:49:33.426
If you can't find a visual
symbol whose meaning is

00:49:33.426 --> 00:49:37.086
universally, immediately,
and clearly understood,

00:49:38.036 --> 00:49:43.176
then just stick with text.

00:49:43.336 --> 00:49:44.416
Now, pictures and words.

00:49:44.596 --> 00:49:46.176
These are really key
and important ways

00:49:46.176 --> 00:49:47.826
of communicating information.

00:49:48.736 --> 00:49:52.156
But there's another tool in the
tool box that I'd like to talk

00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:55.136
with you about today,
and that's animation.

00:49:56.086 --> 00:49:58.806
Animation can sometimes
communicate things far more

00:49:58.806 --> 00:50:01.076
clearly than either
words or pictures.

00:50:01.996 --> 00:50:04.806
One of my favorite examples
of this is the focus

00:50:04.806 --> 00:50:06.636
and exposure indicator
in the camera app.

00:50:07.366 --> 00:50:08.576
This animation of the focus

00:50:08.576 --> 00:50:12.046
and exposure indicator says
three really critical things

00:50:12.046 --> 00:50:12.766
very well.

00:50:13.326 --> 00:50:16.056
First, by first appearing
and then scaling down,

00:50:16.296 --> 00:50:18.866
it's drawing your attention
to the object of the part

00:50:18.866 --> 00:50:20.266
of the image which is being used

00:50:20.546 --> 00:50:22.976
to determine the correct
focus and exposure.

00:50:23.826 --> 00:50:25.326
And because it's
getting smaller,

00:50:25.536 --> 00:50:28.266
it's giving you this hint
that it's really precise.

00:50:28.676 --> 00:50:30.876
Right? It's zeroing in
on a particular area.

00:50:30.876 --> 00:50:35.016
And then when it stops getting
smaller, it just pulses twice,

00:50:35.536 --> 00:50:38.306
which tells you that focus
and exposure have been locked.

00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:43.406
And then, it simply fades
away, which tells you

00:50:43.406 --> 00:50:46.296
that the process is
complete, and it's now okay

00:50:46.296 --> 00:50:49.516
for you to take your photo.

00:50:49.706 --> 00:50:51.846
Ready? Set.

00:50:53.076 --> 00:50:57.596
And go. That's a lot of
information contained

00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:59.806
in a very quick and
simple animation.

00:51:00.786 --> 00:51:02.096
Let's look at another example.

00:51:03.576 --> 00:51:05.066
The animation when you key

00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:07.656
in the wrong passcode
on your lock screen.

00:51:08.526 --> 00:51:11.246
Without saying a single word,
it just shakes its head no,

00:51:12.496 --> 00:51:14.446
that's not the right
answer, I'm going to clear

00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:16.956
out that gibberish that you just
entered, and let you try again.

00:51:17.536 --> 00:51:23.786
Okay. So the second to
last major characteristic

00:51:23.786 --> 00:51:27.686
of intuitive user interfaces
is that they are simple.

00:51:28.346 --> 00:51:33.206
Now, the common element
of not overwhelming people

00:51:33.206 --> 00:51:35.046
with too many options
at any one point

00:51:35.046 --> 00:51:38.976
in time are using more basic
language to communicate

00:51:38.976 --> 00:51:44.316
with people, or reducing the
extraneous visual ornamentations

00:51:44.316 --> 00:51:47.306
from icons, is that
the user interface,

00:51:47.306 --> 00:51:50.086
and the user experience,
needs to be simple.

00:51:51.226 --> 00:51:54.246
Now, let's go back to that pen
and paper analogy for a second.

00:51:55.146 --> 00:51:56.726
Remember, you were
in your kitchen,

00:51:56.726 --> 00:51:59.516
and you were frantically hunting
around for a way to write

00:51:59.596 --> 00:52:00.556
down that phone number.

00:52:01.236 --> 00:52:03.396
And let's just say,
that just like before,

00:52:03.516 --> 00:52:05.006
the pen was sitting
there and the pad

00:52:05.006 --> 00:52:07.876
of paper was sitting there
on your kitchen table.

00:52:09.186 --> 00:52:10.686
But there is also
some pieces of paper.

00:52:11.546 --> 00:52:13.286
And there was also some dishes.

00:52:14.326 --> 00:52:15.496
And your kids' toys.

00:52:16.756 --> 00:52:19.646
That pen could be right
there, but you don't see it

00:52:19.646 --> 00:52:21.346
because there are all
these other objects

00:52:21.346 --> 00:52:22.846
which are demanding
your attention.

00:52:24.046 --> 00:52:26.116
Complex apps are like this.

00:52:26.646 --> 00:52:29.796
In order to do the most
basic and simple of things,

00:52:29.796 --> 00:52:31.726
you have to wade
through a bunch of things

00:52:31.726 --> 00:52:32.906
that you don't care about.

00:52:34.316 --> 00:52:37.416
Simple apps take the
80/20 rule to heart.

00:52:37.416 --> 00:52:39.446
Now, there's a lot
of definitions

00:52:39.446 --> 00:52:43.516
for what the 80/20 rule means,
one of which is that 80 percent

00:52:43.516 --> 00:52:46.446
of people are only going to
use 20 percent of features,

00:52:46.886 --> 00:52:49.576
or that 80 percent of the
time, people are only going

00:52:49.576 --> 00:52:50.386
to use 20 percent

00:52:50.386 --> 00:52:52.386
of the capabilities
of any given system.

00:52:53.356 --> 00:52:56.686
However you define it,
it's pretty simple.

00:52:56.996 --> 00:52:59.546
Most of the time, most
people will use very little

00:52:59.546 --> 00:53:01.506
of what you actually make.

00:53:02.826 --> 00:53:05.406
And however you define
it, the takeaway is this.

00:53:06.006 --> 00:53:08.756
If you show people information
that they don't care about,

00:53:08.756 --> 00:53:10.066
or functions that
they don't need,

00:53:10.656 --> 00:53:13.056
then all that stuff is just
going to distract them.

00:53:13.706 --> 00:53:16.316
It will get in their way
and make it harder for them

00:53:16.316 --> 00:53:19.576
to accomplish what it
is they want to do.

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:22.376
Now, I've been showing a
lot of iOS examples here,

00:53:22.376 --> 00:53:24.106
and I want to talk
about Mac for a second,

00:53:24.106 --> 00:53:25.636
and the context of simplicity.

00:53:26.226 --> 00:53:31.356
Now, what does simplicity
mean for a Mac?

00:53:32.036 --> 00:53:34.646
I mean Macs are very
different than iOS, right?

00:53:34.646 --> 00:53:37.986
I mean for one thing, the
screens are much larger

00:53:37.986 --> 00:53:41.966
than an iPad, let alone an
iPhone, so there's a lot of room

00:53:41.966 --> 00:53:44.556
to show all sorts of
controls and information.

00:53:45.596 --> 00:53:47.456
And a lot of times, that's
what people really want.

00:53:47.456 --> 00:53:50.736
I mean, if you're designing
a professional application,

00:53:51.866 --> 00:53:52.966
that's a good thing right?

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:56.096
Macs are all about
utility and power.

00:53:57.406 --> 00:54:00.496
So Macs that are designed for
professionals take advantage

00:54:00.496 --> 00:54:02.136
of this by offering
sophisticated

00:54:02.136 --> 00:54:05.926
and advanced work flows,
and people use these apps

00:54:05.926 --> 00:54:09.866
for really extended periods
of time, and as they do so,

00:54:09.866 --> 00:54:12.936
they become comfortable in
managing all of that complexity.

00:54:12.936 --> 00:54:17.146
And when they become
comfortable managing complexity,

00:54:17.586 --> 00:54:20.606
other concerns come to the
fore, such as being efficient.

00:54:21.496 --> 00:54:23.286
And efficiency is all
about availability,

00:54:23.286 --> 00:54:26.356
meaning everything is in
plain sight, or within reach.

00:54:26.936 --> 00:54:30.996
Okay. So that's a
good thing, actually.

00:54:32.376 --> 00:54:35.846
But still, keep in mind that
if you're not just designing

00:54:35.846 --> 00:54:38.616
for professionals, for a wider
range of people, maybe people

00:54:38.616 --> 00:54:40.626
who are just wanting
to pick up new skills

00:54:40.626 --> 00:54:42.376
and grow into that profession.

00:54:43.506 --> 00:54:46.846
Just new users are trying to
learn the system, you don't want

00:54:46.846 --> 00:54:49.236
to drop them into something
that looks like this.

00:54:50.326 --> 00:54:53.946
Take the time to give them
this, and allow them to graduate

00:54:54.036 --> 00:54:55.766
to something that's
more complicated.

00:54:56.326 --> 00:55:02.816
Now, finally, the number
one characteristic,

00:55:04.396 --> 00:55:07.256
and that's corny, of
intuitive user interfaces,

00:55:07.256 --> 00:55:09.156
is that they are focused.

00:55:10.446 --> 00:55:14.376
Now, the design of
this pen is successful

00:55:15.016 --> 00:55:17.556
because it's perfectly
suited for the context

00:55:17.976 --> 00:55:18.926
for which it was made.

00:55:19.966 --> 00:55:22.726
It's a general purpose
writing tool that works well

00:55:22.726 --> 00:55:24.236
in your home or in your office.

00:55:25.306 --> 00:55:27.996
There's nothing about this
pen that's extraneous.

00:55:28.636 --> 00:55:30.776
It's not made more
complicated by features

00:55:30.776 --> 00:55:33.366
that people don't really
need all that often.

00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:36.536
It just serves basic
writing tasks.

00:55:37.566 --> 00:55:40.036
There's no ability to
change the color of the pen.

00:55:40.886 --> 00:55:43.566
It's not double-sided in
case one side breaks down.

00:55:44.396 --> 00:55:46.856
It doesn't have any kind of
laser pointing capability.

00:55:48.126 --> 00:55:51.946
All of those features would make
this pen needlessly complicated.

00:55:53.146 --> 00:55:57.136
The design of this pen is a very
singular and focused purpose.

00:55:57.846 --> 00:56:01.006
Every aspect of this pen's
design serves that goal.

00:56:02.496 --> 00:56:06.326
Its form invites us to pick it
up and to hold it comfortably

00:56:06.326 --> 00:56:07.826
with a couple of fingers.

00:56:08.926 --> 00:56:11.606
It's obvious how to
click open the pen tip,

00:56:11.606 --> 00:56:13.656
and click it closed
again by pressing

00:56:13.656 --> 00:56:14.696
on the button at the top.

00:56:16.226 --> 00:56:19.526
It's obvious how to clip it to a
shirt pocket or a piece of paper

00:56:19.526 --> 00:56:23.726
so that it's portable and
we can take it with us.

00:56:23.726 --> 00:56:27.926
In other words, it's intuitive,
because of the intense focus

00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:31.116
on supporting just a couple
of basic tasks like writing

00:56:31.116 --> 00:56:33.116
and drawing, and being portable.

00:56:34.186 --> 00:56:35.456
It is uncomplicated.

00:56:36.046 --> 00:56:39.296
And therefore, it is made
intuitive to a wide range

00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:41.786
of people and a wide
variety of contexts.

00:56:43.116 --> 00:56:45.866
But focus can also
mean designing

00:56:45.866 --> 00:56:49.266
to support very specialized,
or niche applications.

00:56:49.726 --> 00:56:54.396
This calligraphy pen is
intuitive to a calligrapher.

00:56:55.426 --> 00:56:56.996
Everything about
it they understand.

00:56:56.996 --> 00:56:58.356
It makes total sense to them.

00:56:58.546 --> 00:57:00.956
The shape, and the
nib of the pen.

00:57:02.466 --> 00:57:03.926
But if you're not
a calligrapher,

00:57:03.966 --> 00:57:05.856
and you pick this up, and
you try to write with it

00:57:05.856 --> 00:57:08.456
as you would think to
intuitively, as you would write

00:57:08.456 --> 00:57:11.686
with a pen, well the results
are going to be pretty ugly.

00:57:11.686 --> 00:57:14.676
You're going to have a lot of
slashes and holes in the paper

00:57:14.676 --> 00:57:15.566
that you're writing on.

00:57:16.136 --> 00:57:18.546
The paintbrush, it's
the same thing.

00:57:18.546 --> 00:57:20.166
This is intuitive to a painter.

00:57:21.556 --> 00:57:23.846
But if you're not a painter,
you're going to make a mess.

00:57:25.626 --> 00:57:28.356
The design of these
tools is optimized

00:57:28.356 --> 00:57:30.396
for very specialized
applications,

00:57:30.996 --> 00:57:35.506
and just like a pen, adding
any extra stuff would result

00:57:35.506 --> 00:57:39.326
in a less successful and
a less intuitive design.

00:57:41.836 --> 00:57:46.286
The beauty of iOS is that there
are hundreds of thousands,

00:57:46.286 --> 00:57:48.826
I mean 1.2 million
apps, out there.

00:57:50.326 --> 00:57:53.516
And many of the most
successful apps are successful

00:57:54.226 --> 00:57:58.006
because they do just one or two
things, extraordinarily well.

00:57:58.596 --> 00:58:01.546
In other words, they
were designed

00:58:01.606 --> 00:58:03.986
around a clear and
singular purpose.

00:58:07.356 --> 00:58:12.516
Focus means that your app can
and probably should do less.

00:58:13.706 --> 00:58:16.816
If your app does less, you're
going to have more time

00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:20.896
to iterate, to prototype, to
implement, polish and test.

00:58:22.146 --> 00:58:25.026
If your app does less, you're
going to have less need

00:58:25.026 --> 00:58:27.606
for complicated navigation
controls

00:58:27.606 --> 00:58:30.286
that are difficult to use.

00:58:31.376 --> 00:58:38.696
If your app does less, you can
spend more time crafting just

00:58:38.696 --> 00:58:41.386
the right wording, or
picking just the right icons,

00:58:41.786 --> 00:58:44.496
and making sure that you have
time to build in animations

00:58:44.916 --> 00:58:48.376
that clearly and meaningfully
provide user feedback

00:58:48.446 --> 00:58:50.396
and help people to
stay oriented.

00:58:50.966 --> 00:58:59.826
Now, some of the best UI Design
advice that I ever received was

00:58:59.826 --> 00:59:03.416
that great software
starts small.

00:59:04.016 --> 00:59:07.716
You pick something that you're
really passionate about,

00:59:07.716 --> 00:59:12.026
and that is important to real
people, and you try to figure

00:59:12.026 --> 00:59:15.426
out what it is that you
can do to help make things

00:59:15.426 --> 00:59:19.056
in their life better,
easier, faster, more fun.

00:59:20.336 --> 00:59:21.076
More delightful.

00:59:21.616 --> 00:59:25.646
And then you dive in.

00:59:26.326 --> 00:59:27.596
And you make that happen.

00:59:28.096 --> 00:59:30.446
And you don't ship
until you have something

00:59:30.446 --> 00:59:31.696
that is truly great.

00:59:32.896 --> 00:59:36.316
You don't ship until you
have something that you can

00:59:36.316 --> 00:59:39.526
and should feel proud of.

00:59:40.836 --> 00:59:42.456
If you've accomplished that,

00:59:43.326 --> 00:59:45.766
your app will become
indispensable.

00:59:46.586 --> 00:59:51.356
People won't delete it, because
the function it provides them

00:59:51.686 --> 00:59:53.116
perfectly suits their needs.

00:59:53.216 --> 00:59:54.556
It's exactly what they want.

00:59:55.376 --> 00:59:58.156
And the form of the app,
how it's been designed,

00:59:58.436 --> 01:00:00.696
perfectly matches
the functionality

01:00:01.026 --> 01:00:02.116
that it offers to them.

01:00:03.636 --> 01:00:09.146
And perhaps most importantly,
people will sense the care,

01:00:09.716 --> 01:00:12.816
the attention to detail,
and the love that went

01:00:12.816 --> 01:00:19.806
into making a truly great
and truly intuitive app.

01:00:20.086 --> 01:00:21.546
Okay. So thank you.

01:00:21.546 --> 01:00:24.266
I want to point out
really quickly if you want

01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:27.106
to continue this conversation,
here's my Email address.

01:00:27.106 --> 01:00:29.836
We also have a lot of really
great design resources

01:00:29.836 --> 01:00:32.426
for you available on
developer.apple.com,

01:00:32.726 --> 01:00:35.036
including links to the
Human Interface Guideline,

01:00:35.096 --> 01:00:36.146
a bunch of videos.

01:00:36.786 --> 01:00:39.656
We also have made the iOS Human
Interface Guidelines available

01:00:39.656 --> 01:00:41.766
as an iBook, so you can
go out and get that.

01:00:42.416 --> 01:00:43.386
And I also want to point

01:00:43.386 --> 01:00:46.546
out that this is not the
last session about design.

01:00:47.156 --> 01:00:49.966
We have three other really great
sessions for you this year.

01:00:50.076 --> 01:00:52.286
I already talked to you about
the last one there on the list.

01:00:52.556 --> 01:00:53.186
Go check it out.

01:00:53.746 --> 01:00:56.456
If you do internet purchase,
we have a really good session

01:00:56.456 --> 01:00:58.826
with tons of great,
wise advice--

01:00:58.996 --> 01:01:01.486
content for you to follow,
and then this session

01:01:01.486 --> 01:01:02.856
in the middle is awesome.

01:01:02.856 --> 01:01:05.426
It's about prototyping,
and how we use it at Apple

01:01:05.796 --> 01:01:08.746
to develop ideas, and really
refine them and figure

01:01:08.746 --> 01:01:10.286
out what it is we want to do.

01:01:10.286 --> 01:01:13.096
Thank you very much for your
time, and have a great evening.

01:01:14.516 --> 01:01:20.100
