00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:12.676
>> Good morning.

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:19.286
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.416
Welcome to "The New
iTunes Connect."

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:23.476
I'm Dave Van Tassell,

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:26.046
Engineering Manager
here at iTunes Connect.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.036
We have a lot of great things
to talk to you about today.

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:30.316
To do so, I'm going
to need the clicker

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:31.226
over on this desk right here.

00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:35.246
It all starts with a new design.

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.636
We want to take you on a
little bit of a walkthrough,

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:39.806
some of the new features
that we've added,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.606
some of the new flows.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.366
Second thing is app previews.

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:48.416
It's a great chance for you to
upload a video 15 to 30 seconds,

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.946
dynamic view of what
makes your app magical.

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:57.636
App bundles - you can bundle
up to 10 apps together

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.856
with an easy set-up
flow in iTunes Connect.

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.946
App analytics - we're
very excited about this.

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:06.596
This is the best end to end
view of your app with data

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:08.106
that only Apple can provide.

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:14.936
[ Applause ]

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:17.886
And last, TestFlight
beta testing.

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:22.546
[ Applause ]

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:24.096
We're very excited about this.

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:26.846
Give you a little
more insight and depth

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:29.736
into what we have planned
for TestFlight beta testing.

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.396
So we start with the Home page

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.996
of iTunes Connect,
an all new design.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:39.096
We have the same sections as
today, with great new icons.

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:42.406
If you have any news or
announcements for you,

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:45.006
like perhaps you haven't
signed the latest contract

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.086
that released, that's going
to go right there on the top.

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:51.596
But we came here to work
today, so let's jump

00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:53.916
into My Apps and
see what we have.

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:56.016
The first thing you're going

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.926
to notice is it's
wall to wall apps.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.946
We're trying to give it
as much space as we can

00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:04.486
for all these apps, fit
more apps onto the page,

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:07.996
at the same time giving each app
a little more space to breathe,

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:12.316
the full name of the app, the
complete iTunes Connect status.

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:14.626
Easier to tell the
difference between waiting

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:16.096
for review and in review.

00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:20.006
Also we've added a little badge
there to show the difference

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.336
between iOS and Mac apps.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:26.796
If you came to the My Apps page
to check on, perhaps the status

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.816
of an app, to see if the "Hair
Salon" app has been approved

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:33.406
and is ready to go, there at
the top we have an iSearch bar,

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:37.716
type in "hair salon," and
all the hair salon apps float

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:38.196
to the top.

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:40.436
I see it's all green;
green is good.

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:42.606
My app's been approved,
it's ready for sale,

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.296
I'm off to go check
and see how it's doing.

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:48.536
We've also added some filtering.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:53.106
You can see there in the
top right-hand corner,

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.306
the search by status.

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:57.636
You can filter - and see I
have 24 different statuses,

00:02:57.836 --> 00:02:59.226
23 are ready for sale.

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:00.636
I have one prepared for upload.

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:02.746
If I want to click on
one of these statuses,

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:04.236
then I'll filter away
all the other apps

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:06.966
and show just the apps with
this iTunes Connect status.

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:10.016
Some of you like the list view;
we've improved that as well.

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:15.716
More apps on one page, the
same search and filtering

00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:18.236
that we've provided on
the icon view also exists

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:18.976
on this list view.

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:23.276
You can sort by the different
column names, change that up.

00:03:23.276 --> 00:03:26.656
And what's great is if you leave
the My Apps page and come back,

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:29.076
or if you sign out iTunes
Connect, when you come back

00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:31.356
to My Apps we'll take you
right back to the list view.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:36.166
We're going to go back into the
icon view and jump into an app.

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:40.156
What we've done here is
combine the app pages

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:41.846
and the version pages into one,

00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:44.016
because at the top
we have the app icon,

00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:48.216
and going across we have
different tabs, we have pricing,

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:51.356
we have In-App Purchases,
manage your Game Center.

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:55.926
We take you by default to the
version tab and to the ready

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:57.416
for sale version of My App.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:01.276
I can see the screenshots
right there in front of me

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:02.936
and other metadata as it goes.

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:05.266
What we want to do is
create a new version.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.246
So we click on the upper
right-hand corner there,

00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:11.096
it's the new version button,
and we're provided with a window

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.046
to enter in our version number.

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:17.866
You'll notice there's no "what's
new" text on this window.

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:20.896
This information is still
required, but we understand

00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:23.656
that you don't always have
all the marketing data ready

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:25.836
when you want to take actions
like create a new version.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.186
And in fact, we've added this
to the new app flow as well.

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:32.246
When you create a new app,
all you need is a name,

00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:34.016
a bundle ID and a SKU.

00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:39.896
[ Applause ]

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:41.806
This is the new iTunes
Connect, right?

00:04:42.556 --> 00:04:44.756
You can come back when you're
ready to do those descriptions,

00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:46.236
those screenshots
and what have you.

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:48.976
All right, so we're going
to create this new version.

00:04:49.976 --> 00:04:54.846
It'll create a new sub-tab
there with the 1.0.2.

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:58.796
It's copied over the screenshots

00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:00.576
from the previous
version, like normal.

00:05:00.576 --> 00:05:01.836
We can see that the What's New

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.456
in this version text
hasn't been filled in.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:05.406
I can fill it in
now, either way.

00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:08.086
I keep scrolling down,
and I see the rest

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:10.556
of my version information.

00:05:10.556 --> 00:05:13.226
I can change that right
now, easy to edit.

00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:15.616
I can save and come back later.

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:22.426
But we came here today to
create the iPad version

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:23.456
of this app, make it universal.

00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:29.366
So I'm going to click on the
iPad tab, and what I need

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.286
for an iPad is new screenshots,

00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:34.426
that's really the only metadata
difference iPhones and iPads.

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:38.956
And screenshots are great:
five snapshots of what's going

00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:40.606
on in my app, right now.

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:45.796
But we also want to give
a more dynamic experience.

00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:47.696
We want to upload
an app preview.

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:50.436
Giving people more insight:

00:05:50.556 --> 00:05:53.246
What is it about my
app that's magical

00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:55.546
that makes people
want to click on it?

00:05:56.436 --> 00:05:57.396
So we're going to go ahead

00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:59.996
and upload this app
preview here as well.

00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:05.286
Now we could do screenshot
1, then upload screenshot 2,

00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:08.836
and then upload screenshot
3, and then upload the video,

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:12.516
but this is the new iTunes
Connect, and we're just going

00:06:12.516 --> 00:06:14.456
to drag and drop all
six files at once.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:06:20.796 --> 00:06:21.406
And in they come.

00:06:21.576 --> 00:06:23.106
You can see the app
preview's going to be first,

00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:25.216
followed by the screenshots.

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:28.646
And what we've done on the app
preview is selected a default

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:29.206
poster frame.

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:32.586
The poster frame is the
image that people will see

00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:35.026
on the App Store before they
click Play on your video.

00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:39.596
If you don't like this poster
frame, it's easy to change,

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:41.706
the new iTunes Connect.

00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:43.836
We hover over the
poster frame image,

00:06:44.356 --> 00:06:49.846
we click edit poster frame,
and up pops the video itself

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:51.956
and the poster frame
that we've selected.

00:06:52.476 --> 00:06:54.356
We can press Play on the
video, find that spot

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:56.446
that we want, we
can drag and drop.

00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:57.456
Anytime we find a frame that we

00:06:57.456 --> 00:07:00.756
like we click set poster
frame, we're off to go.

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:03.746
I know in my case, the frame
that I would like to use is

00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.976
at the end of my video, so I'm
just going to scrub on through,

00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:09.236
find this one that I
like, this is great.

00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:14.266
I click Set as Poster Frame,
and that's all there is to it.

00:07:14.846 --> 00:07:17.176
I'm done. We can clap.

00:07:17.176 --> 00:07:17.806

changes that I want to make,

and click Save, and
I'm good to go.

This is what it looks like in
the App Store, the same idea.

frame video right here,

about the app preview.

see what one looks like.

further enticing people
to download your app.

A few things to mention.

00:08:29.436 --> 00:08:31.506
Remember an app preview
is a UI walkthrough.

00:08:31.926 --> 00:08:32.916
They want to see your app.

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.166
What is it about your
app that's great?

00:08:35.206 --> 00:08:37.586
They don't want to be sold
to it; it's not an ad.

00:08:38.796 --> 00:08:40.856
You can capture this

App previews are up to
30 seconds in length,

00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:54.066
and we accept both H.264
and ProRes content.

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:56.056

Now we move on to App Bundles.

00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:09.456
App Bundles is a great
feature to bundle together apps

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:14.006
of the same kind, giving
your customers and people

00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:15.496
on the App Store just
one choice instead

00:09:15.496 --> 00:09:16.756
of many on what to download.

00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:20.836
The first step if you want to
have an app bundle is, well,

00:09:20.836 --> 00:09:23.566
what apps do I put in my bundle?

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:24.746
So, you have all the apps

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:26.546
in your head whether it's iTunes
Connect, and you're trying

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:28.026
to think about it, you got
to choose some of them.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:28.996
You can have up to 10.

00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:31.876
In this case I'm going
to pick four of them

00:09:32.396 --> 00:09:33.206
and create an app bundle.

00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:34.406
And this is great.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:37.466
It offers more value for
the people on the App Store.

00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:41.066
It's a single install to get
all of your great apps at once.

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:44.456
And we've included in
this Complete my Bundle.

00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:47.696
It's the same feature we
give for music and for TV,

00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:50.146
where if somebody's already
purchased one or more

00:09:50.146 --> 00:09:53.906
of the apps in your bundle, then
they'll get a discounted price

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:56.166
to purchase the rest of your
bundle to encourage them

00:09:56.336 --> 00:09:58.476
to get all of your apps.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.646
[ Applause ]

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:06.576
So that was step one, selecting
what apps go in my bundle.

00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:09.456
The next thing we're going
to want is the metadata

00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:10.606
to show in the iTunes store.

00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:12.546
We're going to need
a bundle name,

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:13.416
we're going to need
a description.

00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:16.006
It's probably going to need
screenshots, app preview,

00:10:16.636 --> 00:10:20.476
got to select categories,
rating, marketing URLs,

00:10:20.476 --> 00:10:22.126
privacy URLs, all
these different pieces.

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:25.866
Because we want to make this
as simple as possible for you,

00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.516
and we realize that we have a
lot of this information already.

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:33.346
So it starts with information
that is specific to the bundle.

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.146
Each bundle will
need its own name;

00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:37.296
it'll need a description
about the bundle.

00:10:38.426 --> 00:10:41.716
Obviously it has its own
price, has its own SKU

00:10:42.956 --> 00:10:46.436
and a marketing URL so you can
market this bundle on its own.

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.526
And then we have
this information

00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:50.656
that comes from the first app.

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:54.996
It was that key app, the
first app for this bundle.

00:10:55.726 --> 00:10:57.826
So the first screenshot
will come from that app,

00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.716
the first app preview
that you see

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:02.046
on the App Store will
come from that app.

00:11:02.306 --> 00:11:04.996
The categories of
your bundle will match

00:11:05.046 --> 00:11:09.246
that of the first app, and the
App Store contact information,

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:11.696
App review information,
all of that will be pulled

00:11:11.696 --> 00:11:15.706
from the first app as well,
as well as the privacy URL.

00:11:15.706 --> 00:11:22.176
The rest of the information from
your bundle will come from all

00:11:22.176 --> 00:11:23.086
of the apps in the bundle.

00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:27.816
If you have three apps that are
4 plus, and one app is 12 plus,

00:11:28.046 --> 00:11:29.676
your bundle will
be rated 12 plus.

00:11:30.786 --> 00:11:33.776
If you want your bundle to be
made for kids, all of the apps

00:11:33.856 --> 00:11:35.886
in the bundle must
be made for kids.

00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:40.946
The rest of the screenshots
and app previews will come

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:43.186
from the other apps in your
bundle - and equal share

00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:44.396
for every app in your bundle.

00:11:44.966 --> 00:11:49.096
And for keywords we'll take
all of the keywords from all

00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:51.316
of the apps in the
bundle and apply those.

00:11:51.626 --> 00:11:53.156
You don't have to
re-enter any new keywords.

00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:58.416
Let's take a look and see how
we do this in iTunes Connect.

00:11:58.536 --> 00:11:59.926
We come back to the
My Apps page.

00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:03.996
We click New App Bundle.

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:06.856
The first thing we want to enter

00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:11.006
as our new app bundle
name, "Toca Toy Box."

00:12:11.776 --> 00:12:12.976
We start selecting the apps.

00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:20.266
At this point I realize, OK,

00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:22.446
this first app is
important, it's key.

00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:25.486
So, I know which four I
want in my app bundle,

00:12:26.286 --> 00:12:29.586
but I would like to make
this one that primary app.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.336
Once I've selected my apps,

00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:36.456
I can now see I have my
screenshots have already been

00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:38.336
populated for me
from that first app.

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:43.586
I can fill in the app bundle
description, the marketing URL.

00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:46.926
Privacy policy URL
has already been done.

00:12:47.486 --> 00:12:49.506
Let's scroll down further.

00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:52.276
I need to select a price tier.

00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:56.466
It needs to be a discounted
price tier, less, one tier less

00:12:56.466 --> 00:12:58.816
than the sum of all the apps in
the bundle - it is a discount -

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:01.346
as well as give it a SKU.

00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:03.226
Then the rest of the information
has already been filled in:

00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:05.616
categories, the rating.

00:13:06.436 --> 00:13:07.716
I'm good to go, at
this point I'm done.

00:13:07.716 --> 00:13:09.926
I've created my app bundle,
I'm ready to submit it.

00:13:10.936 --> 00:13:13.226
One thing to remember
with app bundles is

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.176
that once they've been submitted

00:13:14.176 --> 00:13:15.866
to the App Store you
can't change the apps

00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:17.516
in a bundle; they're immutable.

00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:22.476
If you want to make a
bundle with now five apps

00:13:22.476 --> 00:13:23.646
or six apps instead
of this four,

00:13:23.646 --> 00:13:25.276
then just create a
new bundle and submit

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:25.966
that to the App Store.

00:13:26.456 --> 00:13:28.936
Here's what it looks
like on the App Store.

00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:30.426
You can see your app icon.

00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:32.426
You can see all the
apps in the bundle.

00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:36.676
The app preview and
screenshots come down below.

00:13:37.296 --> 00:13:41.286
You can have up to 10 paid
apps in an app bundle.

00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:44.696
You have to give it
that discounted price.

00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:49.506
The first preview and screenshot
come from that first app.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.266
We're going to link
to all the other apps

00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:53.006
in your bundle right
there on the App Store.

00:13:53.886 --> 00:13:55.066
And with Complete My Bundle,

00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:57.026
people who have already
purchased one or more

00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:59.706
of those apps will
get discounted price

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:00.796
to purchase the rest
of your bundle

00:14:00.986 --> 00:14:01.896
and get the whole package.

00:14:02.356 --> 00:14:03.236
And that's App Bundles.

00:14:03.996 --> 00:14:05.826
With that, I'd like to turn
the time over to Trystan

00:14:05.906 --> 00:14:07.086
to talk about App Analytics.

00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:13.656
[ Applause ]

00:14:14.156 --> 00:14:14.856
>> Thank you, Dave.

00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:16.806
My name is Trystan Kosmynka,

00:14:16.986 --> 00:14:18.986
Engineering Manager
working on App Analytics.

00:14:19.506 --> 00:14:22.146
Really excited today to show
you what we've been up to.

00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:24.116
Before we get into it,

00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:26.316
let's talk about what it
takes to build a great app.

00:14:26.516 --> 00:14:28.716
We're all here this week
to learn tips and tricks

00:14:28.986 --> 00:14:29.936
on building a great app.

00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:32.866
We know that it all
starts with a great idea.

00:14:34.096 --> 00:14:35.526
Every app that's
in the store today

00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.936
that achieves great success
starts with a great idea,

00:14:38.276 --> 00:14:41.846
and how do you capture that and
present that to your customers?

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.826
You do that with
thoughtful design,

00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:46.576
pixel-perfect design,
intuitive design.

00:14:46.976 --> 00:14:49.326
You focus on really
complete flows

00:14:49.326 --> 00:14:50.946
that make sense to
your customers.

00:14:51.396 --> 00:14:55.126
We write bug-free code, we
all here write bug-free code.

00:14:56.466 --> 00:14:57.436
Worked on my device.

00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:01.356
We test, and we test,
and we test some more.

00:15:01.546 --> 00:15:04.626
So, we have automated unit
tests, automated UI tests.

00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:05.356
We're going to talk more

00:15:05.356 --> 00:15:07.466
about our beta testing
service as well.

00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:09.716
This is a really
important part of writing

00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:11.506
and creating a great app.

00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:13.836
Finally, we submit to the store.

00:15:14.096 --> 00:15:17.176
These are all pieces,
developer responsibility

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:18.146
that we're familiar with today,

00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:21.506
and Apple does a fantastic job
supporting you throughout this

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:24.686
process, with great tools,
with Xcode, more great tools

00:15:24.686 --> 00:15:26.056
and services we're
talking about today.

00:15:26.056 --> 00:15:29.646
But we know that our job
is not done as developers.

00:15:29.776 --> 00:15:31.056
Once we submit to the store,

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:33.116
there's this whole new
set of responsibilities.

00:15:33.726 --> 00:15:34.416
We're not all done.

00:15:35.876 --> 00:15:37.406
And this is after launch.

00:15:37.406 --> 00:15:39.426
And this is what App
Analytics is all about.

00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:43.276
These new responsibilities
can influence this chart.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.836
Hopefully, if you have
apps in the store,

00:15:46.116 --> 00:15:47.226
this chart is familiar to you.

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:50.136
You have your downloads
over time, it's increasing,

00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:53.546
and you see points of
acceleration over time as well.

00:15:53.706 --> 00:15:55.796
Let's talk about what it
takes to influence that,

00:15:56.096 --> 00:15:57.736
and why App Analytics
is really important.

00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:01.366
So first, our App
Store presence.

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:04.356
We can see on this chart now I
have that orange dot and I see

00:16:04.356 --> 00:16:10.506
that App Store presence really
can influence my downloads.

00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:15.806
App Store presence is your name,
your description, your keywords.

00:16:15.926 --> 00:16:17.386
We have these App Bundles now.

00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:19.706
We also have our
App Store previews.

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:22.796
These are great ways to get
your app to have more downloads,

00:16:22.796 --> 00:16:25.556
more customers, more
people using your app.

00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:26.656
Marketing.

00:16:26.976 --> 00:16:29.066
Once you have a great app
you want to get the word out.

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.776
As developers, we don't
just submit to the store,

00:16:31.776 --> 00:16:33.416
we submit it to our
social networks,

00:16:33.416 --> 00:16:34.946
we send it to our
friends and our family.

00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:37.676
We create a home page,
potentially some newsletters.

00:16:38.056 --> 00:16:39.616
Marketing's a really
important piece.

00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:41.236
New updates.

00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:43.966
When you're building an
application and submit it

00:16:43.966 --> 00:16:47.046
to the store your
customers crave new content.

00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:54.706
New levels, new ways to engage
existing customers and new ways

00:16:54.706 --> 00:16:55.876
to attract more customers.

00:16:56.156 --> 00:17:00.046
Your app needs to stay fresh and
unique, and to do that you go

00:17:00.046 --> 00:17:02.306
through this constant
release and build cycle.

00:17:02.766 --> 00:17:05.126
Next is advertising.

00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:08.506
Advertising and marketing
are often used

00:17:08.566 --> 00:17:09.976
in the same vocabulary,

00:17:10.276 --> 00:17:11.566
but advertising's a
little bit different.

00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:15.406
As a developer you may choose
to pay for advertising,

00:17:15.406 --> 00:17:16.415
and that's a big decision.

00:17:16.695 --> 00:17:19.846
You want to know if it was worth
the advertising investment,

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:21.606
if you got a nice
return on that.

00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:24.846
App Analytics is there to help
you inform those decisions.

00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:32.156
All of these dots, all these
lines, you want to monitor,

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:34.916
measure and see how
they're changing over time,

00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:37.636
and App Analytics is there
to provide those answers.

00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:40.136
And that is why we
use App Analytics.

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:42.186
Because App Analytics
provides answers.

00:17:43.526 --> 00:17:46.986
It helps you answer questions
like, "How's my app doing?

00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:51.586
Are people returning to my app?"

00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:53.606
Are people converting on
your In-App Purchases?

00:17:55.766 --> 00:17:58.916
App Analytics helps you make
good advertising decisions.

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:02.436
And this is one I'm
really excited about.

00:18:02.496 --> 00:18:04.736
App Analytics helps you
reveal missed opportunities.

00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:06.746
With App Analytics you can see

00:18:06.746 --> 00:18:09.576
that your App Store presence
is great in the United States,

00:18:09.576 --> 00:18:12.156
and a lot of customers
are looking at your app

00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:13.946
in the United States
and actually turning

00:18:13.946 --> 00:18:16.976
into real customers as
opposed to potential customers.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.696
The same may not be
the case in Germany.

00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:24.446
With App Analytics we can see
that the potential customers

00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:27.566
in Germany can become
actual customers if we focus

00:18:27.566 --> 00:18:30.366
on our German App Store
presence, localization,

00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:33.236
really understanding the German
culture and understanding

00:18:33.236 --> 00:18:37.826
that marketing to Germany may be
a completely different animal,

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.836
and we can do that with
our App Store presence,

00:18:40.046 --> 00:18:42.256
and App Analytics can
point out those areas.

00:18:43.436 --> 00:18:46.886
Finally, after we launch, it's
all about building a better app,

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:49.626
and App Analytics is there
to tell us and point us

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:50.776
in the right direction
to do that.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.386
That is why App Analytics
is important.

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:59.466
So with that, how do we
look at this at Apple?

00:18:59.466 --> 00:19:01.626
How are we looking at App
Analytics as a product

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:03.146
in the service for
app developers?

00:19:03.556 --> 00:19:06.746
We're focusing on this concept
of the customer lifecycle,

00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:10.026
and this involves
acquisition to engagement.

00:19:10.026 --> 00:19:11.826
We want you as developers
to be covered

00:19:11.826 --> 00:19:13.556
from the point your
app hits the store

00:19:13.556 --> 00:19:15.416
to the point your
customers are using the app.

00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:17.656
And let's look at that from
the customer's perspective.

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:19.526
And we start with
our first measure.

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:21.516
Here is your App
Store product page.

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:24.586
We have "Trip Guider," an app we
made up for this presentation.

00:19:25.586 --> 00:19:27.756
The first thing we see
is App Store views.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:30.876
We're really excited that for
the first time Apple's providing

00:19:30.876 --> 00:19:33.826
you developers with a view
of your App Store Views.

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:34.956
All - thank you.

00:19:35.516 --> 00:19:39.806
[ Applause ]

00:19:40.306 --> 00:19:41.806
This is data only
Apple can provide.

00:19:41.926 --> 00:19:44.466
It comes straight from the
App Store to you developers.

00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:48.436
Next we have App
units and sales.

00:19:49.426 --> 00:19:52.686
This data here gets tracked any
time a potential customer turns

00:19:52.686 --> 00:19:53.916
into an actual customer

00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:56.296
and touches your Buy button
inside your product page.

00:19:56.766 --> 00:19:58.986
You have this data today
in Sales and Trends

00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:01.866
if you're familiar with iTunes
Connect, but this is different.

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:03.166
We're tying this data

00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:05.086
into a complete picture
with App Store views.

00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:07.946
For the first time you can
see your App Store views,

00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:10.356
and how that drops
for App units.

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:16.036
Next, we've combined App
Store data, Billings data,

00:20:16.036 --> 00:20:17.846
and now we have Device data.

00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:19.306
We have Installs.

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.916
A customer purchases
your application

00:20:22.916 --> 00:20:25.026
but they may install
it on multiple devices,

00:20:25.086 --> 00:20:28.686
and this is why Installs and App
units are two different metrics.

00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:33.376
Once your customer installs the
application and starts engaging,

00:20:33.626 --> 00:20:36.286
we have a new world
with device measures.

00:20:36.586 --> 00:20:39.236
We have Sessions,
Active devices.

00:20:39.846 --> 00:20:40.856
We have Retention.

00:20:40.856 --> 00:20:42.866
We have this concept
of Stickiness as well.

00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:45.246
Stickiness is great:
It's a single measure

00:20:45.246 --> 00:20:48.376
that you can track over time to
insure that you're both growing

00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:49.836
and retaining customers.

00:20:49.876 --> 00:20:52.536
If there's one measure you want
to look at, it's stickiness.

00:20:54.916 --> 00:20:57.976
Finally, if your application
has In-App Purchases,

00:20:57.976 --> 00:20:58.926
we track that as well.

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:02.476
For the first time you can see
the entire customer lifecycle

00:21:02.476 --> 00:21:05.476
from the point the user
became a real customer

00:21:05.986 --> 00:21:07.816
to when they're converting
on Internet purchases.

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:09.786
This concept of average sales,

00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:13.096
if you're using any
business intelligence today,

00:21:13.096 --> 00:21:15.446
you may be looking at
average revenue per user.

00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:17.006
This is average sales.

00:21:17.006 --> 00:21:17.766
We provide that.

00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:18.956
This in combination

00:21:18.956 --> 00:21:21.026
with stickiness can tell
you a really powerful story

00:21:21.306 --> 00:21:24.486
of how your app's doing and how
your customers are performing.

00:21:25.046 --> 00:21:27.876
So, that's the customer's
view of this.

00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:29.476
Let's look at your
view, the developer.

00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:32.636
We have our App Store views,
we have our App Units,

00:21:33.236 --> 00:21:35.406
Active Devices, Retention,
In-App Purchases.

00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:38.136
This funnel starts to
drop, and that makes sense

00:21:38.136 --> 00:21:40.706
because not every
potential customer becomes an

00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:41.496
actual customer.

00:21:42.026 --> 00:21:46.586
What does this look like when
we start to ask more questions?

00:21:46.626 --> 00:21:48.096
How does this look by platform?

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:52.466
We start to filter this data
by iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch.

00:21:52.466 --> 00:21:56.406
We can see the composition of
our App Store views across all

00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:57.436
of the Apple platforms.

00:21:57.826 --> 00:22:02.616
We can also answer that App
Store presence question,

00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:04.736
"Should I be localizing
for Germany?"

00:22:05.096 --> 00:22:07.226
Here, I can see my
apps reviews in Europe.

00:22:07.226 --> 00:22:10.876
It's quite high, but my app
units in Europe, a little lower,

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.786
and this makes sense as well,

00:22:12.786 --> 00:22:14.256
and there's an opportunity
there.

00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:17.596
This is where analytics can help
you reveal missed opportunities.

00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:20.166
If we just localize our app,

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:21.746
potentially we can
get more app units

00:22:22.026 --> 00:22:25.426
and that will help us get more
active devices, more retention,

00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:26.836
more In-App Purchases.

00:22:27.236 --> 00:22:29.146
Maybe it's that simple,
and we don't have

00:22:29.146 --> 00:22:31.236
to release another
version of our app

00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:32.896
to get more downloads
in Germany.

00:22:33.466 --> 00:22:36.136
So this is great.

00:22:36.706 --> 00:22:38.426
Let's talk about what
it actually looks like

00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:40.496
and show you guys what
we've been working on.

00:22:40.496 --> 00:22:41.356
I think that's why we're here.

00:22:43.486 --> 00:22:45.976
App Analytics shows up as a
new feature inside the new

00:22:45.976 --> 00:22:46.686
iTunes Connect.

00:22:48.046 --> 00:22:49.746
It's here beside My Apps.

00:22:50.996 --> 00:22:52.326
The first view that we see

00:22:52.326 --> 00:22:55.606
when we click inside
Analytics is our App List.

00:22:55.856 --> 00:22:58.036
This is the older view of
your entire mobile business.

00:22:58.416 --> 00:23:00.586
Here, I can see my "Trip
Guider" app at the top.

00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:03.416
I can see all of my
other apps in my suite.

00:23:03.626 --> 00:23:05.346
I can see filters.

00:23:05.736 --> 00:23:09.526
I can see the ability to
change my time, my date.

00:23:10.376 --> 00:23:11.476
Let's look at these metrics.

00:23:11.546 --> 00:23:14.016
So, here is the key
vitals for an application.

00:23:14.576 --> 00:23:16.016
Going from the left
to the right,

00:23:16.056 --> 00:23:17.556
I see that lifecycle again.

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:18.406
It's consistent.

00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:20.826
Start with My App Store
views and then My App Units.

00:23:21.226 --> 00:23:24.026
I see my Sessions and my Sales.

00:23:24.026 --> 00:23:30.016
See if they're rising,
falling in this period.

00:23:30.106 --> 00:23:32.336
I hover over these, I get
tool tips telling me what the

00:23:32.336 --> 00:23:33.566
previous period was as well.

00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:35.496
I can select one.

00:23:35.756 --> 00:23:38.176
Selecting one of these brings us
into the heart of this product

00:23:38.176 --> 00:23:39.306
which is our Metrics Page.

00:23:39.986 --> 00:23:42.006
The first thing you'll
notice is that great trend.

00:23:42.076 --> 00:23:43.716
We can see how we're
doing over time

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:46.516
and this situation we're
looking at, data from May.

00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:50.336
I can see over May that my
application is increasing

00:23:50.336 --> 00:23:51.926
in App Store views,
which is awesome.

00:23:52.366 --> 00:23:54.156
I can also change
my interval below.

00:23:54.156 --> 00:23:56.746
I can change this from
Days to Weeks to Months.

00:23:57.916 --> 00:23:59.406
Let's talk about
those measures again.

00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:01.946
Here, I have those
lifecycle metrics.

00:24:01.946 --> 00:24:04.186
I have my Sales, my Store Data.

00:24:04.656 --> 00:24:07.006
I have my Engagement
Data, my Device Data.

00:24:07.006 --> 00:24:09.866
I can select any of these
and change the chart.

00:24:10.406 --> 00:24:13.406
Let's look at breaking this
down by a particular platform.

00:24:13.516 --> 00:24:17.596
I select View By and now I can
see how this actually looks

00:24:18.176 --> 00:24:20.306
across all of the Apple devices.

00:24:20.306 --> 00:24:24.576
I can see my iPhone, my iPad,
my iPod touch, and it looks

00:24:24.576 --> 00:24:26.526
like the trend is about
the same on all of them.

00:24:26.526 --> 00:24:27.996
They're all performing
equally in this case.

00:24:27.996 --> 00:24:28.386
It's great.

00:24:28.986 --> 00:24:31.726
But a customer can't
have an iPhone

00:24:31.896 --> 00:24:34.306
and an iPad at the same time.

00:24:34.416 --> 00:24:35.516
They're not the same device.

00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:36.556
They're two different devices.

00:24:36.956 --> 00:24:38.856
So, we look at that
as a stacked area.

00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:42.966
I go to Chart Type, I select
Stacked Area, like that.

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:47.436
I can now see the composition
of iPhone, iPod, iPod touch,

00:24:47.646 --> 00:24:50.106
and the sum of these
will equal 100 percent

00:24:50.106 --> 00:24:51.436
of whatever metric
I'm looking at.

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:54.676
There's different chart types
for different scenarios,

00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:59.326
and looking at App Store Views,
here - Area looks the best.

00:24:59.526 --> 00:25:01.246
We'll choose the
sensible default based

00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:02.866
on the measure you're
looking at.

00:25:04.046 --> 00:25:05.526
Let's swap to another measure.

00:25:05.736 --> 00:25:06.846
Look at App Store Units.

00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:08.596
Here, there's no issues here.

00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:12.616
Analytics is providing an
answer that my conversions

00:25:12.616 --> 00:25:16.416
from page views to App Units
hasn't dropped drastically.

00:25:16.676 --> 00:25:19.056
It's a little bit lower,
but the trend is the same,

00:25:19.236 --> 00:25:20.966
and on both devices
it's the same.

00:25:21.376 --> 00:25:23.146
So, not a lot of opportunity

00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:26.096
to improve my iPad
App Store presence

00:25:26.476 --> 00:25:28.216
because it's performing
the same as my iPhone.

00:25:28.216 --> 00:25:29.486
Maybe I improve them
all together.

00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:33.026
Let's go to another
measure In-App Purchases,

00:25:33.206 --> 00:25:37.256
and this is where our team
decided that on May 15th,

00:25:37.656 --> 00:25:39.866
we would lower the price
of In-App Purchases,

00:25:40.236 --> 00:25:42.806
and as a result, we got
a lot more app purchases

00:25:42.806 --> 00:25:45.566
that occurred, and we can
see that with App Analytics.

00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:47.536
We can see the spike there -

00:25:47.536 --> 00:25:49.516
we can see that across
all platforms,

00:25:49.866 --> 00:25:52.946
it performed much better
as a result of our change.

00:25:55.016 --> 00:25:57.786
We also had intuition

00:25:57.786 --> 00:26:01.266
that changing our In-App
Purchases would help give more

00:26:01.266 --> 00:26:03.526
customers more content,
and that would result

00:26:03.526 --> 00:26:05.886
in more engagement,
more active devices.

00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:10.136
So with that, we select
In-App Purchases, Compare To,

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:15.706
select Active Devices, and now
we see our Active Devices went

00:26:15.706 --> 00:26:17.326
up as did our In-App Purchases.

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:18.426
I can see these layer on top

00:26:18.426 --> 00:26:21.306
of each other telling
me the story that, "Yes,

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:25.616
our changes to In-App Purchases
really did impact Active Devices

00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:26.006
as well."

00:26:26.296 --> 00:26:28.566
We've got more revenue
from our In-App Purchases,

00:26:28.886 --> 00:26:31.766
and we've got more
retention and more engagement

00:26:31.766 --> 00:26:32.856
from our Active Devices.

00:26:33.306 --> 00:26:38.146
So, that's Metrics, and that's
the measures that we provide.

00:26:38.326 --> 00:26:40.196
There's some questions
we haven't answered yet,

00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:43.456
and we're going to
answer that with Sources.

00:26:43.986 --> 00:26:45.226
So, what are Sources?

00:26:45.716 --> 00:26:48.826
Sources are all about
how people find your app.

00:26:49.406 --> 00:26:51.996
As developers, you work
really hard on your app,

00:26:51.996 --> 00:26:56.056
your App Store presence, and
you have no idea right now how

00:26:56.056 --> 00:26:57.686
people are getting to
your App Store page.

00:26:58.096 --> 00:27:00.296
We're excited that Sources
solves that problem.

00:27:01.076 --> 00:27:02.656
There's two types.

00:27:03.336 --> 00:27:07.386
We have websites, and
we have campaigns.

00:27:07.456 --> 00:27:08.726
Websites are really simple.

00:27:08.726 --> 00:27:10.246
It's a link to your
App Store page.

00:27:10.246 --> 00:27:11.756
You're familiar with
these links today.

00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:14.646
Any time you hand a link to
your friends, to your family,

00:27:14.646 --> 00:27:18.026
to your marketing sites, that
link is now trapped in the form

00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:21.446
of a website as a refer,
as a Source, and we can see

00:27:21.446 --> 00:27:22.676
that in App Analytics.

00:27:23.636 --> 00:27:26.756
And Campaigns are that same
link with the campaign ID.

00:27:27.246 --> 00:27:29.086
This is a friendly
link - friendly name

00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:30.366
that you supply to the URL.

00:27:30.806 --> 00:27:32.076
Let's talk about
what that looks like.

00:27:32.676 --> 00:27:33.366
It's really simple.

00:27:33.456 --> 00:27:35.706
This is the URL that
hopefully you're familiar with.

00:27:36.046 --> 00:27:39.006
We add a Provider ID.

00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:41.946
We get this Provider ID
inside iTunes Connect,

00:27:41.946 --> 00:27:44.576
and then you add
your Campaign ID.

00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:47.346
Friendly Name, you want
it as friendly as possible

00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:49.936
because you're going to
view this name afterwards -

00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:53.166
we'll show you that in a second
- inside your Sources Lists.

00:27:54.316 --> 00:27:56.176
If you're using iAd today

00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:58.816
to advertise your
application, this is automatic.

00:27:58.956 --> 00:28:03.086
You do not have to go to iAd
and set up campaign names

00:28:03.376 --> 00:28:05.006
for the purposes
of App Analytics.

00:28:05.326 --> 00:28:06.916
It will all happen seamlessly.

00:28:07.176 --> 00:28:10.096
Any campaign you create in iAd
will be automatically tracked

00:28:10.096 --> 00:28:12.666
and available inside
App Analytics

00:28:12.826 --> 00:28:14.546
and you can really
see the effectiveness

00:28:14.546 --> 00:28:17.236
of that inside App
Analytics without any effort.

00:28:17.286 --> 00:28:19.706
So what does this look like?

00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:21.636
Come here, we select Sources

00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:24.946
and get brought to
the Sources Lists.

00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:27.086
Here, I see my Top Websites.

00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:29.146
Beside that I can
see Top Campaigns.

00:28:29.576 --> 00:28:31.836
I have the same key
vitals that I had

00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.316
on my application list as well.

00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:36.876
We're really trying to reinforce
the story of acquisition

00:28:36.876 --> 00:28:39.456
to engagement and keep it
consistent for you guys.

00:28:39.856 --> 00:28:43.446
I select Top Campaigns.

00:28:43.446 --> 00:28:45.276
I get brought over to
my Top Campaigns List.

00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:48.536
These are a view of all those
friendly names that we set up.

00:28:49.116 --> 00:28:50.716
Let's zoom in on
one of these here.

00:28:50.836 --> 00:28:52.296
I can see "Spring Email Blast."

00:28:52.336 --> 00:28:53.286
That was my friendly name.

00:28:53.746 --> 00:28:56.756
I see My App Store
views, my units, my sales,

00:28:56.756 --> 00:28:58.776
and my sessions,
that same lifecycle.

00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:00.516
This is great.

00:29:00.516 --> 00:29:03.896
We select that, and we're
into this Source Details.

00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:05.886
We think that if
you're marketers,

00:29:05.886 --> 00:29:06.916
you're going to love this page.

00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:07.926
You're going to sit
on this page.

00:29:07.926 --> 00:29:09.346
You're going to share
it with your colleagues.

00:29:10.496 --> 00:29:12.456
We can see all of
those key measures.

00:29:12.456 --> 00:29:13.316
It's a nice visual.

00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:15.396
We see it broken down
over time as well.

00:29:15.576 --> 00:29:17.616
Every day has a bar
on these Key Measures.

00:29:17.866 --> 00:29:19.456
We also see additional measures

00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:21.826
that you can only get
on the Metrics Page.

00:29:22.356 --> 00:29:26.936
You can see this broken down by
different data types as well.

00:29:26.936 --> 00:29:29.476
So, here we're looking for
App Store views by Region,

00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:31.466
by Territory, by Platform.

00:29:32.086 --> 00:29:34.226
Changing those dropdowns,
I can change the measure

00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:36.826
that I'm looking at and see
exactly how this campaign is

00:29:36.826 --> 00:29:39.686
performing, how this
website is performing,

00:29:40.026 --> 00:29:43.146
and what exactly the
customers are doing as well.

00:29:43.676 --> 00:29:47.146
So that's Sources.

00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:49.236
We think that you're going
to love Sources today.

00:29:49.236 --> 00:29:51.256
You know that people are
downloading your app,

00:29:51.346 --> 00:29:52.096
installing the app.

00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:53.906
What you don't know is
where they're coming from,

00:29:53.906 --> 00:29:55.496
and we're solving that problem.

00:29:56.846 --> 00:29:59.956
So, we've answered the question,
how are people doing in the app?

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.926
Are they converting
on Internet purchases?

00:30:02.016 --> 00:30:02.906
Where are they coming from?

00:30:03.466 --> 00:30:06.656
We haven't answered in
detail, "Are people returning

00:30:06.656 --> 00:30:07.936
or are they retained?"

00:30:08.326 --> 00:30:10.156
What does that side of
the lifecycle look like?

00:30:10.466 --> 00:30:11.966
And we answer that
with retention.

00:30:12.706 --> 00:30:15.636
Let's just do a quick education

00:30:15.636 --> 00:30:17.096
on retention, why
it's important.

00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:18.816
This is obvious.

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:21.266
One-hundred percent of your
customers are customers

00:30:21.266 --> 00:30:22.136
on the purchased date.

00:30:22.536 --> 00:30:23.376
It's really simple.

00:30:23.856 --> 00:30:29.796
Moving along, 45 percent
are customers on Day 2,

00:30:30.426 --> 00:30:33.866
35 percent on Day 7, and
20 percent on Day 30.

00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:35.816
Hopefully these numbers
aren't scary,

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:37.836
but there's an opportunity
there.

00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:40.596
You can get them higher
and higher - focus on this,

00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:42.916
it's really important because
if you have no more customers

00:30:42.916 --> 00:30:46.906
at Day 30 or 90, you're
really going to have to focus

00:30:46.906 --> 00:30:49.466
on the next stop or
improving your content

00:30:49.466 --> 00:30:50.456
in your marketing to get more.

00:30:50.996 --> 00:30:53.796
How do we show this in the UI?

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:57.216
Select retention, and I
can see my purchase date

00:30:57.216 --> 00:30:58.976
on the left, May 23.

00:31:00.116 --> 00:31:01.866
I can see my days
later on the right.

00:31:02.076 --> 00:31:06.746
Here I'm looking at Day 7,
and there's a little story.

00:31:06.976 --> 00:31:10.786
So of the active devices
that purchase on May 23,

00:31:11.326 --> 00:31:14.786
18 percent remained
active seven days later.

00:31:14.996 --> 00:31:16.226
This is great - single view

00:31:16.226 --> 00:31:18.886
of how my retention
on May 23 was doing.

00:31:19.386 --> 00:31:22.436
As developers, as
marketers, product managers,

00:31:22.576 --> 00:31:24.386
we want to look at this with all

00:31:24.386 --> 00:31:26.416
of our purchase dates
stacked on top of each other.

00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:27.806
So that's the view
that we're providing.

00:31:28.176 --> 00:31:32.396
The same on May 24th, and
now we show you the rest

00:31:32.396 --> 00:31:33.156
of this matrix.

00:31:33.466 --> 00:31:35.946
So, May 23rd to June 3rd,

00:31:35.946 --> 00:31:39.506
I can see my retention
stacked a single quick view

00:31:39.506 --> 00:31:41.596
of how my Day 7 retention is,

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:45.016
and you don't have
to do anything.

00:31:45.196 --> 00:31:45.886
This is amazing.

00:31:46.046 --> 00:31:47.966
So, we're providing -

00:31:48.516 --> 00:31:54.956
[ Applause ]

00:31:55.456 --> 00:31:59.086
- metrics, sources,
retention, your app list.

00:31:59.526 --> 00:32:00.326
What do you need to do?

00:32:00.946 --> 00:32:05.626
Nothing. There's no SDK,
no third party code running

00:32:05.626 --> 00:32:06.976
in your apps, no
performance degradation.

00:32:07.516 --> 00:32:12.426
[ Applause ]

00:32:12.926 --> 00:32:14.426
You don't have to
write any new code.

00:32:14.656 --> 00:32:18.326
This is not an Apple provided
library that you have to embed

00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:20.436
in your app, and you don't
have to instantiate it,

00:32:20.436 --> 00:32:22.686
initialize it, no
code is required,

00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:25.116
no app updates required.

00:32:25.186 --> 00:32:27.456
You do not have to
recompile, re-sign,

00:32:27.456 --> 00:32:28.836
resubmit your app to the store.

00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:31.676
You really have to do nothing
to take advantage of this.

00:32:32.616 --> 00:32:34.106
We're doing this
because it's all built

00:32:34.106 --> 00:32:36.286
into the App Store and iOS 8.

00:32:36.806 --> 00:32:40.346
Everything from the store
metrics to the sales metrics,

00:32:40.346 --> 00:32:42.246
to the device metrics,
this is all automatic

00:32:42.246 --> 00:32:43.386
in the App Store in iOS 8.

00:32:43.886 --> 00:32:48.146
And what have we kept in
mind while doing this?

00:32:48.376 --> 00:32:52.326
Privacy. So App Analytics has
been a really highly requested

00:32:52.326 --> 00:32:53.856
feature of iTunes Connect.

00:32:54.346 --> 00:32:56.236
We're excited to bring it to
you guys, and we're excited

00:32:56.236 --> 00:32:58.556
to bring it to you with
privacy at the forefront.

00:32:59.336 --> 00:33:02.176
We're not in this
business to sell your data;

00:33:02.586 --> 00:33:03.476
we're not in this business

00:33:03.476 --> 00:33:05.926
to write informative blog
posts about your data.

00:33:06.996 --> 00:33:09.836
Apple is providing App Analytics
as a service to the developers,

00:33:09.836 --> 00:33:12.986
and we love our customers
as much as you do,

00:33:13.156 --> 00:33:15.206
and we respect their
privacy as much

00:33:15.206 --> 00:33:16.576
as we know you would
like to as well.

00:33:17.836 --> 00:33:20.106
Rest assured that as we're
building this product,

00:33:20.106 --> 00:33:23.226
as this product rolls out, the
privacy is at the forefront.

00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:25.606
We're not making any
compromises in this area.

00:33:26.076 --> 00:33:27.146
We're really excited about that,

00:33:27.146 --> 00:33:29.286
and we think that's
a really unique thing

00:33:29.286 --> 00:33:29.996
that we're offering.

00:33:32.246 --> 00:33:34.076
Finally, maybe the
best news: It's free.

00:33:34.696 --> 00:33:35.976
App Analytics is
completely free.

to love the setup

excited about this feature.

bring up Daniel to talk

00:33:58.986 --> 00:34:00.646
about TestFlight Beta Testing.

00:34:03.616 --> 00:34:04.636
>> Thanks Trystan.

00:34:06.026 --> 00:34:07.426
Hi, my name is Daniel Miao.

00:34:07.426 --> 00:34:10.626
I'm a Software Engineer
on iTunes Connect.

00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:14.186
Now, most of you heard during
Tim's keynote on Monday

00:34:14.186 --> 00:34:16.206
that we're announcing
TestFlight Beta Testing.

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:19.346
Well we're very excited to
have this opportunity today

00:34:19.346 --> 00:34:21.696
to bring you more details
about this great feature.

00:34:23.136 --> 00:34:24.696
Now, before we get started,

00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:29.196
how many of you used
TestFlight in the past?

00:34:29.376 --> 00:34:33.496
Great. Well whether you've
used TestFlight or not,

00:34:33.996 --> 00:34:35.456
I'm sure we can all agree

00:34:36.226 --> 00:34:39.485
that great beta testing
tools go a long way.

00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:47.206
We'd all like to see less
of these, and more of these.

00:34:47.446 --> 00:34:51.576
So before we get into the
details, let's talk a little bit

00:34:51.576 --> 00:34:53.866
about the history of
beta distribution.

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:56.775
In the beginning,

00:34:57.136 --> 00:35:02.486
beta distribution
looked a lot like this.

00:35:04.016 --> 00:35:06.286
Whenever you wanted to test
your app on your device,

00:35:06.766 --> 00:35:08.846
you would connect your
device to your computer,

00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:11.476
transfer your binary
over and test from there.

00:35:12.186 --> 00:35:15.696
At some point you probably
decided it'd be helpful

00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.496
to have others also take a look

00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:19.576
at your app before you
publish it to the App Store.

00:35:20.926 --> 00:35:22.556
So each time you
wanted to add a tester,

00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:25.196
you would ask the tester
for the device UDID.

00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:28.116
You would go to the
developer portal,

00:35:28.156 --> 00:35:30.096
set up provisioning profiles.

00:35:30.096 --> 00:35:34.346
And then you would send
your tester the binary.

00:35:34.346 --> 00:35:36.896
They would connect their
device to their computer,

00:35:37.136 --> 00:35:39.656
transfer the binary over,
and they would start testing.

00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:41.816
Of course you would
have to do this

00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:43.466
for every single
one of your testers.

00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:47.436
So, what do we do for
you during this period?

00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:50.386
How did we change your beta
distribution experience?

00:35:50.776 --> 00:35:54.916
Well we went from this, to this.

00:35:54.916 --> 00:36:00.026
We think we can do better.

00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:02.846
With the new TestFlight
Beta Testing platform,

00:36:03.936 --> 00:36:15.146
you can distribute your apps
to not one, not 100, not 500,

00:36:16.826 --> 00:36:21.686
but up to 1,000 testers.

00:36:27.056 --> 00:36:30.096
Now these are testers,
not devices.

00:36:31.296 --> 00:36:36.446
In fact, each of your testers
can test on multiple devices.

00:36:39.996 --> 00:36:42.286
Next, UDID and provisioning
profiles.

00:36:46.216 --> 00:36:47.976
You no longer need
to worry about these.

00:36:48.516 --> 00:36:56.866
[ Applause ]

00:36:57.366 --> 00:36:59.986
All you need to get a tester
started is an email address.

00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:02.086
So let's talk a little bit

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:04.556
about the two sides
of the new platform.

00:37:05.916 --> 00:37:07.576
You start out in iTunes Connect.

00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:09.716
As you work on your project,

00:37:09.716 --> 00:37:11.356
you upload your builds
to iTunes Connect.

00:37:11.356 --> 00:37:15.156
And from iTunes Connect you
can manage these builds,

00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:20.946
manage the testers, distribute
these builds to your testers,

00:37:21.566 --> 00:37:25.066
and as they're testing,
you can come back

00:37:25.066 --> 00:37:27.246
to get insight into
their activity.

00:37:30.376 --> 00:37:33.986
Now once your testers receive
an invitation to TestFlight,

00:37:34.826 --> 00:37:40.056
I mean to to test your app, they
download the TestFlight iOS app,

00:37:40.056 --> 00:37:43.196
and from here they can
manage what apps they want,

00:37:43.196 --> 00:37:43.786
they're testing.

00:37:45.526 --> 00:37:47.696
They can perform one-tap
installs and updates,

00:37:47.736 --> 00:37:51.546
and they can send you feedback.

00:37:53.616 --> 00:37:57.896
So, while we were working on
these features, we discovered

00:37:57.896 --> 00:38:01.416
that building great apps
requires a flexible process,

00:38:02.226 --> 00:38:05.066
everything from iterating
with your development team

00:38:05.066 --> 00:38:07.306
to distributing to
a wider audience,

00:38:08.226 --> 00:38:10.766
so we came up with
internal and beta testers.

00:38:12.236 --> 00:38:16.326
Now internal testers are made
up of your iTunes Connect users.

00:38:16.806 --> 00:38:21.756
A beta tester is anyone
with an email address.

00:38:22.106 --> 00:38:26.586
You can have up to 25
internal testers and up

00:38:27.436 --> 00:38:30.196
to 1,000 beta testers.

00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:35.406
As you upload builds
to iTunes Connect,

00:38:35.526 --> 00:38:38.126
your internal testers
will have access

00:38:38.126 --> 00:38:43.446
to these builds right away, and
beta app review will be required

00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:45.366
to unlock your 1,000 testers.

00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:48.736
But while your build is in
review, you can continue

00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:51.586
to upload new builds, and your
internal testers can continue

00:38:51.586 --> 00:38:53.496
to test, and you can continue

00:38:53.496 --> 00:38:55.606
to manage your testers
in iTunes Connect.

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:00.496
Finally, Sandbox Accounts.

00:39:00.646 --> 00:39:04.626
As each of your testers
signs into the iOS App

00:39:04.626 --> 00:39:09.176
for the first time, they'll
automatically have a Sandbox

00:39:09.176 --> 00:39:11.046
Account created for them.

00:39:11.476 --> 00:39:13.426
What this means is that
you don't need to come

00:39:13.426 --> 00:39:15.556
into iTunes Connect anymore
to create test accounts.

00:39:16.476 --> 00:39:18.526
We want your testers to be
able to test all aspects

00:39:18.526 --> 00:39:21.296
of your application
including in-app purchases.

00:39:22.876 --> 00:39:25.706
So let's see what
this all looks like.

00:39:27.976 --> 00:39:31.246
Here we are, we're back
on the version page

00:39:31.246 --> 00:39:35.376
of the new iTunes Connect, and
you'll notice a Prerelease tab.

00:39:35.926 --> 00:39:39.656
If you click this, we'll
see a list of the builds

00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:41.016
that we uploaded in Xcode.

00:39:41.936 --> 00:39:44.746
So let's say you want to
test build number 103.

00:39:45.996 --> 00:39:48.416
In order to do this, we
first have to enter metadata

00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:50.826
for our testers so they
have something to see

00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:51.916
when they receive
their invitation.

00:39:54.576 --> 00:39:59.786
So we click into this build, we
enter things like a description,

00:39:59.786 --> 00:40:03.086
and we also tell the
tester what we like them

00:40:03.086 --> 00:40:08.146
to test specifically
on this build.

00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:14.346
After we've had this information
inputted, we hit Save,

00:40:14.476 --> 00:40:16.186
and we come back
to the Build List.

00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:21.346
Once we're on the Build
List, we come to the corner,

00:40:22.426 --> 00:40:25.356
we click the Testing
Switch, turn on testing,

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:28.866
and that build is now available
to our internal testers.

00:40:28.866 --> 00:40:33.626
So let's say we want
to upload another build

00:40:33.626 --> 00:40:40.406
to our internal testers, keep
entering, maybe upload one more.

00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:44.856
Now, we're confident that
105 is a build that we want

00:40:44.856 --> 00:40:47.816
to distribute more broadly
to our beta testers.

00:40:48.216 --> 00:40:52.166
In order to do this, we
click the Submit button next

00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:57.386
to the build, and after review,

00:40:58.036 --> 00:41:00.306
this is now also available
to our beta testers.

00:41:01.336 --> 00:41:04.396
You'll notice here that
there's a 30-day expiration

00:41:04.396 --> 00:41:06.386
on this build so we know
exactly when we need

00:41:06.386 --> 00:41:08.436
to upload the next
build for our testers.

00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:14.416
Now let's take a look at
managing beta testers.

00:41:18.856 --> 00:41:20.896
Here we are on the
Beta Testers list.

00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:25.046
We see everybody that
we added or invited.

00:41:25.856 --> 00:41:26.836
We see what they're doing.

00:41:27.476 --> 00:41:29.826
We can see that some of our
testers have installed the app

00:41:29.826 --> 00:41:30.966
and they're already testing.

00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:34.086
Some of them have
accepted the invite

00:41:34.086 --> 00:41:35.536
but haven't installed yet,

00:41:36.616 --> 00:41:39.776
and some have not even
accepted the invitations yet.

00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:43.046
For the ones who have installed,
we see the latest build

00:41:43.046 --> 00:41:43.806
that they've installed.

00:41:43.806 --> 00:41:50.006
And if we want to add another
tester, we come up here

00:41:50.006 --> 00:41:52.726
to the top, we click
the Plus button,

00:41:53.296 --> 00:41:58.686
add a few email addresses,
hit Submit

00:41:58.686 --> 00:42:02.036
and those testers
are ready to go.

00:42:02.256 --> 00:42:03.536
So that's iTunes Connect side.

00:42:04.236 --> 00:42:06.866
Now let's take a look at the
tester experience in iOS.

00:42:07.346 --> 00:42:09.756
Here we are on the device.

00:42:10.196 --> 00:42:12.696
This is the "Mail" app,
and this is an invitation

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:14.316
that we received
from a developer.

00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:17.846
We see the name of the app that
we've been invited to test,

00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:21.146
and we see a link that
says, open in TestFlight.

00:42:21.146 --> 00:42:24.646
So let's go ahead and tap that.

00:42:24.846 --> 00:42:26.826
Here we are in the
TestFlight app;

00:42:27.446 --> 00:42:32.786
from here we can install our
app, and once we've done that,

00:42:32.786 --> 00:42:35.766
we can just start testing.

00:42:35.846 --> 00:42:38.426
Few things to note here
is the Send Feedback link.

00:42:39.956 --> 00:42:43.666
You, as a tester, can
tap this to send feedback

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:44.766
to your developer via email.

00:42:47.036 --> 00:42:49.076
There's also the What to
Test section, which we talked

00:42:49.076 --> 00:42:52.976
about earlier, the developer
telling us what they like us

00:42:52.976 --> 00:42:56.976
to test specifically
on the latest build.

00:42:57.776 --> 00:43:00.216
Now if we tap the TestFlight
link in the top corner,

00:43:00.216 --> 00:43:04.666
this will take us
back to a list of apps

00:43:04.666 --> 00:43:05.766
that we're actively testing.

00:43:05.826 --> 00:43:09.166
From here we can open any of
these apps, we can take a look

00:43:09.166 --> 00:43:10.656
at What to Test notes
and we can look

00:43:10.656 --> 00:43:11.716
at the version we're testing.

00:43:11.716 --> 00:43:18.416
Now let's go back to the
Home screen for a minute.

00:43:18.566 --> 00:43:20.446
Here, we see the
app we've installed,

00:43:20.446 --> 00:43:24.066
and we'll see a badge, a little
orange badge next to the name

00:43:24.066 --> 00:43:26.946
of the app that we
just installed.

00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:29.796
This indicates that this app
is currently being tested;

00:43:29.796 --> 00:43:33.646
it's a beta build of the app.

00:43:33.916 --> 00:43:35.216
And oh, what's this?

00:43:35.986 --> 00:43:36.916
We got a notification.

00:43:36.916 --> 00:43:40.076
This is telling us that
there's a new build available

00:43:40.076 --> 00:43:40.776
for us to test.

00:43:41.696 --> 00:43:45.916
So if you tap that,
it'll take us back

00:43:45.916 --> 00:43:47.826
into the app, into TestFlight.

00:43:48.596 --> 00:43:54.216
From here we can update the
app, and we're on our way.

00:43:54.216 --> 00:43:59.546
And that's TestFlight,
the iOS App.

00:44:01.516 --> 00:44:05.856
So in summary, we can have
up to 1,000 testers for each

00:44:05.856 --> 00:44:09.446
of our apps with beta testing.

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:12.676
We no longer need to manage
UDID's or provisioning profiles.

00:44:13.156 --> 00:44:16.766
We can perform one-tap
installs and updates.

00:44:20.136 --> 00:44:22.936
Sandbox Accounts are
automatically created

00:44:24.386 --> 00:44:26.386
for our testers to be able
to test, and our purchases,

00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:30.616
and is all new TestFlight
for iOS.

00:44:30.746 --> 00:44:34.126
And that's Beta Testing.

00:44:34.566 --> 00:44:35.966
Back to Dave.

00:44:36.516 --> 00:44:43.406
[ Applause ]

00:44:43.906 --> 00:44:45.526
>> All right, thank you Daniel.

00:44:46.096 --> 00:44:51.836
We have a few things to wrap
up here before we conclude.

00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:55.366
Every year we ask App
Review if you had a few tips

00:44:55.366 --> 00:44:57.016
and tricks we can
give to developers

00:44:57.576 --> 00:44:59.846
at a developers' conference,
what would they be?

00:45:00.646 --> 00:45:02.286
App Review does a great job.

00:45:02.286 --> 00:45:04.116
I looked right before
I got on stage.

00:45:04.186 --> 00:45:07.276
Ninety-four percent of all
updates review within five days.

00:45:08.076 --> 00:45:09.306
And here are some suggestions

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:13.476
that can help get your
app through app review.

00:45:13.646 --> 00:45:15.836
Number 1, app name
versus keywords:

00:45:17.186 --> 00:45:20.256
Your app name is not place to
list all those different words

00:45:20.256 --> 00:45:23.086
that you want people to search
on so they can find your app.

00:45:23.746 --> 00:45:27.086
That's what keywords are for.

00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:32.766
IDFA, if you serve ads, then
ads must be present in your app.

00:45:34.996 --> 00:45:38.256
The description and screenshots
must match your app -

00:45:38.686 --> 00:45:41.266
and I would add to this -
App Preview will probably be

00:45:41.266 --> 00:45:42.076
on this list next year.

00:45:43.556 --> 00:45:45.166
When you're ready to
submit In-App Purchases

00:45:45.306 --> 00:45:47.606
for review you need to
make sure that all aspects

00:45:47.606 --> 00:45:48.656
of the In-App Purchase work.

00:45:49.226 --> 00:45:50.656
If you need a service
up and running

00:45:50.656 --> 00:45:53.156
so the auto renewables work,
that needs to be ready,

00:45:54.616 --> 00:45:56.696
not when your In-App Purchase
is live on the App Store

00:45:56.696 --> 00:45:58.686
but when you submit
it to App Review.

00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:01.636
If your app gets
metadata rejected,

00:46:02.786 --> 00:46:05.026
and you submit it again
without making a change

00:46:05.026 --> 00:46:09.366
to that metadata, it will just
get rejected a second time.

00:46:09.546 --> 00:46:13.416
I say that because they say it
happens - just a friendly note.

00:46:14.886 --> 00:46:17.826
As always, make sure you have
rights for all the content,

00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:19.386
the keywords in your app.

00:46:20.466 --> 00:46:23.426
This would apply to screenshots,
app previews, anything.

00:46:23.966 --> 00:46:26.396
And lastly, testing.

00:46:27.436 --> 00:46:30.426
I'm very happy this
has lowered itself

00:46:30.426 --> 00:46:31.466
down on the list this year.

00:46:31.996 --> 00:46:37.126
One thing of note is that, if
you're building an iPhone app,

00:46:37.746 --> 00:46:39.836
it needs to also
work on an iPad.

00:46:40.386 --> 00:46:44.846
Not to be outdone, the Apps
Mission Team said, "Hey,

00:46:44.846 --> 00:46:48.636
we have some suggestions, want
to help people some things

00:46:48.636 --> 00:46:52.916
to think about before they
submit their app to App Review".

00:46:52.916 --> 00:46:55.426
IDFA again - answers
these questions correctly

00:46:55.426 --> 00:46:56.176
in iTunes Connect.

00:46:56.826 --> 00:46:58.386
If you serve ads using IDFA,

00:46:58.386 --> 00:47:01.686
make sure you answer those
questions the right way.

00:47:03.046 --> 00:47:04.266
We get a fair number
of apps delivered

00:47:04.266 --> 00:47:05.556
but don't have all
the right icons.

00:47:06.546 --> 00:47:08.456
Make sure all your
required icons are

00:47:08.456 --> 00:47:10.346
in your project before
you submit.

00:47:11.676 --> 00:47:13.666
Toolchains and bad signature:

00:47:14.076 --> 00:47:17.656
These kinds of invalid binary
messages can all be solved

00:47:17.656 --> 00:47:20.956
by making sure that you
upload and create your app

00:47:21.236 --> 00:47:23.526
in the latest version of Xcode.

00:47:24.186 --> 00:47:26.696
And Mac app sandboxing, if
you're going to send a Mac

00:47:26.696 --> 00:47:29.196
out to the App Store, make
sure you check that box

00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:31.066
in Xcode before doing so.

00:47:31.626 --> 00:47:35.466
A little note about
iTunes Connect for iOS:

00:47:35.466 --> 00:47:38.696
I hope many of you already
gotten the latest update;

00:47:38.696 --> 00:47:39.896
we released it a few weeks ago.

00:47:40.056 --> 00:47:43.456
This was our first foray
or step into the redesign.

00:47:43.896 --> 00:47:47.926
Updated pages, sells and trends.

00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:51.156
Take a look at your five
week, your two week,

00:47:51.156 --> 00:47:54.096
your 26 weeks information.

00:47:54.646 --> 00:47:57.076
New page view.

00:47:57.076 --> 00:47:59.656
iTunes Connect for iOS.

00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:02.376
At the palm of your hand you can
release the latest version live

00:48:02.376 --> 00:48:03.006
into the App Store.

00:48:06.836 --> 00:48:10.576
So today we talked about the
new design for iTunes Connect;,

00:48:11.836 --> 00:48:17.096
a nice new UI as well as
cleaner flows; app previews,

00:48:17.496 --> 00:48:20.616
15 to 30 seconds
of dynamic video

00:48:21.286 --> 00:48:23.166
so you can show what
makes your app magical.

00:48:23.716 --> 00:48:28.856
App bundles: Bundle up to
10 of your apps together,

00:48:30.146 --> 00:48:33.156
providing people in the
App Store with one install

00:48:33.156 --> 00:48:34.736
to get all of these apps.

00:48:35.906 --> 00:48:39.676
App Analytics - this is the
best end-to-end view of your app

00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:41.996
with data that only
Apple can provide.

00:48:43.256 --> 00:48:44.476
And TestFlight Beta Testing.

00:48:44.996 --> 00:48:47.856
If you haven't been beta
testing your apps until now,

00:48:47.856 --> 00:48:51.056
you have no reason not to.

00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:53.226
Just like iOS 8 and
OS X Yosemite,

00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:55.926
these features will be
released later this fall.

00:48:57.396 --> 00:48:59.526
For more information,
you can write to write

00:48:59.526 --> 00:49:01.066
to evangelism@apple.com.

00:49:01.756 --> 00:49:03.466
There's a Contact Us
form on iTunes Connect -

00:49:04.016 --> 00:49:05.336
this really is the best way

00:49:05.336 --> 00:49:07.246
to get your questions
answered by the right person.

00:49:07.436 --> 00:49:08.526
It can take a lot time

00:49:08.526 --> 00:49:10.616
to navigate those
emails based off your

00:49:10.616 --> 00:49:12.346
questions appropriately.

00:49:13.126 --> 00:49:15.466
There's iTunes Connect
Dev Guide you can get

00:49:15.466 --> 00:49:19.366
on developer.apple.com as
well as the dev forms -

00:49:19.676 --> 00:49:20.566
lots of good information there.

00:49:22.056 --> 00:49:24.726
We have some related
sessions later today:

00:49:24.726 --> 00:49:26.046
"Optimizing In-App Purchases."

00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:28.006
If you have any questions
on how exactly

00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:29.956
to use In-App Purchases,
check that out.

00:49:30.696 --> 00:49:32.186
"What's New in iAd Workbench."

00:49:32.706 --> 00:49:37.226
As Trystan mentioned, privacy
matters, so we have a session

00:49:37.226 --> 00:49:41.556
on "User Privacy
in iOS and OS X."

00:49:41.796 --> 00:49:43.486
Tomorrow, "Advanced
User Interfaces

00:49:43.486 --> 00:49:44.436
With Collection Views."

00:49:44.776 --> 00:49:46.726
This is a great session
where we'll talk about that

00:49:46.726 --> 00:49:50.146
and show how we used it in
creating iTunes Connect for iOS.

00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:53.036
And the session I
mentioned earlier about

00:49:53.036 --> 00:49:54.216
"Creating Great App Previews,"

00:49:54.606 --> 00:49:56.006
again right before
the bash tomorrow.

00:49:56.006 --> 00:49:57.626
I encourage you to check
that one out as well.

00:49:58.656 --> 00:49:59.766
And with that, that's
all we have today,

00:49:59.766 --> 00:50:00.856
I hope you have a great day
and rest of the conference.

00:50:00.856 --> 00:50:00.923
Bye.

00:50:01.516 --> 00:50:03.973
[ Applause ]

00:50:04.473 --> 00:50:06.930
