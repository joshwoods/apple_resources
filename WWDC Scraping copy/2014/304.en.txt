Good afternoon everyone.

[ Applause ]

All right. All right. Let's have some fun today. All right. Thank you for coming. This is a session not just creating app previews but creating great app previews. And I really believe that. After this session, I believe you're going to be able to create a great app preview. My name is Paul Turner and I'm from the iTunes Engineering Division. And what that fancy title behind you says, is that I have a job that requires many talents. It's true.

Not only do I run several teams that keep content processing such as your apps, processing and flowing to the store. But in my 10 years at Apple, I've been lucky enough to be able to participate in producing and engineering and launching incredible projects. One of my first projects was with some of these people in the front here, it was actually the original App Store launch. Since then, we've done iBooks Store and HD films and iTunes Extras and LPs and iTunes Match and The Beatles. It's been awesome. This isn't about me.

What's actually relevant to you guys though is that one of the teams that I run is actually the logistics team for apps made by Apple. So, not only do I help engineer and support iTunes Connect but I am a customer of it, just like you guys. All right. So, let's talk about you and your apps and your app previews. First, I want to talk about how content is previewed to customers on the store.

Currently, with our amazing and innovative and boundless music store, we have those great 90-second previews. I love them. I sit and click and buy all day long. And for my favorite store, the film store, we have those great theatrical trailers. And for the TV store, we have episode previews. And for everyone's favorite, the iBooks Store, we have those enticing downloadable samples. So, what do we have for the App Store? This week, we're introducing app previews. So, let's get to know them. Yeah, whoo! You're allowed to clap.

[ Applause ]

This is great. This is good. This is amazing. All right. Let's get to know app previews. This is fun. Let's pick it up where Tim left us on Monday. With that app that he showed, Monument Valley. And let's take a look at the way that it's previewed to customers on the store right now.

It's pretty. All right. So, on the store, on the store's product page, you're going to have description text. You're going to have other information but, you know, a picture is worth a thousand words. Let's look at these screenshots and they're beautiful. They're beautiful. They're gorgeous. It's an amazing app. But I'm curious as a customer, I don't fully understand it. I don't understand how the app functions. This is app previews. So, if a picture is worth a thousand words, what's a video worth? And this is it.

[ Music ]

Right before our eyes, Monument Valley becomes this immersive puzzle game. And you make an immediate emotional connection. And that's app previews. So, I want to start off, get us all on the same page with just some basic information. App previews are up to 30 seconds in length. App previews are not really brand or campaign-focused. They are not full of cut scenes. They're definitely not theatrical trailers. They're just brief videos meant to demonstrate the UI, the features or the functionality of your app.

App previews are made primarily of captured footage. And we're going to show you how to do that live on stage today. And once you're finished producing your app preview, you're going to export out a high-resolution source that you're going to upload right into iTunes Connect very easy. It's going to be reviewed along with your binary. We're going to re-encode it for streaming out to devices all around the world. It's incredible. So, with that, let's talk about the agenda today.

First off, we're going to go over a little bit more of the details in app previews, the characteristics, what makes them different than anything you've really seen before. We're going to help you take that first step. And that's kind of the most important step is, the planning step, how to plan your video creatively and technically.

We're going to show you that capture feature and it's amazing and I love it. We're also going to do a little bit of editing. We're going to show your editing options with iMovie. Next, we're going to show you some composition tips. We're going to demonstrate the uploading right into iTunes Connect. And we'll round out everything at the end with some guidelines. Does that sound good to everybody? Yes, OK. It's OK to talk. It's interactive. All right. Let's talk about those details.

All right. App previews. App previews are a feature of the iOS App Stores. And as you saw on the Monument Valley that Tim showed and we just showed here, app previews are going to show up in the first slot of the new section for screenshots and videos. So, that first slot will be dedicated to app previews and show up on the product page. App previews are device specific, meaning that if you have a universal app, you will upload a distinct iPhone and a distinct iPad video for your app previews.

Also, we're making it very easy. You're going to upload just that single set of videos to your apps primary localization and we're going to disperse them to the other storefronts that your app is for sale on. A couple more details, we need those beautiful widescreens to show off your app preview. So, app previews are going to be a feature of iOS 8 and they're going to display on those iPhone, those widescreen iPhones, the iPod touches, the iPhone 5, the iPod touches, the iPads and the Desktop Store.

One question I get a lot, they're not required, but they're strongly encouraged. And I'm glad you guys are all here today. You've taken the first step. We didn't want to launch app previews until we made everything available and accessible to every developer. And now that we're doing that, we're strongly encouraging everyone to get on board. We really want you to get on board. We're here for the session. We're going to be in the lab. We're here to help you get on board with app previews. We just think they're amazing.

This is my favorite. This is my favorite of all, my favorite. We have native aspect ratio support built in. No longer will you have to stretch or pinch or add that to your videos to fit in a widescreen player. I want that off the screen as bad, it's just burning my eyes. We have native aspect ratio support right in, built right in. So, you get the full UI video in the playback. It's fantastic.

I want to talk about planning next. I'm sure you guys are sitting here. I'm giving you a little bit of information. Maybe the wheels are spinning. Maybe you think about your app. Maybe you're wondering what you're going to do. So, let's talk about planning. Planning is the biggest part about making your app preview. The rest of it we made really easy. So, planning is where you're going to have to start.

First, you're going to have to figure out the goal of your app preview. Are you going to highlight a feature, many features, maybe the utility of your app? Maybe you have a really innovative UI. Start thinking about what your goal of your 30-second app preview is going to be. And a great way to think about this is what makes my app magical or what makes my app magic?

And an easy way to kind of put yourself in that question is, if somebody walked up to you with your app, you know, "Hey, I've got this app." It's your app. What would you want them to say to you about the app? You know, "Oh, I've got this app.

It does this for phone basics." Or, "Oh, I've got this really cool app. It revolutionizes the way I...that" or "What's your plan over there?" "Oh, this new cool new game, it does this and this character does that." What makes your app magical? You know, that's going to make your magical app preview and your app preview magical. That's going to get people to purchase your app.

Just like Monument Valley, you saw those beautiful screenshots and screenshots are a very powerful tool. But now, you have this story to tell. You have this...you have app previews to fill in that story. So, you're going to look beyond your screenshots. How do you tell your story now with these videos? It's fantastic.

A couple more things on content planning. So now, you started to figure out what makes your app magical. You're starting to understand what your goal is. Now, it's time to start listing out these elements, maybe list out the elements that you want to put in your app preview.

If you're an app that's already on the store, a great place to start would probably be a description text, that's probably your first list today. I bet every one of you got bulleted list in your description text right now, you can just steal that, put that in your list. But add to it, start playing with things.

Start thinking about what your app is all about. Or, "Oh man, I spent so much time on this great level. I really want to show this off. Kids love this." Or, "I get so much feedback about this portion of my app, that's a great thing to put in my app preview."

And I-- having said that, now I highly encourage you to make some kind of outline or storyboard. And you see the storyboard that we have up on here-- on the screen. This is for storyboard but we're going to actually show the app preview this is based on in a little bit.

But, it doesn't have to be fancy. You don't have to be a greater drawer. This is a fantastic drawing. [Speaker laughs] It could be on a napkin, it could be on a Chipotle napkin. You know, it doesn't matter what you're drawing it on. It could be a series of arrows and boxes but start storyboarding it out. What do I want to show in my video? How am I going to put the story together, right? And along those lines, you probably want to work with that list of elements, your storyboard and start working with the timing. Remember you have a finite amount of time.

So say, "I like this element, I really want to show off this UI." That takes about 5 seconds to load. Let's start working with the timing here. This is the time in the planning stage. You don't want to get bogged down in the production stage. You don't want to be working on your app preview and still not know what you're trying to accomplish by it.

So, part of the planning stage, and these are all basic things I'm telling here, but I think it's good to remind everyone, it'll get you out of the weeds if you're on the production process. And one last thing on content planning, just like screenshots, you have to disclose all your In-App Purchases.

So, that's a good time in your planning stage to figure out how you're going to do that. If you're going to show the, you know, the sword of thunder and that cost 10,000 coins, you're either going to have to figure out how to disclose that with some kind of textural element or maybe you want to show how that in-app purchase was purchased in your app preview. So remember, you have to disclose all your in-app purchases, plan for it. It's a good tip. All right. A couple of technical things to go over.

If you're a universal app, you might have a great storyboard, might have a great plan. But your iPad app and your iPad version and your iPhone version may have different UI elements that you want to highlight or need to highlight or capture in a different way to edit into your app preview. And the planning phase is good to identify those so you can capture them when you need them to edit them into your production process.

Next one. Oh, this is a good one. You know your customers best, and so therefore, we're going to allow you to pick your language for your app preview. And remember, it goes on to your apps primary localization, but you need to choose a language. Now, yet again, you know your customers best.

If your app's primary localization is Japanese and it's primarily sold in Japan, but yet you know that your customer is expecting an English video, as long as it passes guidelines, we're going to allow it. So, in the planning phase, it's good to figure out what language you're going to use.

This is probably the most obvious thing I'm going to tell you today. The demo accounts, if you're app opens up to a login screen, it's going to be a really boring app preview. So, you're probably going to need some demo accounts, you know. And along those lines, you may need to stage some information into those accounts. If you're a social app, you're going to need to put some social media. And if you're a calendar app, you're going to need to put some calendar information in.

If you're a game and you really want to show off that 4th level that you, you know, kids really love, you're going to have to figure out a way to get to that 4th level. And I caution you, don't stage anything in your app preview that cannot be accomplished in your app. Your app preview has to be represented of the app that customer will buy.

It's just a caution, I know none of you guys would do that, but I just want to warn you about that. Also in staging, it's a good idea, just like screenshots, we can't have any advertisements in the app preview, so it's a good time to stage those out.

Sound good? All right. Let's show you a cool app preview now, enough of me talking. This is a preview from our friends at Toco Boca, for an app called Toca Labs. And they just have put a few captured clips together. They demonstrate their quirky art direction, their fun UI. This is an app that gets kids really involved in experimentation in science. It just gives you a great picture of the app in a brief amount of time. Love to show it to you right now.

[ Music ]

Cool, right? It's really neat. I like it. Yes, please clap for Toca Boca, come on.

[ Applause ]

That's a great app preview. Just a series of clips, it's very basic. My kid is addicted to this app. She loves them, she loves them. All right. Now, I want to move on to my favorite part about this, the capture. And you need a really expensive cable for this and really lots of...no, I'm kidding, you just need a Lightning cable. It's...we've made it so easy, it's amazing. All right. A couple things about capture.

In OS X Yosemite and iOS 8, you're going to be able to hook up your device via a Lightning cable, right to your Mac, open up QuickTime Player and your device's screen output and audio are available as inputs just like a camera would be. Yes, there we go.

[ Applause ]

Yeah.

[ Applause ]

Super easy. I love it, I love it. It's fantastic. All right. So, to do this obviously, you're going to need iOS devices that require Lightning cables. So, that's your iPod touches, your iPhone 5 series, your iPads, you needed the Lightning cable support, it only works over Lightning. But, in true Apple form, it just works. No special modes, no clicking, no shaking it over your head. Stamp on it three times and it works. It's plugin, select it in QuickTime, we're going to show it to you today, it's really amazing. It just woks, I love that. A couple tips for capture.

We want to display the highest quality video and audio to the customers and so we've made this capture tool so that you can capture the highest quality video and audio of your app. You spend a lot of time making...perfecting every pixel in your UI and we want to capture every single pixel and make sure that the customer sees how much love and, you know, everything that you put into your app. So, we're hoping that you're going to use these Apple tools.

A tip just like Toca Boca did there, you can start your capture or, you know, you can edit in from your splash screen. It looks really kind of cool if you want to. But please don't capture straight from the home screen going into your app or if your app has inter-app operability, don't switch back and forth between apps. This is about your single app and its functions, let it shine, capture only your app.

Go slow. I know that 30 seconds is scary to some of you but really, you can make some amazing app previews. We're going to show you a really awesome-- a couple awesome 30-second app previews in a second, but go slow. If your customer can't follow along with what you're doing, they're not going to understand your app preview, they're not going to understand your app, and they're probably going to be discouraged by it, so go slow. Use intentional moves, smooth moves, smooth moves, you know? And there's no film or anything to load into this camera. The only limitation is your hard drive so rehearse it, retake it.

You know, if you flub it and you try and continue on, don't-- don't-- no, no, just stop, retake, rehearse it, retake it. You got plenty of time. Make it look right. This is a face that's now going on your app, you know, for 30 seconds for your customers to see. So, rehearse, retake, have-- you know, take some time. And along those lines, I want to show you a really cool app preview.

This app preview is from our friends at UpTo. UpTo is a calendaring app that deals with the different levels of events in your life. And what they've done is an example of what we like to call a one take. Instead of editing clips together, they've literally taken a one take shot at their app preview.

Click Record, they've added a couple graphics in the front and the back. But they click Record and they go through this nice smooth intentional movements. They've populated it with a lot of, you know, data. They've staged their app really well. And in their one take video, you get a great picture of their innovative UI for their calendaring app. I'll show it to you right now.

[ Music ]

Awesome, right?

[ Applause ]

I love how they synced up the music, I mean, it just, it's got this great feel. You get the whole app, 30 seconds. It's fantastic, which is a great segue into our composition section. A couple tips on composition. You have been developing your app for days, weeks, months, years, you know a lot about your app.

Well, the customer probably doesn't have that same perspective. So, when you're making your app preview, think about their perspective. If you're going to barrage them with a bunch of information or assumptions about what your app does, they might be confused, maybe put off. So, think about your customer's perspective.

And, you know, this is a great, great tip is, you know, use your friends, your family, or everybody at your office. Show your app preview off and look for what their feedback is, you know. See if there's something missing to your story 'cause you might have something in your head that, you know, somebody else doesn't have in their head.

This is a common mistake; a very, very common mistake. If you're going to put text up on the screen, you need to put it up there long enough for people to read it. People do this all the time. They throw a text up on the screen and they don't make it-- you know, they've-- it's gone before you can read it. So, make sure if you're throwing text up there, allow people to read your text.

This one is easy for me 'cause I'm always positive. Stay positive. There's no worst sales pitch than a negative sales pitch. This is about your app and why your app is the best or why your app is awesome. So, don't imply anything about other applications. Just keep it about your app and stay positive. This is real opportunity for your app to shine. A couple more tips.

You may be a cross-platform developer, but for these 30 seconds, you're all App Store. So, go ahead and leave off those platform logos. In fact, leave off the App Store logo, use the 30 seconds for you. We like our logo just and-- it's fine. These are your 30 seconds. Leave off the platform logos. You might have this great idea.

"New for Spring" in your app preview, and then, you know, you think you're going to upload a new binary or upload a new preview and your cat gets sick or your car breaks down and it's eight months later and it's winter or whatever season. And now, it says, "New for Spring," and it makes absolutely no sense. So, keep it timeless. Allow your app preview just to be about your app in some kind of neutral time space.

Straightforward transitions. Now I love a star wipe or barn doors or confetti as much as the next guy. Remember this is about your app, so straightforward transitions are really recommended when you're making an app preview. Straightforward transitions we actually have found just in our tests can actually sometimes be confusing though.

Jump cuts is what we recommend for everyone. You've seen a lot of jump cuts here and I'll show you a couple of app previews that have a lot of great jump cuts. But in a couple situations, we noticed that in jump cutting, you can imply that your app does something that your app doesn't actually do.

So, another great straightforward transition is like a dissolve or a fade-through color to give your user-- oh, OK, this is a fade to another clip. Make sure you don't imply that your app does something that it does not. You don't want to confuse your customers, we love our customers.

My last point is, remember the tone. These aren't in your face marketing videos. This is just simple short app usage videos, they're fantastic. Remember the tone. All right. This is my things to avoid slide, I'll put my deep serious voice on for this. All right. Things to avoid. It's not that serious, don't worry.

Blinking, crazy, flashing, loud, obnoxious things, this isn't the '90s and these aren't banner ads. If they're watching your app preview, they're already on your product page. They've already clicked Play, you don't need a gimmick to draw them in. Please keep it simple. You don't have to do this.

Pricing, if you're going to put pricing in your video, it's going to get lost, it's going to put you into the corner. Remember, your app preview or your app is sold internationally. You may put your app on sale one day. If you block yourself in the pricing in your video, it's not going to make any sense. Leave the pricing out.

These are going to display in your product page. The product page already has pricing. It already has storefront-based pricing. Leave the pricing for the product page. Local-- yeah, you know, local colloquialisms, memes, things like that, references to Game of Thrones that I don't even understand because I don't watch the show. I'm probably the only one who doesn't. But this is about your app preview. It's not about anything that's going on in the media nowadays. So, just keep it about your app, keep it simple.

And here's the big one. You can't put anything-- this is just like screenshots, it's just like your app, you can't put anything in your app preview that you don't have the rights to use. And this includes, but isn't limited to, imagery or photography or text or sounds or music or videos.

If you don't have the rights to use it, do not put it in your app preview, all right. That was as serious as it's going to get. One thing we added in here 'cause we got a lot of questions on it, is narration. Absolutely, it's a powerful tool if used correctly. So, here's a couple of tips.

There is an incredible voiceover community out there. Look for them, they're so talented. Use professional voices. Not everyone has the intonation and clarity for voice over work. Obviously, I don't either, um. But remember, this is a voice now. This is the voice of your app. So, choose your voice wisely. The second one is use professional equipment.

It's available everywhere. Condenser mics, pop filters, just recording studios in general, quiet rooms. Nobody wants to listen to an app preview with a narration on it and they can hear your dog barking at the background. Or maybe for some of our younger developers, you know, "Jenny, come down to dinner," you know.

No, no. And lastly, narration is a powerful tool, but sometimes, it can be overused. You don't want to narrate your entire video, but you want to let your app speak. So, just use narration wisely is what I'm going to say. And having said that, I want to show you a really cool app preview. It's for a game called Leos Fortune which I think, they got a design award this week? Got a design award-- hey, good for them. Really cool.

[ Applause ]

So, they have done something really neat with their narration. They have their character narrate in the intro to their games. So, they integrated that narration with some capture gameplay footage. So, you kind of get a picture of the story of the game as well as the gameplay all in one. Leo's Fortune preview, I'd love to show it to you.

- [Background Music] I used to be Leopold the Golden, but when my fortune was stolen from me, I was only Leopold the Fool. Around me, the world was crumbling. The lands decayed. Order was lost. I am on a journey with one purpose only, to find my fortune and get it back.
- Cool, right? I love that.

[ Applause ]

That was an app preview that I saw and I immediately went and bought the game and, you know, now I'm on like level 12 or something like that. OK. So, to give you a lot of information, but really there's no better way to get to know all this than to demonstrate it. So, what I'd like to demonstrate first is capture. And to do that, I'd like to bring up Mr. John Danty, who is the Senior Product Manager for GarageBand who's going to help us capture some clips for a GarageBand app preview. John?

[ Applause ]

- I'm going to go over our demo machine here.
- I will tune up my iPhone.
- In tuning.
- Well.
- All right. So, we have a Mac Pro under here. It's just a straight Mac Pro and it's plugged into this USB cable, Lightning cable. I'm going to hand that to John. John, what do you have there?
- I have an iPhone 5s--
- All right.
- -- with GarageBand loaded. And I'm going to plug this in.
- Go ahead.
- Like so.
- Like so, that was it.
- That was it.
- All right. That's the end of the demo.
- Thank you and good night.
- Thank you. All right. So, on our box here on our Mac, we are going to open up QuickTime Player. We're going to go up here to File, New Movie Recording. Ah, hello. Look at this. That's couple of handsome guys there. So, right here on the Transport bar is our Inputs menu and you can see John's phone now shows up as a video and audio input. So, we're going to switch it over right now. Ahhh. And now, we're going to switch over that audio, too, because we want to get the great audio out of GarageBand. All right, and I'm going to give you a little sound here, John.
- OK.
- Feel like a warm up maybe?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I'm a little nervous--
- Get your fingers.
- -- get the fingers, you know, kind of thing.

[ Music ]

- Pretty good sound.
- Thank you very much.

[ Laughter ]

Do you have anything--

[ Applause ]

- Thank you.
- Do you have anything less Liberace, maybe a little more Metallica?
- I think so. How about this?

[ Music ]

All right, John. So, now--

[ Music ]

[ Laughter & Applause ]

This is WWDC, not Woodstock.

Oh, yeah.

[ Music & Laughter ]

All right. All right. We're going to do an app preview now.

[ Laughter ]

So John, I was thinking of doing an app preview like a one take first. Maybe we'll do an example of a one take. Is there something about GarageBand that makes it magical, the one feature that really stands out that we could kind of capture in under 30 seconds?

- Well, a lot of users love our smart instruments. But I think the Smart Strings is pretty cool. So, let's show that.
- OK, OK, OK.
- All right.
- Let's get set up here. So, we have our input setup and, I'm just going to click Record, are you ready to go?
- I'm ready.
- OK.
- Here we go. So, I'll swipe through the Touch Instrument Browser, land on Smart Strings. And then I'll play a little didi [phonetic].

[ Music ]

It sounds better when you close your eyes apparently.

[ Laughter & Applause ]

[ Applause ]

- Are you available for weddings?
- And bar mitzvahs.

[ Laughter ]

All right, we just hit Stop on the screen. We're just going to save that out and we will call that the one take right there. Now, it's a good time just to let you guys know, the QuickTime Capture captures at the native frame rate that your app outputs.

So, when you're uploading it to iTunes Connect, we're going to ask you to normalize that to a standardized frame rate. So, that one take video will still need to go through something like iMovie and be exported out to a standardized frame rate before it gets uploaded into iTunes Connect, all right?

- But John, we're going to do a different one. We're going to do a-- maybe a clip-based.
- Yeah.
- So, we've got a song we started in GarageBand already that would be a good soundtrack. And then we could capture some instruments and then edit them all together.
- OK. I'm just going to set right back up here. And check our inputs, all good. And make sure-- I forgot to mention this before, make sure quality is set to maximum. Remember, we wanted to deliver the highest quality video and audio to your customers, all right. So, you're all set, you probably have some audio. You want to play that song just a little bit?
- Yeah, just a little sample here so we can hear it.

[ Music ]

- That's right.
- Snappy number.
- Sounds good, I can dance to it. All right. So, what we're going to do is capture the clips of the instruments used to make this song. So, what's the first instrument we're going to here?
- So, we're going to do a synth base.
- Well, I like this control panel.
- That's kind of cool, right?
- That's really nice.
- Yeah, so we can relive the '80s, right?
- The '80s never die.
- Oh, there it is, yeah. OK, so ready to go?
- I'm ready to go.
- OK.
- So, I'm just going to hit Record. Anytime you're ready.

[ Music ]

- It's like Depeche Mode.
- I love it. I love it. That is fantastic. I'm just going to hit Save and I'm going to call that the bass. OK. How about another one, you got another one in you?
- Yeah, I got another one.
- How about, let's do a synth.
- A synth.
- Let's bring up a synth here, and [Background Music] I can just play that. Now, what's cool here is we have this feature in GarageBand where we can do what's called pitch mode. So, as we play, [Background Music] hopefully we get the blue dots, but you also can slide between the notes.
- I like that.
- Really cool.
- That's kind of neat. That's kind of neat. What about the control panel? Do you have that same control panel?
- Oh yeah. Yeah. So, we pop that open.
- OK. Can we show that possibly?
- Capture that.
- Capture that, OK.
- OK. Whenever you're ready.
- OK. So, control this, tap here and then what do you think, start now?
- That's good, that's good. Go ahead.

[ Music ]

All right, fantastic.

[ Laughter ]

- I said we're going to have fun today, right?
- With pitch mode, you can. You got to play it.
- It's great. All right. One last instrument from John.
- Oh yeah.
- I know you got a concert tour to get to, right?
- Everyone's wondering who the band will be tonight.
- It's you and your iPhone.
- Me and my iPhone. So, yeah. So, let's do the Smart Drums.
- I love Smart Drums. Yeah. So, when we capture, I'll bring the dice in and we'll put it together.
- Easy enough? How does it go?
- Here we go.

[ Music ]

- Cool.
- Move some stuff around.

[ Music ]

- Cool.
- Cool is right. Save and that's QuickTime capture. Can I get a big round of applause for John?

[ Applause ]

- Thanks Paul.
- Thank you so much.
- See you, man.
- Great. OK. So, this is a great transition to where we can now-- We've captured our clips. Let's now open up iMovie and let's just show you how really easy it is to drag those clips in and create your app preview. And pop open iMovie. I've got a blank project waiting to go. Look at that.

All right. We're going to grab those clips that we just did with John. I'm going to drag them in to our event. We have our event right here. This is where we can browse our clips, we can favorite them, we can work with them. And then we have our timeline down here where we can start building our preview, add titles and transitions. So, let's just start with some drums.

These are drums we captured off stage, a little hard to capture in this room with the echo. So, I'm going to drag those in here, make this timeline a little smaller so I can work with it. What was that next instrument? That was the bass. So, I'm just scrubbing along here. You can see I have the waveform view up right here. So, you can kind of see where my audio clicks in. I got...there we go, that's a good amount.

It's the bass right there. And what was next? That was the synth, right, with the cool controllers. Let's get that. Let me grab a little bit of that. That is cool. We have that pause there so, I am going to just slick my way from up. I can see the little-- There we go. We get right as those come in, can I get that hit?

How about four seconds for that. That looks good. OK. We exported out John's song earlier, I put that in the folder too. So, we're going to drag that down into the soundtrack section just right there. Now, I could add maybe some titles to this from the content library.

But I really do like to end on a fade to black in any video that I do. So, let's just drag that on there, make that look really pro. What I want to do also is I want to mute these clips so they don't conflict with that soundtrack, all right? That was it, let's give this a whirl. Are you guys ready?

[ Music ]

How about that?

[ Applause ]

Is that cool? So, cool, I love it. All right. So, we could do-- what we could do for this is we could add a couple more instruments, we could work on our timings, we could fill it out a little and that's actually what we did the other afternoon. I want to show you that. This is a completed app preview made in GarageBand with captured clips. I'm going to show it to you right now.

[ Music ]

[ Applause ]

All right. I can tell by your applause, you approve. So, if you're happy with your app preview, if that's what you love, you're going to go up here to the Share, you're going to export that file, you're going to export that high resolution file and you're going to get it ready to go into iTunes Connect.

But we have already taken the time to do that. We've exported that file out into this GarageBand folder on the desktop. And to show us how to upload these into iTunes Connect, one of my colleagues from iTunes Engineering was Karen Posnansky, who's going to come up and show that to you. Caryn?

[ Applause ]

Hello. I'm Karen Posnansky, Software Engineer at iTunes Connect. I'm here today to show you how simple and intuitive it is to upload your app previews along with your images in the newly redesigned iTunes Connect. So, let's check it out. All right. Let's open up iTunes Connect. And here we are in iTunes Connect. As if creating a new version of GarageBand, as you can see, there's currently only one screenshot.

So, let's add to it. And this is where we add new screenshots and the app preview that Paul and John just created. We could add them the old fashion way with the file chooser. But it would be more fun to open up Finder and simply drag and drop.

[ Applause ]

As you can see, the video ends up in first position followed by the screenshots to its right. The screenshots can be rearranged into whatever order you want by dragging and dropping. Whatever order you choose is the order that ends up in the App Store. The video will always remain fixed in first position just as it does in the App Store.

So, this is all looking really good. But I don't love the poster frame on the app preview. By default, we select a poster frame for you, but if you'd like to choose another one, just click Edit Poster Frame, up pops a dialogue with the video on the left and the currently selected poster frame on the right. To select another poster frame, we can play the video.

[ Music ]

[ Inaudible Remark & Music ]

[ Music ]

Or, we can scrub through the video story frame.

[ Music ]

And set those frame anytime. Or we can get granular and step through forward or backward until we get to just the right frame. I like that one. So, let's choose that one. And once you found the perfect frame, just click Done. And voila, there it is. Once--

[ Applause ]

Once you have your screenshots and your poster frame looking just the way you want, you can click Save and Submit for review. And once the app has gone through the approval process, we can check out what it looks like in the App Store. And there it is.

[ Applause ]

So, simple as that. In just a few minutes, I went into iTunes Connect, dropped some images, dropped a video, set a poster frame. And now, how my app looks to the world is completely different. Thank you. That's all.

[ Applause ]

Thank you, Karen. That was awesome. All right. So, let's go back, just rewind, just a second back to that exporting. We wanted-- yet again, I'm going to reiterate this-- we want to show the highest quality audio and video to your customer. So, we want to-- we will-- we're going to accept. And we'd like you to export out at the highest quality of media.

So, that's going to coincide with the iOS device captures highest quality video settings. And that is for the iPad 900 x 1200 in portrait mode, 1200 x 900 in landscape mode. For the iPhone, in the 4-inch series, that's the 1136 x 640, I guess you can-- bet you can guess what the next one is going to be, 640 x 1136. But also, we know that you guys have some already-- have already captured footage in 1080 workflows, maybe you're in a 1080 workflow already. So, we're going to take variance of 1080 as well for those iPhone dimensions.

And here is some technical data. Don't everybody grab your pen, this will all be in the documentation, although, you can take a picture if you want some poses, my Sears Roebuck catalog poses things like that. A couple takeaways here. We're going to take two codecs that are very familiar to the Apple ecosystem, that's H.264 and ProRes 422 HQ, remember, high quality. We want take the ProRes, so you'd-- highest quality video to your customers. A couple takeaways is the 30 frames per second. We'd like you to upload your sources in 30 frames per second. And we're going to take stereo audio either in AAC or PCM wave.

Basic, all this documentation will be available to you, don't worry about writing it down, I see this guy writing it down, I'm sorry. It's OK. All right. I'd like to end out with a couple review guidelines. Now, the review guidelines will be published as this feature is rolled out.

And obviously, I'm not going to be able to go over every single, applicable review guideline to you. But, I'd like to highlight a few that'll help find you safe passage. Remember things like inappropriate content, trademarked items, all apply to app previews. So, consult the app review guidelines before uploading your app preview. First one, keep it relevant.

If your app has screenshots, or app previews that are absolutely not relevant to your app, it will be rejected. So, don't sneak in a plug for your Uncle Murray's car wash or a, you know, surprise proposal to your fiancee. This is not the time. Keep it relevant to your app. By the way, she said yes and we're married, I know.

Yay, all right. Next one, just like screenshots, you got to keep it 4+. And I know you're sitting there maybe have a game called Mortal Kombat. And that you're like, "Paul, do I have to make it into a tickle fest or something like that?" No. But you're going to have to get creative, you know, what did Spielberg do when the shark didn't work? He made "Jaws" and it was awesome. So, get creative, creative editing, just, you know, leave the violence, those things out. It has to be 4+ applicable to all audiences just like screenshots, easy enough.

All right. Use captured footage. No people in-- you know, videos of people interacting with your apps, no hands in the shots, so let's remove that hand. This is captured footage. You can use some textual elements. You can use graphic elements that highlight points. But, this is mostly about your app and your app preview needs to be made mostly of captured footage. And we've given you those tools. So, use captured footage.

This one, simulated data please, this goes without saying. Please don't use any celebrities, don't use anybody, don't use your neighbor, your friend, the person sitting next to you, anybody that would have issue with use of their likeness in your app preview. You know about Johnny Appleseed, we use it all the time. You need to find your own Johnny Appleseeds and if you're going to use any data in your app preview.

This last one, I've gone over it before, I'll go over it again. You got to identify your in-app purchases, you know, the sword of truth, the missiles in our Touch Fighter app here. You got to figure out a way in your app preview-- if you're going to use those in-app purchase content, you got to figure out a way to disclose them in your in-app purchases, simple as that. Just a couple guidelines to keep in your head, very easy. We want to make this very easy for you guys. All right. Time for a summary. App previews are just 30 seconds of app usage footage. They need to be 4+ and appropriate for all audiences.

Device capture using a Lightning cable, Mac OS X Yosemite and iOS 8 into QuickTime player. You're going to edit on your Mac using iMovie. iMovie will be updated to support those native aspect ratios and device dimensions. For more advanced editing, Final Cut Pro is always a great option. Love Final Cut Pro. And we've made it super easy as Karen showed you to upload them into iTunes Connect along with your binary reviewed. We're going to re-encode that for streaming all around the world.

Simple. I want to close out with a really cool app preview. And this one's kind of personal to me. This one came in and I believe this app also won a design award this week which is kind of neat. This app preview came in and it just touched me. Ever since I was a kid, I was one of those people that would kind of sit and look out of the stars. And everybody does this, right? You've put your finger out, you kind of trace the Big Dipper or you track Orion or something like that.

And this preview came in and it showed me an app that did what I always dreamed I could I do. I immediately-- yet again, immediately run to my iPad, bought the app, went home, sat out on the porch with my daughter. And we played with the stars and this is Sky Guide.

[ Music ]

It's lovely. It's just lovely. Yeah. Yeah.

[ Applause ]

Sky Guide is cool, super cool. All right. If you need more information, please reach out to your evangelist, the amazing, the incredible Rachel Roth.

[ Applause ]

Yes, please clap for her. Documentation will be available. This is actually something you might want to write down or take a picture of. It's a long URL. If you need it, it will be available on the Developer Forum. And we have the Developer Forums as well where you can interact, get information. We have some related sessions, The New iTunes Connect, if you weren't there yesterday, you missed something amazing. But you can always watch it on the replay.

The New iTunes Connect, we got a little preview over here, Karen showed you with the drag and drop interfaces. New iTunes Connect is going to blow your mind. If you're planning on using Camera Capture and you want to integrate that into your apps, there's a Camera Capture session. Watch these all on the replay, really hip, really cool. So, listen, we've given you the tips, we've shown you the technology, you can have the tools. Go on out and make great app previews everybody.

[ Applause ]

Thank you.
