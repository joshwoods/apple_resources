experiences,and Apple Watch comes packedwith many health and safety features,that keep an eye on things for you.One of the most popular is sleep tracking,and we are making updatesto capture more detailed sleep data.We also have other great new additionsto HealthKit this year.We enhanced our APIs to make it easierto query for data with Swift async.We're improving workouts with a richer workout representation.And we're adding support for saving vision prescriptions,including a digital copy of the physical prescription.I'm excited to tell you more about all these updatesand how your apps can leverage them.Let's get started!Sleep is such an essential functionthat allows our bodies and minds to recharge,and I love using my Apple Watch to manage my sleep scheduleand get insights that help me understandand improve my sleep.This year we are making sleep tracking even betterby introducing sleep stages.Apple Watch will automatically trackall the different sleep stages you go throughwhen you're asleep,and this data will be accessible from the Health appand saved in HealthKit.Of course, your app will be able to readand save sleep stages data.Sleep data saved by Apple Watch or your appis represented in HealthKit by category sampleswith the identifier sleepAnalysis.We will support three sleep stages:REM, core, and deep.When saving sleep data to HealthKit,you should make sure to create one samplefor each continuous period of time in a given sleep stage.This is what the sleep sample value enum looks like.We're adding three cases to represent sleep stages,starting with asleepCore,which corresponds to stages one and two of the scoring modelfrom the American Academy of Sleep Medicine or AASM;asleepDeep, which corresponds to stage threeof the AASM scoring model;and finally, asleepREM,which corresponds to the rapid eye movement stage.Now that we added sleep stages,we are deprecating the asleep casein favor of asleepUnspecified,which indicates that the user is asleepbut no sleep stage was specified.With the updated sleep samples enum,it is now possible to save and read sleep stages datafrom HealthKit.We added a new predicate to make it easy to read sleep samplesfor a given stage.Let's say I want to read sleep samplesin the REM stage.First, I create a predicateusing the new predicateForSamples methodwith asleepREM as value.Now, I can start building my query.I create a predicate for my querywith the sleepAnalysis sample typeand the sleep stage predicate.And with this query predicate, I can now create my query.Running the query will give me backan array of sleep samples in the REM stage.However, if you're interested in reading samplesfor all sleep stages, including unspecified,it's important that you update your appto use the new .allAsleepValues when building your predicate.If you haven't looked at HealthKit since last year,this shorter syntax for querying may look unfamiliar to you.Since iOS 15.4,we have updated our query API to support Swift async.Queries are an essential piece of HealthKit,and with Swift async support, they're easier to usewith a more concise syntax.Queries allow you to read various data from HealthKit,using predicates to filter the results,and also watch for new data as it comes in.All queries are subclasses of HKQuery.If I'm interested in knowing the total calories burnedover a certain period of time,a great query to get these computed statisticsis HKStatisticsCollectionQuery.To get the initial results, you would setthe initialResultsHandler closure of the query.And if you're interested in watching for any updates,you would additionally setthe statisticsUpdateHandler closure.Once the query is started,these closures will be called with the results.Thanks to Swift async, we are making this even simpler.Each query now has a matching query descriptor,so HKStatisticsCollectionQuery becomesHKStatisticsCollectionQuery Descriptor.You get the initial resultby simply calling the async result(for:) method.If, on the other hand, you want to get the initial resultand also watch for updates, you call results(for:),which returns an AsyncSequence that you can loop throughto read the results.HealthKit is great for tracking workoutsand relevant metrics such as burned calories.To find out how many calories I burned this week,I can use the statistics collection query descriptor.First, I create the query descriptorwith a predicate to match calorie samples.I use the cumulativeSum option because I want the total sum.I'm interested in this week's data,so I use thisSunday as my anchorDate.And finally, I want my calorie totalsto be computed for a time interval of one week.Once I created my query descriptor,all I need to do is call result(for:)with a healthStore object.The returned statisticsCollection objectgives me a snapshot of my current data.But if I want live updates as my calories change,it's as simple as calling results(for:)and looping through the returned async sequenceto read the results.When I'm done watching for updates,I just break out of the loop and that will stop the query.Now, let's talk about workouts.HealthKit is a great place for saving workoutsand all their related metricswhether you're going on a casual bike rideor pushing yourself to the limit at a race.And oftentimes,workouts may contain more than one distinct activity.You may be repeating the same exercise with interval trainingor participating in a triathlon racewhich comprises swimming, cycling, and running.We are updating our workouts API in iOS 16 and watchOS 9to make it possible to capture these types of workoutsand the relevant statistics for each activity.This is the timeline of a swim-bike-run workoutI did recently.I started with swimming,after which I took a little bit of timeto get ready for the cycling portion of the workout,and finally running.Each activity is represented by an HKWorkoutActivity object.Each workout activityis created with its own workout configuration,which includes the activity type.A workout activity holds a list of eventsthat occurred during the activity.And you will be able to read statistics for each activity,which is great for when you're only interestedin analyzing what happened during a particular activity.Going back to my timeline,my three activities are configuredwith their appropriate activity type.Activities cannot overlap in time.And because there may be a transition periodbetween each activity,they are not required to be contiguous.If I'm interested in analyzing what happenedduring transition periods,I can create an HKWorkoutActivityfor each transition with the type transition.All of these activities will be saved with the HKWorkout objectunder the workoutActivities property.If you're using HKWorkoutBuilder to add workouts to HealthKit,adding an activity is as easy as creatingan HKWorkoutActivity object with a workoutConfiguration,start and end date, and an optional metadata.And then, you simply call addWorkoutActivityon the workout builder.On Apple Watch, you can use a workout sessionto track a swim-bike-run workout,and the associated workout builderto save the workout in HealthKit.Let's go back to my workout timeline.To track this workout on Apple Watch,I need to set up a workout session and builder.I start by creating a workout configurationwith the type swimBikeRun.Then I create an HKWorkoutSessionusing my configuration.At the beginning of the workoutI simply call startActivity on the session,and beginCollection on the associated workout builder.Now that my session and builder are ready,I can add my first activityusing the beginNewActivity methodwith a swimming workout configuration and a start date.At the beginning of each activity,you should make sure to update the workout builder data sourceto only collect the data types you're interested in.Because this is a swimming activity,I want swimming distance to be collected.At the end of the activity,I call endCurrentActivity with the end date.Because I'm interested in analyzing the transition periodfrom swimming to cycling,I will start a new transition activityimmediately after swimming has ended.Again, because this is the beginning of an activity,I update the builder data sourceto disable the collection of swimming distance,since it's no longer relevant.I end the transition activity right before cycling begins.I can track the remaining activities of my workoutthe same way.At the end of the workout,ending the session will also end any running activity.Then I can finish the workout builder,which will save and return an HKWorkout object.I can use the returned workoutto read some of the associated metricssuch as totalEnergyBurned and totalDistance,and display a summary of the workout in my app.However, this small set of propertiesis no longer sufficient.totalSwimmingStrokeCount is not relevant to all workouts,and some workouts may collect more metrics.In order to make it easier to read metricsfor all kinds of workouts,we are deprecating these propertiesin favor of a new method which returns statisticsfor a given quantity type.As a reminder, this method is also availableon HKWorkoutActivity, allowing you to focuson just what happened during an activity.These statistics will be automatically computedfrom any samples collected with the workout,only when using HKWorkoutBuilder or HKLiveWorkoutBuilder.Along with this richer workout representation,we also have a new set of predicates to help you queryfor only the workouts you're interested inwhen driving your analysis or visualization.To give you an example,here's a list of my recent workoutswith the average heart rate for each activity.I would like to find my workouts with high-intensity activitieswhere my average heart rate was above 150.First, I start by creating a predicate using the newpredicateForWorkoutActivities method,which will act on workout activities.I want the average heart rateto be greater than 150 beats per minute.Next, because I want to query for workouts,I wrap my heart rate predicate inside a workout predicate.Then, I create a query using that predicate.And I call the result(for: healthStore) methodof my query descriptor to get the list of workoutsthat match my predicate.And that's how I'm able to queryfor just the workouts I'm interested in.One of my recent workoutsconsisted of four running intervals.Using HKWorkoutActivity is a great wayto capture these intervals.You just need to make sure that all activitiesof an interval workout have the same activity typeas the workout.So for a running workout, all activities are configuredwith the .running type.One benefit of using workout activities to track intervalsis you can get statistics for each interval.With these updates, workouts now includea more comprehensive picture of their activitiesand the context surrounding them.In order to provide an even richer picture,we're introducing new running metricsthat will be automatically collectedon Apple Watch Series 6, SE, and newer --metrics such as running stride length, or power in watts.For swimming workouts, we're adding the SWOLF score.It's defined as the number of strokestaken in a given length,and the time it took to swim that length.This score will be calculated for each lap eventand segment event for swimming workoutsrecorded on Apple Watch.While these metrics enrich your workouts and allow youto get a better understanding of how you performed,another important metric that is recordedafter a workout has ended is heart rate recovery.It's an estimate of how quickly your heart rate lowersafter exercise, and it can be used to understandhow the heart recovers after stress,and reveal potential health problems.With iOS 16, we are introducing a new Cardio Recovery data type.It will be accessible from the Health app,and your apps will be able to read and save this datain HealthKit.Heart rate recovery is a quantity typewith the identifier .heartRateRecoveryOneMinute.Additional context informationabout each heart rate recovery samplecan be added as metadata.In my recent swim-bike-run workout,I pushed myself to my limits,and then observed my heart rate's recovery rate.It took me about three and a half hoursto complete the workout.I reached a maximum heart rate of 184 beats per minutewhen I was running.And the minute following the workout,my heart rate dropped by 50 beats.When using HKLiveWorkoutBuilder on Apple Watch,a heart rate recovery sample,along with its surrounding context,is automatically saved in HealthKit after a workout.Otherwise, to save a heart rate recovery sample,I create a quantity sample with the.heartRateRecoveryOneMinute type.My heart rate dropped by 50 beatsthe minute following the workout,so I set that as the quantity of my sample.I also set a start and end date for the sample.Then, I put the additional context informationin the metadata dictionary,starting with the recovery test type.Because my workout was an all-out effort,the test type is .maxExercise.My workout was a swimBikeRun,so I set that as the activity type.I can also add the workout duration using theHeartRateRecoveryActivity Duration key.Finally, I add the maximum heart rate observedduring the workout, which was 184 beats per minute.With these updates, it is now easier than everto track swim-bike-run, and interval workouts.In addition, the introduction of new metricsprovides a more comprehensive picture for your workoutsand newer ways to evaluate progress over time.While activity and fitness is something that impacts everyonethere are other aspects of healththat touch on many of us, such as vision.In fact, according to the Vision Council of America,approximately 75 percent of adults in the United Statesrely on vision correction with prescription glassesor contact lenses.These prescriptions, however, are easy to lose,and it's one more thing you need to have with youwhen ordering prescription glasses or contact lenses.So let's put them in our phones.Starting with iOS 16, your apps can now saveglasses and contacts prescriptions in HealthKit.A vision prescription is a samplewith the visionPrescriptionType.The sample's start date correspondsto the prescription's issue date,while the end date corresponds to the expiration date.Optionally, a digital copy of the physical prescriptioncan be attached to the sample.A glasses or contacts prescription sampleis a subclass of HKVisionPrescription.For glasses, you use the HKGlassesPrescription subclass,and for contacts, the HKContactsPrescription subclass.Each glasses prescription is createdusing two glasses lens specification objects;one for each eye.And similarly, contacts prescriptions are createdwith two contacts lens specification objects.Now, let's save my reading glasses prescriptionto HealthKit.The first step is to create an HKGlassesLensSpecificationfor each eye.Some parameters, such as vertex distance and prism,are optional.I can create the right eye lens specification the same way.Next, I create a glasses prescription samplewith my right eye and left eye lens specifications.This prescription is for my reading glasses,so I'm adding that in the description.Then, I just call save on the healthStorewith my prescription.And with that, my prescription is now saved in HealthKit.I also took a picture of it,which I'd like to attach to the sample I just saved.A file attachment is represented by an HKAttachment object.You use HKAttachmentStore to save and read file attachments.Only static images or PDF filescan be attached to prescriptions.To attach the picture I took to my prescription sample,I start by creating an HKAttachmentStore objectusing a healthStore.Then I call addAttachment(to:) with my prescription sample.I set a name for the attachment.Here, I'm attaching a PNG file.And finally, pass the URL of the file.The prescription I just attached contains a lot more informationthan just the lens specification --sensitive information, like my full name and date of birth.One of HealthKit's core principlesis to protect your privacy and make surethat you are always in control of the data you share.Because it can be easy to share more data than intendedwith prescriptions that include an attachment,we are introducing a new authorization modelfor prescriptions.Read authorization is grantedfor each prescription object separately.Users can select exactly which prescriptionsthey grant your app access to,and update their selection at any time.We have a new API for requesting authorizationfor vision prescription objects.Just like other data types,you can use queries to read prescriptionsthat your app has access to.If you're only interested in certain prescriptions,you can use a predicate.To request authorization, simply call therequestPerObjectRead Authorization methodof the healthStore with the visionType.Doing so will always display an authorization prompt in your appwith a list of all the prescriptionsthat match your predicate.Make sure you're asking for authorizationin the appropriate context to ensure the best user experience.These are just some of the new things we added to HealthKitto empower your apps to provide better healthand fitness experiences.We can't wait to see what you will build next.Have a great WWDC, and if you have any questions,we'll be happy to help you in the Developer Forums.♪

♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hip music ♪♪Hello and welcome to WWDC.

My name's Karim, and I'm a HealthKit engineer.

The HealthKit framework provides the foundationfor building great health experiences,and Apple Watch comes packedwith many health and safety features,that keep an eye on things for you.

One of the most popular is sleep tracking,and we are making updatesto capture more detailed sleep data.

We also have other great new additionsto HealthKit this year.

We enhanced our APIs to make it easierto query for data with Swift async.

We're improving workouts with a richer workout representation.

And we're adding support for saving vision prescriptions,including a digital copy of the physical prescription.

I'm excited to tell you more about all these updatesand how your apps can leverage them.

Let's get started!Sleep is such an essential functionthat allows our bodies and minds to recharge,and I love using my Apple Watch to manage my sleep scheduleand get insights that help me understandand improve my sleep.

This year we are making sleep tracking even betterby introducing sleep stages.

Apple Watch will automatically trackall the different sleep stages you go throughwhen you're asleep,and this data will be accessible from the Health appand saved in HealthKit.

Of course, your app will be able to readand save sleep stages data.

Sleep data saved by Apple Watch or your appis represented in HealthKit by category sampleswith the identifier sleepAnalysis.

We will support three sleep stages:REM, core, and deep.

When saving sleep data to HealthKit,you should make sure to create one samplefor each continuous period of time in a given sleep stage.

This is what the sleep sample value enum looks like.

We're adding three cases to represent sleep stages,starting with asleepCore,which corresponds to stages one and two of the scoring modelfrom the American Academy of Sleep Medicine or AASM;asleepDeep, which corresponds to stage threeof the AASM scoring model;and finally, asleepREM,which corresponds to the rapid eye movement stage.

Now that we added sleep stages,we are deprecating the asleep casein favor of asleepUnspecified,which indicates that the user is asleepbut no sleep stage was specified.

With the updated sleep samples enum,it is now possible to save and read sleep stages datafrom HealthKit.

We added a new predicate to make it easy to read sleep samplesfor a given stage.

Let's say I want to read sleep samplesin the REM stage.

First, I create a predicateusing the new predicateForSamples methodwith asleepREM as value.

Now, I can start building my query.

I create a predicate for my querywith the sleepAnalysis sample typeand the sleep stage predicate.

And with this query predicate, I can now create my query.

Running the query will give me backan array of sleep samples in the REM stage.

However, if you're interested in reading samplesfor all sleep stages, including unspecified,it's important that you update your appto use the new .allAsleepValues when building your predicate.

If you haven't looked at HealthKit since last year,this shorter syntax for querying may look unfamiliar to you.

Since iOS 15.4,we have updated our query API to support Swift async.

Queries are an essential piece of HealthKit,and with Swift async support, they're easier to usewith a more concise syntax.

Queries allow you to read various data from HealthKit,using predicates to filter the results,and also watch for new data as it comes in.

All queries are subclasses of HKQuery.

If I'm interested in knowing the total calories burnedover a certain period of time,a great query to get these computed statisticsis HKStatisticsCollectionQuery.

To get the initial results, you would setthe initialResultsHandler closure of the query.

And if you're interested in watching for any updates,you would additionally setthe statisticsUpdateHandler closure.

Once the query is started,these closures will be called with the results.

Thanks to Swift async, we are making this even simpler.

Each query now has a matching query descriptor,so HKStatisticsCollectionQuery becomesHKStatisticsCollectionQuery Descriptor.

You get the initial resultby simply calling the async result(for:) method.

If, on the other hand, you want to get the initial resultand also watch for updates, you call results(for:),which returns an AsyncSequence that you can loop throughto read the results.

HealthKit is great for tracking workoutsand relevant metrics such as burned calories.

To find out how many calories I burned this week,I can use the statistics collection query descriptor.

First, I create the query descriptorwith a predicate to match calorie samples.

I use the cumulativeSum option because I want the total sum.

I'm interested in this week's data,so I use thisSunday as my anchorDate.

And finally, I want my calorie totalsto be computed for a time interval of one week.

Once I created my query descriptor,all I need to do is call result(for:)with a healthStore object.

The returned statisticsCollection objectgives me a snapshot of my current data.

But if I want live updates as my calories change,it's as simple as calling results(for:)and looping through the returned async sequenceto read the results.

When I'm done watching for updates,I just break out of the loop and that will stop the query.

Now, let's talk about workouts.

HealthKit is a great place for saving workoutsand all their related metricswhether you're going on a casual bike rideor pushing yourself to the limit at a race.

And oftentimes,workouts may contain more than one distinct activity.

You may be repeating the same exercise with interval trainingor participating in a triathlon racewhich comprises swimming, cycling, and running.

We are updating our workouts API in iOS 16 and watchOS 9to make it possible to capture these types of workoutsand the relevant statistics for each activity.

This is the timeline of a swim-bike-run workoutI did recently.

I started with swimming,after which I took a little bit of timeto get ready for the cycling portion of the workout,and finally running.

Each activity is represented by an HKWorkoutActivity object.

Each workout activityis created with its own workout configuration,which includes the activity type.

A workout activity holds a list of eventsthat occurred during the activity.

And you will be able to read statistics for each activity,which is great for when you're only interestedin analyzing what happened during a particular activity.

Going back to my timeline,my three activities are configuredwith their appropriate activity type.

Activities cannot overlap in time.

And because there may be a transition periodbetween each activity,they are not required to be contiguous.

If I'm interested in analyzing what happenedduring transition periods,I can create an HKWorkoutActivityfor each transition with the type transition.

All of these activities will be saved with the HKWorkout objectunder the workoutActivities property.

If you're using HKWorkoutBuilder to add workouts to HealthKit,adding an activity is as easy as creatingan HKWorkoutActivity object with a workoutConfiguration,start and end date, and an optional metadata.

And then, you simply call addWorkoutActivityon the workout builder.

On Apple Watch, you can use a workout sessionto track a swim-bike-run workout,and the associated workout builderto save the workout in HealthKit.

Let's go back to my workout timeline.

To track this workout on Apple Watch,I need to set up a workout session and builder.

I start by creating a workout configurationwith the type swimBikeRun.

Then I create an HKWorkoutSessionusing my configuration.

At the beginning of the workoutI simply call startActivity on the session,and beginCollection on the associated workout builder.

Now that my session and builder are ready,I can add my first activityusing the beginNewActivity methodwith a swimming workout configuration and a start date.

At the beginning of each activity,you should make sure to update the workout builder data sourceto only collect the data types you're interested in.

Because this is a swimming activity,I want swimming distance to be collected.

At the end of the activity,I call endCurrentActivity with the end date.

Because I'm interested in analyzing the transition periodfrom swimming to cycling,I will start a new transition activityimmediately after swimming has ended.

Again, because this is the beginning of an activity,I update the builder data sourceto disable the collection of swimming distance,since it's no longer relevant.

I end the transition activity right before cycling begins.

I can track the remaining activities of my workoutthe same way.

At the end of the workout,ending the session will also end any running activity.

Then I can finish the workout builder,which will save and return an HKWorkout object.

I can use the returned workoutto read some of the associated metricssuch as totalEnergyBurned and totalDistance,and display a summary of the workout in my app.

However, this small set of propertiesis no longer sufficient.

totalSwimmingStrokeCount is not relevant to all workouts,and some workouts may collect more metrics.

In order to make it easier to read metricsfor all kinds of workouts,we are deprecating these propertiesin favor of a new method which returns statisticsfor a given quantity type.

As a reminder, this method is also availableon HKWorkoutActivity, allowing you to focuson just what happened during an activity.

These statistics will be automatically computedfrom any samples collected with the workout,only when using HKWorkoutBuilder or HKLiveWorkoutBuilder.

Along with this richer workout representation,we also have a new set of predicates to help you queryfor only the workouts you're interested inwhen driving your analysis or visualization.

To give you an example,here's a list of my recent workoutswith the average heart rate for each activity.

I would like to find my workouts with high-intensity activitieswhere my average heart rate was above 150.

First, I start by creating a predicate using the newpredicateForWorkoutActivities method,which will act on workout activities.

I want the average heart rateto be greater than 150 beats per minute.

Next, because I want to query for workouts,I wrap my heart rate predicate inside a workout predicate.

Then, I create a query using that predicate.

And I call the result(for: healthStore) methodof my query descriptor to get the list of workoutsthat match my predicate.

And that's how I'm able to queryfor just the workouts I'm interested in.

One of my recent workoutsconsisted of four running intervals.

Using HKWorkoutActivity is a great wayto capture these intervals.

You just need to make sure that all activitiesof an interval workout have the same activity typeas the workout.

So for a running workout, all activities are configuredwith the .running type.

One benefit of using workout activities to track intervalsis you can get statistics for each interval.

With these updates, workouts now includea more comprehensive picture of their activitiesand the context surrounding them.

In order to provide an even richer picture,we're introducing new running metricsthat will be automatically collectedon Apple Watch Series 6, SE, and newer --metrics such as running stride length, or power in watts.

For swimming workouts, we're adding the SWOLF score.

It's defined as the number of strokestaken in a given length,and the time it took to swim that length.

This score will be calculated for each lap eventand segment event for swimming workoutsrecorded on Apple Watch.

While these metrics enrich your workouts and allow youto get a better understanding of how you performed,another important metric that is recordedafter a workout has ended is heart rate recovery.

It's an estimate of how quickly your heart rate lowersafter exercise, and it can be used to understandhow the heart recovers after stress,and reveal potential health problems.

With iOS 16, we are introducing a new Cardio Recovery data type.

It will be accessible from the Health app,and your apps will be able to read and save this datain HealthKit.

Heart rate recovery is a quantity typewith the identifier .heartRateRecoveryOneMinute.

Additional context informationabout each heart rate recovery samplecan be added as metadata.

In my recent swim-bike-run workout,I pushed myself to my limits,and then observed my heart rate's recovery rate.

It took me about three and a half hoursto complete the workout.

I reached a maximum heart rate of 184 beats per minutewhen I was running.

And the minute following the workout,my heart rate dropped by 50 beats.

When using HKLiveWorkoutBuilder on Apple Watch,a heart rate recovery sample,along with its surrounding context,is automatically saved in HealthKit after a workout.

Otherwise, to save a heart rate recovery sample,I create a quantity sample with the.heartRateRecoveryOneMinute type.

My heart rate dropped by 50 beatsthe minute following the workout,so I set that as the quantity of my sample.

I also set a start and end date for the sample.

Then, I put the additional context informationin the metadata dictionary,starting with the recovery test type.

Because my workout was an all-out effort,the test type is .maxExercise.

My workout was a swimBikeRun,so I set that as the activity type.

I can also add the workout duration using theHeartRateRecoveryActivity Duration key.

Finally, I add the maximum heart rate observedduring the workout, which was 184 beats per minute.

With these updates, it is now easier than everto track swim-bike-run, and interval workouts.

In addition, the introduction of new metricsprovides a more comprehensive picture for your workoutsand newer ways to evaluate progress over time.

While activity and fitness is something that impacts everyonethere are other aspects of healththat touch on many of us, such as vision.

In fact, according to the Vision Council of America,approximately 75 percent of adults in the United Statesrely on vision correction with prescription glassesor contact lenses.

These prescriptions, however, are easy to lose,and it's one more thing you need to have with youwhen ordering prescription glasses or contact lenses.

So let's put them in our phones.

Starting with iOS 16, your apps can now saveglasses and contacts prescriptions in HealthKit.

A vision prescription is a samplewith the visionPrescriptionType.

The sample's start date correspondsto the prescription's issue date,while the end date corresponds to the expiration date.

Optionally, a digital copy of the physical prescriptioncan be attached to the sample.

A glasses or contacts prescription sampleis a subclass of HKVisionPrescription.

For glasses, you use the HKGlassesPrescription subclass,and for contacts, the HKContactsPrescription subclass.

Each glasses prescription is createdusing two glasses lens specification objects;one for each eye.

And similarly, contacts prescriptions are createdwith two contacts lens specification objects.

Now, let's save my reading glasses prescriptionto HealthKit.

The first step is to create an HKGlassesLensSpecificationfor each eye.

Some parameters, such as vertex distance and prism,are optional.

I can create the right eye lens specification the same way.

Next, I create a glasses prescription samplewith my right eye and left eye lens specifications.

This prescription is for my reading glasses,so I'm adding that in the description.

Then, I just call save on the healthStorewith my prescription.

And with that, my prescription is now saved in HealthKit.

I also took a picture of it,which I'd like to attach to the sample I just saved.

A file attachment is represented by an HKAttachment object.

You use HKAttachmentStore to save and read file attachments.

Only static images or PDF filescan be attached to prescriptions.

To attach the picture I took to my prescription sample,I start by creating an HKAttachmentStore objectusing a healthStore.

Then I call addAttachment(to:) with my prescription sample.

I set a name for the attachment.

Here, I'm attaching a PNG file.

And finally, pass the URL of the file.

The prescription I just attached contains a lot more informationthan just the lens specification --sensitive information, like my full name and date of birth.

One of HealthKit's core principlesis to protect your privacy and make surethat you are always in control of the data you share.

Because it can be easy to share more data than intendedwith prescriptions that include an attachment,we are introducing a new authorization modelfor prescriptions.

Read authorization is grantedfor each prescription object separately.

Users can select exactly which prescriptionsthey grant your app access to,and update their selection at any time.

We have a new API for requesting authorizationfor vision prescription objects.

Just like other data types,you can use queries to read prescriptionsthat your app has access to.

If you're only interested in certain prescriptions,you can use a predicate.

To request authorization, simply call therequestPerObjectRead Authorization methodof the healthStore with the visionType.

Doing so will always display an authorization prompt in your appwith a list of all the prescriptionsthat match your predicate.

Make sure you're asking for authorizationin the appropriate context to ensure the best user experience.

These are just some of the new things we added to HealthKitto empower your apps to provide better healthand fitness experiences.

We can't wait to see what you will build next.

Have a great WWDC, and if you have any questions,we'll be happy to help you in the Developer Forums.
