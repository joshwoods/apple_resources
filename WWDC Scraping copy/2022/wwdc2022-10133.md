The SwiftUI cookbook for navigation

What's new in SwiftUI

Search this video…Anne: Hello, and welcome!I'm Anne Hitchcock,and I'm a watchOS software engineer.Today, I want to show youhow to create a productivity appon watchOS.Since the introduction of SwiftUIand Independent Watch apps in watchOS 6,you've been able to do more in your Watch apps.Each year, SwiftUI on watchOS gets more capabilities.At the same time,watchOS has gotten new features, like the keyboard,that let you build whole new kinds of apps for Watch.I'd like to show you how to knit together some of those featuresto build an app to track a list of things to get done.We're going to create a new Watch app,add a simple list of items to display,Let people add items to the list,and then edit the items.As we add these features,we'll talk about common app navigation strategies in Watch appsand how to pick the correct one.We'll share items with a friend to share the load.Then we'll add a chart to our appto help us spot productivity trends and keep us motivated.And we'll use the Digital Crown to makeour chart scrollableto show a larger data range.Let's get started by creating a new app.Create a new project in Xcode.In the watchOS tab, choose App and click Next.After choosing a product name, you have a couple of choices.The most important oneis whether to create a Watch-only Appor to create a Watch app with a companion iOS app.Let's talk about what makes a great Watch appand when you want a companion iOS app.Great Watch apps enable quick interaction,like the interface in Workoutthat allows you to start your favorite workouts quickly.No one wants to stand around, holding up their arm,tapping through to try to find something.Great Watch apps make it easy to access important informationand features.Great Watch apps focus on the essential purpose of the app.For example, the Weather app displays the forecast for today,relevant current conditions, and a simple 10-day forecast.Focus on the essentials in your appso people can easily find the informationand actions they need.A great Watch app is designed to be usedindependently of the companion iPhone.The Contacts app, for example, synchronizes with your phone,but doesn't require your iPhone to be nearbyto access contact informationon your Apple Watch.There are many reasons you might also wanta companion iOS app for your Watch app,including providing a historical record of data captured by Apple Watchor detailed analysis of trends, as in the Fitness app.Since our app has a focused feature set,quick interaction, and limited data,we're going to create a Watch-only app.At this point, I want to spend a few minutestalking about the targets that are created.If you've built a Watch app in the past,your project has two targets for Watch:a WatchKit App target with a storyboard,assets, and perhaps some localization-related files,and a WatchKit Extension target with all of your app code.These dual targets are a holdoverfrom the early days of watchOS,and there really isn't a good reason for multiple Watch targets anymore.Starting in Xcode 14, new Watch apps have a single Watch app target.All of the code, assets, localizations,and Siri Intent and Widget extensionsassociated with your Watch appbelong in this target.The great news is that single-target Watch appsare supported back to watchOS 7!You can simplify your project structure and reduce confusion and duplicationwhile still supporting customers who aren't runningthe latest watchOS.If you have an existing appwith a WatchKit Extension target,it will continue to work,and you can continue to update your app using Xcodeand publish your app through the App Store.If you already have a Watch app that usesthe SwiftUI lifecycle,transitioning to a single target is easy using the migration tool in Xcode 14.Select your target and choose Validate Settingsfrom the Editor menu.The target collapsing option will be offeredif your deployment target is watchOS 7 or later.If you haven't already made the leap,now is a good time to start the processof converting your app to use the SwiftUI life cycleto enjoy the simplicity of a single-target Watch appand all of the features of SwiftUI.The targets aren't the only thing we simplified in Xcode 14!We've also made it a lot easierto add an icon for your appby only requiring a single 1024x1024 pixel image.The app icon image will be scaledfor display on all Watch devices.Be sure to test with your app iconon devices on the home screen,in notifications,and in the settings for your appin the Watch app on the iPhone.You can add custom imagesfor specific smaller sizes if necessary.For example,if your app icon has details in the imagethat get lost at smaller sizes,you can add specific icon images for those sizeswith the image details removed.Now let's add some functionality to our appby adding a list of task items.We'll start by creating a data modelfor our list of tasks.The ListItem struct will be Identifiable and Hashable,and we'll give it a description to display.Then, create a simple model to store our dataand publish the array of list items.And finally, add the model as an environment objectso our views can access our model.Now let's create a List in SwiftUI with our data model.Since there are no tasks yet,when we preview this, we get an empty list.We need to do something about that.We should give people a way to add some tasks to their list.We'd like to add a Button that people can tapto add a new item to the list.Text field link, new in watchOS 9,lets you invoke text input options from a button,and offers several styling optionsto make it feel right at home in your app.You can create a TextFieldLink with a simple stringor use a Label for a more custom button.Modify the button's appearance with view modifiers,including foregroundColor,foregroundStyle,and buttonStyle.We'll create an AddItemLink viewto encapsulate the styling and behaviorof the TextFieldLink we're using in our app.We'll use a custom label for the button,and when someone enters text,we'll add the new item to our list.Now that we've decided to use TextFieldLinkto add a button to add a new list item,we need to think about where to put the TextFieldLink.When adding actions to lists in Watch apps,we have a couple of options.Use a button, navigation link, or TextFieldLinkat the end of the list for primary actions in short lists.Adding an action as an item at the end of a listis a good choice for a primary actionin a short list of itemslike the list of cities in World Clock.However,if you anticipate a long list of items,people will have to keep scrolling to the end of the listeach time they want to do the action.For commonly used actionswith longer lists, use a toolbar item.To add a toolbar item, add the toolbar modifier to the list,and use your action view as the content.This will add a single toolbar item to the listwith automatic toolbar item placement.While I'd like to think I'll always keepmy to-do list short,I'm fairly sure that I won't.So I'm going to put the text field links in a toolbar itemto make it easy to access.Let's take a moment to review what we've accomplished.We've created a model for our list items,stored it as an environment object,created a list to display the items,and added a text field link to add new items.Creating an item with only a descriptionis simple, but it isn't very useful.We're going to need to mark the item as complete,and we might want a way to set a priorityor add an estimate of the amount of workfor a task.To do this, we'll add a detail view.Before we do this, I want to reviewthe options for app navigation structurein SwiftUI on Watch.Hierarchical navigation is used for viewswith a list-detail relationship.Starting in watchOS 9, use the SwiftUI NavigationStackto create interfaces with this type of navigation structure.Page-based navigation is used for viewswith a flat structure,where all of the views are peers.A great example of page-based navigationis the in-workout view of the Workout app,where people can easily swipebetween the workout controls, metrics, and playback controlsduring a workout.A full-screen app has a single viewthat uses the entire display.This is generally used for apps like gamesand other apps that have a single main view.For a full-screen view, use the ignoresSafeArea modifierto extend your content to the edges of the display,and the toolbar modifier with a visibility value of hiddento hide the navigation bar.A modal sheet is a full-screen viewthat slides over the current view.It should be used for important tasksthat should be completed as part of the current workflow.It's important to differentiatewhen to use a hierarchical flowversus when to use a modal sheet.Mail uses a hierarchical style to display the list of messagesand show each message or thread as a detail view.There are actions you can do from the message detail,but there is nothing you must dobefore returning to the list.If you go back to the list, and tap New Message,Mail uses a modal sheet to show the New Message view.A modal sheet is the right choicebecause you need to fill in the details of the new message, or cancel,before continuing.To display a modal sheet,create a property to control the sheet presentation state.Set the property based on an action in the user interface,and use the sheet modifierto display the custom modal sheet contentwhen the presentation state property is true.To add custom toolbar items to the modal sheet,add a toolbar with your items.Note that your toolbar items should use modal placementslike confirmationAction,cancellationAction,and destructiveAction.We're going to use the modal sheet for our detail viewbecause we're editing an itemand we want to focus on this single taskuntil we've finished and tapped Done.To learn more about navigation in SwiftUI,including more details about NavigationStackand programmatic navigation,check out "The SwiftUI cookbook for navigation."Now that we've decided how to navigate to our detail view,we'll update our list item struct.We have new properties to store estimated work,creation date, and completion date.Let's give people a way to view and edit these details.We'll create a detail view with a TextField to edit the descriptionand a toggle to mark the task as complete or not.But what should we do with the estimated work?We know the values will all be numbers,and we can specify a range of valid values.Beginning in watchOS 9,we can use the Stepper.The Stepper is a great optionwhen you want to provide granular control to edit sequential values.You can specify a range of values and optionally provide a step.You can also use the Stepper to edit logically sequential,but not necessarily numeric values.For example, maybe we want to notethe estimated stress level for an item.We could create an array of emojito indicate the stress level,then create a Stepper,binding the value to the selected index in the stress level emoji arrayand setting the range to the range of emoji indices.Stepping through the valuesincreases or decreasesthe stress level we're estimating for the item.Preparing a WWDC session is fun,but sharing great Watch app development with all of you is a party.When I have stressful items on my list,or just a lot of items on my list that are making me feel stressed,I'd like to share an item from my list with a friendto ask for help.We're going to add a button to our detail viewto allow people to share an itemusing the share sheet.I want to be able to tap a button on my detail viewto share the item,pick from a list of friends to ask for help,edit my message, and send it.To do this, we're going to use a new toolavailable to us in SwiftUI on watchOS 9:ShareLink.We can share our list item by creating a ShareLink with our item.We can optionally customizethe initial text of the messagewith a subject and message.And provide a Preview to display in the Share Sheetwhen someone shares the item.You can use ShareLink to share from your SwiftUI appin iOS, macOS, and watchOS.Be sure to check out "Meet Transferable"to learn more details and optionsfor ShareLink.Now that I can track when I completed itemsand call for help to get things done,I'd also like to add a chartto see my productivity.I've chosen to use a bar chartbecause I have a single data seriesand distinct data values.A bar chart will clearly showthis data on a Watch displayas long as I limit the amount of data I display at one time.We're going to start by adding the chart viewto our app's navigation structure.I've chosen a page-based navigation strategybecause there is no list-detail relationshipbetween the item list and the chart.Someone can swipe between the listand the chart at any time.To add the page-based navigationfor our list and chart,let's start by creating an ItemList struct to encapsulate the list view.I moved the entire content of the content viewto this new item list.Encapsulating the item list here will allow usto have simple, easy-to-read tab view codein the content view.We also need to create a struct for our chart view.I'll temporarily put in a placeholderso we can focus on our navigation structurebefore we build our chart.Now we'll set up a content viewwith a page-style tab view with 2 tabs:the item list and the chart.Since we've set up our navigation structure,let's talk about how to build this chart.I know I could use a SwiftUI Canvasand draw a chart,but starting in watchOS 9,we have an easier answer: Swift Charts.Swift Charts are also available on iOS, macOS, and tvOS,so you can reuse your charts anywhere you're using SwiftUI.We'll aggregate the data we want to chartand then let Swift Charts display it for us.For our chart, we want to show the number of items completed by date.We'll create a struct to store the aggregate data for the chart.Then we'll write a small methodto aggregate our list item datainto chart data elements.Display a simple chart by specifying the data to displayand defining the series from the data.We're using the date as the x-valueand the number of items completed as the y-value.To achieve the appearance I want on my Watch display,I'm customizing the x-axisusing the Chart's chartXAxis modifier.I'm specifying a format style for the axis value labels.I also don't want vertical gridlines,so I omitted an AxisGridLine mark.I'm also customizing the y-axis using the chartYAxis modifier.I specify a gridline style that looks good with my chart on Watch.I'm formatting the axis value labels as integersand omitting the top labelto prevent it from being clipped at the top of the chart.To learn more about the amazing things you can achieve with Swift Charts,check out "Hello Swift Charts"and "Swift Charts: Raise the bar."Our chart looks pretty good,but I'd like to show a little more databut still keep a great Watch experience,so I'm going to make it scrollable.To accomplish this, we're going to usea new digitalCrownRotation modifierthat allows us to set a callbackfor digital crown events,and we're going to implementa custom scrolling behavior for our chart.Let's get ready to add the digitalCrownRotation modifierby adding some properties to store the stateas someone scrolls across the chart.The highlightedDateIndex is the index of the data pointfor the current scroll position.We'll store the crown offsetso we can display the current crown positionas the person is scrolling across the chart.This is an intermediate value, on or between data points,while the crown is moving.To keep track of whether someone is actively scrolling,we'll store the the idle state.We'll use this informationto add a little animationas crown scrolling stops and starts.Now that we have the properties to store values,we can add the digitalCrownRotation modifier.We'll bind the detent value to the highlightedDateIndex property.In mechanical terms, a detent is a mechanismthat holds something in a positionuntil enough force is applied to move it.For instance, when I open my car door,there is a "stop" position where the door will settle.I can push a little harderand open the door wider to another "stop."To close it, I need to pull hard enoughto overcome the resistance to pull it out of the "stop."Otherwise, it will spring back into that resting position.This is a detent.The stop for the car doorhelps us understand detent in this API.The detent is the resting notch positionof the crown on your view.In the handler for the onChange callback,we'll set the value for isCrownIdle to false,since we know that the crown is scrolling,and we'll set the crownOffset value to the current valueto let us show the current position on the chart during scrolling.In the handler for the onIdle callback,we'll set the value for isCrownIdle to true.Now we can display the position of the crownas we scroll on the chart.To do this, we can use the RuleMark from Swift Charts.A RuleMark is a straight line on your chart.You can use it to display a horizontal or vertical line,to display a threshold, for example,or to display a sloped line.We're going to create a RuleMarkwith the crown offset date valueto display the current location of crown scrolling.Just to make this look a little better,I'd like to have the crown position line fadewhen the crown stops moving.It's simple to animate thisusing the isCrownIdle property we added.We'll add a property to store the opacity for the color we're usingin the foregroundStyle for the RuleMark.And add an onChange modifier to the chartto animate the crownPositionOpacity value changewhen the isCrownIdle value changes.Then update the foregroundStyle for the RuleMark to use the opacity.To display the value next to the bar on the chart as we scroll,we can add an annotation to the BarMark.We'll position the annotation on the top leading side of the barwhen it's the last bar.Otherwise, we'll position iton the top trailing side.Let's take a moment to see what we've accomplishedwith just the digitalCrownRotation modifier,the RuleMark in Swift Charts,and a simple SwiftUI animation.The final step to creating our custom scrollable chartis adjusting the data range for the chart as someone scrolls.Create a property to store the visible range.Create the chartData variable to provide the data in the range to the chart.When the highlightedDateIndex changes,call a method to check the chartDataRangeand update it if necessary.As someone scrolls across the chart using the Digital Crown,the chart will scroll to display the available data.Now we've finished implementing all the features we had planned.To learn more about the new SwiftUI featuresavailable in watchOS 9,check out "What's New in SwiftUI."As you're planning your Watch app,or your new Watch app features,think about what makesa great Watch app experience.While you're designing your app,consider your app navigation strategyto ensure that your app is easy and intuitive.And use SwiftUI for simpler and richer development options.Keep building great Watch apps.And remember,because of you, there's an app for that!

Anne: Hello, and welcome!I'm Anne Hitchcock,and I'm a watchOS software engineer.Today, I want to show youhow to create a productivity appon watchOS.Since the introduction of SwiftUIand Independent Watch apps in watchOS 6,you've been able to do more in your Watch apps.Each year, SwiftUI on watchOS gets more capabilities.At the same time,watchOS has gotten new features, like the keyboard,that let you build whole new kinds of apps for Watch.I'd like to show you how to knit together some of those featuresto build an app to track a list of things to get done.We're going to create a new Watch app,add a simple list of items to display,Let people add items to the list,and then edit the items.

As we add these features,we'll talk about common app navigation strategies in Watch appsand how to pick the correct one.

We'll share items with a friend to share the load.

Then we'll add a chart to our appto help us spot productivity trends and keep us motivated.

And we'll use the Digital Crown to makeour chart scrollableto show a larger data range.

Let's get started by creating a new app.

Create a new project in Xcode.

In the watchOS tab, choose App and click Next.

After choosing a product name, you have a couple of choices.The most important oneis whether to create a Watch-only Appor to create a Watch app with a companion iOS app.Let's talk about what makes a great Watch appand when you want a companion iOS app.

Great Watch apps enable quick interaction,like the interface in Workoutthat allows you to start your favorite workouts quickly.No one wants to stand around, holding up their arm,tapping through to try to find something.Great Watch apps make it easy to access important informationand features.

Great Watch apps focus on the essential purpose of the app.

For example, the Weather app displays the forecast for today,relevant current conditions, and a simple 10-day forecast.

Focus on the essentials in your appso people can easily find the informationand actions they need.

A great Watch app is designed to be usedindependently of the companion iPhone.The Contacts app, for example, synchronizes with your phone,but doesn't require your iPhone to be nearbyto access contact informationon your Apple Watch.

There are many reasons you might also wanta companion iOS app for your Watch app,including providing a historical record of data captured by Apple Watchor detailed analysis of trends, as in the Fitness app.

Since our app has a focused feature set,quick interaction, and limited data,we're going to create a Watch-only app.

At this point, I want to spend a few minutestalking about the targets that are created.

If you've built a Watch app in the past,your project has two targets for Watch:a WatchKit App target with a storyboard,assets, and perhaps some localization-related files,and a WatchKit Extension target with all of your app code.These dual targets are a holdoverfrom the early days of watchOS,and there really isn't a good reason for multiple Watch targets anymore.

Starting in Xcode 14, new Watch apps have a single Watch app target.All of the code, assets, localizations,and Siri Intent and Widget extensionsassociated with your Watch appbelong in this target.

The great news is that single-target Watch appsare supported back to watchOS 7!You can simplify your project structure and reduce confusion and duplicationwhile still supporting customers who aren't runningthe latest watchOS.

If you have an existing appwith a WatchKit Extension target,it will continue to work,and you can continue to update your app using Xcodeand publish your app through the App Store.

If you already have a Watch app that usesthe SwiftUI lifecycle,transitioning to a single target is easy using the migration tool in Xcode 14.Select your target and choose Validate Settingsfrom the Editor menu.The target collapsing option will be offeredif your deployment target is watchOS 7 or later.

If you haven't already made the leap,now is a good time to start the processof converting your app to use the SwiftUI life cycleto enjoy the simplicity of a single-target Watch appand all of the features of SwiftUI.

The targets aren't the only thing we simplified in Xcode 14!We've also made it a lot easierto add an icon for your appby only requiring a single 1024x1024 pixel image.

The app icon image will be scaledfor display on all Watch devices.

Be sure to test with your app iconon devices on the home screen,in notifications,and in the settings for your appin the Watch app on the iPhone.

You can add custom imagesfor specific smaller sizes if necessary.For example,if your app icon has details in the imagethat get lost at smaller sizes,you can add specific icon images for those sizeswith the image details removed.Now let's add some functionality to our appby adding a list of task items.We'll start by creating a data modelfor our list of tasks.The ListItem struct will be Identifiable and Hashable,and we'll give it a description to display.

Then, create a simple model to store our dataand publish the array of list items.

And finally, add the model as an environment objectso our views can access our model.

Now let's create a List in SwiftUI with our data model.Since there are no tasks yet,when we preview this, we get an empty list.

We need to do something about that.We should give people a way to add some tasks to their list.

We'd like to add a Button that people can tapto add a new item to the list.Text field link, new in watchOS 9,lets you invoke text input options from a button,and offers several styling optionsto make it feel right at home in your app.

You can create a TextFieldLink with a simple stringor use a Label for a more custom button.

Modify the button's appearance with view modifiers,including foregroundColor,foregroundStyle,and buttonStyle.

We'll create an AddItemLink viewto encapsulate the styling and behaviorof the TextFieldLink we're using in our app.

We'll use a custom label for the button,and when someone enters text,we'll add the new item to our list.

Now that we've decided to use TextFieldLinkto add a button to add a new list item,we need to think about where to put the TextFieldLink.

When adding actions to lists in Watch apps,we have a couple of options.Use a button, navigation link, or TextFieldLinkat the end of the list for primary actions in short lists.Adding an action as an item at the end of a listis a good choice for a primary actionin a short list of itemslike the list of cities in World Clock.However,if you anticipate a long list of items,people will have to keep scrolling to the end of the listeach time they want to do the action.For commonly used actionswith longer lists, use a toolbar item.

To add a toolbar item, add the toolbar modifier to the list,and use your action view as the content.This will add a single toolbar item to the listwith automatic toolbar item placement.While I'd like to think I'll always keepmy to-do list short,I'm fairly sure that I won't.So I'm going to put the text field links in a toolbar itemto make it easy to access.

Let's take a moment to review what we've accomplished.We've created a model for our list items,stored it as an environment object,created a list to display the items,and added a text field link to add new items.

Creating an item with only a descriptionis simple, but it isn't very useful.We're going to need to mark the item as complete,and we might want a way to set a priorityor add an estimate of the amount of workfor a task.To do this, we'll add a detail view.Before we do this, I want to reviewthe options for app navigation structurein SwiftUI on Watch.Hierarchical navigation is used for viewswith a list-detail relationship.Starting in watchOS 9, use the SwiftUI NavigationStackto create interfaces with this type of navigation structure.

Page-based navigation is used for viewswith a flat structure,where all of the views are peers.

A great example of page-based navigationis the in-workout view of the Workout app,where people can easily swipebetween the workout controls, metrics, and playback controlsduring a workout.

A full-screen app has a single viewthat uses the entire display.This is generally used for apps like gamesand other apps that have a single main view.

For a full-screen view, use the ignoresSafeArea modifierto extend your content to the edges of the display,and the toolbar modifier with a visibility value of hiddento hide the navigation bar.

A modal sheet is a full-screen viewthat slides over the current view.It should be used for important tasksthat should be completed as part of the current workflow.

It's important to differentiatewhen to use a hierarchical flowversus when to use a modal sheet.

Mail uses a hierarchical style to display the list of messagesand show each message or thread as a detail view.There are actions you can do from the message detail,but there is nothing you must dobefore returning to the list.

If you go back to the list, and tap New Message,Mail uses a modal sheet to show the New Message view.

A modal sheet is the right choicebecause you need to fill in the details of the new message, or cancel,before continuing.

To display a modal sheet,create a property to control the sheet presentation state.Set the property based on an action in the user interface,and use the sheet modifierto display the custom modal sheet contentwhen the presentation state property is true.

To add custom toolbar items to the modal sheet,add a toolbar with your items.Note that your toolbar items should use modal placementslike confirmationAction,cancellationAction,and destructiveAction.

We're going to use the modal sheet for our detail viewbecause we're editing an itemand we want to focus on this single taskuntil we've finished and tapped Done.

To learn more about navigation in SwiftUI,including more details about NavigationStackand programmatic navigation,check out "The SwiftUI cookbook for navigation."Now that we've decided how to navigate to our detail view,we'll update our list item struct.We have new properties to store estimated work,creation date, and completion date.

Let's give people a way to view and edit these details.

We'll create a detail view with a TextField to edit the descriptionand a toggle to mark the task as complete or not.But what should we do with the estimated work?We know the values will all be numbers,and we can specify a range of valid values.

Beginning in watchOS 9,we can use the Stepper.The Stepper is a great optionwhen you want to provide granular control to edit sequential values.

You can specify a range of values and optionally provide a step.

You can also use the Stepper to edit logically sequential,but not necessarily numeric values.

For example, maybe we want to notethe estimated stress level for an item.

We could create an array of emojito indicate the stress level,then create a Stepper,binding the value to the selected index in the stress level emoji arrayand setting the range to the range of emoji indices.Stepping through the valuesincreases or decreasesthe stress level we're estimating for the item.

Preparing a WWDC session is fun,but sharing great Watch app development with all of you is a party.When I have stressful items on my list,or just a lot of items on my list that are making me feel stressed,I'd like to share an item from my list with a friendto ask for help.

We're going to add a button to our detail viewto allow people to share an itemusing the share sheet.I want to be able to tap a button on my detail viewto share the item,pick from a list of friends to ask for help,edit my message, and send it.

To do this, we're going to use a new toolavailable to us in SwiftUI on watchOS 9:ShareLink.We can share our list item by creating a ShareLink with our item.We can optionally customizethe initial text of the messagewith a subject and message.And provide a Preview to display in the Share Sheetwhen someone shares the item.You can use ShareLink to share from your SwiftUI appin iOS, macOS, and watchOS.

Be sure to check out "Meet Transferable"to learn more details and optionsfor ShareLink.Now that I can track when I completed itemsand call for help to get things done,I'd also like to add a chartto see my productivity.I've chosen to use a bar chartbecause I have a single data seriesand distinct data values.

A bar chart will clearly showthis data on a Watch displayas long as I limit the amount of data I display at one time.We're going to start by adding the chart viewto our app's navigation structure.I've chosen a page-based navigation strategybecause there is no list-detail relationshipbetween the item list and the chart.Someone can swipe between the listand the chart at any time.

To add the page-based navigationfor our list and chart,let's start by creating an ItemList struct to encapsulate the list view.

I moved the entire content of the content viewto this new item list.Encapsulating the item list here will allow usto have simple, easy-to-read tab view codein the content view.

We also need to create a struct for our chart view.

I'll temporarily put in a placeholderso we can focus on our navigation structurebefore we build our chart.

Now we'll set up a content viewwith a page-style tab view with 2 tabs:the item list and the chart.

Since we've set up our navigation structure,let's talk about how to build this chart.I know I could use a SwiftUI Canvasand draw a chart,but starting in watchOS 9,we have an easier answer: Swift Charts.Swift Charts are also available on iOS, macOS, and tvOS,so you can reuse your charts anywhere you're using SwiftUI.

We'll aggregate the data we want to chartand then let Swift Charts display it for us.

For our chart, we want to show the number of items completed by date.We'll create a struct to store the aggregate data for the chart.

Then we'll write a small methodto aggregate our list item datainto chart data elements.

Display a simple chart by specifying the data to displayand defining the series from the data.We're using the date as the x-valueand the number of items completed as the y-value.

To achieve the appearance I want on my Watch display,I'm customizing the x-axisusing the Chart's chartXAxis modifier.I'm specifying a format style for the axis value labels.I also don't want vertical gridlines,so I omitted an AxisGridLine mark.I'm also customizing the y-axis using the chartYAxis modifier.I specify a gridline style that looks good with my chart on Watch.I'm formatting the axis value labels as integersand omitting the top labelto prevent it from being clipped at the top of the chart.To learn more about the amazing things you can achieve with Swift Charts,check out "Hello Swift Charts"and "Swift Charts: Raise the bar."Our chart looks pretty good,but I'd like to show a little more databut still keep a great Watch experience,so I'm going to make it scrollable.To accomplish this, we're going to usea new digitalCrownRotation modifierthat allows us to set a callbackfor digital crown events,and we're going to implementa custom scrolling behavior for our chart.

Let's get ready to add the digitalCrownRotation modifierby adding some properties to store the stateas someone scrolls across the chart.

The highlightedDateIndex is the index of the data pointfor the current scroll position.

We'll store the crown offsetso we can display the current crown positionas the person is scrolling across the chart.This is an intermediate value, on or between data points,while the crown is moving.

To keep track of whether someone is actively scrolling,we'll store the the idle state.We'll use this informationto add a little animationas crown scrolling stops and starts.

Now that we have the properties to store values,we can add the digitalCrownRotation modifier.

We'll bind the detent value to the highlightedDateIndex property.

In mechanical terms, a detent is a mechanismthat holds something in a positionuntil enough force is applied to move it.For instance, when I open my car door,there is a "stop" position where the door will settle.I can push a little harderand open the door wider to another "stop."To close it, I need to pull hard enoughto overcome the resistance to pull it out of the "stop."Otherwise, it will spring back into that resting position.This is a detent.The stop for the car doorhelps us understand detent in this API.The detent is the resting notch positionof the crown on your view.

In the handler for the onChange callback,we'll set the value for isCrownIdle to false,since we know that the crown is scrolling,and we'll set the crownOffset value to the current valueto let us show the current position on the chart during scrolling.

In the handler for the onIdle callback,we'll set the value for isCrownIdle to true.

Now we can display the position of the crownas we scroll on the chart.

To do this, we can use the RuleMark from Swift Charts.A RuleMark is a straight line on your chart.You can use it to display a horizontal or vertical line,to display a threshold, for example,or to display a sloped line.

We're going to create a RuleMarkwith the crown offset date valueto display the current location of crown scrolling.

Just to make this look a little better,I'd like to have the crown position line fadewhen the crown stops moving.It's simple to animate thisusing the isCrownIdle property we added.

We'll add a property to store the opacity for the color we're usingin the foregroundStyle for the RuleMark.

And add an onChange modifier to the chartto animate the crownPositionOpacity value changewhen the isCrownIdle value changes.

Then update the foregroundStyle for the RuleMark to use the opacity.

To display the value next to the bar on the chart as we scroll,we can add an annotation to the BarMark.We'll position the annotation on the top leading side of the barwhen it's the last bar.Otherwise, we'll position iton the top trailing side.

Let's take a moment to see what we've accomplishedwith just the digitalCrownRotation modifier,the RuleMark in Swift Charts,and a simple SwiftUI animation.

The final step to creating our custom scrollable chartis adjusting the data range for the chart as someone scrolls.Create a property to store the visible range.

Create the chartData variable to provide the data in the range to the chart.When the highlightedDateIndex changes,call a method to check the chartDataRangeand update it if necessary.

As someone scrolls across the chart using the Digital Crown,the chart will scroll to display the available data.

Now we've finished implementing all the features we had planned.

To learn more about the new SwiftUI featuresavailable in watchOS 9,check out "What's New in SwiftUI."As you're planning your Watch app,or your new Watch app features,think about what makesa great Watch app experience.

While you're designing your app,consider your app navigation strategyto ensure that your app is easy and intuitive.And use SwiftUI for simpler and richer development options.Keep building great Watch apps.And remember,because of you, there's an app for that!
