right.Part of engineering great privacyis giving people choices and controlover how their data is used.When people have these choicesand understand how their data will be linked or shared,they are more likely to trust and engage with your app.That's why, beginning last year,App Store policy requires apps to receive users' permissionbefore tracking users across apps and websitesowned by other companies by adoptingthe AppTrackingTransparency framework.Today, I'm going to talk to you about when and how to adoptApp Tracking Transparency.First, I'll start with some background on trackingto help you understand if and when your app needs to adoptthe AppTrackingTransparency framework.Then, I'll highlight some key things to keep in mindwhen adopting the framework in practice.Let's get started with some background on tracking.So, how is tracking defined for App Tracking Transparency?Tracking refers to linking user or device datacollected from your app with user or device datacollected from other companies' apps, websites,or offline properties for targeted advertisingor advertising-measurement purposes.Tracking also refers to sharing user or device datawith data brokers.Let's talk through some example scenariosto better understand how tracking is defined.First, let's look at an advertising scenariothat doesn't involve tracking.Suppose I download an app called Pal About,and the Pal About app has a featurethat lets me search for places and eventsthat are happening nearby.Now suppose I use Pal About to search for placesthat serve waffles near me, which results in Pal Aboutstoring waffles as an interest of mine.Pal About later wants to show an ad for breakfast placestargeting people who like breakfast foods.Using the data Pal About stores about me from my searches,Pal About shows me the breakfast ad.In this example, Pal About doesn't link my datawith any data from an app or websiteowned by another company to show me the breakfast ad,so this scenario would not be considered tracking.For another example that wouldn't be considered tracking,suppose the company that owns Pal About -- Pal About Inc. --has another app that I use called Pal About Plus.And Pal About's server links together data collected about mein Pal About Plus, like my interest in tacos,with data collected about me in Pal About.After linking this data, Pal About shows me an adfor a taco truck using the fact I like tacoscollected from Pal About Plus.In this example, the Pal About app doesn't needto get my permission to track because it isn't tracking.Pal About doesn't link my data from Pal Aboutwith any data from an app or websiteowned by another company.Let's now consider a scenario that would require Pal Aboutto get permission to track.Suppose there's a food delivery app I usethat's owned by a different company than Pal About.And I've used the food delivery appto place orders late at night.When I signed up for the food delivery app,I gave the app my email address --the same email address I used to sign up for Pal Aboutand that Pal About stores for my account.The food delivery app includes codethat shares my email addressand the fact I often order at night with Pal About.The Pal About server uses my email address to link togethermy interest in waffles, collected by the Pal About app,to the fact I order at night,collected in the food delivery app.Finally, Pal About uses the combinationof my ordering habits and my interest in wafflesto show me an ad for a restaurantthat serves all-day breakfast.This scenario would require Pal Aboutto request permission to trackbecause it linked user data from Pal About --my email address --with another company's user data --my email and habit of ordering at night --for advertising purposes.In this example, data is linked together across appswith an email address.Even if the email address or another user identifieris hashed before it is used to link data,it would still require permission to trackbecause it would still be linking data about a userfrom the app with another company's data about that user.The type of identifier and whether or not it is hasheddoesn't change the fact it is being used for tracking,which is what requires permission.Another thing you'll need to considerto determine if your app needs to request permission to trackis how third-party SDKs use and share data from your app.As a developer,you're responsible for the behavior of your whole app.Returning to our example, suppose the Pal About developerhasn't written any code themselvesthat would require permission to track,but would like to include a third-party SDK in their appfor advertising-measurement purposes.Whether Pal About needs permission to trackin order to include the SDK depends on whether or notthe SDK combines user data from Pal Aboutwith user data from other companies' apps or websites.For example, if the SDK shares user data from Pal Aboutto provide analytics about ads in Pal About,but doesn't link the user data it collects from Pal Aboutwith user data from other companies,it doesn't require permission to track.Now suppose instead,the SDK shares user data from Pal About with an ad network,and the ad network links the data it receivesabout how I use Pal Aboutwith data about ads I saw in other companies' appsto compare the impact of ad campaigns in those apps.This requires Pal About to request users' permissionto track because this SDK is tracking.This is considered tracking regardless of whether Pal Aboutuses the SDK for those purposes,or even if Pal About only gets aggregate reportingafter Pal About users' data is linkedwith other companies' users' data.If you're unsure about whether an SDK you want to usewould contain code that would requireApp Tracking Transparency,you should ask the developer of that SDK.This responsibility applies not just to SDKs,but to any libraries or third-party code your app uses.So far, we've looked at examples that involve linking user data.Now let's look at another scenariothat's considered tracking:sharing user or device data with data brokers.First, how are data brokers defined?Data brokers are defined by law in some jurisdictions.But in general, a data broker is a companythat regularly collects and sells, licenses,or otherwise discloses to third partiesthe personal information of particular end userswith whom the business does not have a direct relationship.Let's look at sharing data with a data broker in an example.Suppose the Pal About app includes client codethat sends my interest in wafflesand an account identifier to a data broker.This scenario counts as trackingwhether or not the data that is sharedis linked with data from other companiesfor advertising or advertising measurement.Sharing of user data with a data brokerrequires permission to track.And even if Pal About client codedoesn't directly send my account identifierand my interest in waffles to the data broker,but instead this interest is sent to Pal About's serverand the server later shares accountsinterested in waffles with the data broker,this would require getting permission to trackeven though my device isn't communicatingwith the data broker directly.We've now talked through how the definition of trackingapplies to some example scenarios.For more information about how App Tracking Transparencydefines tracking, you can visitthe User Privacy and Data Use page.Now, if you've determined that your appwould like to track users,you'll need to ask for and obtain the user's permissionbefore you do so.Here's how.To ask for permission for your app to track,you'll need to present the app tracking authorizationrequest prompt by callingthe requestTrackingAuthorization method.Calling this method will cause a system permission alert --like this one for Pal About -- to appear over your app.This is a one-time prompt.The system will remember the user's choiceand won't prompt againunless the app is uninstalled and reinstalled.The next thing you'll need to do is providea NSUserTrackingUsageDescription key in your app's info.plist.The string provided here will be shown in the system promptand informs the user why the app is requesting permissionto use data for tracking the user or the device.A great purpose string is clear, concise, and helps usersunderstand why they are being asked to allow tracking.This string doesn't need to include the app's name,because the system will automatically identifythe requesting app and display the app namein the system prompt.If you don't include a usage-description string,your app will crash when the system prompt is shown.Finally, use trackingAuthorizationStatusto determine the user's app-tracking permission statusfor your app.If a user has selected Allow for this app,then you have their permission to link their activityin that app across other apps and websitesas long as their tracking authorization statusremains authorized.Users can change and grant or revoketheir tracking authorization at any time,so make sure your app checks the tracking authorization statuseach time it is launched and only continues to trackwhen the value of the tracking authorization statusis authorized.Users can control whether apps have their permission to trackon a per-app basis.Just because a user has given one of your appspermission to track doesn't mean you have their permissionto track in another app owned by the same company.Different apps must each individually request permissionfrom the user for that particular appbefore data from that app can be linkedto apps or websites owned by other companiesfor marketing or advertising.If your app doesn't havetracking authorization for a user,there are a couple things to keep in mind.First, per the App Store review guidelines,your app must not gate any of its functionalityon whether the user agrees to allow tracking.Second, the IDFA API will return all zerosif the user has asked your app not to track.If a user has opted out of tracking,there are nontracking alternatives for advertisingor advertising measurement for your app.For example, your app could choose to serve first-party adsor contextual ads.And for advertising measurement, we continue to build and improveprivacy preserving ad-attribution technologiesthat ad networks can adopt.For more information about recent improvementsto SKAdNetwork and private click measurement, you can refer to"Meet privacy preserving ad attribution"and "What's new in SKAdNetwork."You'll also need to declare what data your app usesto track for display in your app's privacy nutrition label.Filling out your privacy nutrition labelwhen submitting your app to the App Storeand getting permission to track usingthe AppTrackingTransparency frameworkare two separate steps that are both requiredif your app would like to use data for tracking.For more information about nutrition labelsand how to fill them out for your app,see "Create your Privacy Nutrition Label."Finally, let's talk about fingerprinting.With permission, tracking is allowed.But fingerprinting is never allowed.Regardless of whether a user gives your apppermission to track, fingerprinting --or using signals from the deviceto try to identify the device or user --is not allowedper the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.Some examples of user or device data used for fingerprintinginclude properties of a user's web browserand its configuration,the user's device and its configuration,the user's location, or the user's network connection.Collecting any data solely for the purposeof generating a fingerprint is also not allowed.It's important people have transparency and controlover how their data is used for tracking.We hope

Part of engineering great privacyis giving people choices and controlover how their data is used.

When people have these choicesand understand how their data will be linked or shared,they are more likely to trust and engage with your app.

That's why, beginning last year,App Store policy requires apps to receive users' permissionbefore tracking users across apps and websitesowned by other companies by adoptingthe AppTrackingTransparency framework.

Today, I'm going to talk to you about when and how to adoptApp Tracking Transparency.

First, I'll start with some background on trackingto help you understand if and when your app needs to adoptthe AppTrackingTransparency framework.

Then, I'll highlight some key things to keep in mindwhen adopting the framework in practice.

Let's get started with some background on tracking.

So, how is tracking defined for App Tracking Transparency?Tracking refers to linking user or device datacollected from your app with user or device datacollected from other companies' apps, websites,or offline properties for targeted advertisingor advertising-measurement purposes.

Tracking also refers to sharing user or device datawith data brokers.

Let's talk through some example scenariosto better understand how tracking is defined.

First, let's look at an advertising scenariothat doesn't involve tracking.

Suppose I download an app called Pal About,and the Pal About app has a featurethat lets me search for places and eventsthat are happening nearby.

Now suppose I use Pal About to search for placesthat serve waffles near me, which results in Pal Aboutstoring waffles as an interest of mine.

Pal About later wants to show an ad for breakfast placestargeting people who like breakfast foods.

Using the data Pal About stores about me from my searches,Pal About shows me the breakfast ad.

In this example, Pal About doesn't link my datawith any data from an app or websiteowned by another company to show me the breakfast ad,so this scenario would not be considered tracking.

For another example that wouldn't be considered tracking,suppose the company that owns Pal About -- Pal About Inc. --has another app that I use called Pal About Plus.

And Pal About's server links together data collected about mein Pal About Plus, like my interest in tacos,with data collected about me in Pal About.

After linking this data, Pal About shows me an adfor a taco truck using the fact I like tacoscollected from Pal About Plus.

In this example, the Pal About app doesn't needto get my permission to track because it isn't tracking.

Pal About doesn't link my data from Pal Aboutwith any data from an app or websiteowned by another company.

Let's now consider a scenario that would require Pal Aboutto get permission to track.

Suppose there's a food delivery app I usethat's owned by a different company than Pal About.

And I've used the food delivery appto place orders late at night.

When I signed up for the food delivery app,I gave the app my email address --the same email address I used to sign up for Pal Aboutand that Pal About stores for my account.

The food delivery app includes codethat shares my email addressand the fact I often order at night with Pal About.

The Pal About server uses my email address to link togethermy interest in waffles, collected by the Pal About app,to the fact I order at night,collected in the food delivery app.

Finally, Pal About uses the combinationof my ordering habits and my interest in wafflesto show me an ad for a restaurantthat serves all-day breakfast.

This scenario would require Pal Aboutto request permission to trackbecause it linked user data from Pal About --my email address --with another company's user data --my email and habit of ordering at night --for advertising purposes.

In this example, data is linked together across appswith an email address.

Even if the email address or another user identifieris hashed before it is used to link data,it would still require permission to trackbecause it would still be linking data about a userfrom the app with another company's data about that user.

The type of identifier and whether or not it is hasheddoesn't change the fact it is being used for tracking,which is what requires permission.

Another thing you'll need to considerto determine if your app needs to request permission to trackis how third-party SDKs use and share data from your app.

As a developer,you're responsible for the behavior of your whole app.

Returning to our example, suppose the Pal About developerhasn't written any code themselvesthat would require permission to track,but would like to include a third-party SDK in their appfor advertising-measurement purposes.

Whether Pal About needs permission to trackin order to include the SDK depends on whether or notthe SDK combines user data from Pal Aboutwith user data from other companies' apps or websites.

For example, if the SDK shares user data from Pal Aboutto provide analytics about ads in Pal About,but doesn't link the user data it collects from Pal Aboutwith user data from other companies,it doesn't require permission to track.

Now suppose instead,the SDK shares user data from Pal About with an ad network,and the ad network links the data it receivesabout how I use Pal Aboutwith data about ads I saw in other companies' appsto compare the impact of ad campaigns in those apps.

This requires Pal About to request users' permissionto track because this SDK is tracking.

This is considered tracking regardless of whether Pal Aboutuses the SDK for those purposes,or even if Pal About only gets aggregate reportingafter Pal About users' data is linkedwith other companies' users' data.

If you're unsure about whether an SDK you want to usewould contain code that would requireApp Tracking Transparency,you should ask the developer of that SDK.

This responsibility applies not just to SDKs,but to any libraries or third-party code your app uses.

So far, we've looked at examples that involve linking user data.

Now let's look at another scenariothat's considered tracking:sharing user or device data with data brokers.

First, how are data brokers defined?Data brokers are defined by law in some jurisdictions.

But in general, a data broker is a companythat regularly collects and sells, licenses,or otherwise discloses to third partiesthe personal information of particular end userswith whom the business does not have a direct relationship.

Let's look at sharing data with a data broker in an example.

Suppose the Pal About app includes client codethat sends my interest in wafflesand an account identifier to a data broker.

This scenario counts as trackingwhether or not the data that is sharedis linked with data from other companiesfor advertising or advertising measurement.

Sharing of user data with a data brokerrequires permission to track.

And even if Pal About client codedoesn't directly send my account identifierand my interest in waffles to the data broker,but instead this interest is sent to Pal About's serverand the server later shares accountsinterested in waffles with the data broker,this would require getting permission to trackeven though my device isn't communicatingwith the data broker directly.

We've now talked through how the definition of trackingapplies to some example scenarios.

For more information about how App Tracking Transparencydefines tracking, you can visitthe User Privacy and Data Use page.

Now, if you've determined that your appwould like to track users,you'll need to ask for and obtain the user's permissionbefore you do so.

Here's how.

To ask for permission for your app to track,you'll need to present the app tracking authorizationrequest prompt by callingthe requestTrackingAuthorization method.

Calling this method will cause a system permission alert --like this one for Pal About -- to appear over your app.

This is a one-time prompt.

The system will remember the user's choiceand won't prompt againunless the app is uninstalled and reinstalled.

The next thing you'll need to do is providea NSUserTrackingUsageDescription key in your app's info.plist.

The string provided here will be shown in the system promptand informs the user why the app is requesting permissionto use data for tracking the user or the device.

A great purpose string is clear, concise, and helps usersunderstand why they are being asked to allow tracking.

This string doesn't need to include the app's name,because the system will automatically identifythe requesting app and display the app namein the system prompt.

If you don't include a usage-description string,your app will crash when the system prompt is shown.

Finally, use trackingAuthorizationStatusto determine the user's app-tracking permission statusfor your app.

If a user has selected Allow for this app,then you have their permission to link their activityin that app across other apps and websitesas long as their tracking authorization statusremains authorized.

Users can change and grant or revoketheir tracking authorization at any time,so make sure your app checks the tracking authorization statuseach time it is launched and only continues to trackwhen the value of the tracking authorization statusis authorized.

Users can control whether apps have their permission to trackon a per-app basis.

Just because a user has given one of your appspermission to track doesn't mean you have their permissionto track in another app owned by the same company.

Different apps must each individually request permissionfrom the user for that particular appbefore data from that app can be linkedto apps or websites owned by other companiesfor marketing or advertising.

If your app doesn't havetracking authorization for a user,there are a couple things to keep in mind.

First, per the App Store review guidelines,your app must not gate any of its functionalityon whether the user agrees to allow tracking.

For more information about recent improvementsto SKAdNetwork and private click measurement, you can refer to"Meet privacy preserving ad attribution"and "What's new in SKAdNetwork."You'll also need to declare what data your app usesto track for display in your app's privacy nutrition label.

Filling out your privacy nutrition labelwhen submitting your app to the App Storeand getting permission to track usingthe AppTrackingTransparency frameworkare two separate steps that are both requiredif your app would like to use data for tracking.

For more information about nutrition labelsand how to fill them out for your app,see "Create your Privacy Nutrition Label."Finally, let's talk about fingerprinting.

With permission, tracking is allowed.

But fingerprinting is never allowed.

Regardless of whether a user gives your apppermission to track, fingerprinting --or using signals from the deviceto try to identify the device or user --is not allowedper the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.

Some examples of user or device data used for fingerprintinginclude properties of a user's web browserand its configuration,the user's device and its configuration,the user's location, or the user's network connection.

Collecting any data solely for the purposeof generating a fingerprint is also not allowed.

It's important people have transparency and controlover how their data is used for tracking.

We hope that by tuning in to this session,you now have the tools you need to determinewhen and how to give people that control by adoptingthe AppTrackingTransparency framework.
