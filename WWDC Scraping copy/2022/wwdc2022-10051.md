Search this video…♪ ♪August Joki: Hello, I'm August Joki,a software engineer on watchOS,and I'm here to show you how to go further with WidgetKit complications.I hope you've seen the wonderful Complications and Widgets: Reloaded talkfirst, covering the basics of complications in WidgetKit.This talk expands on the concepts covered thereas they relate to complications on the watch faces.And my WWDC 2020 talk: Build complications in SwiftUIcovers more specifics about tinting and SwiftUI drawing in complications.In this talk, I'll be discussing the WidgetKit featuresunique to watchOS,as well as how to migrate your, and your users',existing ClockKit complications to WidgetKit.I've taken inspiration from the Coffee Tracker sample appto use as an example throughout this talk.The app records the number of coffees, teas, and sodasyou drink throughout the dayand tracks the amount of caffeine in your body over time.Let's start with what's unique to watchOS.In iOS 16 we brought complication style widgetsto the phone's lock screenand in watchOS 9 we brought WidgetKit to the watch's complications.On the watch faces we have a unique complication presentationfor the corners of the watch screen.And it requires a unique WidgetKit familycalled accessoryCorner, to describe it.Part of that unique presentation is auxiliary contentspecified by your SwiftUI view,but not rendered as part of your content.Instead, it is rendered by the watch face.The circular part of the corner is standard SwiftUI renderingand the auxiliary content is the curved part in the corners.Or in the dial on the Infograph face.The accessoryInline family has a unique behavior on watch faces.It has multiple ways of being rendered depending on the face.Sometimes flat,sometimes curved to match the dial.Let's talk about how to support these unique featuresby looking at how the coffee tracker app might be updated to use WidgetKit.In addition to the three new complication-styled widget familieson iOS 16: AccessoryRectangular,accessoryCircular, and accessoryInline,we have a fourth family on watchOS 9 called accessoryCorner.accessoryCorner can either be shown as a large circular content,like the maps and heart rate complications shown in the lower corners,or as smaller circular content with a curved label or gaugelike the coffee tracker and moonphase complications shown in the upper corners.To control whether the inner auxiliary content is shown,watchOS 9 has added a new view modifier you can use, which I'll show you now.Let's look at building a corner complication for my coffee tracker app.Starting with the larger circular content style,I have a ZStack with an SF Symbol and a background.The SwiftUI content is automatically clipped to a circleto keep in line with the design of the other corner complications.To add the inner curved content, we use the new to watchOS 9widgetLabel view modifier.The watch face extracts the contents of the modifier to draw the controlappropriate for the family and the style of the watch face.And the circular content automatically scales down to make room.For accessoryCorner you can specify a SwiftUI text, gauge,or progressView in your widget's label.AccessoryCorner isn't the only family that supports widgetLabel.Let's look at how it is used on the accessoryCircular family.On the Infograph watch face, in addition to the corner complications,there are four circular complications inside the dial.My coffee tracker circular complication, in the middle top,looks very similar to the corner complication we just saw,but with text in the dial.I'll show you how to add that text now.For my circular complication design, I thought it more appropriateto move the gauge that was in the widgetLabelin my corner complication, to be front and center.To take advantage of the top middle position on Infograph,I add a widgetLabel to the gauge in order to display additional textin the longer bezel area that wouldn't otherwise fit in the circular content.But now I have redundant information between the main viewand the text above it.I can clean that up by switching the circular contentto that good looking coffee cup SF Symbol from my corner complicationBut when I switch to a face showing my circular complicationthat does not have the bezel,then I've lost all of my caffeine info.Luckily, there's a piece of API I can add to make my complication workin both cases.I update my complication to add the Environment propertycalled showsWidgetLabel to my view.This will be true whenever the complication is in a positionon the watch face that shows the content in the widget's label.And then I can change the content to depend on the value of showsWidgetLabelso I am able to have the appropriate level of information in each complication spot.I just demonstrated two different ways that the accessoryCircular familycan show up on watch faces,and there is one more way you need to be aware of.The Extra Large watch face has long been a great way for people to see the timein an extra large format.And it supports a single, large circular complication.The Extra Large face uses the accessoryCircular familyand automatically scales up the content to match the style of the face.Please note: as this face is designedto have a single, large complication,do not use the increased canvas sizeas an opportunity to densely pack your complication.The content should be identical to the normal circular family, only larger.As I mentioned earlier, there are two more widget families usedon watch faces: accessoryRectangular and accessoryInline.There are no faces with rectangular complications that show the widgetLabel.And the accessoryInline family acts, already, as a widgetLabel.The watch face extracts Images and Texts from your inline contentand renders them itself to match the look of the face.Next up is Migration.There are two parts to migration:rewriting your existing ClockKit complication code in WidgetKit;and providing a mapping to let the system know how to upgradeyour complications people have set on their watch faces.When you adopt WidgetKit the system will stop asking your ClockKit data sourcefor new content and show only your new complications in the face editing picker.As well as bringing WidgetKit to the watch,watchOS 9 has updated every face to support rich complications,which allowed us to dramatically reduce the number of complication familiesfrom 12 to only 4.Rectangular and Corner map directly acrossto accessoryRectangular and accessoryCorner.All three graphic Circular styled ClockKit familiesare now a single accessoryCircular WidgetKit family.And the accessoryInline family is used where the old utilitarianSmallFlator utilitarianLarge used to be.And many places that used to be utilitarianSmallhave been updated to use the accessoryCorner family.With WidgetKit, SwiftUI views and their state driven layouthave replaced ClockKit's templates.WidgetKit still has familiar timelines and entries.In fact, they were originally inspired by ClockKit itself,which means that your complication data source will nicely migrateto one of either a static or intent based WidgetKit configuration.Please see the original WidgetKit talk for more detailsabout the types of configurations WidgetKit supportsas well as general family support.We've added one last API to ClockKit to allow a person's complicationsto be migrated by the system automatically.This allows for your existing complications that are alreadyon watch faces to automatically be upgraded to your new WidgetKit basedcomplications without any user interaction.When your app gets updated on a watch,the Watch Faces will check for the presence of widgetsin your app's bundle.If it finds any, it will then launch your ClockKit complication data sourceto generate the migrations for the existing complications.From this point forward, your CLKComplicationDataSourcewill only be run to ask for migrations when a person receives a shared facewith your ClockKit complications on it.The system will ask for your migrations every time a new face is shared,so for a consistent experience you should keep your migrations consistent.Once you've finished creating your beautiful WidgetKit complications,you can add the new property, widgetMigrator,to provide the object that conforms to the new Migrator protocol.Be that your complication data source itself or some other type you provide.The CLKComplication WidgetMigrator protocol has a single functionto provide to the watch faces widget migration configurationsfrom existing CLKComplicationDescriptors.The most straightforward way to adopt the new APIis to have your data source conform to the new Migrator protocol.If your WidgetKit complication uses the static configuration,you provide a static migration configuration.And there's an equivalent migration configurationif you use intents in your widget complication.Note that if you provide intent based migration configurations,you will need to also include your intent definitions in your watch appas well as your widget extensions,so you can create your intent objects in both places.WidgetKit enables new and creative ways to make complications for the watch,while dramatically simplifying the experience.Thanks for watching.
