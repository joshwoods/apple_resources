extensionswhich help people categorize incoming SMS messagesfrom unknown senders.First, I will describe how SMS message filters work.Next, I will talk about what's new in iOS 16.I will walk through an example of how to build a message filter extensionusing iOS 16 APIs,then show you what people will see in Messageswhen they use your extension.Finally, I will talk about enhancementsto Apple's SMS filter for India.Let's talk about SMS message filters.In many countries, SMS messages are now used by businessesto notify customers about transactions,marketing campaigns, alerts, and reminders.In this example you can see a mix of SMS messagesincluding short codes,alphanumeric codes, and standard phone numbers.This results in a very cluttered inbox,and it's really difficult to find personal messagesfrom your loved ones.iOS does provide an option to filter messages from unknown senders,but if you receive several messages each day,even the unknown sender folder will quickly get filledwith unread messages.Automated filtering of SMS messages is important to many people,and iOS provides a securesandbox-based extension modelthat allow you to further classify messages from unknown senders.People can find and install SMS filter apps from the App Store.Once installed, you can turn on message filteringby going to Settings, Messages,Unknown & Spam, and turning on Filter Unknown Senders.Then, you can select your SMS filter of choice.Here we have installed two SMS filters.Note that only one filter can be active at a time.In iOS 14 and later,new folders will appear in Messagesfor Transactions, Promotions, and Junk.These folders help people organize and find messagesthat are most relevant to them.Regardless of which filter is chosen,Messages provide the same classification structureconsisting of Transactions, Promotions, and Junk.We have heard from you loud and clear,that you would like to provide more detailed classifications.So in iOS 16 we are introducing enhancementsto the filter classification API.Now your SMS message filter extensioncan classify messages into 12 additional sub-categories.Here are the new sub-categories that you can specifyin your SMS filter extension.The new sub-categories fall under the existing top level categories–Transactions and Promotions.Now you can further refine incoming messagesand provide an even better experience.For example, in markets like India,it's common to receive a large number of messagesrelated to financial transactions.These include activities in their bank accountand alerts for credit card spending.These messages can now be nicely organizedin the Finance sub-folder under Transactions.Let's see how the flow works for SMS message filters.We can divide the flow into two phases;configuration and runtime classification.In the configuration phase,users select your message filter in Settings.This triggers a new API introduced in iOS 16to request the capabilities supported by your filter.You can now respond with a list of supported categoriesand sub-categories.In this example, the filter reportsthat it supports the sub-categoriesFinance, Orders, and Coupons.iOS validates these capabilitiesand updates the inbox in Messageswith the appropriate folders.In the runtime classification phase,every time an SMS message is received from an unknown sender,iOS queries your filterto determine which category and sub-category it belongs to.You can also see the terms action and sub-action used here.Filters must respond with one of the capabilities declaredin the configuration phase.The SMS message will then appearin the corresponding sub-folder in Messages.Let's build a simple message filter extensionto see how the APIs are usedand what people will see in Messages.In Xcode, you start by creatinga new Message Filter Extension target.The Message Filter Extension target appears as one of the optionswhen you create a new targetand go to template selection.Select the Message Filter Extension and click Next.Now give your filter a name and click Finish.When the target is created,MessageFilterExtension.swift will be auto-populatedwith all the required functions.In iOS 16, we have a new API handlecalled capabilitiesRequest.Fill in the ILMessageFilterCapabilitiesQueryResponsestructure with the transactional or promotional sub-actionsthat you support.You can specify up to five sub-actions.Here we are indicating support for Finance,Orders, and Health sub-actions under Transactions,and Coupons and Offers sub-actions under Promotions.Now build and install your filter extension.When you choose your filter in Settings,the Message inbox will be updatedwith the sub-actions we declared;Finance, Orders, and Health appear under Transactions,and Coupons and Offers appear under Promotions.Now, we have confirmed that our configuration works.Let's define some simple logicto return suitable categories to iOSwhen an incoming SMS message is received.First, we extract the message body text from the queryRequest object.If the message contains specific keywords,we return a suitable matching action and sub-action.Here, we have added the code where if the keyword is debitedthen we will return filterAction as Transactionand filterSubaction as transactionalfinance.Similarly, when the message has the keyword coupon,then Promotion and PromotionalCoupons will be returned.You can also update the business logicfor other sub classifications within Transactions and Promotions.Note that if you return an incorrect combinationfor filterAction and filterSubAction,iOS will discard the sub-actionand only honor the action.For example, if we return the action Transactionand sub-action Coupons,then the message will only go to the All Transaction folder.Here, we have an example of SMS received from bankwith the keyword "debited"and it has been classified under Finance sub-folder by Messages.Here is another examplewhere we have received a Black Friday Deal with the keyword "coupon."In Messages it has been classified under the Coupons sub-folder.In iOS 16, you can choose sub-categoriesthat are the best fit for your user demographics.In the first example, the SMS message filter shows foldersfor Orders, Reminders, Health,Public Services, and Weather under Transactions,while the second example shows folders for Finance,Reminders, Health, and Rewardsunder Transactionsand Offers under Promotions.Your filter extension can use these sub-categoriesto provide a differentiated experience for your users.Apple provides an SMS filter in India,and we have updated it using the enhancements in iOS 16.The Apple SMS filter in Indianow supports additional sub-foldersincluding Finance, Orders,and Reminders under Transactions.Your bank transactions appear in Finance,your food or commercial delivery messagesare organized under Orders,while important events and to-do's appear in the Reminders folder.To wrap up, in this video we talked about SMS message filtersand how they can classify messages into Transactions,Promotions, and Junk.In iOS 16, your message filter extensioncan now classify messages into 12 additional sub-categories.To learn more, see the API documentationin the link accompanying this video.I look forward to seeing your new and creative ideasto help people organize SMS messages.And as always, we appreciate your feedbackto help us improve SMS message filtering in future.
