Adopting Swift Packages in Xcode

Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip hop music ♪♪Hello, my name is Anders.In this video,I'll show you how to get started with Swift package plugins.Swift Packages were introduced in Xcode 11.They provide a great way of distributing librariesas source code.Xcode 14 extends this approach to your development workflow,letting you use plugins to do thingslike generating source code during a build,or automating your release tasks.We'll start by taking a look at what package plugins areand how they work, and then talk in more detailabout the two kinds of package plugins that Xcode 14 supports:command plugins and build tool plugins.So first of all, what is a plugin?A package plugin is a Swift script that can performactions on a Swift package or an Xcode project.A plugin uses API that Xcode providesespecially for this purpose.Package plugins are implemented as Swift packages.A package can provide pluginstogether with libraries and executables,or a package could focus only on providing plugins.A package plugin can be implementedusing more than one source file,and a Swift package can define more than one plugin.A highly specialized plugincan be private to the package that provides it,and in that case, it's available only within that package.But a general-purpose plugin can be made availableto other packages by defining it as a package product.That lets other packages use it too,in a way that's similar to how a packagecan use a library from another package.But unlike a library, a dependency on a plugindoes not bring in runtime content into your app.Instead, it lets you access development toolsthat run on your own machine or in your build automation.So what can a package plugin do?Well, in Xcode 14 there are two kinds of package plugins:command plugins and build tool plugins.Command plugins implement custom actionsthat you can run whenever you want to.They can run source code formatters or linters,or they can perform other tasksas part of your development workflow.That might include updating contributor listsor copyright dates in source files based on Git history,or other things you might have arbitrary scripts to do today.If it needs to, a command plugincan ask for permission to modify the files in a package.And that's especially useful for code formatting.Not all command plugins need write permission.Some commands could create reports or calculate metricsabout your code, without needing to make any changes.Build tool plugins extend the build system's dependency graph.They're particularly useful for generating source codeor resources as part of a build.Unlike command plugins, which are invokedfor a whole package or a project at a time,build tool plugins are applied to each target that needs them.Let's take a look at using a command plugin in Xcode.Here's a little iOS appthat shows various kinds of geometric shapes.It's composed of an app project and a local package.The package implements a librarythat provides the core data types and logic for the app.I'm thinking of splitting out the packageinto its own repository so that others can use it,and as part of this, I'd like to create a contributor filethat lists everyone who has committed code of this package.I could write a custom script to do this.But I know of a package that providessome useful plugins for working with code,and I think it has a plugin that does exactly what I want.To get access to those plugins, I'll do the same thingas if I needed a library from another package:I'm going to add a package dependencyin the manifest of my local package.When I save the manifest, Xcode fetches the remote packageand it appears in the Package Dependencies section.I notice that Xcode has also fetched SwiftFormat,which is a popular tool for formatting code.This is because one of the command pluginsin the utility package in turn has a dependency on SwiftFormat.Now that I've added this dependency,I have access to any plugin commandsthat the package provides.I use the context menu on the packageI want to apply the command to.Now there are three new commands in the menu;one is for reformatting source code using SwiftFormat,and two others provide specialized actions.One of them generates or updates contributor listsbased on the commit history in Git,and another updates the copyright datesin my source files.The command in the middle there does exactly what I want.When I invoke the plugin command on my package,Xcode lets me choosewhich of its targets to pass to the plugin.In this case, I'm going to invoke it on the whole package.And if the plugin takes custom arguments,I can pass those here as well.I click Run, and because the pluginis going to modify the file system,Xcode warns me about that.I can see the plugin author's stated reasonfor wanting to modify my code, but I want to take a peekat the implementation of the plugin as well.So I choose Show Command, and Xcode takes me to the code.What this plugin is doing is safe,so I'm going to invoke the command againand this time, I will choose Run.I'll tell Xcode to remember my choice for this plugin.This particular plugin uses Git history to generatea file listing showing the names of contributors,but there's a lot of flexibility in what command plugins can do.Now that we've used a command plugin in Xcode,let's take a closer look at how plugins work under the hood.Package plugins are Swift scriptsthat are compiled and run when they are needed.Each plugin runs as a separate process.Plugins have access to a distilled representationof the input package, including its source files.A plugin also gets informationabout any dependencies of the package.Many plugins call command-line toolsas part of doing their work.Plugins can also create files and directories,and can perform other actions using standard librariessuch as Foundation.A plugin runs in a sandbox that prevents network accessand that only allows writing to a few places in the file system,such as the build outputs directory.But command plugins can ask for permissionto also modify files in the package source directory.If the user approves, the sandbox is configuredto allow writing to those locations.The plugin can also send results back to Xcode.It can emit warnings and errors,and build tool plugins can define tool invocationsfor Xcode to run during the build.All package plugins use API from the PackagePlugin moduleprovided by Xcode.This API allows the plugin to access the input package,and if appropriate, to return results to Xcode.The main source file that implements the pluginalso defines the main entry point.This should be a class or a struct that conformsto the protocol that matches the type of plugin.The specific entry point function that Xcode callsdepends on what kind of plugin it is.You can learn more about the PackagePlugin APIin the "Create Swift Package plugins" video.Earlier, we used a command pluginto make changes to our package.Let's look at some more of the specifics of command plugins.Command plugins extend the development workflow.They are applied directly to a package,not during a build.Not all command plugins modify the file system --there are useful actionsthat don't involve changing any files.But if a command does want to write to the file system,it must declare that in the manifest of the packagethat implements the plugin.This causes Xcode to ask the userfor permission before letting the plugin run.Plugins are usually quite small,and often depend on other tools to do the actual work.Earlier, we saw that one of the pluginsuses SwiftFormat for all the real work.Dependencies on tool packagescan be either binaries or source code --Xcode will build any required tools from sourcebefore the command is invoked.Note that the plugin can be provided by a different packagethan the tool it relies on.In the implementation of command plugins,the main type conforms to the CommandPlugin protocol,and the plugin implements the performCommand entry point.This entry point takes a contextand any custom arguments provided by the user.Let's look at a different way of invoking command plugins.I'm going to use the same project as before,and because I added the dependencyon the SourceCodeUtilities package earlier,I can invoke the same plugins in Terminal.First I'm going to change directoryinto the CoreLibs package, since that's the packagethat I want to apply the command plugin to.Swift Package Manager 5.6 has a new subcommand for plugins.I'll type "swift package plugin --List"to see what plugins are available.This shows the same plugins as in the menu in Xcode.Here on the command line, each command also showsthe verb that should be used to run it.I'll use the verb for regeneratinga contributor list, as I did in Xcode.This plugin wants permission to write to the file system,since it's going to create a file.I type "yes" to allow this,and the plugin can run and update the contributor list.I could also have useda package manager option that allows the pluginto write to the file system without asking.This is particularly useful if you're invoking itfrom a CI system or other build automation.But be sure you know what the plugin is doingbefore using that option.Just like in Xcode,I can pass command line arguments to the plugin.Any arguments after the plugin's action verbwill be passed to the plugin.In this case, I pass a verbose flagto see more output from the plugin as it runs.Each command plugin defines what arguments it supports.Until now, we've been talking mostly about command plugins.But there are a few more things to sayabout build tool plugins.Unlike a command plugin,a build tool plugin does not do its work immediately.Instead, it creates and returns build tool invocationsfor Xcode to run later when the package is built.Each of those tool invocations has a command line to run,and it also has inputs and outputsthat tells Xcode when to run it.Build tool plugins can define commandsthat run during the build or before the build.We'll take a look at the difference in a minute.Commands returned by build tool plugins are usually configuredto write their outputs to the build directory,so they persist between incremental builds.And like the plugins themselves,the commands defined by a build tool pluginrun in a sandbox that prevents network accessand any changes to the package.In the implementation of a build tool plugin,the main type conforms to the BuildToolPlugin protocoland the plugin implementsthe createBuildCommands entry point.This entry point takes a context and the targetto create build commands for.It returns any custom build commandsthat should run when the package is built.There are two basic kinds of build commandsthat a build tool plugin can return.Ordinary build commands specify input and output paths,and only run when the outputs are missingor the inputs have changed.Prebuild commands run before the build starts,and can be used when the names of the outputsare unknown ahead of time.Prebuild commands run before every build,so they should make sure to do as little work as possiblewhen there are no changes.Build commands and prebuild commandsare great for generating source code or resources.So how does Xcode know which build tool pluginsto apply to a package target?In SwiftPM 5.6 and later,there is a new plugins parameterin the package manifestthat lists the build tool plugins that a target wants.This parameter specifies any build tool pluginsneeded by the target,and just as with any runtime libraries it depends on,those plugins can be either in the same packageor in another package.Let's go back to Xcode.I'm going to configure my geometry appto use a build tool plugin.In this particular case,I have a custom command line tool that generates Swift codebased on some data files in my Core Library target.The specific details aren't important,but what I want to end up withare generated type-safe Swift accessorsfor each piece of data.In addition to my data files, I've been using a custom toolto generate source code that I've checked into my repository.I have been manually running this toolto regenerate Swift wrapper code and committing the changeswhenever my data files change.But with the build tool plugin, I can do better.I can generate the code during the buildand avoid having to keep the generated code in my repository.To get access to the plugin, I go to the package manifestand add a dependency on the package that providesthe source generator plugin I want to use.The targets in my package now have accessto any build tool plugins defined in that package.Now I go to the target that needs to use the plugin,and I add a plugins parameter to its definition.This tells Xcode that it wants to apply a particular build toolfrom that package to my target.Now I can go and delete those generated source filesfrom my repository.They'll be created or updated as needed during the build.There, that's much cleaner.And now when I build and run my app,my build tool plugintells Xcode to invoke my code-generation toolwhenever my data files change.The generated code will be storedalong with the other build files in my build folder,keeping my repository clean.In this video, we've talked aboutwhat Swift package plugins are and how they work.We have discussed some of the similaritiesand differences between command pluginsand build tool plugins.Both types of pluginslet you replace a variety of random scriptswith a more structured kind of extensibility in your packages.Build tool plugins let you extend the build systemto generate sources and resources,or to do other custom work as part of your build.Command plugins let you automatecommon development tasks with custom actions.They might be tailored to a particular workflowor could be written to be useful in a wide variety of cases.To learn how to create your own package plugins,be sure to check outthe
