Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop music ♪♪Hello, I am Teja, an engineer on the iOS System Experience team,and in this session, you'll get to meet Focus filters.Focus was introduced in iOS 15, macOS Monterey and watchOS 8.It is a way for people to concentrate on what's importantby configuring system behavior for a period of time.Focus is enabled by simply going into Control Centerand selecting from either a system Focus or a custom Focus.During the time that a Focus is enabled,notification behavior can be customized.For example, during Work Focus, someone may wantto only allow notifications from their coworkersor only allow notifications for a select few appsthat are relevant to work.For each Focus, system behavior can be configuredand scheduled in Settings.iOS 16 and macOS Ventura enhance the Focus featurewith Focus filters.I'll start by introducing you to Focus filtersand how they behave.Then, I'll go over how to define a Focus filter in your app.After that, I'll cover what it means to act on a Focus filter.And finally, I'll cover how your app can provideadditional context back to the system.Focus filters are a way for someoneto customize app behavior based on the currently enabled Focus.There are some great examples of system appsthat have adopted Focus filters.The Calendar app allows peopleto filter which calendars should be visible by defaultwhen a Focus is enabled.This is what my calendar normally looks like.And as you can see, I have a mixof work and personal calendar events.I can configure a Focus filter for Calendar,during the Personal Focus, to only show my personal calendar.After setting up the Focus filter,this is what my calendar looks like.Calendar has indicated that this is filtered by Focusand provided a way to toggle the filtering.Now I won't be overwhelmed with my work calendarwhen trying to enjoy some personal time.The Mail app's inbox can be filteredto show only relevant mailboxes during a Focus.Mail notifications are also filteredto show only the relevant notifications prominently.This means that I can set up Mailto only deliver work-related Mail notificationsduring the Work Focus and preventpersonal mail notifications from interrupting me.There are many reasonswhy your app may want to implement Focus filters.Perhaps your app manages multiple accounts,and it's appropriate to associate a Focuswith a particular account.Apps with large amount of data may need to filter contentfor the Focus.If you would like to help your usersavoid getting distracted while focused,you can do this by reducing badge counts,in-app alerts, and notificationsto what is salient for the enabled Focus.Regarding appearance, your app may want to surface a themeor a layout based on the enabled Focus.Fundamentally, if your app can surface different contentbased on context, you may be able to employ Focus filtersto enhance user experience.Let me explain how Focus filters work.Your app defines what can be customized by a user per Focus,and this is done using an AppIntent.The system will expose what can be configured per Focus.UI to configure properties defined by your AppIntentwill be exposed in Focus settings as a Focus filter.Users can configure your app to behave a certain wayby navigating to Focus settings and configuring Focus filtersfor your app.Now, I'm going to go over how you can incorporateFocus filters into your codebase.There are a few parts to defining your Focus filter.The first is implementing SetFocusFilterIntent.This indicates to the system that your appis interested in having custom settings per Focus.The second step is defining your app's parameters.These will represent what can be configured within your appby the user.The final step is to set the display representation,so your Focus filter appears in system settingswith the correct content.This way, users are aware of what is configured.I'll dive into some code.The first thing you need to do is import AppIntentsand define a struct that implements SetFocusFilterIntent.This is your Focus filter.Setting the title and descriptionwill help users discover what your Focus is all about.Focus filters appear in a grid view in Settings.Before your Focus filter has been configured,it will be surfaced to the user with this look.The icon here is your app's icon,the primary text is your app's name,and the secondary text will match the title variablethat you set in your Focus filter.When the user taps in to configure your filter,the same content is displayed.This time, the system also includes the description stringthat you've provided, for additional context.Both the title and description strings are static,and they are read by the systemat the time that your app is installed.When defining your Focus filter, you'll have to specifywhat a person can customize by providing a seriesof properties that are decorated as parameters.When specifying a parameter, you must give it a nameand a data type.Parameters can be of a standard data typesuch as Bool, string, float, etcetera.If you have a custom data type that you would liketo have configured, you can make it an entity,which will allow you to decorate it as a parameter.To learn more about entities and App Intents,watch the "Dive into App Intents" session.When defining your Focus filter, you will only specifythe data type and name for each parameter.It is up to users to configure the value of the parameterthat would apply during each Focus.Parameters can be marked as optional,which means that they do not have to be configured.Parameters that are not optional should provide default values.In code, you specify a parameter --or an optional parameter -- by defining a variableof the type you want in your Focus filterand decorating it as a parameter.Here, I've created a required Bool parameter that representswhether my Focus filter should always use Dark Mode.I've set its default to false.I've also created an optional string parameterthat represents a user's status message during this Focus.Lastly, I've included an optional account parameterthat is an entity defined by my app;it contains information about a particular account.The title, which is set on all three of these parameters,is displayed in Settings to describe the parameterto the user.In Focus settings,once a user configures your app's Focus filter,it'll be presented in a similar gridto what I showed earlier.But this time, because the filterhas already been configured, the content is dynamicin order to reflect what has been configured.The icon here is still your app's icon.The primary text and the secondary textcan be customized using the display representation propertyon your FocusFilterIntent.The primary text should represent what parametershave been configured, such as Select Account,Set Status, etcetera.The secondary text should represent what the parametershave been configured to, such as Work Account or Working.In my code, I set the display representationto be generated dynamically.Since account and status are optional parameters,they only get included in the dynamic primaryand secondary texts if they are actually set.Since alwaysUseDarkMode is a required parameter,it is always included in the primary and secondary texts.OK, you have now defined your Focus filter,so users can go into Focus settingsand customize certain values for a particular Focus.But how can your app know what someone has customized?And how can your app update itself accordingly?It has to act on a change from the system.When a Focus change occurs and the system has determinedthat it's important for your app to know about this change,it will deliver this information to you in one of two ways.If the app is running, you will receive a callto the perform method in your FocusFilterIntent,if you've implemented it.If the app is not running, you can implement an extensionthat will get spun up.Again, if you've implemented performin your FocusFilterIntent, that will get calledin your extension.Since perform can get called on either your appor your extension, not every app needs an extension.Typically, if your app is only updating its own viewin response to a Focus transition,then implementing perform just in the app would suffice.If your app's widget, notifications or badgeswould need to change based on the Focus transition,then you may want to consider implementing an extension.Basically, if your app would wantto update anything outside its own views,you would need to implement the extension.For the rest of this session, I may refer to "your app"but that can mean either your app or your extensiondepending on this context.To respond to a Focus filter, implement the perform function,access the populated values for parametersprovided via Settings, and then use these valuesto update your app's views and behavior.Your implementation of perform is calledwhen the system determines that your appneeds to respond to a Focus transition.Perform is also called when the system determinesthat the previously delivered values are no longer relevant.In this case, your Focus filter parametersare configured with the default values.When perform is called on your app's Focus filter,the values of all the parameters will be filled outto match what was configured in Settings.The values of the named parameters can be readby calling self."name of the parameter."In this example, at the end of perform,I update my app with the data I received.Sometimes, you may need to querythe current Focus filter parameters.In my case,since my filter is called ExampleChatAppFocusFilter,I access ExampleChatAppFocus Filter.current.Now that your app is able to act on a Focus filter,the next step is to take the user experience furtherby providing additional context about how your app behaviorhas changed back to the system.By providing additional context, you can influenceyour app behavior outside your app's views.Examples of this include notifications filteringand setting your app's notification badge count.One way you can give the system informationis via the App Context object.This is an object that can be returnedas part of the result of the perform function.Or you can return the App Context at any timein your Focus filter and force the systemto get the updated value by calling invalidate.When a Focus filter is active, your app may haveadditional context to determine if a particular notificationshould not interrupt the user.To pass along this information, your app must setthe filterPredicate property in the AppContext.This filter predicate works in conjunctionwith a new string property called filterCriteriaon the UNNotification.If the filter criteria on the notification does not matchthe filter predicate, the notification is silenced.To set the filter predicate from your FocusFilterIntent,include it in your App Context.Say the device has the Personal Focus enabledand the user has set it up so that only the personal accountis selected;in this case, I set up the filter predicateto be the personal account's identifier.If the incoming notification is not from the personal account,it should not interrupt the user.Here, when I'm configuring this notification,I set the filterCriteria to be the work account's identifier.This is because I know this notificationis being sent to the work account,and I expect that this notification would be silencedbecause the account identifier does not match the predicatethat I had just set,which only matched with the personal account's identifier.This example is for a local notificationbut filter criteria can also be set on the JSON payloadof a remote notification.Another way to provide the system additional contextis by updating your app's badge count to reflectwhat is important during the currently-enabled Focus.This prevents distractions for your users.There is a new API in UserNotificationsfor this purpose.On UNUserNotificationCenter, you simply call setBadgeCountwith an unsigned integer that represents the new badge value.Now, you know how to provide additional contextto filter notifications or set the badge count.Remember, the goal of this feature is to surfacewhat is most relevant to a user when they are focused.Sometimes this requires minimizing unrelated contentto prevent distraction when a Focus is enabled.For next steps, I encourage you to start consideringwhat parts of your app would benefit from a Focus filter,determine which properties can be configured,set up your app and your extension to process this,and then take it a step furtherby assessing whether to provide additional context.That's it for Focus filters!Thank you for joining in on this sessionand have a great rest of WWDC.♪
