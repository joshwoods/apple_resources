Search this videoâ€¦Yann Ly-Gagnon: Hi. my name is Yann.I'm a core Bluetooth engineer.Today, I want to talk to you about timely alertsfor your Bluetooth devices on Apple Watch.First, we will review how to update a complicationwhile your watchOS App is in the background.Then, we will dive into how to listen for timely alerts on your watchOS App.We will also see new ways you can discover peripheralson watchOS 9.Finally, we will provide best practices and recommendationsto help you design your Bluetooth accessory.Let's jump into our first topic:how to update a complication in the background for your watchOS App.Last year, in watchOS 8, we introduced a wayto update complications with your Bluetooth accessoryduring Background app refresh.This is great for data that can be updated periodically,like in this example showing me the current air temperature.As a quick refresher, last year watchOS allows you to update your complicationand use Background app refresh, which runs periodically in the background.Whenever Background app refresh happens, it allows your app to reconnectto your Bluetooth peripheral,retrieves data, and then disconnects from your peripheral.For more details about this, watch the video called"Connect Bluetooth devices to Apple Watch."But what if a time-sensitive event happens on your Bluetooth peripheralthat the user wants to know about?In watchOS 9, we are introducing a way to listenfor alerts from your Bluetooth accessories in the background.Here's how it works.You will connect your device when your app is running,and start monitoring a characteristic.When your app stops running, Core Bluetooth maintains the connectionto your device on your behalf, and continueslistening for changes to your characteristic.When your device changes the value of that characteristic,your app will get runtime to process that event.You could post a local notification or send a network request, for example.This is intended to provide users with time-sensitive informationthey care about.Let's say I have a food thermometer.I can set a desired cook temperature to get alertedwhen I should remove my food from the oven.As the temperature approaches the desired temperature,the thermometer changes a characteristic's value,and the app posts a local notification that the food is almost ready.When the food is done, I receive the desired notification.And if the temperature keeps rising, I get one final notification.First, let's review how to configure the Background modes.Add Bluetooth-central to UIBackgroundModes in your Watch app's Info.plist.In Xcode it's called "Required background modes,"and you should add "App communicates using CoreBluetooth."Note that those Info.plist entries are the same as your app has for iOSif you want to use background execution as a central.You will need to edit your watchApp info.plist manuallyand not rely on the iOS "Signing capabilities."Let's look at the code.Assuming you're already connected, you found a GATT serviceand just discovered a GATT characteristic.You will get the didDiscoverCharacteristicFor callback.Inside the callback,you can decide to get notifications every time the value changes.This is the same API as in watchOS 8,with the difference that it will also work while your app is in the background.Then implement the delegate method to handle changesto the characteristic's value with didUpdateValueFor.Once the characteristic changes, you can post a local notification here,send a network request, or whatever makes sense for your app.This method will be called both in the foreground and in the background,so make sure you perform the correct action in both cases.Now, let's talk about some situations you need to consider.First, on the topic of Bluetooth reconnections.If your device goes out of range, the Bluetooth connectionwill disconnect after a timeout.If this happens, your app will briefly get background runtimeto call "connectPeripheral" in order to attempt reconnection.This is the same as what happens on iOS.As soon as the device is in range again, Core Bluetooth will reconnect to it.Now, let's talk about some limits.These limits are important to maintain optimal battery lifefor Apple Watch users.If your device is on the edge of Bluetooth rangeand repeatedly disconnects while in Background BLE connection,the reconnection range will be reduced.This means only devices close to the Apple Watch will reconnect.Those limits are counted on a rolling window of 24 hoursand are reset whenever the user interacts on your App.Another limitation is regarding the number of background runtime opportunitiesfor timely alerts.Only monitor characteristics that will changewhen something critical to the user happens.If you need to gather periodical data from your device,this should be done with Background app refresh.When your app is about to exceed the limit, the notificationLeGattNearBackgroundNotificationLimit will be posted.It is a good practice for your app to monitor that errorand realize that the user isn't interacting with the watchOS app.If this alert is important, it might be the right timeto find another way to communicate with your user,such as through a network requestor UI changes on your Bluetooth peripheral.After the limit is exceeded, the notification calledLeGattExceededBackgroundNotificationLimit will be posted.After this point, your app will no longer receive background runtimeand will revert back to watchOS 8 behavior,where there will be no background connectionand only background app refresh.You can retrieve those two notificationsin the error field of the GATT Notification Update.For background BLE connection,we recommend using the errorto know when the limit is reachedinstead of counting down.For watchOS 9, the background runtime limit is set to 5.Both of these limits are reset whenever the user interacts with your app.They also reset 24 hours after the limit was reachedin case there has been no user interaction with your app.Note: These limits only apply to Bluetooth Background LE connections.Background app refresh will continue to happen if your complicationis on the active watch face, regardless of these limits.The amount of time you get to process each event is very short.There may not be enough time to do extremely complex processing,but enough to alert the user something important is happening.Finally, listening for timely alerts in the backgroundrequires Apple Watch Series 6 or later.Listening for alerts isn't the only thing you can do in the background.In watchOS 9, you can discover peripherals while your app is in the background.Let's say I have a Bluetooth medical deviceand a watchOS app that detects any timely alerts from it.To conserve power, the peripheral doesn't advertiseuntil it detects a serious condition.Therefore, there's no connection between the device and Apple Watch yet.Here, the watchOS App will scan for a unique Service UUIDfrom the medical device.Now, when the medical device detects something is serious,it starts advertising.The Apple Watch discovers this peripheral and launches the app in the background.The app can then alert the user of the condition detected.Here's how it works:The Watch app will initiate a scan for peripherals,and Core Bluetooth will continue scanning in the background.Once the peripheral's advertisement is detected,the app is given background runtime and can initiate a connection.Let's dive into the code to make this happen.The API hasn't changed from watchOS 8,but the scan will be honored even the app is in the background.Call "scanForPeripherals"with the service UUID you want to watch for.You can do this while your app is in foreground, and it will continuewhile the app is in the background.Note that if you ask for the option "allowDuplicatesKey,"it will only be available when the app is in foreground.Now, let's talk about some limits.There is a limit on the number of times your app will be givenbackground runtime between app launches.This limit is combinedwith the background runtime we saw previouslywhen a GATT characteristic changes.Also, scanning for peripherals in the backgroundrequires Apple Watch Series 6 or later.In summary, we can now scan for a limited numberof Bluetooth service UUID while the watch is scanning in the background.Now let's talk about how to design your accessoryto make the most of these features.There is a power tradeoff you need to considerwhen designing your Bluetooth accessory.If power consumption is a concern, you should opt for a topologywhere your device can go into deep sleepand only advertise relevant informationwhen an alert happens.The tradeoff is, you will have extra latency with the Bluetooth discovery timeat every timely alerts, but you will be able to save more power.This is the topology provided in the example with the medical device.On the other hand,if you need low latencyfor your timely alerts,but the power is not so much a concern,you can consider usingBackground LE connectionand send your alertswith GATT indications.Note that there is a limit of two Bluetooth connections for each app.This is the topology we saw in the example for temperature sensor.In order for your users to have the best experience with timely alerts,consider adding as much processing and intelligence on your peripheralto filter the data that is time critical versus non-time critical.Coming back to our temperature example, instead of transmitting every temperature,you can send only the relevant events or when the temperature changes.The benefit of this approach is, if you properly separatethe time-critical events from periodic data,both your peripheral and the Apple Watch userwill save on power, thus an overall better experience.When your device disconnects, we recommend advertisingto re-establish the connection.The advertisement interval depends on the requirementof your Bluetooth peripheral,such as how fast it needs to reconnect, battery life, et cetera.In the accessory guidelines, we offer a few different values you can use.For example, if your device is battery constrained,you can use a value of 1022.5 milliseconds.Another example: if you advertise at a rate of 20 milliseconds,it should allow for a detection within a second in ideal conditions.You could design such that this high advertisement rate can be usedonly while a critical event happens.Now let's talk about connection interval.If you opt for a topology where your device remains connected in the background,we highly recommend using a long connection interval,such as at least 150 milliseconds.This will allow to save battery on your peripheraland provides best user experience on Apple Watch.Bluetooth 5.3 is coming to Apple Watch, along with connection sub-rating.This would allow to increase the connection intervalwhile the Bluetooth peripheral is idleand quickly change to smaller connection intervalwhen you need lower latency.Here is a table showing the differences between platforms.These are the currently supported configurations for Bluetooth Low Energy.Last year we introduced Background app refresh for watchOSas a new background execution mode.This year, if you own a Series 6 and above,we improved the background execution with timely alerts as we described today.Thanks for watching!

Yann Ly-Gagnon: Hi. my name is Yann.I'm a core Bluetooth engineer.Today, I want to talk to you about timely alertsfor your Bluetooth devices on Apple Watch.

First, we will review how to update a complicationwhile your watchOS App is in the background.

Then, we will dive into how to listen for timely alerts on your watchOS App.

We will also see new ways you can discover peripheralson watchOS 9.

Finally, we will provide best practices and recommendationsto help you design your Bluetooth accessory.

Let's jump into our first topic:how to update a complication in the background for your watchOS App.Last year, in watchOS 8, we introduced a wayto update complications with your Bluetooth accessoryduring Background app refresh.

Here's how it works.You will connect your device when your app is running,and start monitoring a characteristic.

When your app stops running, Core Bluetooth maintains the connectionto your device on your behalf, and continueslistening for changes to your characteristic.

When your device changes the value of that characteristic,your app will get runtime to process that event.You could post a local notification or send a network request, for example.This is intended to provide users with time-sensitive informationthey care about.

Let's say I have a food thermometer.I can set a desired cook temperature to get alertedwhen I should remove my food from the oven.As the temperature approaches the desired temperature,the thermometer changes a characteristic's value,and the app posts a local notification that the food is almost ready.

When the food is done, I receive the desired notification.

And if the temperature keeps rising, I get one final notification.

First, let's review how to configure the Background modes.

Add Bluetooth-central to UIBackgroundModes in your Watch app's Info.plist.

In Xcode it's called "Required background modes,"and you should add "App communicates using CoreBluetooth."Note that those Info.plist entries are the same as your app has for iOSif you want to use background execution as a central.

You will need to edit your watchApp info.plist manuallyand not rely on the iOS "Signing capabilities."Let's look at the code.Assuming you're already connected, you found a GATT serviceand just discovered a GATT characteristic.You will get the didDiscoverCharacteristicFor callback.

If this happens, your app will briefly get background runtimeto call "connectPeripheral" in order to attempt reconnection.This is the same as what happens on iOS.As soon as the device is in range again, Core Bluetooth will reconnect to it.

Now, let's talk about some limits.These limits are important to maintain optimal battery lifefor Apple Watch users.

If your device is on the edge of Bluetooth rangeand repeatedly disconnects while in Background BLE connection,the reconnection range will be reduced.This means only devices close to the Apple Watch will reconnect.

Those limits are counted on a rolling window of 24 hoursand are reset whenever the user interacts on your App.Another limitation is regarding the number of background runtime opportunitiesfor timely alerts.

Only monitor characteristics that will changewhen something critical to the user happens.If you need to gather periodical data from your device,this should be done with Background app refresh.

When your app is about to exceed the limit, the notificationLeGattNearBackgroundNotificationLimit will be posted.It is a good practice for your app to monitor that errorand realize that the user isn't interacting with the watchOS app.

If this alert is important, it might be the right timeto find another way to communicate with your user,such as through a network requestor UI changes on your Bluetooth peripheral.

After the limit is exceeded, the notification calledLeGattExceededBackgroundNotificationLimit will be posted.

After this point, your app will no longer receive background runtimeand will revert back to watchOS 8 behavior,where there will be no background connectionand only background app refresh.

You can retrieve those two notificationsin the error field of the GATT Notification Update.For background BLE connection,we recommend using the errorto know when the limit is reachedinstead of counting down.For watchOS 9, the background runtime limit is set to 5.Both of these limits are reset whenever the user interacts with your app.They also reset 24 hours after the limit was reachedin case there has been no user interaction with your app.Note: These limits only apply to Bluetooth Background LE connections.Background app refresh will continue to happen if your complicationis on the active watch face, regardless of these limits.

Let's say I have a Bluetooth medical deviceand a watchOS app that detects any timely alerts from it.To conserve power, the peripheral doesn't advertiseuntil it detects a serious condition.

Therefore, there's no connection between the device and Apple Watch yet.Here, the watchOS App will scan for a unique Service UUIDfrom the medical device.

Now, when the medical device detects something is serious,it starts advertising.The Apple Watch discovers this peripheral and launches the app in the background.

The app can then alert the user of the condition detected.

Here's how it works:The Watch app will initiate a scan for peripherals,and Core Bluetooth will continue scanning in the background.

Once the peripheral's advertisement is detected,the app is given background runtime and can initiate a connection.

Let's dive into the code to make this happen.The API hasn't changed from watchOS 8,but the scan will be honored even the app is in the background.

Call "scanForPeripherals"with the service UUID you want to watch for.You can do this while your app is in foreground, and it will continuewhile the app is in the background.Note that if you ask for the option "allowDuplicatesKey,"it will only be available when the app is in foreground.Now, let's talk about some limits.There is a limit on the number of times your app will be givenbackground runtime between app launches.This limit is combinedwith the background runtime we saw previouslywhen a GATT characteristic changes.Also, scanning for peripherals in the backgroundrequires Apple Watch Series 6 or later.

In summary, we can now scan for a limited numberof Bluetooth service UUID while the watch is scanning in the background.Now let's talk about how to design your accessoryto make the most of these features.

There is a power tradeoff you need to considerwhen designing your Bluetooth accessory.

If power consumption is a concern, you should opt for a topologywhere your device can go into deep sleepand only advertise relevant informationwhen an alert happens.The tradeoff is, you will have extra latency with the Bluetooth discovery timeat every timely alerts, but you will be able to save more power.

This is the topology provided in the example with the medical device.

On the other hand,if you need low latencyfor your timely alerts,but the power is not so much a concern,you can consider usingBackground LE connectionand send your alertswith GATT indications.Note that there is a limit of two Bluetooth connections for each app.

This is the topology we saw in the example for temperature sensor.

In order for your users to have the best experience with timely alerts,consider adding as much processing and intelligence on your peripheralto filter the data that is time critical versus non-time critical.

Coming back to our temperature example, instead of transmitting every temperature,you can send only the relevant events or when the temperature changes.The benefit of this approach is, if you properly separatethe time-critical events from periodic data,both your peripheral and the Apple Watch userwill save on power, thus an overall better experience.

Another example: if you advertise at a rate of 20 milliseconds,it should allow for a detection within a second in ideal conditions.

You could design such that this high advertisement rate can be usedonly while a critical event happens.
