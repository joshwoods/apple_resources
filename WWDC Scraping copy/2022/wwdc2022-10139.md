I'm Ryan, an engineer on the SharePlay team.Our team has had a lot of fun exploringall the incredible SharePlay experiences you've made.Your work has brought people together like never before,and we've also learned a lot over the past yearabout how you can give peoplethe best SharePlay experience possible.So today, we're going to take you through how to designand build a great SharePlay experience in your app.We'll talk about using SharePlay as a new way to connect people.Then we'll go over how to foster a sense of presence,breaking down the digital barriers between peopleand making them feel like they're togetherin the same space.We'll go over the different types of SharePlay experiencesyou can design in your app,and then finally, we'll tell you some tips and trickswe've learned along the wayfor how to make it a seamless experiencefor people using your app.More people than ever are relying on FaceTimeand iMessage in order to stay connected.With iMessage, we connect by sharing text or sharing images,and with FaceTime, we connect by sharing audio and video.However, some of the most meaningful momentspeople have together are about morethan just sharing a conversation.When we're together, we connect most by sharing experiences.So to foster that sense of closeness,we built SharePlay,and by adopting the Group Activities framework,you can connect people in this entirely new wayby allowing them to participate in SharePlay activitiesin your app.It all comes down to this concept of activities.When someone in a FaceTime call starts an activity,SharePlay brings the group directly into your app,where you can create almost any type of experience.And an activity can really be anything;from cooking together, to playing piano together.We've seen a lot of creative examples of activitiesfrom you already.And this year, we focused on elevatingthe core SharePlay experience, making it even easierfor people to share experiences in your app.Now, people can start SharePlay directly from your app.When someone finds that perfect piece of content in your appthat they want to share with their friends,they can choose who they want to experience that content withand invite them to SharePlay directly from your app.This way, people can jump into a shared experiencewith their friends whenever it feels most natural for them,without having to plan in advance.They'll even get the option to start SharePlay from Messages,letting them share an experience with their friendswithout needing to be on a FaceTime call.We think people are going to love all the new waysthey can start SharePlay from your app.We'll go over how to adopt all of these new featuresin the session "What's new in SharePlay."And that just scratches the surfaceof what SharePlay can dobut we think the real potential of SharePlay is unlockedwhen you unleash your creativity to build experiencesthat bring people closer together.And a big part of that is fostering a sense of presence.So before we go into how to build these experiences,we first have to understand what it meansto be present with others and how to take aspectsof a great in-person experienceand bring them into your apps.Typically, digital communication tools are designed to bridgethe gaps in presence, but in order for SharePlayto create meaningful moments between people,we need to find ways to actually make people feel presentwith each other, as if they were in the same physical space.Now, knowing how to foster this sense of presencecan be different for every experiencebut one trick we can do is to think about your appbeing used in the physical world.So, here's an exercise we recommend doing:think of SharePlay like a portal transporting peoplethrough their phones and into the same space.What would they do with your appif they were actually present with each other?If that sounds impossible, don't worry.We'll go over some ways that you can fosterthis sense of presence in your own apps.Let's do this exercise together.Imagine you're transported to a roomwith a physical record player.Everyone can go up to it and interact with it.They can put on their favorite songand once it's playing, anyone else in the roomcan also go up to the record player and interact with it.They can skip forward in the songor they can skip the song entirely.From this, we found that we neededto offer shared playback controls in our app.And in fact, it's critical that we don't put any limitationson who can interact with these controls.We want to create an engaging experiencewhere everyone feels like they're able to walk upand control that same music player.OK, now someone has started playing some music.The next thing they might do is look aroundand see who's there listening with them.Now this may seem obvious, but that person may be playingtheir favorite song for someone and probably wantsto be reminded of their friend there listening with them.When people are doing these experiencesthrough their phones, we need to find waysto offer reminders that there are others theredoing that experience with them.This exercise is a great way to start thinkingabout the design considerations that will helpto foster presence in almost any kind of experience.Now, I'm going to hand it over to Priya to talk throughsome things to keep in mind when designing your experience.Priya: Thank you, Ryan.When designing an experience for groups,the first thing to think about is what shared activitiesyour app will support.It might be challenging at first since many appshave been designed with a single person in mind.Apps have been personalized to build engaging experiencesfor individual peoplebut a great personalized experiencemight not always translate to a great group experience.Here is an opportunity for you to think of your appfrom a different perspective -- to think of an experiencedesigned specifically for groups.When designing your activity,think about what people like to do when they're together.From cooking together with your friends,to breathing through a yoga flow,watching your favorite team win the finalsor gasping at every "Severance" cliffhanger.All of these are good candidates for SharePlaybecause they're activities that people love to do together --in person!SharePlay provides the ability to createrich coordinated experiences for groups where everyonehas control and shares the same experience in sync,to help foster a sense of presencewhen people are apart.For example, when using SharePlay with Apple TV+,pressing play on a video enables everyoneto watch together.Everyone's playhead is in sync, and pause, play, seek commandsare all coordinated.So when Ryan pauses or Adam resumes,the video pauses and plays for everyone at the same time.Apple TV+ is a great exampleof a single-view coordinated experience,where everyone can watch and listen to the same thing.If you're building a coordinated media experiencelike this for your app, you can add shared playback controlsby adopting AVPlaybackCoordinatorand using the coordinateWithSession method.The system will keep everyone in perfect syncas if they were all in the same room sharing one remote.But sometimes, we share activitiesthat participants experience differently.Some participants might have different viewsof the same coordinated experience.For example, when playing a game of Heads Up!,one person has to guess the words on the screenwhile their friends shout out or act out clues.Now, it wouldn't be a very difficult gameif the guessers could see the answers…so there are two views in this game,and not all participants see the same view.If you're building a multiview coordinated experiencelike this, you can use the send methodof the GroupSessionMessenger class and specify the subsetsof the participants that should receive the message.So once you've decided on the activity you are designingand the views needed to support it,the next step is to build a great experience for the peopleinteracting with your app.Let's discuss some of the factorsthat can make your app's SharePlay experienceintuitive and easy to use.In order to build a great SharePlay experience,it is important to think through the different stagesof a shared activity -- starting, during, and ending.We've added the ability to start a SharePlay sessionwithout the need for an active FaceTime call.So people can start a SharePlay session directly from your appwhen they come across content or an activitythat they want to share with their friends.This helps bring everyone directly to the experienceyou've created in your app.When people browse your app and come across somethingthey want to share with their friends,they might tap the Share button to present the Share Sheet.In order to surface the ability to SharePlay here,you can register your app's group activity by usingthe registerGroupActivity(_:) method.People will see the option to SharePlay the activityfrom your app directly from the Share Sheet.In order to make group activities in your appeven more discoverable, you can support the abilityto SharePlay directly in your app's UIwith the SharePlay button.To do this, you can adopt the GroupActivitySharingContoller.This allows people to start a SharePlay session,select the friends they want to SharePlay with,and whether they want to SharePlay over messagesor FaceTime.I'm going to go ahead and SharePlay some musicwith Adam and Ryan.The system will display informationabout the group activity to them, including the title,an optional subtitle and image.It's important that this information is descriptiveso that Ryan and Adam know what to expectwhen they join the SharePlay session.So be sure to implement the metadata propertyfor your group activity with meaningful informationand return a GroupActivityMetadata instance.Also consider including a web-based URLfor participants who might not have your app installedon their device already.This will make it quick and easy for themto download your app and join their friends in the activity.It's important to rememberthat just because someone's on a Messages groupor FaceTime calldoesn't mean that they have joined the group activity.To find out who else is participatingin the SharePlay session,people can navigate to the details view.Looks like Ryan's listening with me,but Adam, who's on the FaceTime call,hasn't joined the SharePlay activity yet.When possible, you can also show similar informationin your app's UI.This is a great way to knoweveryone is on the same page as you.It also helps maintain a sense of presence with the group.If you were all in the same room,you would know how many peoplewere enjoying the activity with you just by looking around.Now we all have some friends who are always fashionably lateto a party; so, depending on your app's experience,you might want to consider supporting a lobbywhere people can wait for people to joinbefore beginning the experience.For example with Heads Up!, once everyone has joinedthe SharePlay session, you can tap Let's Play!to start the game.OK, so we've covered how to make startingand joining a SharePlay activity seamless.Now let's consider how to create an intuitive experienceduring an activity.As part of the ongoing activity, everyone will be interactingwith your app at the same time.We have built a relationship with our devicesthat changes occur as a resultof us directly touching something.But when you build a shared experienceacross different devices,it's possible that things would change on someone's screendue to someone else's interaction.So when things change during a SharePlay session,it is important to let everyone know why.For example, Ryan might pause the moviethe group is watching on his device.When Ryan pauses the video,it pauses for everyone else as well,without any interaction with their devices.The system already handles communicating changeslike these to the rest of the group with noticesbut, for some activities, people may benefitfrom in-app contextual informationabout what's going on during the activity as well.For example,when using SharePlay with the Flow app by Moleskin,multiple people might be drawing on the same page.When someone draws something, the app shows the initialsof who drew it, and this makes fora much more intuitive experience for the entire group.It also helps reinforce the feeling of presencewith the rest of the group.This is even more important now that you can SharePlayover Messages, where you may not have continuous feedbackfrom your friends over audio or video.All right, so we've started a SharePlay activitywith our friends.We've made sure everyone has joined.Now, the focus is on the activity itself.You might have a fully-immersive experience that supportsfull-screen viewing and might be hiding the status bar.For example, the Apple TV app hides the status barand other interface elementswhen people are watching a videobut…  it is important to remember that the pill in the status bargives people access to important controls.So, let people redisplay a hidden status barusing a simple, discoverable gesture to give them accessto these types of controls during the ongoing activity.In the Apple TV app, a single tap shows the status bar againand reveals important experience controls in the UI.It is also important to rememberthat the activity in your app's interfaceis only one part of the whole experience.Think about how the people using your appwill engage with the rest of the groupduring the SharePlay experience you've built.Whether they are on a FaceTime call or texting over Messages,people are multitaskingso there may be instances when someone navigates awayfrom your app while in a group activity.For cases like this, remember to support Picture in Picturefor coordinated media experiences.This will allow everyone to continue watchingwith their friends,maintaining a sense of presence with the rest of the group.Whether someone is responding to a messageor connecting with the group over FaceTime,the video doesn't have to pause every single time.Considerations like these when building group activitiesfor your app will help makethe end-to-end SharePlay experience seamless,breaking down the digital barriersto create meaningful moments where people feel presentwith each other.So make sure to register your group activityso people can start to SharePlay directly from your app;configure descriptive metadata so people know what to expectwhen they join the activity;have an experience for late joiners,and provide contextual informationabout why the UI might be changing;make sure controls are easy to access;and support Picture in Picture for media.We've talked about a lot today, so let's do a quick recap.Now, you can start a SharePlay session directly from your appwithout the need for an ongoing FaceTime call.This expands the opportunitiesfor building a variety of group activities.So we recommend that you do the portal exerciseto start thinking about how to design an experiencefor your app that helps people feellike they're in the same space together;reimagine your app's content and activitiesto create great experiences for groups;and use best practices when building your experienceto prevent digital barriers from getting in the way.We cannot wait to see the creative uses of SharePlaythat you all come up with.We hope you enjoyed the session.Adam and Priya: Thanks for watching!♪
