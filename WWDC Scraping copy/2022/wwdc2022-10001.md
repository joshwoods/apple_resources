improve navigationon your iOS apps.When apps have great navigation, it's often unnoticedbecause people are able to focus on the content and experience.Navigation involves teaching people abouthow things behave,where things belong,and how things work in your app.The goal of navigation is to provide enoughof a foundation of familiarity so that people can easilydiscover your content and interact with your app.When navigation deviates too far from our expectationsor doesn't match our natural understanding of the world,we often feel frustrated and sense that an appis hard to use.But getting navigation right requires focus and intention.And although the concepts I'm covering today are not new,they are fundamental,and they're essential to having a successful app on iOS.So whether you're new to the platform or looking for waysto improve your app experience, then this session is for you.Today, we're going to discuss tab bars,a common form of navigation on iOS.Then we'll discuss interactions for moving between screensby exploring hierarchical navigationand modal presentations.As you can see, we'll only be covering a subsetof the large topic area of navigation.But we'll start here because these core patternsrepresent a foundation which we often see misused,and understanding them can set you up for successas your app evolves or supports other devices.Let's get started with tab bars.Tab bars are a global navigation controlthat sit at the bottom of the screen,categorizing an app's content into different sections.Think of tabs as a control to reflectyour information hierarchy.The UI control itself should translatean already-clear grouping and establish relationshipbetween different areas of your app.So the Tab bar represents your top-level content,which should be the top of your app's hierarchy.Each tab communicates your app's menu of options,and these sections should be meaningful and descriptive.This likely sounds really straightforward,but in practice and for various reasons,it can be easy to lose sight of in your app.Let's look at some good examples.Without seeing any of the content of these apps,notice how the tabs hint at functionality.They tell a story about what the app can dojust by displaying concise labels.Listen Now and Radio indicate that this is a content-based appwith auditory media.For this app, Library and Albums hint at a content-rich appwith a For You tab that signals strong personalization.This app has tabs that are so focused that their functionalityis self-evident and tell me exactly what I can doin those content areas.What we see often is that the first tab of appstend to be loaded heaviest with features.Try to create balance in your interfaceby distributing functionality throughout your tabs.Let's go through this with an exampleto explore how tabs can oftentimes be misguidingor confusing.Imagine I have a fake app that lets people discovercurated routes in cities just like a local cyclist.And if you're traveling, moving to a new city,or just getting into the sport, then there's an easy wayto save routes and create itineraries.Here it is.Since this app is about finding routes to bike,the first thing you'll see is a map view with filters for rides.Then, there's a section with an upcoming itinerarythat I can interact with by editing the contentor inviting friends.And then there are routes grouped togetherin collection views.It can be tempting to add all your functionality into one tabjust like this, because it's available at a glance.Or maybe your app has evolved over timeand you've lost sight of grouping your functionalityinto sections on the tab bar.Well today, I invite you to reconsider this in your app.In this design, people may have to scroll a lotfor what they're looking for, and it takes effortto mentally parse unrelated, disparate features.Filtering a map view and editing an itineraryare two very different features -- and mindsets --when someone opens this app to use it.Be cautious of combining your app's functionality in this wayor doing it out of fear that people won't interactwith the rest of your app.It's much easier to understand an app's functionalitywhen it's well organized and clearly communicated.One way to do this is to take a step back and ask yourself,Why do people use your app?Remember, great apps have focused solutions.They aim to do a few things really well,opposed to trying to solve everything in one app.Let's reconsider the tab bar on this cycling app.People use this app to find routesin the places they care about, that are right for their level.This is one of the most important views in the app,as it represents the content that people care about the most.So let's take a step back and reassess the tab barto understand how a route may be usedand how that content can be represented in the appin a way that feels more balanced.This is a route detail.Someone would expect to see an overview,like distance and elevation gain,as well as access to the map and road surfacesthroughout the route, like sidewalks or roads.Seeing specific callouts for steep climbs or descentscould help me understand if this route is right for my level.And finally, food stops along the routeare great for planning.OK. So, how do people make sense of this core functionalityof viewing routes?Well, a route is only helpful if you know where it is located.Routes should likely have a relationshipwith the city they're associated with.That may lead me to have a city overviewthat tells me helpful information about cycling there.And if you scroll down the view,you'd have that list of all the routes you can ride.But this app also supports routes in different cities,which means each city should go back to a list of all places.Places can become the top level of the hierarchywhen navigating to routes.As you can see, there's a lot of content in this workflow alone,and it's really key to the value that this app provides.This is great justification for a tab-bar item.Notice now how it's self-contained.It wouldn't make sense to put anything in this tabthat isn't about a place.Part of designing great tab bars is organizing your content.Look for these natural ways to address relationships.I can go through this exercise with other key featuresin the app, like itineraries, and I can ask myself,What is an itinerary?How will people use it?And where can I dedicate a place for them in my app?Even if people are unfamiliar with the content of your app,and perhaps especially if they are,it's best to communicate your functionalityand content clearly,assess where it belongs in your hierarchy,and how people engage with it.Then, this app can improve from having all of the featurescrammed into the first tab, to a much clearerand straightforward form of navigation.Now, the core functionality is more balanced on the tab barbecause these sections hold up on their own.They are related,yet distinctly different content areas and workflows.This makes navigation so much more intuitive.Next, I want to discuss a slightly related topic,but we see it expressed differently.Avoid duplicating your functionalityand consolidating it into a single tab.In content-rich apps like this one,a tab titled Home, may seem like an attractive catchallto showcase functionality throughout an appin a single place.For example, maybe it seems like people aren't engagingwith the Itineraries feature, and you may be worriedit's because they don't know the functionality exists.So it may seem logical to encourage engagementby repeating actions in the tab bar for more visibility,such as New Itinerary on the Places cardsand maybe creating a version of an itinerary viewthat has the features front and center,such as inviting friends;or listing the stops with an easy action to add.It might be tempting to do this out of fearthat some functionality won't be discovered throughout your app.And to clarify, this isn't about duplicating content.In many scenarios, it can make senseto have similar types of content, like songs or photos,exist on many tabs, but organized in a different way.But when it's your app's functionality,which are the actions people can take to achieve things,the redundancy creates confusion.And in practice, Home tabs disrupt an app's hierarchy.If functionality from different tabs or areas throughout an appare duplicated and added to a single screenwithout sufficient context,it creates redundancy and confusion.Home becomes the tab where every featureis fighting for real estate, because the tabis trying to solve a problem of discoverability.But in reality, it creates a dissociationbetween understanding content and how to act on it.If this is your app,consider removing the Home tab altogether.The redundancy of features prohibits peoplefrom understanding where things belong and why.Another concern about Home tabsis that the repeated functionalitymay cause someone to tab-jump because the action existsin another tab too.Transporting someone to another tab by tapping on an elementwithin a view is jarring and disorienting.Never force someone to change tabs automatically.Next, one of the biggest selling points of a tabbed navigationis access to multiple top-level hierarchies,so avoid hiding or removing the tab barthroughout your navigation.Persistent access to the tab bar gives someone the abilityto toggle between different levelsof your information hierarchywhile maintaining context in each.For example, I can look at a new route I'm considering ridingin the Places taband compare it to an itinerary I'm buildingin the Itinerary tabwith routes I've already savedthat are two levels deep into my hierarchy.This only works well if tabs have defined purposeand represent specific categories of content.Finally, all of the work you investin a solid information architectureshould be honored with clear and concise labels.Let's look at an Apple Design winnerfrom the Interaction category this year.This is the Slopes app.I think it's so great that when you launch the app,you land on the middle tab, which is your Logbookwith your season stats.The other tabs are specific.They're easy to understand, and I have an immediate senseof what the app does and how to use it.At a glance, this is because the labels are representativeof the content.Record a ski day, browse resorts,compare stats with friends; they all representcore functionality with a succinct label.Tab bars are a powerful control for navigation.Let's recap everything we've learned.Use tabs to reflect your information hierarchy.Organize your features in a way that balances themacross your tabs.Avoid duplicating features and merging them into a single tab.Always keep the tab bar persistent throughout your app.Finally, use clear and concise labels for each tab.All right, let's dive into interactions.When it comes to navigating between screens of an app,there are two very common forms of transition:you can navigate through an app's hierarchywith a term we sometimes refer to as a "push,"such as pushing into more detail.Or, you can transition with a modal presentation.These are nonintrusive and familiar waysto traverse an app's hierarchy and transition between views.Let me show you both.When you transition through hierarchical navigation,a view pushes, which means a personhas tapped on an element and the next screenslides into view from right to left.A push transition is an expected defaultwhen drilling further into an app's hierarchy.Pushing is great because it directly reflectsyour information hierarchy.It's a literal representation of moving through contentfrom a high level and drilling into more detail.On the other hand, a modal is reservedfor a self-contained task in an interface.Modals work great for workflows that are independent,meaning someone has enough information in that viewto make decisions and complete a task.Modals are unique because they create focusby separating people from the information hierarchy.For example, creating a new itineraryis presented in a modal view.Someone can make selections or input data such as a title,a city, a range of dates, and even invite friends.This is suitable for a modal because the UI is intendedto be edited and completed before dismissing the viewor navigating around the rest of the app.Since it's all user input, the rest of the app isn't neededas a reference to complete the fields.Now that you're familiar with these interactions,let's dive deep on both.Starting with hierarchical navigation.Here are a couple of guidelines to consider.Use a push transition to navigate betweendifferent levels of your app's hierarchy.Hierarchical navigation reinforces the relationshipbetween top-level and secondary content.The top-level content is higher in the hierarchy.As I want more detail, I access the supplemental viewsby drilling into the hierarchy.As I make selections, I narrow my optionsand eliminate access to the rest of the hierarchy.This is how it should be.Content should become increasingly more specificand there should be fewer options as I push inand drill into detail.When using a push transition,it's really important that the tab barremains persistently anchored to the bottom of the screen.As we talked about before,this is one of the biggest selling pointsof a tabbed navigation.It's consistent.It gives access to core areas of your appbecause it's always available.This means people can explore contentat different hierarchies.As views push in, it feels naturalto swipe left to right to go back to where you came fromwithout losing access to hierarchiesin other tabs where your state should be preserved.Next, it's important to use the navigation barat the top of the screen with appropriate labelsto orient people in your hierarchy.Let me show you.As I drill into contentand move through my information hierarchy,notice how the back button in the navigation bar changesto reflect the title of the screen I just came from.This is helpful as I navigate further into an appby scrolling screens and drilling in,so I never have to remember where I came fromor how to get back there, because the back buttoncan indicate the level up in the hierarchy.The other place to use hierarchical navigationis in all instances when a disclosure indicator is used.A disclosure indicator,which is also referred to as a chevron,points in the direction you're expected to transition to.When a chevron initiates a different transition,there's a disconnect between what the UI representsand the interaction that follows.The concept of pushing maps to our mental model of progression.In western cultures, we read left to right,and that direction indicates progress.But in right to left languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew,the mental model of progress is flowing in the other direction.If your app supports right to left languages,then the transition of pushing is flippedto create an association with the flow of content.The last consideration for when to use hierarchical navigationis about the context of the workflow,such as when someone is navigating frequentlybetween content.If you're presenting a workflow that you expect peopleto interact with frequently by toggling between views often,app switching during the workflow,or spending significant time in the view, then use a push.A familiar example is the Messages app.Even though the hierarchy is relatively flat,I can easily move in and out of the messageswith a push transition.If each message wasn't a push, but instead a modal,it would be difficult to seamlessly movebetween different chats.Messaging should feel fluid, but dismissing a modalwhen it's not relevant makes people have to think aboutleaving the screen, and that feels overcomplicated.Pushing allows frictionless transitionbetween core areas of an app.That is an overview of hierarchical navigation.Let's review.Primarily, push transitions are used to traversean app's hierarchy.Always keep the tab bar persistently anchoredto the bottom of the screen.Use the navigation bar of each screen to reflecta clear title and back label to orient people in your hierarchy.Use a push when a disclosure indicator is present.And when workflows require navigating frequentlybetween content.Hierarchical navigation is a very commonand a relatively simple interaction,so this transition is likely to be used frequently in your app.However, modal presentations are more about a context shift.It's about isolating someone into a focused workflowor self-contained task.When using modals on iOS,always present them from the bottom of the screen.A modal interrupts information hierarchy.It comes from the bottom of the screen to cover your tab bar.This prevents people from drilling further into your app.And it's an intentional disruption because the purposeis to reinforce focus.So now you may be wondering, what is a self-contained task?Let's talk about three broad examples.You can use modal presentations for a simple task,a multi-step task, or for full-screen content.I'll share an example of each.First, use modality for a workflowthat requires accomplishing a simple task,such as creating an event or setting a reminder.Creating a reminder requiresI edit and modify the entry fields.Locking in focus while doing this helps someoneachieve this task without distraction.It also minimizes the possibility of accidentallyabandoning the flow by tapping on another element or tab.Second, use modality for a workflow that accommodatesa complicated task.This is potentially multiple stepssuch as adding a transit card to the wallet.It may seem counterintuitive to use a modalfor a complicated task, but remember,the purpose is to reinforce focus by hiding the tab barand preventing people from moving around the appbefore the task is complete or canceled.And third, use a modal when viewing an article, video,or full-screen content that requires minimaladditional navigation.When in the Fitness app starting a workout,which is presented as a video,is a great scenario for a modal presentation.In the hierarchical section, we talked about the importanceof the navigation bar to orient people.It's equally important with modal presentations.When looking at the anatomy of a modal,think about the navigation bar as a guide for wayfinding.The use of labels and actions can make people feel confidentabout where they are and what actions they can taketo go other places.A title helps orient people to the content of the screen,such as "New Itinerary."The right label is intended to be the preferred action,so it's often seen in a bolder font to emphasize importance.The label itself is a concise, affirmative verbthat tells me exactly what to expect when tapped.The preferred action dismisses the modaland the previous state of the app should be preserved.If there is not yet input or interaction on the modal,then having the preferred action be inactiveis a good way to clarify that fields are requiredin order to save or continue.If you have a preferred action, then using the left actionto dismiss the modal with "Cancel"clearly indicates that I'm abandoning the workflow.If I've entered any information before tapping Cancel,this is a good time to display an alert, or an action sheetas you see here.Letting someone know that they will lose the dataif continuing to cancel.But if I haven't interacted with the UI,tapping Cancel should simply dismiss the modal.Use close symbols sparingly and only when modal presentationsrequire minimal interaction and no text input.Sometimes, you'll see an "X" in a modalas the primary way to dismiss, such as this articlefrom the Today tab in the App Store.The close symbol works here because there is no user input,so the subtle dismiss actionhelps someone focus on the content.Here's an example of how the close symbol can be problematicin a modal that requires input and interaction.After I select a filter, if I tap close,will the selections be applied or canceled?Without a clearly labeled action, people will wonder,"What happens if I tap close?"So keep in mind that using labels in the navigation baris usually preferred, as it's more affirmingand the actions are more explicit.Lastly, we try to limit modals over modalsbecause it can feel jarring and overcomplicated.It's worth calling out, that a modal view itselfcan support subviews and transitions when relevant.I mentioned earlier that this is an edit view,meaning that the text fields and table cells have selectionsand input which are intendedto be interacted with and not just viewed.For example, I can tap on a table cellof one of my friends I've added to the itinerary.You expect this to push because it has a chevron, remember?When I push in, this view may show information about Kateand give me the option to remove her from the itinerary.But the labels "Add People" and "Upload Photo" are intint color, which indicates that these actions are tappable.In each of these scenarios,they're workflows within workflows.I started by adding an itinerary,now I'm adding a photo to the itinerary.Uploading a photo is a workflow that includesquite a bit of interaction,like scrolling through my camera roll and selecting a new photo.I would also define this as a self-contained task.Once a photo is chosen, that modal is dismissedand I'm back to the first modal of the new itinerary.Try to limit multiple modality stacks,but sometimes they're requiredto drive consistency and focus in subviews.That is an overview of modal presentation on iOS.Modals should present from the bottom of the screen.They can be used for three types of tasks:simple, multi-step, or full-screen.Use the preferred and cancel actions in the navigation bar.Use the close symbol for content with minimal interaction.And limit modals over modals.I hope this deep dive was helpful for you.When designing navigation for your iOS apps,think about how content is organized,how people interact with your functionality,and how best to represent it in relation to your hierarchy.This way, people can easily access and interactwith all of your app's amazing features.Thanks for

and drilling in,so I never have to remember where I came fromor how to get back there, because the back buttoncan indicate the level up in the hierarchy.The other place to use hierarchical navigationis in all instances when a disclosure indicator is used.A disclosure indicator,which is also referred to as a chevron,points in the direction you're expected to transition to.When a chevron initiates a different transition,there's a disconnect between what the UI representsand the interaction that follows.The concept of pushing maps to our mental model of progression.In western cultures, we read left to right,and that direction indicates progress.But in right to left languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew,the mental model of progress is flowing in the other direction.If your app supports right to left languages,then the transition of pushing is flippedto create an association with the flow of content.The last consideration for when to use hierarchical navigationis about the context of the workflow,such as when someone is navigating frequentlybetween content.If you're presenting a workflow that you expect peopleto interact with frequently by toggling between views often,app switching during the workflow,or spending significant time in the view, then use a push.A familiar example is the Messages app.Even though the hierarchy is relatively flat,I can easily move in and out of the messageswith a push transition.If each message wasn't a push, but instead a modal,it would be difficult to seamlessly movebetween different chats.Messaging should feel fluid, but dismissing a modalwhen it's not relevant makes people have to think aboutleaving the screen, and that feels overcomplicated.Pushing allows frictionless transitionbetween core areas of an app.That is an overview of hierarchical navigation.Let's review.Primarily, push transitions are used to traversean app's hierarchy.Always keep the tab bar persistently anchoredto the bottom of the screen.Use the navigation bar of each screen to reflecta clear title and back label to orient people in your hierarchy.Use a push when a disclosure indicator is present.And when workflows require navigating frequentlybetween content.Hierarchical navigation is a very commonand a relatively simple interaction,so this transition is likely to be used frequently in your app.However, modal presentations are more about a context shift.It's about isolating someone into a focused workflowor self-contained task.When using modals on iOS,always present them from the bottom of the screen.A modal interrupts information hierarchy.It comes from the bottom of the screen to cover your tab bar.This prevents people from drilling further into your app.And it's an intentional disruption because the purposeis to reinforce focus.So now you may be wondering, what is a self-contained task?Let's talk about three broad examples.You can use modal presentations for a simple task,a multi-step task, or for full-screen content.I'll share an example of each.First, use modality for a workflowthat requires accomplishing a simple task,such as creating an event or setting a reminder.Creating a reminder requiresI edit and modify the entry fields.Locking in focus while doing this helps someoneachieve this task without distraction.It also minimizes the possibility of accidentallyabandoning the flow by tapping on another element or tab.Second, use modality for a workflow that accommodatesa complicated task.This is potentially multiple stepssuch as adding a transit card to the wallet.It may seem counterintuitive to use a modalfor a complicated task, but remember,the purpose is to reinforce focus by hiding the tab barand preventing people from moving around the appbefore the task is complete or canceled.And third, use a modal when viewing an article, video,or full-screen content that requires minimaladditional navigation.When in the Fitness app starting a workout,which is presented as a video,is a great scenario for a modal presentation.In the hierarchical section, we talked about the importanceof the navigation bar to orient people.It's equally important with modal presentations.When looking at the anatomy of a modal,think about the navigation bar as a guide for wayfinding.The use of labels and actions can make people feel confidentabout where they are and what actions they can taketo go other places.A title helps orient people to the content of the screen,such as "New Itinerary."The right label is intended to be the preferred action,so it's often seen in a bolder font to emphasize importance.The label itself is a concise, affirmative verbthat tells me exactly what to expect when tapped.The preferred action dismisses the modaland the previous state of the app should be preserved.If there is not yet input or interaction on the modal,then having the preferred action be inactiveis a good way to clarify that fields are requiredin order to save or continue.If you have a preferred action, then using the left actionto dismiss the modal with "Cancel"clearly indicates that I'm abandoning the workflow.If I've entered any information before tapping Cancel,this is a good time to display an alert, or an action sheetas you see here.Letting someone know that they will lose the dataif continuing to cancel.But if I haven't interacted with the UI,tapping Cancel should simply dismiss the modal.Use close symbols sparingly and only when modal presentationsrequire minimal interaction and no text input.Sometimes, you'll see an "X" in a modalas the primary way to dismiss, such as this articlefrom the Today tab in the App Store.The close symbol works here because there is no user input,so the subtle dismiss actionhelps someone focus on the content.Here's an example of how the close symbol can be problematicin a modal that requires input and interaction.After I select a filter, if I tap close,will the selections be applied or canceled?Without a clearly labeled action, people will wonder,"What happens if I tap close?"So keep in mind that using labels in the navigation baris usually preferred, as it's more affirmingand the actions are more explicit.Lastly, we try to limit modals over modalsbecause it can feel jarring and overcomplicated.It's worth calling out, that a modal view itselfcan support subviews and transitions when relevant.I mentioned earlier that this is an edit view,meaning that the text fields and table cells have selectionsand input which are intendedto be interacted with and not just viewed.For example, I can tap on a table cellof one of my friends I've added to the itinerary.You expect this to push because it has a chevron, remember?When I push in, this view may show information about Kateand give me the option to remove her from the itinerary.But the labels "Add People" and "Upload Photo" are intint color, which indicates that these actions are tappable.In each of these scenarios,they're workflows within workflows.I started by adding an itinerary,now I'm adding a photo to the itinerary.Uploading a photo is a workflow that includesquite a bit of interaction,like scrolling through my camera roll and selecting a new photo.I would also define this as a self-contained task.Once a photo is chosen, that modal is dismissedand I'm back to the first modal of the new itinerary.Try to limit multiple modality stacks,but sometimes they're requiredto drive consistency and focus in subviews.That is an overview of modal presentation on iOS.Modals should present from the bottom of the screen.They can be used for three types of tasks:simple, multi-step, or full-screen.Use the preferred and cancel actions in the navigation bar.Use the close symbol for content with minimal interaction.And limit modals over modals.I hope this deep dive was helpful for you.When designing navigation for your iOS apps,think about how content is organized,how people interact with your functionality,and how best to represent it in relation to your hierarchy.This way, people can easily access and interactwith all of your app's amazing features.Thanks for listening.♪
