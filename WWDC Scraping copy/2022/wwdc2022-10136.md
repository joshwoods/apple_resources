Injera, 850. Crêpes, 802.Jian Ping, 753. Dosa, 654. American, 618.Dominik: And of course, the chart supportsthe Audio Graphs feature Apple presented in 2021,including the sonifications.VoiceOver: Describe chart. Chart Details.Play Audio Graph.Complete.Dominik: We just used Swift Charts to addan informative and accessible chart to the food truck app.The chart shows how many pancakesthe truck sold of each style.Besides the summaries for each style of pancake,the food truck also has per-day sales data.The truck can park in Cupertino and San Francisco.We want to help the food truck know where to parkon different days of the week.To answer this question, let's visualize the dataas a time series for our two cities.To see how easy it is to explore different designs,we will make three iterations of the chart.We will start by making a bar graph for Cupertino.Then, we will add the data for San Francisco and add a picker.And finally, we will combine the datainto one multiseries line chart.Let's start with the bar chart showing the average numberof pancakes sold per day of the week.The sales data has the weekday stored as a dateand how many pancakes the truck sold as an integer.The data for Cupertino is in a variable, cupertinoData.As before, we start making a chart with a BarMark.We set the x-position of the barto be derived from the day of the date......and the height to be derived from the sales.And this gives us a first iteration of a chartthat shows the sales data per day of the week for Cupertino.For the second iteration, let's add the data for San Francisco.Using this chart, we want to help the pancake truckdecide where to park during the week.The sales data for San Francisco is in the sfData variable.We want to toggle between the two citiesand see the bar chart for each city.We start with adding a state variable, city.And then we add a SwiftUI picker for the city to the View.To toggle between the sales summaries for the two citiesvia the city variable,we add a switch statement for the data variable.And all we have to do now is to replace the data for Cupertinowith the one that toggles between the two --Cupertino and San Francisco.If I switch the toggle, the charts togglesbetween the two cities.Swift Charts works with SwiftUI animations,so if we specify that the transition should be animatedwith easeInOut,the bars animate as I toggle between the two citiesand also only shows one location at a time.This gives our app the right look and feel.As our final iteration, we will show both seriesin a line chart.To make this line chart, we start with the bar chartfrom Cupertino from before.The data for Cupertino and San Franciscois in an array of series.Series structs have the city and sales data.Before we show both series,let's focus on the Cupertino data.In the chart, we can loop over the series data.Remember, the chart initializeracts just like a ForEach.Then we can replace the specific data for Cupertinowith the sales data from the series.To distinguish the data for the two cities,I want the color of the bars to be derived from the city.For this, we set the foregroundStyleto be derived from the city in the series.To show what city a color represents,Swift Charts creates a legend below the chart.Now, I add the data for the second location.As you can see in the preview, Swift Chartsautomatically chooses a color for San Francisco,and it shows the bars for both cities in the chart.Charts show data for a particular contextand a visualization may need to changeas our data or questions change.Swift Charts makes it easy to quickly change your chartto explore different designs.The stacked bar chart is greatfor showing the total average sales per day;but what if I wanted to do a comparisonbetween the two cities?Maybe a point or line chart would be better.We change the mark type from a BarMark to a PointMarkto display the pancakes sold as points,or to a LineMark to show the data as a line chart.A line chart is a good fit for the sales datasince it lets us compare the two cities in each day of the week.Charts can combine multiple marks.For example, I can add a PointMark.To make the series differentiable without color,we set the symbol to be derived from the city.Now each point indicates the city by its color and symbol.Because it is common to show points on a line,Swift Charts has a shorthand for thiswhere we apply the symbol modifier to the LineMark.The style of the points adapts to the line.This chart is great.We can easily compare the sales trends throughout the week.We observe that the sales are especially highin San Francisco on Sundays.Swift Charts made it very easy for usto iterate through many designs in just a few minutes.So to wrap up, let's look at how Swift Charts makes it easyto iterate quickly and at the same time be flexible enoughto seamlessly integrate charts into your app's unique style.In Swift Charts, you build chartsby composition of marks with mark properties.In the Pancake app, we composed chartswith three different marks and four mark properties.For example, we made a simple bar chartas a bar mark with x and y properties.We also changed the mark to quickly explore designs,like charts with points,or line charts where we used the line markwith x and y properties.We also saw that we can add properties,like Foreground Style, to show multiple series in a line chart.And a chart doesn't have to have just one mark.We combined points and lines,and showed the same value with two mark properties.Swift Charts supports even more marks and mark propertiesthan we used today.It's also extensible and you can add custom marks.Marks and mark properties is what allows Swift Chartsto express a wide range of chart designswith a small number of declarative building blocks.There are many ways in which you can combinethese building block to create great data visualizationsfor your apps.Together with what you can already do in SwiftUI,the possibilities are truly endless.And as I've showed you today, you get support for Dark Mode,different device screen sizes, Dynamic Type, VoiceOver,and Audio Graphs for free.In addition, Swift Charts supports High-Contrast mode.And finally, Swift Charts works across localesand is multiplatform.The chart with the same codeworks across all Apple platforms.And the same customizations work everywhereso you can tailor the chart to each platform.Today, I showed you how Swift Chartsuses SwiftUI's powerful compositional syntaxso you can make more charts with less code.Swift Charts also providesa rich set of customization options,so you can style the chart to match your application.And now that you know how to chart new territoryand make a chart, you can learn how to customize it in the docsand in our follow-up talk where you'll raise the bar.♪

If ForEach is the only content in the chart,we can also put the data directlyinto the chart initializer.

We can now add the remaining three entriesfor the jian bing, dosa, and american pancakes.
