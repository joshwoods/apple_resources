Meet the new Photos picker

Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop music ♪♪Hello! I'm Justin,and I'm an engineer on the Photos team.Today, I would like to talk about some of the improvementswe have made to the system Photos picker.The system Photos picker is the best way for most appsto access photos and videos on iOS.The picker runs out of process, so your app doesn't needto request any library access to use it.It has an intuitive UI and an easy-to-use API.If you aren't familiar with the PHPicker API,you can watch our previous years' WWDC sessionswhere we talked about it in depth.In today's session, I'll start with an overviewof the new features we added to the picker.Then, I will talk about additional platformsand frameworks the picker now supports.All right, let's dive in.The picker supports filtering between images, videos,and Live Photos since its introduction.However, we understand that some of your appsmay have some other requirements.For example, a screenshot-stitching appwants to only show screenshots in the picker.Now it is possible with the new screenshots filterwe added this year.In addition to screenshots, we added other asset typeslike screen recordings and slo-mo videos.There is also a way for you to create a new filterusing PHAsset.PlaybackStyle.Other than Cinematic videos, depth effect photos, and bursts,all of the new filters are backported.If your app is targeting iOS 15,you can still use them as long as you are compilingwith the iOS 16 SDK.For compound filters, in addition to the existing "any,"now you also use "all" and "not."They are also backported to iOS 15.Let's look at some code examples.To show videos and Live Photos, you can combine them with "any."Or you may only want to show screenshots.To show all images without screenshots,you can combine images and screenshots filtersusing "all" and "not."And the last example, you can use .cinematicVideos filterif you are targeting iOS 16.Next, let's talk about improvementsrelated to the half-height picker.In iOS 15, UIKit has a new UISheetPresentationControllerAPI which you can use to present the picker in half-height mode.It already works great in many cases.But some of you may want to implement a custom UIto adjust selected assets and have those changesbe reflected back in picker.In iOS 16, you can deselect assetsusing their asset identifiers.As shown here, the second photo is no longer selectedin the picker after deselectAssets is called.You can also call the moveAsset method to reorder assets.Now we are familiar with all of the new picker features,let's talk about platform support.Currently, the system Photos picker can only be usedby iOS and iPadOS apps.This year, we are bringing the Photos pickerto two additional platforms: macOS and watchOS.The iPadOS picker is also updated with a new designjust for the iPad.Let's take a look at the new iPad UI first.The picker now shows a sidebarto take advantage of the larger iPad display.The sidebar allows faster navigationbetween different collections.But if there is not enough space,like in Split Screen mode,we will fall back to the existing compact picker UI.Next, macOS.The macOS picker also has a sidebar with Mac-style controls.And just like the iOS picker, it supports multiple selection,fluid zooming in the grid, and has a powerful search featurewhich allows you to search for things like people, places,and a lot more.The new picker UI is also available in NSOpenPanel.You can use it to select assets from the system photo library,and for the first time,including those assets stored in iCloud Photos.Your app will get the new UI for freewithout needing to do any adoption work.Drag and drop is supported in the NSOpenPanel picker.It's also supported in the standard picker on iOS,iPadOS, and macOS.If your app only needs to select a few images or videos,the NSOpenPanel API may be all you need.But keep in mind that selected files in the photo librarymay be deleted by the system at any time.You should copy them to a location managed by your appif you need to ensure their availability in the long term.For media-centric macOS apps, we encourage you to defaultto the new Photos picker for the best user experience.However, your app should still provide an alternative wayto select assets from the file systemusing the NSOpenPanel API.Sometimes your customers may still want to select assetsoutside their photo libraries.Last but not least, let's talk about watchOS.For the first time, you can have access to imagesstored on the watch using a new API.The watchOS picker also runs out of process,like the iOS and the macOS picker,so you don't need to request any library access to use it.It has a UI similar to the iOS pickerbut optimized for the smaller screen.You can browse your photos in the grid or by collections.You can configure the picker to show the selection order,as well as specifying a selection limit.However, unlike iOS and macOS,only images will be displayed in the watchOS picker.If the device has more than 500 images,only the most recent 500 will be shown.You may be wondering,"PHPickerViewController is UIKit based.How can I use it for my macOS or watchOS app?"As you may have guessed,new picker APIs are now available in AppKit and SwiftUI.Let's take a look at the AppKit API first.Actually, it is very similar to the UIKit API.You have access to the same PHPickerConfiguration typeand its properties.There is only a small difference:PHPickerViewController is a NSViewController subclassfor AppKit apps.With the introduction of the AppKit-based PHPicker,it's time to move away from the legacy media library browser.PHPicker is a lot more powerful.It's also easier to maintain if you are working on bothUIKit and AppKit apps at the same time.Finally, it's time to talk about the SwiftUI API.Remember the iOS picker you saw at the beginning of the session?It can be presented with only a few lines of SwiftUI code.More importantly, you have accessto the SwiftUI PhotosPicker APIon all picker-supported platforms:iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS.The picker will automatically choose the best layoutdepending on the platform, your app's configuration,and available screen space.You don't need to worry about what the picker UI should be,so you just can focus on making your app better.Before we look at the new API in detail via a demo,we should talk about how to loadselected photos and videos first.The selection you receive through the SwiftUI bindingonly contains placeholder objects.You still need to load actual asset data on demand.Keep in mind that some asset datawon't be loaded immediately.The load operation could also failif an error was encountered,for example, when the picker was trying to download datafrom iCloud Photos but the device was not connectedto the internet.Some large files like videos may take a long time to download,so we recommend you to show a per-item inline loading UIinstead of a blocking loading indicator.The PhotosPicker uses Transferable,which is a new SwiftUI protocol for transferring databetween apps and extensions.You can load SwiftUI Image via Transferable directly,but for advanced use cases,you should define your own model objectsconforming to the Transferable protocolto fully control the type of data you want to load.For more information about Transferable,you can check out the "Meet Transferable" session.If your app needs to deal with a lot of items at the same time,or large assets like videos,it may not be feasible to load everything in memoryat the same time.To reduce memory usage, you can use FileTransferRepresentationto load selected assets as files.When loading assets as files,keep in mind that your app is responsiblefor managing their lifecycles.Files should always be copied to your app directorywhen received and deleted when they are no longer needed.OK, it's time for the demo!I have already set up this demo appshowing an account profile page.Right now the profile image is just a placeholder icon.We want to add an edit button to change the profile imageusing the PhotosPicker API.The profile image view can already respondto the image state defined in our view model,so we just need to update the image statewhen a picker selection is received.First, let's go to our view modeland add a new imageSelection property.It will be passed to the PhotosPicker APIas the selection binding.Now we can go back to our profile image view,and add an overlay button that brings up the picker.OK, let's pause for a second and take a look at the codewe just added.We added a PhotosPicker view,given it the selection binding we just defined,and configured it to only show images.The label of the PhotosPickeris just a pencil glyph with a circle background.We can build and run to see what we have so far.I can tap the edit button to bring up the picker.Tapping an image will automatically close the picker,but the profile image is not updated.Why?We still need to connect the image selectionand the image state.So, let's do that.We can go back to the view modeland respond to image selection did set.We set the image state to empty if the image selection is nil.Otherwise, we start loading the image.We are seeing a compiler error because we haven't implementedthe loadTransferable method yet.Let's fix it.The implementation is very simple.We just need to respond to the completion handlerand update image stateif the request is still the most recent one.Let's build and run to see it in action.I can tap the edit button and select an image.Great! It works as expected.Actually, the project is already set up to run on macOS as well.Will the code I just added automatically work on macOS?Let's build and run to find out.It compiles!I can open the picker, select an image,and it is reflected in the app.That's it for the demo.You just saw the demo on iOS and macOS,but the same code will work on watchOS as well.However, there are a few things to keep in mind.The watchOS picker is designed for simple flowsand short interactions.Images are scaled based on the device size.Usually, they are synced from the paired iPhone.However, Family Setup lets your family memberswho don't have their own iPhoneenjoy the features and benefits of an Apple Watch.If a device is in the Family Setup mode,the most recent 1000 images in iCloud Photos can be selectedusing the picker.The picker may need to download some images from the internet.And if that's the case,a loading UI will be shown in the picker before closing.Before you go, I just want to saythat we are committed to making the system Photos pickerthe best way for most apps to access photos and videos.We really encourage you to switch to itif you are still using a custom picker.Thank you, and have a great WWDC!♪
