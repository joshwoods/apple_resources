Taking iPad Apps for Mac to the Next Level

Search this video…Andy: Hi there.Welcome to "Adopt desktop class editing interactions."I'm Andy, a UIKit frameworks engineer,and I will be joined later by my colleague, James.The iPad is continuously evolving,without compromising the interactions that make it simple and easy to use.In this video, you'll learn about the exciting new editing interactionsthat will transform your app to become more desktop class.First, I'll go over the new edit menus, which received a major facelift in iOS 16.Later, James will dive into the new system find and replace experience.In iOS 16, the edit menu features an all-new designthat remains familiar but is more interactiveand is easier to discover actions.The edit menu now has alternate presentationsbased on the input method used.For touch interactions,the edit menu still has the familiar compact appearance,but with an improved paging behavior,allowing actions to be more discoverable than before.With the Magic Keyboard or a trackpad,a context menu is presented on secondary or right clickfor a more desktop class experience.Similarly, touch interaction on the iPhone will display the new edit menu.And for Mac Catalyst apps,context menus that Mac users are familiar with is presented.In iOS 16, the text edit menu gets a major power-upwith new data detectors integration.This includes inline unit and currency conversions,as well as smart lookupwhich displays contextual actions depending on the selected text.For example,if you select an address in Safari,you will get Maps-based actions,like "Get Directions" or "Open in Maps,"on top of the existing edit menu actions.The best part is, there is no adoption required!These features are available in every text edit menu,including text interaction views, WebKit and Safari, as well as PDFKit.To insert actions into a text view's menu, implement the new TextViewDelegate methodto customize the displayed menu for text in the given rangewith system provided actions.If you don't need to customize anything,return nil to get the standard system menu.There are also similar methods on UITextFieldDelegate and UITextInputto customize the menu there too.Please note that inserting menu items using UIMenuControlleris now deprecated in iOS 16,and you should instead move to use the new methodsto add menu elements into your text edit menus,because where we're going, we don't need menu controllers!Here is an example of a text view with some custom actions.When a menu is presented on some text selection,a custom "Highlight" and "Insert Photo" action is shownafter the system suggested actions.Selecting the highlight action performs a highlight on the text as expected.Next, when the menu is presented without any text selectionwhere there is nothing to highlight,the menu only displays the "Insert Photo" actionafter the system suggested actions.I'll show you how to add these actions using the new API.To insert actions into the menu dynamically on presentation,implement the UITextViewDelegate methodtextView editMenuForTextIn range suggestedActionsIn this example, I only want to add the "Highlight" actionwhen there is selected text,so I can add the action dynamically through this method.The "Insert Photo" action is always valid,so I can add it into the array to always display the action in the menu.Finally, I'll append my actions to the system suggested actions,which includes items like Cut, Copy, and Paste, and return the menu.And that's it!UIEditMenuInteraction is the UIInteraction API that powers the new edit menu.The interaction allows you to programmatically presentthe lightweight edit menu outside of text viewsbased on your own gesture,and has native support to present a context menu on secondary click.In iOS 16, UIMenuController and all of its related APIsare replaced by the new edit menu interaction.To present an edit menu from scratch,first, create the interaction and add it to the view.Next, configure a gesture recognizer to present the menu from.To ensure that the menu only appears on direct touchand not from indirect pointer clicks,be sure to set the allowedTouchTypes propertyof the gesture recognizer to be direct touch only.Then, add the gesture recognizer to the view.Finally, when the gesture recognizer fires,determine if there is content at the location of the gesturethat could display the menu.Then, create an edit menu configurationwith a source point at the gesture's location.The source point is used to determine performable actionsin the interaction's view to display in the menu.Once configured, call presentEditMenu(with: configuration)to show the menu.When I right-click anywhere within the selected "Jello there!" view,a context menu is presented with performable system actionsfor the app's content.Even more, when I tap on the selected view,the edit menu is presented where my touch occurred,showing the same actions as the context menu.This is good, but it can be better.While it is nice that the menu appears where the touch occurred,it's actually blocking the selected view's content.Moreover, I want to insert a new "Duplicate" action into the menu,which is not a system default action.Let's go back and change this.To show the menu around the selected view,implement the delegate methodeditMenuInteraction targetRectFor configurationThis method returns a CGRect used to determine where to present the menu fromand is in the coordinate space of the interaction's view.If the method is not implemented or a null CGRect is provided,the menu will be presented from the source point of the configuration.In this case, to prevent the menu from occluding the selected view,return its frame.Next, to add the "Duplicate" action,implement editMenuInteraction menuFor configuration suggestedActionsand append the custom action after the system suggested actions,similar to how you would insert actions into a text view's menu before.Now, when I tap again on the selected view,the menu no longer occludes "Jello there!" and instead presents around it.The new "Duplicate" action is also included when the menu is presented,all with just a few lines of code.Brilliant!For Mac Catalyst apps,the edit menu bridges to the familiar context menusthat users expect on the Macwhen they right click on the interaction's view.For iPad idiom Mac Catalyst apps,programmatically presented edit menus also bridge into context menus.Please note that programmatic presentation of the edit menu is not supportedfor Mac idiom apps.To offer seamless bridging between different presentation styles,UIEditMenuInteraction is built on top of the UIMenuElement family of APIs.These offer more flexibility and customizability than before,including support for submenus and images.If this is your first time using UIMenus,watch "Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13" to learn more about menus and actions.Building on top of UIMenuElement also means thatthe edit menu has access to a wide variety of APIs,like UIMenuSystem, that support menus already.The edit menu uses the existing UIMenuSystem.context systemto build its menus.To find out more about the menu builder,as well as a deeper dive on responder chain traversal and command validation,watch "Taking your iPad apps to the next level."Speaking of menus, there are several new enhancements to UIMenu in iOS 16.UIMenu now has a preferred element size property that allowsyou to choose between different layouts in the context menu.The small size gives the menu a more compact side-by-side appearance,fitting more actions in a single row.The medium size also displays actions in a side-by-side appearancebut with a little more detail.This is used by the text edit menu to display the standard edit menu.And finally, the large element size gives the menu its default,full-width appearance.Additionally, there is a new .keepsMenuPresented attributeon UIMenuElement to keep menus presentedafter an action is performed.Use this attribute to allow actions to be performed multiple timeswithout re-presenting the menu.That's just the tip of the iceberg for the new edit menu.Extend text editing functionality by customizing the text edit menu.Make sure that your actions have titles and imagesso that the menus look complete in different presentation styles.Most importantly, adopt the new UIEditMenuInteractionfor better customizability and improved consistency across platformsand different input methods.Adding support for the new edit menu is a great first step.To complete the desktop class editing experience,I'll hand it over to James to talk aboutthe new system find and replace experience.James Magahern: Ah, there it is!Hi, I'm James Magahern, a UIKit engineer,and I'm here to talk about find and replace.New in iOS 16,we introduced a new UI component for finding and replacing text in apps.It's standard across the systemand included with many of the built-in apps,and allows your users to flex their muscle memorywith even more commonly used editing shortcuts.This is the new find panel running on iPad.We will automatically transition from floating inline with the shortcut barwhen a hardware keyboard is attached,to resting on top of the software keyboard when used without a hardware keyboard.On iPhone, we'll adapt to the smaller screen sizeby using a more compact layout.Automatic dismissal, minimization, and keyboard avoidanceare all taken care of by the system.When running your app on a Mac,we'll present the find panel inline with your content,behaving just like the AppKit find bar,and using a familiar layout that users expect on the Mac.If you're using UITextView, WKWebView, or PDFViewsto display text content in your apps,all you need to do to get started is set isFindInteractionEnabled to trueon the built-in find interaction.It's that simple!In addition, if you're using QuickLook to display text content,this will already be available without any work from you.With a hardware keyboard,all of the standard system shortcuts like command+F for find,command+G for find next,command+shift+G for find previous, et cetera, will work just as expected.Access to these commands are available via the menu bar when running on a Mac.All you need to do is make sure the view displaying the contentcan and does become first responder.For users who are not using a hardware keyboard,you can invoke the find interaction programmaticallyvia presentFindNavigator, on the included find interaction property.It might be a good idea to make this availablevia a navigation bar item, for example.When running on a Mac, there's a couple other things to keep in mind.For instance, on iOS, the find panel is presentedas part of the software keyboard or shortcut bar.On the Mac, we'll display it inline with your content.If you're installing the find interaction on a scroll view,we’ll automatically adjust the content insets to accommodate the find panel,and adapt to trait collection changes automatically.You should otherwise make sure that there's enough roomto host the find panel in your UI on macOS.Additionally, we'll show a menu containing a standard set of find options availablewhen tapping on the magnifying glass icon.You can customize the contents of this menuby using the optionsMenuProvider property on UIFindInteraction.This will be more important with custom implementations.And that's all it takes if you're usingone of the built-in views that I mentioned before.If your app is displaying textual content by other means,like a completely custom view or something like a list view, shown here,you can still add the find interaction to your app.Let me show you how.The good news about find interactionis that you can install it on any arbitrary view.If you have an existing find and replace implementation in your app,it's a snap to bridge over to UIFindInteractionand take advantage of the system's UI.If you don't already have an existing find implementation for your custom view,it's still super easy to get started,especially if you've already implemented the UITextInput protocolin order to work with the system keyboard.Here's how UIFindInteraction works with custom views.After installing UIFindInteraction on your custom view,set up a find interaction delegate.The find interaction delegate, besides being notifiedabout when a find session begins or ends,is responsible for dealing out UIFindSessions.UIFindSession is an abstract base classthat encapsulates all of the state for a given session,such as the currently highlighted result.It also services all actions requested from the UI,such as "go to the next result," or "search for this string."If you want to manage all of this state yourself,you can choose to vend a subclass of UIFindSessionfrom your find interaction delegate.This is a good option if you already have an existingfind and replace implementation in your app,and want to bridge it over to the system UI.Otherwise, it would be a much better ideato let the system take care of the state for you,and instead adopt the UITextSearching protocolon whatever class encapsulates the content of the document being displayed.To do this, you would return a UITextSearchingFindSession,and connect it with your document class.This is the best option if you don't yet havea find implementation for your custom view.Here's how to do this in code.This example has a custom document classand a custom view which displays this document.The UIFindInteraction will be installed on this view,and a UITextSearchingFindSession will be provided with this documentas the "searchable object."Make sure either your view controller or your custom viewcan become first responder so keyboard shortcuts work as expected.Create the find interaction, and provide a session delegateto deal out find sessions.Here, the view controller is the session delegate.Then, when asked for a find session by the interaction,just return a new UITextSearchingFindSessionproviding your document as the searchable object.You will of course need to make sure that your document classconforms to the UITextSearching protocol.The class which implements the UITextSearching protocolis responsible for actually finding text in your document.The system will call performTextSearch,and hand you an aggregator object to which you can provide results.The aggregator works with UITextRange to represent results in your document.This is another abstract class that you can useto encapsulate whatever data makes sense for how you store text.For example, this could represent a DOM rangefor clients who use WebKit to render text.The aggregator is also thread-safe,so you can provide it results on a background thread.Finally, since the find interactiondoesn't know how to display results using your custom view,you'll also need to decorate results for a given style when decorate() is called.The UITextSearching find session and protocolalso support multiplexing across multiple visible documentsusing the same interaction.In other words, if your app displays contentin a manner similar to Mail's conversation view,where each "document" in that case is a mail message,you can install a single find interaction on the root level collection viewand perform a find across all documents at the same time,allowing your users to jump between results in different documents with ease.So that's all it takes to get started with the new find interaction in iOS 16.For system views that display a lot of text content,make sure to enable isFindInteractionEnabled.Move your existing find implementation to UIFindInteraction.Implement UITextSearching and use UITextSearchingFindSessionif you don't yet have text searching in your app.And lastly, check and make sure you don't have any conflictingkeyboard shortcuts in your app.And that is what it takes to refresh your app's editing interactions for iOS 16and make them truly desktop class.Try the new text edit menu in your app,and adopt the edit menu interaction for custom UI.And boost productivity by making your app's text content searchable.I'm looking forward to finding these great new features in your app.Thanks for watching!
