Security is an API that we provide,so you can build security products for the Mac.It is a C API, providing a rich security event streamto third-party anti-virus,Endpoint Detection and Response,and data-leakage prevention solutions.We first introduced Endpoint Security in macOS Catalinaas a replacement for the deprecated KAuth KPI,the unsupported MAC Kernel Framework,and the also deprecated OpenBSM audit trail.By making this functionality availablein the Endpoint Security API, we removed the needfor you to have to develop kernel extensions.The introduction of Endpoint Securityhas been a resounding success.We are thrilled with the positive feedback we receiveand with the security products that it is enabling.For an introduction to Endpoint Security,refer to the WWDC 2020 session"Build an Endpoint Security app."In this session,we'll be covering new events added in macOS Ventura,improvements to muting functionality,as well as a new utility called eslogger.Let's start with the new events.As of macOS Monterey,Endpoint Security supports over a hundred event types.Up until now, these events focused on critical eventsthat happen within the kernel, such as forking a processor opening a file.In macOS Ventura, we're expanding the setof observable events to include security-relevant eventshappening in user space.Specifically, we are adding visibility into authentication,login and logout, and Gatekeeper's XProtect.The new authentication event covers the situationwhere a user authenticates to the operating system.This includes logging into local user accounts,but also authenticating in other places,such as to authorize an operation as an administrator.These events are typically used by security productsthat wish to observe suspicious access patterns.Previously, if you wished to observe authentication events,you still had to rely on the deprecated OpenBSM audit trailto do so; this will now no longer be necessary.And compared to their audit counterparts,these new events are much richer in information,and also provide visibility into Auto Unlock using Apple Watch,which wasn't available in audit.In a similar vein, we're adding visibility into user sessions.Login events cover situations where someone or somethinglogs on to the system, either locally at the consoleor remotely over one of the supported methodsof remote access.These events go substantially beyond what was availablewith the OpenBSM audit trail.They allow you to gain more comprehensive visibilityinto access to systems,including lateral movement across enterprise fleets.Part of Gatekeeper's mission is to detect and blockknown malicious software.Starting with macOS Ventura,Endpoint Security will provide visibilityinto both the detection of malicious softwareand into actions taken to stop and remove malicious software.This information was previously unavailable in a structured way.It is now available through the Endpoint Security API.We expect that with these additions,most Endpoint Security clients no longer needto rely onto the deprecated OpenBSM audit trail at all.The audit trail has been deprecated since macOS Big Surand will be removed in a future version of macOS.Let's move on to muting.Since macOS Catalina, we have supported muting processesby audit token or executable image path.Muting is an important tool we give youto prevent deadlocks, hangs, and watchdog timeouts,and to manage the performance impact of your solutionsbased on Endpoint Security.In macOS Monterey last year, we started to addressfrequent causes of system instabilityby muting some event typesfor a small set of executables by default.You are free to unmute those, but we do recommendyou keep them muted in the interest of system stability.In macOS Ventura, we are taking muting one step furtherby introducing muting based on target path.For many real-world use cases,this allows for scalpel-like precision over muting.You can now mute file events pertaining to certain pathsor path prefixes that your applicationis not interested in receiving.This shows how you might mute all eventshaving a target path under /var/logwhen you're not interested in events for log files.The second example shows how you might usees_mute_path_events to mute only write eventsto a single file, such as /dev/null.And what's more, we're even introducing the possibilityto invert muting logic.Instead of suppressing events based on specified process,executable path, or target path, we now allow you to invertany of these three types of muting.Effectively, you can now select processes, executable paths,or target paths you are interested into only receive events that match --instead of don't match -- anything you've muted.For example, this now allows you to select file eventsonly for certain persistence locations.Here's how you would use es_invert_mutingto invert muting for target paths.You would then proceed to remove previously existing target pathsfrom the mute set, and then select only eventswith the target-path prefix that you are interested in.We expect this to allow for much improved muting strategies,and ultimately, to make it easierto provide a great user experiencewith products based on Endpoint Security.And finally, we're introducing eslogger.We have had many requests for a capabilityto provide Endpoint Security eventswithout the need to write a native client.Starting in macOS Ventura, you will be able to harnessthe power of Endpoint Security via a command-line utilitythat brings deep introspection into the OS.eslogger taps into the Endpoint Security event streamfor specific events and emits JSON-formatted event datato standard output or to the unified logging system.Data is structured just like the C representationnative clients use.eslogger supports all 80 NOTIFY eventsthat Endpoint Security supports in macOS Ventura.We hope eslogger will be useful not only for engineersworking on Endpoint Security clients,but also for security analysts and other security practitionerswho need visibility into security-relevant eventson macOS.eslogger ships with the OS and is already entitledfor Endpoint Security.Like all Endpoint Security clients,eslogger must be run as superuserand requires the user to have authorizedthe responsible process for Full Disk Access,such as Terminal.app or SSH.eslogger is not intended to be used by applications.Its output is subject to change in software updates.It is neither meant to provide the sameperformance characteristics, nor the same feature set,as natively interfacing with the Endpoint Security API does.Applications will continue to interface natively.With that out of the way, let's use esloggerto explore some of the new events.I'm going to use eslogger to log the startand end of an SSH session by subscribingto the openssh_login and _logout eventsand redirecting output to a file.Now in this other tab, I'm using SSHto locally log in and log out again.Back in the first tab, I'm interrupting eslogger.Let's have a look at the Endpoint Security event datain its raw JSON form.It's very likely that you will have your own favorite wayto work with JSON data.Here, I will use jq to examine the events further.This is a lot of information.I'll just drill down to some interesting fields.Like all Endpoint Security events,we have information on the process that emitted them.We can see that both events were emitted by the SSH daemon.We can also inspect, for instance,its audit token to glean the PID of the processthat emitted the events.And finally, let's have a look at the event-specific fieldsof these events.We can see that this was a successful SSH logininto my user account, followed by a logout.I love how I can get visibilityinto Endpoint Security events this way,whether I want to observe malicious software behavior,or to just quickly prototype a detection approach.We look forward to seeing your security solutionstake advantage of the new eventsas well as of the improved muting capabilities.Thanks for joining us at WWDC.♪
