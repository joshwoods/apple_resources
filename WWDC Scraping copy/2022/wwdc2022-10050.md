Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop music ♪♪Hi! My name is Devon.I'm an engineer on the watchOS team,and today, I'll be talking about iOS.And I'm Graham, an engineer from iOS,and today, I'll be talking about watchOS.We'll be talking about API additions to WidgetKitthat enable you to write accessory widgetsfor the Lock Screen and complications for watchOS.We'll show how you can develop both together,along with additions to SwiftUI to help you along the way.If you're unfamiliar with widgets,timelines, and reloading,I encourage you to seek out prior WidgetKit sessions.First, we'll talk about the history of complicationsand how they've evolved.Then, we'll talk about new API to color your widgetsand complications in their new environments.After that, Graham will demo how to get startedmaking your own widgetsand moving your existing widget extension to watchOS.Next, Graham will walk you throughhow to make the most of these smaller views.And lastly, we'll talk about the different privacy environmentsyour widgets may appear in.Complications are a key piece of the watchOS platform,presenting quick, glanceable information on the watch face.They convey immediately accessible,high-value information and a tap takes youto the relevant location in the app.In watchOS 2, ClockKit enabled youto create your own complications.Complications have come a long way since then.Rich complications were introduced in watchOS 5,with graphic content and a suite of new families.SwiftUI complications and multiple complicationswere introduced in watchOS 7, which enabled youto take your complications to the next leveland provide more options than ever.Today, complications have been reimaginedand remade with WidgetKit, embracing SwiftUIand bringing the glanceable complication experienceto iOS in the form of widgets.With WidgetKit in iOS 16 and watchOS 9,you can build great glanceable widgets and complicationsacross both platforms,enabling you to write your code once and share infrastructurewith your existing Home Screen widgets.To do this, we've added new widget familiesto the existing WidgetFamily type,prefixed with the word "accessory."The new accessoryRectangular family can be usedto show multiple lines of text or small graphs and charts,similar to the existing ClockKit graphicRectangular family.The accessoryCircular family is great for brief information,gauges, and progress views.This family also replaces the graphicCircular ClockKit family.The all-new accessoryInline is a text-only slotpresent on many faces on watchOS and above the time on iOS.The inline slot comes in many sizes,and we'll talk about how to make the best useof them all later on.Specific to watchOS is the new accessoryCorner family,mixing a small circle of widget content with gauges and text.This talk focuses on families common between iOS and watchOS.For more details on this new watchOS familyand complication-specific features, check outthe "Go further with WidgetKit complications" session.Let's talk about colors and rendering modes.You may have noticed that accessory widgetstake on a few different appearances.The system controls the look of accessory family widgets,and we've given you some tools to help adapt themto the rendering style.There are three different rendering modesyour widget may be shown in.Your widget can be full color, accented, or vibrant.We've introduced the WidgetRenderingMode typeto represent these three different presentations.You can access this value from the Environment,using the widgetRenderingMode keypath.After that, you can change your content conditionallyto make sure it looks just right everywhere that it'll show up.In watchOS's full-color mode,your content is displayed exactly as you specify.Many existing complications take on a colorful appearancein full color, like the gradient in Weather's gauges,or the Activity rings' colors.In the accented rendering mode, your views are splitinto two groups and colored independently.The two coloring groups are flatly colored,preserving only their original opacities.You can tell the system how to group your viewswith the .widgetAccentable() view modifier,or switch out your content based onthe Widget Rendering Mode environment valueto look perfect when flattened.Note that the system can tint your contentin a number of ways, some of which are inverted.Some are on a black background, while others areon the new full-color backgrounds in watchOS 9.In the iOS vibrant rendering mode,your content is desaturated then colored appropriatelyfor the Lock Screen background.The system maps your greyscale contentin to a material appearance.This material is adaptive to the content behind it,appearing just right in its environment.Additionally, the Lock Screen can be configuredto give the vibrant rendering mode a colored tint.A light source color ends up mostly opaque and brighter.On the other end, a dark source colorappears as a less prominent blur of the background behind it,with only a slight amount of brightening.To ensure legibility,avoid using transparent colors in this mode.Instead, use darker colors or blackto represent less prominent contentwhile maintaining legibility.To help you with some of this nuance,we've also introduced the AccessoryWidgetBackground viewto give a consistent backdrop to widgets that need them,like this circular calendar.While most accessory widgets have no background,some styles can be enhanced with one.The background view takes on different appearancesin the various widget rendering modesand is tuned by the system to look rightfor the style of the face or Lock Screen.This is a soft transparent view in full color and accented,and black in the vibrant environment,which results in a low brightness and full blur.Graham is super excited to get started making some new widgetsfor the Lock Screen and complications on watchOS --I'll hand it off to him.Hi again!I'll be adding support for our new widget familiesto an existing app -- Emoji Rangers --which some of you might be familiar with from WWDC2020's"Widgets Code-along."Before I begin, a note for thosewith existing widget-free projects.You can get started by adding the Widget Extension targetto your project, which already exists on iOSand has been brought to watchOS.But I know that many of you have apps with widgets already,so today let's start there and talk aboutadding new widgets and complications.We'll continue the Emoji Rangers project.This app keeps track of our favorite Emoji Rangersand keeps you up to date with their health and recharge timewith the use of Home Screen widgets.We've already brought Emoji Rangers over to watchOS,bringing our favorite app to our wrists.Today we'll be extending Emoji Rangers with supportfor our new widget familiesand bringing its widget extension to the watch.Let's get started with getting the widget extensiononto the watch.We'll add a new watchOS target that shares codewith the existing iOS target.We'll duplicate the iOS widget extension target,give it a better name,change the bundle identifierto be prefixed with the watch app's,target watchOS,and embed our new extension in our watch app.Now we need to get our code building on watchOS --let's get on with that.Glancing through the EmojiRangerWidget code,we can see the timeline provider,which is used when the system reloads content,the view which uses SwiftUI to generate contentfor our different families,the widget configuration,and the Xcode preview provider.The Emoji Rangers appalready supports iOS Home Screen widgets.It offers the system small and medium families,and here in the widget configuration,I'm going to add the new families.Because system families are unavailable on the watch,we'll need to use a platform macroto specify our supportedFamilies.In the preview provider, I'm going to add previewsfor the new families.Next, we need to implement the new IntentRecommendation APIbefore we can successfully build for watchOS.While Intents are fully configurablein the widgets editing UI on iOS,on watchOS, we need to provide a preconfigured list.We can do that by overriding the new recommendations methodon our IntentTimelineProvider.Now we're building successfully.Let's resume the previewsand see what our circular widget looks like.The content intended for even a small widgetdoesn't fit well inside our new form factor.The new widget families are smaller than iOS widgetsfound on the Home Screen, and you'll need to considerthe content of your complications.Now let's talk about some new views we can useto make our complications stand out.Let's go to the view.We can see code for the systemSmall and other widgets;let's add code for the accessoryCircular case.I think it would look good just with the avatar.This provides a quick shortcut in to our appbut doesn't offer users any information.Let's add a progress view around the edge,which will give the users an idea of when the Rangerwill be ready for combat again.Trouble is animating this progress view to be currentwill require a lot of timeline entries in short succession.Instead, we can use SwiftUI's new auto-updating ProgressView.That takes a date interval over which our Rangerwill be fully healed.The system will keep our progress view updated,meaning we only need one timeline entry here.Much better.Now let's add the rectangular family.We'll select the rectangular preview.This gives us more space, so we'll make a three-line viewin the style of a complication.First the character's name, then their level,and then the time until fully healed,for which we'll use an auto-updating date field.I'd like the character's name to stand out,so I'll size the text, using a font style of headline,and add the widgetAccentable modifierwhich will adjust its color.Our view looks great here in vibrant,now let's see how it looks in our other rendering modeson the watch.You can see how the character's name takes on the accent color.To make your widgets and complications feel at homein their environment, it's importantthat you use the default font parametersand make use of font styles.The font styles and sizes are differentbetween iOS and watchOS.iOS uses the regular text design,while watchOS uses a rounded designwith a heavier weight.Your widgets and complications will sit onscreenadjacent to others.And so they look consistent, we recommend usingthe font styles Title, Headline, Body, and Caption.Xcode's preview shows we still have room leftoverto add the avatar too.Let's see how this looks on the iPhone.That looks great!Finally, let's add the third style, accessoryInline,which displays a line of text and optionally an image.Note that inline accessories are drawnaccording to system-defined coloring and font.Let's select the preview.Let's show our hero's name and recharge countdown.This text is too long for our watch slot.So now's a good time to show you ViewThatFits.I can supply multiple views, from lengthy to concise,and ViewThatFits will choose the first content viewthat fits the available space without truncation or clipping.Let's shorten the text.Even that might be too long for the shortest watch slot,so let's offer a third alternativeby switching out the avatar for the name.Let's see what that looks like.Refer to the "Compose Custom layouts with SwiftUI" sessionfor more about this.Awesome!Even Emoji Rangers like to enjoy some privacy,so I'll hand it back to Devon to talk about that.Hello again! Let's talk about privacy.So far in this talk, we've discussed the active stateof your widgets and complications.However, across our platforms, you'll need to considerwhether the device is redacting contentor in a low-luminance state.On the iOS Lock Screen, the default behavioris to show your content even while the device is locked,which is the top-left cell in our grid here.However, this is configurable in Settings,and users can choose to redact their widget when locked,much like Notifications.On watchOS, the device stays unlockedas long as the watch is being worn.When inactive, the watch transitions into always-on,with content in a low-luminance presentationand a lower update cadence.By default, your content is not redacted in low luminance,which is the state on the bottom left.Like the Lock Screen, your users can configuretheir complication content to be redactedin this always-on state.In this state, you'll need to make sure your contentis prepared for both redaction and low luminance.Together, the platforms cover each of the four statesshown here.Consider all these possible states and ensureyour complications and widgets work well in all cases.Let's talk about how you can do that.On the watch, your widget needs to supportthe always-on display experience.You can adapt your content for always-onwith the \.isLuminanceReduced environment value.If you're coming from ClockKit, note that you now can preparealways-on content for every timeline entry, not just one.When in always-on, your time-relative textand progress views will change to a reduced fidelity modeto support the low update cadence of always-on.To support this mode, use the environment value to removeany time-sensitive content and optimize your contentfor the lower update frequency.Now let's talk about redaction.By default, the privacy mode will show a redacted versionof the placeholder view your TimelineProvider creates.If you have some elements that are sensitiveand others that don't need to be redacted,you can use the .privacySensitive modifierto mark only some of the views to be redacted.In this example, we've redacted the heart rate in our widgetbut left the image unredacted.Now you're ready to make awesome widgets for the Lock Screenand WidgetKit complications.For more on what's new in SwiftUI,check out the "Compose Custom Layouts with SwiftUI" talk.Thanks for watching.♪
