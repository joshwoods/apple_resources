a tour of Swift-DocC in Xcode 14,packed with great new toolsto help you create even better documentation.We introduced Swift-DocC last year in Xcode 13,allowing you to guide developers through your Swift frameworks.With Swift-DocC, you write comprehensive content,from reference documentation for individual APIsto conceptual articles that provide a higher-level storyfor using these APIs together,all the way to step-by-step tutorialsthat walk the user through a task.This year, with Xcode 14,Swift-DocC unlocks brand-new, exciting workflows.In addition to documenting frameworks,we're thrilled to now support app projects as well,so that you can easily collaborate with your team.You can now also document Objective-C and C APIsusing Swift-DocC, allowing youto describe all your project's APIs together.Publishing your content to a websiteis now dramatically easier, with out-of-the-box supportfor static hosting environments like GitHub Pages.And thanks to the powerful new navigation sidebar,developers will be able to discover your contenteasier than ever before.Also, with Swift-DocC now being an open source project,these new features were developedin close collaboration with the open source community.In this session, we'll take a tour of Swift-DocCand the exciting new workflows it unlocks in Xcode 14.First, we'll discover how to document your project's APIsright inline with your source code.Then, we'll take a look at seamlesslypublishing your content to a website.And finally, we'll discoverthe brand-new navigation sidebar on the web.Let's start with writing documentation.Good documentation is essential to any software project.As your project evolves,it's important to describe its functionality and designso that developers have a solid reference pointwhen contributing.Swift-DocC in Xcode gives you the tools you needto create fantastic documentation,using the same tools you use to develop code.And this year, we're excitedto expand Swift-DocC to app projects.Let's dive right in.We'll document an app I'm working on with my teamcalled Slothy,which contains both Swift and Objective-C source files.Even with a brand-new project,where I haven't written documentation yet,you can open the Product menu and select Build Documentation,and Xcode opens the documentation window,where you'll see stubs that Swift-DocCautomatically generates for your APIs.This provides a great starting point for filling in these pagesto help contributors navigate the project.So, let's take it step by step to turn this contentinto a rich and complete guide for contributing to our app.A good place to start is to teach how each APIworks individually, and from there,to provide higher-level content using a documentation catalog.Let's start by describing a view called SlothView.For this documentation to be visible to Swift-DocC,start your comment using three slashes.Then, add a concise summary for your view.In the built documentation page, this translates to textdisplayed prominently right below the view's name.Then, add more details using additional paragraphs.This content appears in the Overview section of the page.And use Swift-DocC's link syntax to turn references to APIsinto active links,allowing you to quickly jump to Pages to learn more.DocC even validates these links when you build,so you get warnings if they go out of date.Finally, if you wish to provide an exampleof how to use this view,add a code listing using the Markdown code block syntax.Now, contributors know at a glancehow to use this view.In just a few steps, my view's documentationis now much more helpful to contributors of this project.Next up, let's document an initializer.Again, start by writing a summary.For initializers and methods,it's a good idea to describe each parameter individually.You do so by adding a parameter list item,with a short description of what the parameter is.Notice how the content appearsin a separate Parameters section.Now let's take a look at the Objective-C APIsdefined in this project.New in Xcode 14, we're excited to bringSwift-DocC's comprehensive toolingto document Objective-C code.Using the same familiar Markdown syntax you know and love,and updated support in Xcode's source editor,you can now describe and organizeall your project's APIs together.And for code that can be called from both Swift and Objective-C,there's a nifty language toggleto browse the page in the language you're coding in.Check out the developer documentation linked belowfor more details.Now, let's apply this to our Slothy project.I'll describe the SLOSound class and its initializer.Notice that because this classcan be used from both Swift and Objective-C code,Xcode displays a language toggle allowing youto browse the content in the language you're using.Let's describe the class and initializerusing the same Markdown syntax you use for Swift code.Great, this looks much better.I've added a summary, an overview,and for the initializer, a parameters section.And that wraps up describing individual APIs.By writing a few documentation comments in source code,developers contributing to my projecthave a better understanding of how to use its APIs.Now, let's focus on creating a great top-level pagefor our app.This is the first page contributors will see,so I'd like to provide a great introductionto what the app does and how to contribute to it.To customize the top-level page,start by adding a documentation catalog.To do so, right-click on your project's source folderand select New File.Then select Documentation Catalog.A Documentation Catalogcomplements your source code documentationand contains additional Markdown files and media.Xcode automatically adds a filefor the top-level page of your app.Let's fill it in with an overview of what the app does.Using the same syntax you use for documentation commentsin source code, I added a summary,an overview, and even embedded rich content like images.Great, this looks much more inviting.Now contributors know at a glance what my app is about.And that's it! I've dramatically improved documentation for my appand provided a great reference pointto my project's contributors.They can browse the top-level pagefor an overview of the project, and jump into each pageto get detailed information about each of its APIs.Now that we've seen how to write and build documentation,it's time to publish it to a websiteso that contributors can easily browse it.Over to you, Ethan.Ethan Kusters: Thank you, Franklin.We've been developing the Slothy app in a modular wayalongside a more generally useful Swift Packagecalled SlothCreator.I think it would be great to publish SlothCreatorto a wider audience so that other developersmaking sloth-related apps can make use of it.As a part of this effort, I want to be sureSlothCreator's documentation is easily shareable on the web,so let's walk through Swift-DocC's brand-new,simplified publishing workflow.When you build documentation in Xcode,Swift-DocC produces a static bundlecontaining your documentation.This bundle is called a DocC archiveand is a portable container for your documentation.You can export it directly from Xcode's documentation windowand send it to colleagues.They'll be able to open and browse the documentationby just double-clicking on the archive.But a DocC archive isn't just a portable containerfor opening documentation in Xcode.It also contains a fully featured websiteright out of the box.And new in Xcode 14, that DocC archiveis also directly compatible with most web servers.This makes publishing your documentation to the webeasier than ever.In most cases, you can deploy your documentationby just copying the contents of your built DocC archiveinto the root of your web server.This also means that DocC archivesare now compatible with most managed hosting services,including GitHub Pages.GitHub Pages is a popular waymany developers host their documentationthat's integrated right into GitHub.com.And since we've been using GitHubfor the source control of SlothCreator,it makes sense for us to publish our documentation thereas well.If you're familiar with using GitHub pages,you'll know that, unlike a standard server,your website is not published at the root path of the URLbut at a specific base path.In this kind of hosting scenario,you'll need to specify your website's base pathwith an additional build settingto produce a DocC archive that's compatible.To fully understand how this worksand why we only need this configurationin certain hosting scenarios -- like on GitHub Pages --let's take a look at how we would expect the URLof a DocC archive hosted on your own domain might look.Let's assume we already have a website for the Slothy app --slothy.example.com --and we'd like to publish the documentation for SlothCreatoras a part of that existing website.If we just take the content of the SlothCreator DocC archiveand copy it to the root of our web server,the reference documentation for SlothCreator will appearat slothy.example.com/ documentation/slothcreator.Any tutorials for the SlothCreator packagewould be at a neighboring "tutorials" path.However, in this case, we're not going to be publishingto our own domain.Instead, to keep the documentationwith our GitHub repository,we'll publish to the domain GitHub Pages provides.When you create a GitHub Pages site for a repository,the URL of that website is not at the root path;instead, it's at a specific base pathcorresponding to the name of the repository.Generally that will be something like your username.github.ioforward-slash your repository name.Any reference and tutorial documentation pathsare appended to that base path.Because this base path is unique to your repository,it's important to tell Swift-DocC what it isbefore building a DocC archive for publishing to GitHub Pages.There's a new build setting exposed in Xcode 14for just this use case.After configuringthe DocC Archive Hosting Base Path settingto be the name of your GitHub repository,you'll be ready to gofor all of your future documentation builds.Let's take a look at how this works in practice.Here, I've opened the SlothCreator Swift packageFranklin showed you earlieras a dependency of the Slothy app.Since we're getting close to publishing this packagefor wider use, I'm going to go aheadand publish the documentation we've prepared to GitHub Pages.I'll begin by opening the framework's project settingsby moving my mouse to Xcode's Project navigatorand selecting the SlothCreator item.Next, I'll select the SlothCreator target,and then open the Build Settings tab.In this case, I'm looking for a Swift-DocC-related setting,so let's filter for DocC.Now I'll set the DocC Archive Hosting Base Path settingto be the name of our repository: sloth-creator.Great!Next, let's build documentation.I'll move my mouse up to the Product menuand select Build documentation.After Xcode finishes compiling my projectand generating documentation for it,the documentation window will open.Here's the top-level page for SlothCreator's documentation.Let's go ahead and export it.I'll move my mouse over to the documentation navigatorand the SlothCreator technology item.Next I'll click on the context menu and select Export.I'm going to export it to a directory named "docs"in the root of my repositorybecause this is how I've configured GitHub Pagesto publish my documentation website.Now I just need to commit and push my changes up to GitHub.Back in the main Xcode window,I'll move my mouse up to the Source Control menuand select Commit.I'll select the docs directorythat has my documentation contentand write a commit message.Let's go ahead and push the changes.And that's it.Let's go check out the published site.I'll open up my repository on GitHub.com.I'd already placed a link to the documentation sitein the README, so I'll just click on it.And here we are.I'm so excited to have the documentationwe worked on for SlothCreator easily accessible on the web.I think this is going to be really helpful for folksinterested in using SlothCreator in their own projects.Now that we've deployed the documentationfor SlothCreator once,I'd really like to set up automationto perform a deploymentany time the documentation in the repository changes.Since we're releasing SlothCreator as a Swift Package,the new Swift-DocC Swift Package Manager plug-inis going to be a great help here.You can use the Swift-DocC plug-into really simplify the process of building documentationfor Swift packages.The plug-in's documentation is linked belowand I recommend checking it outas a great starting place for configuring automateddocumentation deployments to GitHub Pagesand other hosting services.And of course, Swift-DocC continues to havegreat command-line support for Xcode projectswith the xcodebuild docbuild command-line interfacethat was introduced in Xcode 13.Documentation for how to get started using xcodebuildto automate GitHub Pages deployments is linked below.We're thrilled to be releasing an all-new enhanced browsingand navigation experience for Swift-DocC on the web this year.Let's take a look at how the new navigation sidebarcan help readers of the SlothCreator documentationexplore what the framework has to offer.We're back on the GitHub Pages site for SlothCreator,and over on the left side of the pageis the new navigation sidebar.I'll move my mouse over to the CareSchedule itemand expand it by clicking on the disclosure triangle.Now I can see the pages that are organizedas children of CareSchedulewithout even needing to fully open the page.In this case, I'm interested injumping straight to the type's initializer.I can continue navigating through the framework,expanding other items like FoodGenerator and SlothFood,eventually opening the twig page.As I'm navigating between pages,the state of the navigation sidebar stays constant,allowing me to keep track of the pages I've already visited.This allows for a natural exploration of the frameworkthat I really appreciate.But what if I'm already familiar with the SlothCreator frameworkand am looking for information about a specific symbol?The filter field at the bottom of the new navigation sidebaris perfect for this.I'm interested in an API that will help meincrease the energy level of my sloths.I'll move my mouse to the bottom of the navigator,select the filter bar, and insert "energy."Perfect!This documentation on the energyLevel propertyis exactly what I was looking for.The new browsing experienceoffered by Swift-DocC in Xcode 14is going to bring your documentation siteto the next level.We're so excited for you to try it out.Swift-DocC's integration in Xcode now offers supportfor documenting all of your projects.This includes your Objective-C and Swift codein application and framework targets,whether packaged as Xcode projects or Swift Packages.The DocC archive produced by Xcode 14is immediately compatible with popular hosting services,including GitHub Pages.This is a game changer for distributing your documentationto an even wider audience.And finally, Swift-DocC offersa powerful new navigation experience on the web.The navigation sidebar is going to unlock new waysof exploring and finding the documentation on your site.To learn more about the new Swift-DocC sidebarand how to best author your documentationto take advantage of its new features,check out the "Improve the discoverabilityof your Swift-DocC content" session.And to take your documentation even further,check out the "Build interactive tutorials using DocC" sessionto learn how to build step-by-step walk-throughsto guide developers through your app or framework.We are so excited to see all of the documentationyou write and publish with Xcode 14.Thank you for watching.♪
