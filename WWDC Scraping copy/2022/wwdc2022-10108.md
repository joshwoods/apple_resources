LocalAuthentication frameworkto improve the authentication and authorization flows of your app.We will start by taking a look at the generic conceptsof authentication and authorizationand how they apply to your application.Then we will review how the existing LocalAuthentication API,and in particular the LAContext,can help you implement a wide range of authorization schemes.And finally we will see how the new APIswe are adding to LocalAuthentication this yearcan help you further streamline your authorization code.So let's start by talking about authentication and authorization.Authentication and authorization are distinctyet closely related security concepts.On the one hand, authentication is the act of verifying the identity of the user.On the other hand, authorization is the act of verifying whether a given useris allowed to perform a specific operation on a concrete resource.Put together, we can see that, since we first need to verifythat the user is who they claim to be before we can evaluatewhat resources and operations are available to them,we can say that authentication in fact enables authorization.To help illustrate these concepts,let's look at a concrete example involving a common security resourcemanaged by your applications, such as Secure Enclave keys.Secure Enclave keys are special types of asymmetric keysthat are bound to a specific device and which are protectedby a hardware-based key manager that is isolated from the main processor.What makes these keys special is that when you store a private keyin the Secure Enclave, you never actually handle the keybut instead instruct the Secure Enclave to perform operations with it.Secure Enclave keys can be associated with access control listsor ACLs for short.An access control list specifies the requirements that need to be satisfiedin order to perform specific operations such as signing or decrypting a blob.They can specify when a given item is available,for example after device unlock, as well as the authentication requirementsneeded to allow the execution of certain operations.For this example, let's say that your app wants to protectthe sign and decrypt operations of its key with biometric authentication,while also ensuring that the key is only availableafter the device has been unlocked.Now let's see how an authorization flow would look likefor a sign operation involving this key.First, your application issues a request to sign a blob using the private key.Then, after verifying that your application can access the key,the system proceeds to identify the authorization requirementsfor the sign operation.In this case, the sign operation requires a successful biometric authenticationfrom any of the currently enrolled users.The system will then walk the userthrough the biometric authentication process via the standard UI.Upon a successful authentication,the system verifiesthat all the remaining authorization requirements have been satisfiedbefore finally performing the sign operationand returning a signed blob to your app.Let's break down the main components involved in this flowto see how they fit into our initial definitions.First, we have a resource: the Secure Enclave key.Second, we have an operation that can be performed with the key.And third, we have a set of requirements that, among other things,specify who is allowed to perform the operationas well as the means of authentication that should be usedto verify their identity.Plugging the parameters of this example into our definitions, we can see thatfor authentication, the question of whether this is the right useris answered by means of a biometric authentication;while for authorization, the question of whether the user is allowedto perform a signature operation using the private keyis answered by verifying the requirements specified in the access control list.Now that we have seen how this works at a high level,we can take a look at the way a flow like this can be implementedusing the current API of LocalAuthentication.Let's start by quickly reviewing the features offered by the LAContext,which is one of the core components of the framework.An LAContext can be used to evaluate the user's identity.It handles user interaction when biometric or passcode authentication is required.And it also interfaces with the Secure Enclaveto enable the secure management of biometric data.From this perspective, the LAContext can be usedto support your authentication use cases.The LAContext can also be used in association with other frameworksto support authorization flows.For instance, you could use it to evaluate access control listslike the one we saw in our previous example.Let's take a closer look.The first thing we need to do is to get access the ACLassociated with our private key.We can do this with the help of the SecItemCopyMatching APIoffered by the Security framework,making sure that we provide the return-attributes key inside of our query.Once we obtain access to the access control list,we can evaluate it directly using the LAContextand the evaluateAccessControl API.The biggest advantage that this approach gives you is that it lets you decidethe right moment and the right place in your applicationto prompt the user for this authorization.In this case, since the access control list requiresbiometric authentication for the signature operation,the LAContext will present the familiar Face ID or Touch ID UI.Once the ACL has been authorized inside our LAContext,we will be able to use it as part of our queryfor obtaining a reference to our key.We do this by appending the LAContext to our SecItem queryunder the use-authentication-context key.By binding the LAContext to our private key reference,we ensure that executing the signature operationwill not trigger another authentication,while allowing the operation to continue without unnecessary prompts.These binding also means that no additional user interactionswill be required for future signatures until the LAContext is invalidated.The LAContext offers a great deal of flexibilityand it lets you control each of the steps and parametersinvolved in your authorization flows.It can be used in combination with other frameworks such as the Security framework,which in turn unlocks a wide range of use cases.This versatility, however, comes at the cost of higher code complexity,requiring you to carefully orchestrate the APIs offered by several frameworks.Depending on your use case,the LAContext might be the right tool for you,especially if the main value proposition of your apprequires low-level access to keys, secrets,contexts, and access control lists.However, if all you need for your app is a way of authorizing access to contentor a sensitive resource, then you may want to trade off some of this flexibilityfor a simpler API.This brings us to our last topic, streamline your app.New to iOS 16 and macOS 13, LocalAuthentication is introducinga higher level, authorization focused API.The new API builds on top of existing concepts in LocalAuthenticationsuch as the LAContext and is geared towards simplifying the implementationof common authorization flows, allowing you to focus all your energyin the core value proposition of your apps.The most important abstraction introduced by the new API is the LARight.The simplest use case you can give a LARightis to help you authorize operations on application defined resources.For instance, you could use a right to help you gate accessto the user profile section of your applicationby first requiring a successful biometric authentication from your user.By default, rights are protected by a set of authentication requirementsthat allow your users to authenticate using Touch ID,Face ID, Apple Watch, or their device passcodedepending on the device they are using.You can also choose to associate your rightswith more granular requirements,which allow you to further constrain the means of authentication.Let's have a look at how we can use LARights in code.The first thing that we need to do is to instantiate our right.We do this by specifying its requirements.In this case, our login right will require users to authenticateusing biometry or providing the device passcode.We then proceed to verify that the current user can obtain the login right.We use this information to determinewhether we can continue with the login operationor if instead we need to redirect the user to the public section of our app.Finally, we can proceed with the actual authorize operationproviding a localized reason that will be visible to the userin the authorization UI.When authorizing a right in this way,a brand-new, system-driven UI is presented.The UI is rendered inside your application windowand provides users with relevant informationto help them understand the origin and purpose of the operation.We believe that the new look will allow you to craft authorization flowsthat integrate more seamlessly with your applicationand that provide more context and information for your users.Now that we have seen how to create and authorize a right,let's take a closer look at its lifecycle.Rights start their lifecycle in an unknown state.As soon as your application issues the authorize request,the state of the right changes to authorizing.It is at this point that the user will be presented with the authorization UIthat we saw in the previous slide.Depending on the success or failure of the operation,the right may transition to authorized or notAuthorized state.This is the most important state transition for your application.Finally, the right can also move from the authorizedto the notAuthorized state.This occurs when your application explicitly issuesa deauthorize request on the right, or when the right instance is deallocated.Be sure to keep a strong reference to your rightin order to preserve its authorized state.After a right has been deauthorized, your application can continueto issue authorization requests to restart the cycle.All the previous state transitions can be queried and observed.If you have access to the LARight instance,you can query its state property directly.You can also observe all state transitions using KVO or Combine.Additionally, if your application handles several rights,you can observe the state of all them from a single placeby listening to the didBecomeAuthorizedand the didBecomeUnauthorized notifications,which are published to the default NotificationCenterafter a change in the authorization state is detected.Before we move on, let's jump back to our exampleand add a logout operation to deauthorize our login right.By doing this, we guarantee that a new authorization will be requiredthe next time the user wants to log in.So far, we have seen how to use right instancesto authorize operations on application-defined resources.We have also seen how the lifecycle and state of these rightsis ultimately tied to the runtime,which means that on every session of your application,you need to instantiate and configure these rights correctly.So let's take a look at how rights can be persistedand what sort of possibilities this enables for your app.LARights can be persisted with the help of the right store.When persisted, rights are backed by a unique Secure Enclave keythat is protected with an access control list or ACLthat matches the authorization requirements of the right.This approach helps us ensure that the authorization requirementswill remain immutable after the right has been persisted.You can also access the private key that backs your rightand use it to perform protected cryptographic operationssuch as decryption, signature, and key exchanges.The corresponding public key is also accessibleand can be used to perform operationssuch as encryption and signature verification.Because this is a public key, you can also export the bytes associated with it.Private key operations are only allowedafter the right has been successfully authorized.In contrast, public key operations are always allowed.When persisting your right, you also have a chance of storinga single, immutable secret along with it.The secret is also associated with an access control listthat matches the authorization requirements of your rightand it only becomes accessible after the right has been authorized.To summarize, LAPersistedRights are createdwith the help of the right store.They are configured only onceand their authorization requirements are immutable.Because they are stored, they can be usedacross different sessions of your application.Internally, they are bound to a specific deviceand are backed by a unique Secure Enclave keywhich can be used to perform different cryptographic operations,depending on the authorization status of the right.Finally, they can be used to protect a single, immutable secretthat only becomes available after the right has been authorized.Now that we understand some of the features offered by persisted rights,let's see how they can help us implementthe scenario we discussed at the beginning of the presentation,where we wanted to authorize a signature operation.We start by instantiating a regular right specifying its authorization requirements.In this case, we want to ensure that the right would only be grantedto users that have biometric enrollments in the deviceat the moment of the creation of our right.Therefore, we use the biometryCurrentSet requirement.We can then persist the right with the help of the right store,providing a unique identifier.This identifier will be useful the next time we need to fetch the rightin future sessions of our application.Once the right is persisted, we get immediate access to its public keyand can start performing unprotected operations with it,without the need for an explicit authorization.In this example, we are simply exporting its public bytes.Later on, when it's time to perform a signature operation,we can retrieve our right from the storeusing the unique identifier we provided during creation.We can then proceed to authorize the current userthrough the authorize operation on our right.At this point, the system will walk the user through the authentication processand will verify that all the authorization requirements are satisfied.After the right has been authorized, we can use its private keyto perform protected cryptographic operations.In this case, we are using the private key to sign a challengeissued by the backend server of our application.To wrap up, we talked about the relationship that existsbetween the generic concepts of authentication and authorization,and particularly how authentication enables authorization.We went over some of the features offered by the LAContextand how it can be combined with frameworks such as Securityto unlock very powerful and extensible authorization flows.And finally, we looked into how the newly added LARightcould help you streamline the codeto implement certain authorization use cases.We invite you take a look at existing usages of LocalAuthenticationin your app and consider whether some of the features we discussed todaycan help you simplify your codewhile still protecting the privacy and security of your users.Thanks.
