Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop music ♪♪Hi, folks. My name is Pavlo.I work on security technologiesthat help keep you and your users safe.Today I'm going to tell you about some upcoming changesthat may impact the way you develop, test,and deploy your applications.First, I want to tell you what Developer Mode is,the reasoning behind why it was created,the security benefit it brings,and the workflows that it will affect.Then, we will discuss when and howto turn on Developer Mode.And then we will finish off this session with a walk-throughof the tools we built to support automation flowsfor when you're working with many devices,like in a testing lab environment.OK, so what is Developer Mode?It's a new mode in iOS 16 and watchOS 9that enables common developer workflows.Developer Mode is disabled by defaultand requires you to explicitly enroll the deviceinto Developer Mode.Your enrollment persists across reboots and system updates.And of course, we have built toolsthat enable you to automate Developer Mode setupif you want.A natural question you will have is,"Why are we introducing Developer Mode?"The reason is that powerful developer featuresare being abused in targeted attacks.Meanwhile, the vast majority of usersdo not need such functionalityand so they shouldn't be enabled by default.This way we can retain the development capabilitiesthat you rely on and increase the security for userswith mitigations that otherwise would get in your way.Now having said that,most common distribution flows will not require Developer Mode.For example, deploying your application through TestFlightor using Enterprise in-house distributiondoes not require Developer Mode.And of course, distributing your applicationsthrough the App Store does not require Developer Mode.It's only required for when you, the developer,are actively developing your application on your device.All right, by this point I'm sure you can't waituntil I tell you how you would get startedwith using Developer Mode.So let's go through when you need to turn on Developer Modeand how to do it.You should turn Developer Mode on if you need torun and install development signed applications,including applications signed by using a Personal Team;debug and instrument your applications;or you want to use testing automation on your device.Turning on Developer Mode is straightforward,but first you need to connect your device to Xcodefor the Developer Mode menu item to appear.The beta releases that you have downloadedwill have the menu item always visible for the time being.Installing a development-signed application without Xcode,like through Apple Configurator,will also make the menu item visible.Once you've done that, you can find the Developer Mode controlsunder Privacy & Security in Settings.And for automation, you can use the new devmodectlthat ships by default on macOS Ventura,but more on that later.OK, so let's walk throughwith how you would turn on Developer Mode.In front of me, I have an iPhone 13 Prothat I just picked up to run my code on.First, I'm going to plug it in to my Macthat has Xcode already running.As you can see, Xcode recognizes that this devicedoes not have Developer Mode enabledand will prevent me from running this application.But now that I have plugged it in,I can go into Settings, Privacy & Security,Developer Mode.Turning on Developer Mode requires that you reboot your device,so let's go ahead and do that.Once the device has rebooted,you will be prompted once again to confirm your decision.Once you tap Turn On, you will be good to go.Now, Xcode sees that the device has Developer Mode enabled,and I can run my application.While this flow works when you're workingwith a single device,this process can be time consumingif you're dealing with multiple devices.For this reason, we've built toolsthat help you automate this process.Automation flows have one limitation:only devices without a passcodecan have Developer Mode automatically enabled.This is because when you restart your iPhoneyou need to unlock your devicebefore your device can be interacted with.To support automation,macOS Ventura ships with devmodectlthat you can use to either enable Developer Modeon a single device that you have already connected,or in Streaming Mode that will automatically turn onDeveloper Mode on all devices that you plug in.Here I have two devices plugged into my Mac.They don't have passcodes,and I don't want to manually set up Developer Mode on them.So I'm going to run devmodectl with the streaming subcommand.This will automatically reboot the connected devicesand set up Developer Mode.Once Developer Mode has been set up,you will get a notification on the device.And now these devices are good to go.All right, that's all I have for you today.To wrap it up, in iOS 16 and watchOS 9you will have to enable Developer Modeto perform common development activitieslike deploying and debugging your applications.And if you need to automate Developer Mode setup,you can use devmodectl, which ships in macOS Ventura.If you want to learn more about security changesthat may impact your macOS distribution workflows,check out the "What's new in notarization for Mac apps" talk.I hope you have a great rest of your dayand happy coding!♪
