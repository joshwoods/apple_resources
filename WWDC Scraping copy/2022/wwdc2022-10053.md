Search this video…♪ instrumental hip hop music ♪♪Hello. My name is Ashwathand I am an engineer with the Education team.Today I am excited to talk to youabout Sign in with Apple at Work & School.In this presentation, I will be coveringthe key features that we are introducing this fall.I will first walk you throughwhat Sign in with Apple at Work & School is and how it works.Then I will talk about the Roster APIand specifics about how you can make use of it.And finally, I will be talking about access management,where I discuss how IT admins can manage accessto Sign in with Apple at Work & Schooland the Roster API on behalf of their organization.Let me begin by covering two conceptsyou may be familiar with but are important to reviewfor this session.The first is Sign in with Apple.Sign in with Apple is a fast and easy wayfor users to sign in to apps with their Apple ID.Users are able to create an account within your appwith a simple tap.The second concept is Managed Apple IDs.Like Apple IDs, Managed Apple IDsare used to personalize a device.They're also used to access Apple apps and services.Unlike Apple IDs, Managed Apple IDsare owned by an organization and managed throughApple School Manager or Apple Business Manager.With those definitions in mind,I am excited to share that Sign in with Applehas now been extended to support Managed Apple IDs.Now you can get the benefits of a fast and easysign-in experience of Sign in with Apple,but with the management capabilitiesof Managed Apple IDs.To showcase the user experienceof Sign in with Apple at Work & School,let us take a look at an example.Here is the login screen for Slack.To use Sign in with Apple,a user can just tap Continue with Apple.When using an Apple ID, they will then seethis welcome screen for Sign in with Apple.On the other hand, if they are using a Managed Apple ID,they will see the welcome screenfor Sign in with Apple at Work & School.You will notice a difference in the welcome screen.What do we mean when we saywe make it easy for apps to provide access control?Let's take a look at an example.When using their personal Apple IDwith Sign in with Apple,the user sees the account creation screenwhere they may edit their nameand choose whether to share or hide their email.But in an organizational context,it is important for the app to understand who is logging inand what level of access to provide them.In the example shown on this screen,the user is signing in to Slack at work.In order to know which Slack channelsthis employee should be allowed to join,Slack needs to know which user is signing in.So this is an example of Slack providing access controlusing the name and email shared with their appwhen using Sign in with Apple at Work & School.So this is what the user sees, but what does this mean for you?It means when a useruses Sign in with Apple at Work & School,the name and email fields will always be accessible.If you are a developer working on a client-side app,here's a look at some example codeshowing the authorization controller.On a successful authorization, the highlighted statementsindicate the full name and email received by your app.This assumes that the request for authorizationincluded the scopes for the full name and email.If you are a developersupporting Sign in with Apple on the web,here's a look at some example codethat uses the signIn method to start the authorization process.Upon successful authorization,the server returns the response to the data object.That data object looks like this.The highlighted fields contain the emailand full name of the user signing in.It is important to note a few points here.In this release, Sign in with Apple at Work & Schooluses the primary Managed Apple IDthat is signed in on the device.Even though the example screens that we showed youwere for the login flow on the device,the web flow is supported as well.Some accounts may not have email addresses provided.For example, schools may not assign email addressesto younger students.Let's see what the account creation screen looks likein this scenario where an email address is not present.This user, Fatima Silva, does not have an email address,so only their full name is presenton the account creation screen.If you have already implemented Sign in with Apple,there is no work needed from your endto add support for Managed Apple IDs.If you haven't implemented support yet,I would highly suggest taking a lookat the "Get the most out of Sign in with Apple" sessionfrom WWDC2020and the "Enhance your Sign in with Apple experience" sessionfrom this year.That was Sign in with Apple at Work & School,which brings the fast and easy sign-in experienceof Sign in with Apple to Managed Apple IDs.Now let's dive into the Roster API.But before jumping into any specifics,let's consider the following scenario.You're a developer in the education space.Your app is being used by school districts.You have implemented support for Sign in with Apple in your app.That's great!Students, teachers, and staff can use their Managed Apple IDsto log in to your app.In this scenario, your app allows teachersto share assignments and announcementswith their students.To support this, IT administratorsneed to enter students, teachers, and classesinto your app prior to the start of the school year.For a school with hundreds or thousands of students,creating these records by handwould quickly become a time-consumingand tedious process.We've created the Roster API to address this problem.The Roster API provides programmatic accessto resources like users and classesin Apple School Manager.This allows an IT admin to automate the processof importing this information to your app.These resources are defined in the form of REST endpoints.This data can be accessed by your appafter the IT admin has granted permissionthrough a successful OAuth 2.0 authorization.The Administrator and Site Manager accountsin Apple School Managercan manage which apps are able to access the data.As part of this release,we have created a standardized wayfor apps to request access to organizational data.We call this Organizational Data Sharing.We wanted to follow industry standardswhen it comes to UI design patternsand choice of technology so developer adoption is easy.So we created an authorization flow using OAuth 2.0,which includes using scopes and asking the IT adminto consent to sharing their organizational data.Here is what it looks like.The consent screen provides information on which appis requesting access to the organization's dataand what data the app is requesting access to.Looking more closely, the consent screencontains information on the requestor --which represents the app requesting access to the datamade available by Apple School Manager;in this case, the requesting app is Quizzler --and the scopes, which represent the datathat the app will have access to.In this case, once the IT admin consents,Quizzler will be able to accessall user and class information for this organization.What does your implementation journey look like?The first step is to register in the developer portal,which involves requesting scopes.The next step is to request consent from the IT adminto share the data with your appthrough the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.Finally, your app queries the Roster API endpointsto fetch the data.Let us take a look at each of these steps.To request scopes, visit the Developer portal.Under the Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles page,click on Configureunder Account & Organizational Data Sharing.In the next step, click on "Set up a configuration."Choose the primary app ID from the drop-downand hit Continue.In the additional configuration details page,under Organizational Data Sharing Scopes,choose the scopes desired.Right now, we offer two: user access and class access.Ensure return URLs are configured for your app.This step is important as the return URLs will be usedin the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.Hit Continue.Finally, confirm your configuration.Now we're ready for the next step.The second step in the implementation journeyis getting the access token through the OAuth 2.0authorization flow.Let us look at this in detail.The IT admin first logs in to your app.The IT admin then interacts with your appto initiate the authorization flow --for example, by clicking a buttonnamed "Connect to Apple School Manager."This starts a sequence of eventsfollowing the OAuth 2.0 standard.The first step is to execute a GET API callto the authorize endpoint.Let us take a look at the details of this request.The request takes in a few query parameters:the client_id, the redirect_uri,the state, response_type, and scopes.The response will be a redirectto the Apple OAuth consent screento request access from the IT admin.In this diagram, we assume that the IT adminhas authenticated with their Managed Apple ID.If they have not,they would be prompted to authenticate first.The IT admin is presented with the consent screento confirm that they would like to sharetheir organizational data with your app.This is the same consent screen that we saw earlier.As a reminder, it looks like this.Once they click Allow, your app is providedwith an authorization code at your return URLthat you registered in the developer portal.The final step involves a POST request to the token endpointto retrieve your app's access token.Let us see what this request looks like.The request body is composed of standard OAuth parametersincluding the authorization code received on your return URL.The response would have the access token,its expiration, and the refresh tokenthat is used to create a new access token when it expires.Let us take a look at the request detailsto generate a new access token using a refresh token.The request body is composed of the standard OAuth parameters,including the refresh token, and the response would havethe access token and its expiration.After successfully completingthe OAuth 2.0 authorization flow,your app now has the access token,which can be used to fetch user and class informationfrom the Roster API.As part of our current release,we are introducing five endpointsthat the apps can query.These include fetching a list of classes,a list of users, a specific class,a specific user, users in a class.Let's walk through a simple example flowto demonstrate how you can fetch users and classes.Your app server can first retrievethe list of students, teachers, and staffby querying the users endpoint.Let us take a look at the request and response in detail.The users endpoint takes in three query parameters.The pageToken and limit are pagination parameters,and an optional role parameterlets you query for students, instructors, or staff.The request requires the authorization headerwith the access tokengenerated from the authorization flow.The response is a JSON payload that includes a "users" key,which has the list of users;the "nextPageToken" keythat is used to fetch the next set of records,and a "moreToFollow" Boolean key that indicatesif there are any more records to query.Let's take a look at an example request.The API call here is retrieving a list of studentswith a maximum of 10 students in the response.This is the first API request,so the pageToken query parameter is not specified.The response has standard user informationsuch as givenName, familyName, etcetera,but I would like to draw your attentionto the stable unique identifier for the user.This is the same identifier your app receiveswhen the user authenticates with Sign in with Apple.The email address of the userand their roles in the organization are also included.The nextPageToken needs to be usedin the subsequent API request as a query parameterto fetch the next set of students,since the moreToFollow key is set to true.After querying the users endpoint,your app server can now query the classes endpoint,which gives you the list of classesfor that particular school districtand the relationship between the class and the studentsand teachers associated with that class.Let us take a look at the request and response in detail.As part of the get classes request,the request takes in two query parameters:the pageToken and the limit parameter,both of which we saw before.The headers are the same as when querying users.The response is a JSON payloadin which the "classes" key holds the list of classes.Let us take a look at an example request.This request retrieves a list of classeswith a maximum of 200 to be included in the response.The API request also has the pageToken parameter,which means it is in the middle of fetching all classes.The response has standard class informationsuch as the name, the class identifier, etcetera,but I would like to draw your attentionto the list of instructor IDs and student IDsthat belong to the class.That was the Roster API.With these endpoints, your app can nowprogrammatically query users and classesfrom Apple School Manager.Finally, I would like to talk to you about access management.It is vital to provide management capabilitiesto organizations using Organizational Data Sharingand Sign in with Apple at Work & School.Let me explain what this means in more detail.When using Sign in with Apple,users manage their own account and it's solely up to themto decide which apps they choose to sign in to.But when using Sign in with Apple at Work & School,the IT admin at the organization centrally manages accesson behalf of all the users at that organization.This is because the IT admin is responsible for ensuringthe safety and security of the organization's data.So, they must be empowered to manage which appsusers are allowed to use Sign in with Apple at Work & School,and which apps are allowed to use Organizational Data Sharing.These access management capabilities can be configuredin Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager.For Sign in with Apple at Work & School,we offer two modes.The first mode is "Allow all apps."Let us see what this mode looks like.Here, the IT admin is logged in to Apple Business Manager.On selecting Access Management from the sidebarand choosing Sign in with Apple,they are presented with the two modes.The "Allow all apps" mode lets all users of the organizationlog in to all apps that support Sign in with Apple.The second mode is "Allow only certain apps."Let us see what this mode looks like.The "Allow only certain apps" mode lets the IT adminsearch for apps that support Sign in with Appleto add to the list.Users will only be able to use Sign in with Applewith the apps that have been added to the list.If a user tries to log in to an app that is not on the list,they will see an error message.It is important to note that this functionalityis the same for Apple School Manager,Apple Business Manager,and Business Essentials customers.Similar to Sign in with Apple at Work & School,Organizational Data Sharing also has the same two modes.Let's take a look.The "Allow only certain apps" mode lets the IT adminsearch for supported apps to add to the list.It is these apps that can access user and class informationusing the Roster API.In addition to the consent screen,this is a second layer of control for the IT adminto manage which apps can access organizational data.With the release of Sign in with Apple at Work & School,now users in any environment can use an Apple IDor a Managed Apple ID to log in to your app.If you haven't already implemented Sign in with Apple,I encourage you to do so.I would also highly encourage you to adopt the Roster APIif you are in the education space.Implementing support for Roster APIwill provide a seamless onboarding experiencefor IT administrators, staff, teachers, and students.As always, we love hearing from you.So please submit any feedback you may have.If you'd like to learn more, I would highly suggestthe "Get the most out of Sign in with Apple" session from 2020and the "Enhance your Sign in with Apple experience" sessionthis year.Thank you so much for watchingand we hope you enjoy this year's WWDC.♪

♪ instrumental hip hop music ♪♪Hello. My name is Ashwathand I am an engineer with the Education team.

Today I am excited to talk to youabout Sign in with Apple at Work & School.

In this presentation, I will be coveringthe key features that we are introducing this fall.

I will first walk you throughwhat Sign in with Apple at Work & School is and how it works.

Then I will talk about the Roster APIand specifics about how you can make use of it.

And finally, I will be talking about access management,where I discuss how IT admins can manage accessto Sign in with Apple at Work & Schooland the Roster API on behalf of their organization.

Let me begin by covering two conceptsyou may be familiar with but are important to reviewfor this session.

The first is Sign in with Apple.

Sign in with Apple is a fast and easy wayfor users to sign in to apps with their Apple ID.

Users are able to create an account within your appwith a simple tap.

The second concept is Managed Apple IDs.

Like Apple IDs, Managed Apple IDsare used to personalize a device.

They're also used to access Apple apps and services.

Unlike Apple IDs, Managed Apple IDsare owned by an organization and managed throughApple School Manager or Apple Business Manager.

With those definitions in mind,I am excited to share that Sign in with Applehas now been extended to support Managed Apple IDs.

Now you can get the benefits of a fast and easysign-in experience of Sign in with Apple,but with the management capabilitiesof Managed Apple IDs.

To showcase the user experienceof Sign in with Apple at Work & School,let us take a look at an example.

Here is the login screen for Slack.

To use Sign in with Apple,a user can just tap Continue with Apple.

When using an Apple ID, they will then seethis welcome screen for Sign in with Apple.

On the other hand, if they are using a Managed Apple ID,they will see the welcome screenfor Sign in with Apple at Work & School.

You will notice a difference in the welcome screen.

What do we mean when we saywe make it easy for apps to provide access control?Let's take a look at an example.

When using their personal Apple IDwith Sign in with Apple,the user sees the account creation screenwhere they may edit their nameand choose whether to share or hide their email.

But in an organizational context,it is important for the app to understand who is logging inand what level of access to provide them.

In the example shown on this screen,the user is signing in to Slack at work.

In order to know which Slack channelsthis employee should be allowed to join,Slack needs to know which user is signing in.

So this is an example of Slack providing access controlusing the name and email shared with their appwhen using Sign in with Apple at Work & School.

So this is what the user sees, but what does this mean for you?It means when a useruses Sign in with Apple at Work & School,the name and email fields will always be accessible.

If you are a developer working on a client-side app,here's a look at some example codeshowing the authorization controller.

On a successful authorization, the highlighted statementsindicate the full name and email received by your app.

This assumes that the request for authorizationincluded the scopes for the full name and email.

If you are a developersupporting Sign in with Apple on the web,here's a look at some example codethat uses the signIn method to start the authorization process.

Upon successful authorization,the server returns the response to the data object.

That data object looks like this.

The highlighted fields contain the emailand full name of the user signing in.

It is important to note a few points here.

In this release, Sign in with Apple at Work & Schooluses the primary Managed Apple IDthat is signed in on the device.

Even though the example screens that we showed youwere for the login flow on the device,the web flow is supported as well.

Some accounts may not have email addresses provided.

For example, schools may not assign email addressesto younger students.

Let's see what the account creation screen looks likein this scenario where an email address is not present.

This user, Fatima Silva, does not have an email address,so only their full name is presenton the account creation screen.

If you have already implemented Sign in with Apple,there is no work needed from your endto add support for Managed Apple IDs.

If you haven't implemented support yet,I would highly suggest taking a lookat the "Get the most out of Sign in with Apple" sessionfrom WWDC2020and the "Enhance your Sign in with Apple experience" sessionfrom this year.

That was Sign in with Apple at Work & School,which brings the fast and easy sign-in experienceof Sign in with Apple to Managed Apple IDs.

Now let's dive into the Roster API.

Ensure return URLs are configured for your app.

Hit Continue.

Finally, confirm your configuration.

Now we're ready for the next step.

The second step in the implementation journeyis getting the access token through the OAuth 2.0authorization flow.

Let us look at this in detail.

The IT admin first logs in to your app.

The IT admin then interacts with your appto initiate the authorization flow --for example, by clicking a buttonnamed "Connect to Apple School Manager."This starts a sequence of eventsfollowing the OAuth 2.0 standard.

The first step is to execute a GET API callto the authorize endpoint.

Let us take a look at the details of this request.

The request takes in a few query parameters:the client_id, the redirect_uri,the state, response_type, and scopes.

The response will be a redirectto the Apple OAuth consent screento request access from the IT admin.

In this diagram, we assume that the IT adminhas authenticated with their Managed Apple ID.

If they have not,they would be prompted to authenticate first.

The IT admin is presented with the consent screento confirm that they would like to sharetheir organizational data with your app.

This is the same consent screen that we saw earlier.

As a reminder, it looks like this.

Once they click Allow, your app is providedwith an authorization code at your return URLthat you registered in the developer portal.

The final step involves a POST request to the token endpointto retrieve your app's access token.

Let us see what this request looks like.

The request body is composed of standard OAuth parametersincluding the authorization code received on your return URL.

The response would have the access token,its expiration, and the refresh tokenthat is used to create a new access token when it expires.

Let us take a look at the request detailsto generate a new access token using a refresh token.

The request body is composed of the standard OAuth parameters,including the refresh token, and the response would havethe access token and its expiration.

After successfully completingthe OAuth 2.0 authorization flow,your app now has the access token,which can be used to fetch user and class informationfrom the Roster API.

As part of our current release,we are introducing five endpointsthat the apps can query.

These include fetching a list of classes,a list of users, a specific class,a specific user, users in a class.

Let's walk through a simple example flowto demonstrate how you can fetch users and classes.

Your app server can first retrievethe list of students, teachers, and staffby querying the users endpoint.

Let us take a look at the request and response in detail.

The users endpoint takes in three query parameters.

The pageToken and limit are pagination parameters,and an optional role parameterlets you query for students, instructors, or staff.

The request requires the authorization headerwith the access tokengenerated from the authorization flow.

The response is a JSON payload that includes a "users" key,which has the list of users;the "nextPageToken" keythat is used to fetch the next set of records,and a "moreToFollow" Boolean key that indicatesif there are any more records to query.

Let's take a look at an example request.

This is the first API request,so the pageToken query parameter is not specified.

The response has standard user informationsuch as givenName, familyName, etcetera,but I would like to draw your attentionto the stable unique identifier for the user.

This is the same identifier your app receiveswhen the user authenticates with Sign in with Apple.

The email address of the userand their roles in the organization are also included.

The nextPageToken needs to be usedin the subsequent API request as a query parameterto fetch the next set of students,since the moreToFollow key is set to true.

After querying the users endpoint,your app server can now query the classes endpoint,which gives you the list of classesfor that particular school districtand the relationship between the class and the studentsand teachers associated with that class.

Let us take a look at the request and response in detail.

As part of the get classes request,the request takes in two query parameters:the pageToken and the limit parameter,both of which we saw before.

The headers are the same as when querying users.

The response is a JSON payloadin which the "classes" key holds the list of classes.

Let us take a look at an example request.

This request retrieves a list of classeswith a maximum of 200 to be included in the response.

The API request also has the pageToken parameter,which means it is in the middle of fetching all classes.

The response has standard class informationsuch as the name, the class identifier, etcetera,but I would like to draw your attentionto the list of instructor IDs and student IDsthat belong to the class.

That was the Roster API.

With these endpoints, your app can nowprogrammatically query users and classesfrom Apple School Manager.

Finally, I would like to talk to you about access management.

It is vital to provide management capabilitiesto organizations using Organizational Data Sharingand Sign in with Apple at Work & School.

Let me explain what this means in more detail.

When using Sign in with Apple,users manage their own account and it's solely up to themto decide which apps they choose to sign in to.

But when using Sign in with Apple at Work & School,the IT admin at the organization centrally manages accesson behalf of all the users at that organization.

This is because the IT admin is responsible for ensuringthe safety and security of the organization's data.

So, they must be empowered to manage which appsusers are allowed to use Sign in with Apple at Work & School,and which apps are allowed to use Organizational Data Sharing.

These access management capabilities can be configuredin Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager.

For Sign in with Apple at Work & School,we offer two modes.

The first mode is "Allow all apps."Let us see what this mode looks like.

Here, the IT admin is logged in to Apple Business Manager.

On selecting Access Management from the sidebarand choosing Sign in with Apple,they are presented with the two modes.

The "Allow all apps" mode lets all users of the organizationlog in to all apps that support Sign in with Apple.

The second mode is "Allow only certain apps."Let us see what this mode looks like.

The "Allow only certain apps" mode lets the IT adminsearch for apps that support Sign in with Appleto add to the list.

Users will only be able to use Sign in with Applewith the apps that have been added to the list.

If a user tries to log in to an app that is not on the list,they will see an error message.

It is important to note that this functionalityis the same for Apple School Manager,Apple Business Manager,and Business Essentials customers.

Similar to Sign in with Apple at Work & School,Organizational Data Sharing also has the same two modes.

Let's take a look.

The "Allow only certain apps" mode lets the IT adminsearch for supported apps to add to the list.

It is these apps that can access user and class informationusing the Roster API.

In addition to the consent screen,this is a second layer of control for the IT adminto manage which apps can access organizational data.

With the release of Sign in with Apple at Work & School,now users in any environment can use an Apple IDor a Managed Apple ID to log in to your app.

If you haven't already implemented Sign in with Apple,I encourage you to do so.

I would also highly encourage you to adopt the Roster APIif you are in the education space.

Implementing support for Roster APIwill provide a seamless onboarding experiencefor IT administrators, staff, teachers, and students.

As always, we love hearing from you.

So please submit any feedback you may have.

If you'd like to learn more, I would highly suggestthe "Get the most out of Sign in with Apple" session from 2020and the "Enhance your Sign in with Apple experience" sessionthis year.

Thank you so much for watchingand we hope you enjoy this year's WWDC.
