Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop music ♪♪Hi, there!I'm Paul, and I work on the SF Symbols app.Today, we're going to talk abouta brand-new feature of SF Symbols: Variable Color.We'll be going over how to bring symbols with Variable Colorinto your projects, and how the SF Symbols appcan help you with every step along the way.First, we'll take a look at Variable Colorin system-provided SF Symbols.We'll go over how it works and when to use it.Then, we'll go over how to bring Variable Colorinto your own custom symbols.Before we get started, if this is your first timeusing SF Symbols, or if you just want a refresher,I recommend you watch last year's session,"Explore the SF Symbols 3 app," to find out more abouthow to find and organize symbols for your projects.And if you haven't yet, check out Thalia's talk,"What's new in SF Symbols 4," for an overviewof the visual design of SF Symbolsand the different rendering modes we'll be showing today.Now, let's talk about Variable Color.Variable Color is a new feature of SF Symbols that allows youto affect the appearance of a symbol using a percentage value.By changing this percentage value,you can easily create symbols that reflect valuesthat can change over time, like signal strength or progress.I think the best way to see how Variable Color worksis to jump into the SF Symbols appand let the system speak for itself.This year in the SF Symbols app,we added a new preview area here in the rendering inspectorthat allows you to see a symbol in every rendering modeat a glance.You can also click on the different representationsto switch between rendering modes.There's also a new Automatic option here in the picker.This option allows each symbolto choose its own preferred rendering mode,which you can see selected in the preview area here.For example, this square.and.arrow.up symbolprefers Monochrome, while these iPhone symbolsprefer Hierarchical.Below the color controls, you'll find a new setof controls for Variable Color.And there's a new categoryfor symbols that support Variable Color,which is a great place to start experimenting.Let's select this speaker symbol, switch to Multicolor,and switch to the gallery view to get a closer look.I'll start by clicking this buttonto turn Variable Color on, and pull the sliderall the way down to decrease the percentage we're using.You can see pieces of the symbol dimmingas the percentage value decreases.And as I pull the slider back up,those pieces of the symbol regain all of their color.If you keep an eye on the preview area,you can see this happening in all four rendering modes.And if I switch back to grid view,you can see all of the symbols in the Variable categoryare reacting to the changes.So what did we just learn about Variable Color?First off, Variable Color can be usedwith every single rendering mode available for SF Symbols.Every system symbol that supports Variable Colorsupports it in Monochrome, Hierarchical, Palette,and Multicolor modes.Second, there are no rules for how many parts of a symbolcan be affected by Variable Color.Some symbols only have one layer that's affected;some have dozens.Regardless, because Variable Coloris controlled using percentages,you don't need to worry about this.Just pass in a percentage and you're good to go.So how does the system interpret those percentages?How do we know when a particular layeris going to have Variable Color applied?Well, like the rest of SF Symbols,we designed Variable Color to make your appsfeel right at home on Apple platforms.And that means that we took inspiration from the behaviorof system-level indicators that you might be familiar with.Let's look at this microphone symbol as an example.The four dots on the left side of the microphone are eachin a separate layer that participates in Variable Color.So, each dot will activate when the percentage valuecrosses a certain threshold.Those thresholds are spaced out evenlybetween zero and 100 percent.Zero percent is a special case where no layers will be active.Any value greater than zero percentwill activate the first dot.At 26 percent and greater,the second dot will also be activated.Fifty-one percent and greater will activate the third dot.And 76 up through 100 percent will activate all four dots.So, Variable Color symbols will only appearvisually empty at exactly zero percent.You can see this behavior in system-level indicatorslike Wi-Fi strength and battery level.Variable Color symbols will start appearing visually fullat a value less than 100 percent.You can see this behavior in system-level indicatorslike brightness and volume.Now, this next symbol has three layers that use Variable Color,which means that the thresholds between layers might fallat awkward values like 33.3333 and 66.6667 percent.We didn't want rounding errors to make symbols appear inunexpected ways, and we didn't want you to have to worry abouthow many significant digits you typed into your code.So, thresholds between layersare rounded to the nearest percentage point,and we don't activate the next layeruntil you're one full percentage point above that rounded value.So, for the first threshold, 33.3 percent rounds downto 33 percent, so the second layeractivates one percentage point higher at 34 percent.The final threshold rounds from 66.7 percent up to 67 percent,so the last layer activates at one percentage pointhigher than that, at 68 percent.Of course, system-provided symbolsare only one half of the story.With the SF Symbols app, you can make and annotateyour own custom symbols, and even better,you can make your custom symbols just as flexibleand just as powerful as symbols provided by the system.What do I mean by flexible and powerful?Well, system-provided SF Symbols are availablein nine different weights, and each one of those nine weightsis available at three different scales.Each one of those 27 variants is availablein four rendering modes with and without Variable Color.That's 216 possible configurations.Luckily, that doesn't mean that you need to drawyour custom symbols 216 times.Last year, to streamline the process of drawing symbols,we introduced variable templates.When using this kind of template,instead of drawing 27 different combinations of weightsand scales, you only need to draw three,and the system can generate the other 24 for you automatically.After you've drawn your custom symbol,you can adopt different rendering modesthrough a process we call "annotation."Last year, if you wanted your symbol to adoptthe Hierarchical and Palette rendering modes,you broke your custom symbol into different layersand assigned each layer a hierarchy level.If you wanted your symbol to adoptthe multicolor rendering mode, you broke your custom symbolinto different layers again and assigned a color to each layer.This meant that, to support all the available rendering modes,you had to manage two separate layer structures.This year, we're streamlining that workflowwith unified annotation.Unified annotation uses a single-layer structurefor a symbol, and shares that structureacross all rendering modes.So, instead of having to break your symbol into layersmultiple times, you only need to do it once.You now also have control over how your symbol will lookin Monochrome rendering mode,in addition to the previous control you hadover Hierarchical, Palette, and Multicolor.And of course, unified annotation allows youto add Variable Color to your symbols.So let's work on annotating a custom symbolto get to know unified annotation.Last year, I was working on an appso my family could play card games together,even when we couldn't be in the same room.A few months after that, I discovered a new obsession:puzzle cubes!So this year, I want to make an appthat's going to help me practice solving mine.I've got a custom puzzle cube symbolthat I've made here on my desktop.I'll drag it into the app to make a new custom symbol.I based this symbol off of the system-provided cube symbol,and notice how I've left some of the detailsof the puzzle cube out.This helps the symbol come across clearly,even at small sizes and different weights.Now, remember this preview area from before?It's especially handy when annotating custom symbols.As I make changes to the annotation,I can see how my custom symbol looksin all the different rendering modes at a glance.And when I switch rendering modes by clicking hereor picking a different option in the picker,the annotation controls in the list change accordingly.Monochrome looks pretty good,but let's add some depth in Hierarchical mode.I'll switch to that mode and pull the topand the side of the cube into new layers.You can see that these new layersautomatically get switchedto the less-prominent secondary and tertiary levels.This gives my symbol a little bit more depthand visual interest.And remember that the Hierarchical annotationthat we create is also used to support Palette rendering mode.So I've just gotten two new rendering modesfor the price of one.Now, let's switch over to Multicolor modeto give this symbol some color.Notice that when I switch to Multicolor mode,I still see the same layers that I separated outin Hierarchical mode.Remember, in unified annotation,changes made to the layer structure in one rendering modewill carry through to all the others.Let's make the front face red, the top face blue,and the side face yellow.All right, this looks pretty great.But the most important part of learning to solve a puzzle cubeis practice, practice, and more practice.So, I would love to use my cube symbol as a timer,and have it fill up with color as I spend more time practicing.The solution for that is Variable Color.These separate pieces in the front facelook like a great place to add some variable colorfor our timer.Let's separate out each of these piecesinto a different layer.Notice the order that I'm arranging thesein the layer list.The layers that I want to fill in first go on the bottom,and the layers I want to fill in last go on top.Then, we'll select all of these layers and click on this button,which will enable Variable Color on all of them.And that's it!Let's move the Variable Color slider aroundto see what happens.Remember to keep an eye on the preview areato see what's happening in all the different rendering modes.You can see that,as we change the percentage used in Variable Color,the front face adjusts its color in every rendering mode.That's the power of unified annotation.Because edits in one rendering modecan carry through to other rendering modes.In many cases, you only need to do work once or twiceto get great results in all four rendering modes.And in situations where things are a bit trickier,the SF Symbols app still has you covered.Let's look at a more complicated symbol.Here's my cube symbol again, but this time,it's set inside of a circle,like many of the .circle.fill symbols in the system library.Now, I've already started annotating this symbol.You can see here that I've separated the circleand the parts of the cube into different layers.My symbol looks great in Multicolorand Hierarchical modes,but in Monochrome, there's not much contrastbetween the cube and the circle behind it.When all the paths in the symbol were in one layer,the cube paths created holes in the circle path,which looked great in Monochrome.But now that I've moved the circle onto its own layer,the cube paths no longer create holes.Instead, they create a solid cube on top of a solid circle.So we can't see it very well.Luckily, there's a new feature of unified annotationthat can help us here.We can choose Eraseto make a layer create a hole in the layers behind it.That's looking much better.Now, let's add Variable Color again.This time, I'll just select all of the pieces of the front faceand choose Split into New Layersfrom the contextual menu.Then I'll use this button to turn on Variable Color again.And I'm done!And by the way, the paths are split upusing the order that they appear in your symbol template,so if you pay attention to the order of your symbol's pathsas you're drawing, you can save some time later.So that is unified annotation in a nutshell.It's a fast and powerful way to annotate your custom symbols.You create one layer structurethat applies across all rendering modes.You can now control the appearance of your symbolin Monochrome rendering mode.You can add Variable Color to individual layersin your symbol.The z-order of the layers determines the orderthat they will fill in as the passed-in percentage increases,and the thresholds used for each layer are spaced evenlybetween zero and 100 percent.And because it's part of the layer structure,when a layer opts in to Variable Color,this setting is shared across all rendering modes.And there are two new layer options in unified annotationthat make it easier to work with the new shared layer structure.Setting a layer to Erase will use that layer's shapeto erase layers behind it.This is really useful in situations like Monochromeand Hierarchical symbols that have badges with a plus,a minus, or some other shape inside of them.And finally, setting a layer to Hidden will exclude itfrom a particular rendering mode.If you're in a situation where a layer truly can't be usedacross all the rendering modes, you can use this optionto only apply that layer to certain modes.All of these new featuresare supported by a new template format, 4.0.When you're exporting a symbol from the SF Symbols appto import into Xcode, make sure that you export a 4.0 templateto control Monochrome rendering and use Variable Color.If you already have custom symbolsthat you annotated last year, they will be automaticallyupdated to use unified annotation.Your Hierarchical and Multicolor annotations will be brought inwith no extra work required from you.And, if you need to support earlier platforms,the previous 3.0 and 2.0 formats are still available for use.Before we wrap up, there's one more thing I want to do.I've had a lot of fun learning about how to solve puzzle cubes,but the best part so far is that my daughtersaw me solving them and wanted to learn too.So naturally, I also want her to be able to use my appto help her practice.Now, she's starting kindergarten this fall,so we're going to start her off a little slower.But this is where symbols with Variable Color truly shine.We could design our timer UI like this.Text and numbers are descriptive and helpful,but they could be intimidating for someone like herwho's still learning or is unable to read the text.But seeing a puzzle cube that looks just like the oneshe's holding, and seeing it fill upwith color as time passes, is friendly and intuitive.I don't even need to change my timer code;all I need to do is change the name of the symbol I'm usingand keep passing in the same percentage values I usedfor my bigger cube symbol,and SF Symbols takes care of the rest.And that's the power of symbols.They allow us to convey ideas in a waythat transcends language and text.They give us a way to make our apps more inclusive.And Variable Color in both system-provided symbolsand your custom symbols gives us even more expressive powerfor concepts like progress, signal strength, and time.All of that from three drawingsand one unified annotation.That's pretty amazing.And, I might add, it's way easierthan solving a puzzle cube.♪

♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop music ♪♪Hi, there!I'm Paul, and I work on the SF Symbols app.

Today, we're going to talk abouta brand-new feature of SF Symbols: Variable Color.

We'll be going over how to bring symbols with Variable Colorinto your projects, and how the SF Symbols appcan help you with every step along the way.

First, we'll take a look at Variable Colorin system-provided SF Symbols.

We'll go over how it works and when to use it.

Then, we'll go over how to bring Variable Colorinto your own custom symbols.

Before we get started, if this is your first timeusing SF Symbols, or if you just want a refresher,I recommend you watch last year's session,"Explore the SF Symbols 3 app," to find out more abouthow to find and organize symbols for your projects.

And if you haven't yet, check out Thalia's talk,"What's new in SF Symbols 4," for an overviewof the visual design of SF Symbolsand the different rendering modes we'll be showing today.

Now, let's talk about Variable Color.

Variable Color is a new feature of SF Symbols that allows youto affect the appearance of a symbol using a percentage value.

By changing this percentage value,you can easily create symbols that reflect valuesthat can change over time, like signal strength or progress.

I think the best way to see how Variable Color worksis to jump into the SF Symbols appand let the system speak for itself.

You can also click on the different representationsto switch between rendering modes.

There's also a new Automatic option here in the picker.

This option allows each symbolto choose its own preferred rendering mode,which you can see selected in the preview area here.

For example, this square.and.arrow.up symbolprefers Monochrome, while these iPhone symbolsprefer Hierarchical.

Below the color controls, you'll find a new setof controls for Variable Color.

And there's a new categoryfor symbols that support Variable Color,which is a great place to start experimenting.

Let's select this speaker symbol, switch to Multicolor,and switch to the gallery view to get a closer look.

I'll start by clicking this buttonto turn Variable Color on, and pull the sliderall the way down to decrease the percentage we're using.

You can see pieces of the symbol dimmingas the percentage value decreases.

And as I pull the slider back up,those pieces of the symbol regain all of their color.

If you keep an eye on the preview area,you can see this happening in all four rendering modes.

And if I switch back to grid view,you can see all of the symbols in the Variable categoryare reacting to the changes.

So what did we just learn about Variable Color?First off, Variable Color can be usedwith every single rendering mode available for SF Symbols.

Those thresholds are spaced out evenlybetween zero and 100 percent.

Zero percent is a special case where no layers will be active.

Any value greater than zero percentwill activate the first dot.

At 26 percent and greater,the second dot will also be activated.

Fifty-one percent and greater will activate the third dot.

And 76 up through 100 percent will activate all four dots.

So, Variable Color symbols will only appearvisually empty at exactly zero percent.

You can see this behavior in system-level indicatorslike Wi-Fi strength and battery level.

Variable Color symbols will start appearing visually fullat a value less than 100 percent.

You can see this behavior in system-level indicatorslike brightness and volume.

Now, this next symbol has three layers that use Variable Color,which means that the thresholds between layers might fallat awkward values like 33.3333 and 66.6667 percent.

And remember that the Hierarchical annotationthat we create is also used to support Palette rendering mode.

So I've just gotten two new rendering modesfor the price of one.

Now, let's switch over to Multicolor modeto give this symbol some color.

Notice that when I switch to Multicolor mode,I still see the same layers that I separated outin Hierarchical mode.

Remember, in unified annotation,changes made to the layer structure in one rendering modewill carry through to all the others.

Let's make the front face red, the top face blue,and the side face yellow.

All right, this looks pretty great.

But the most important part of learning to solve a puzzle cubeis practice, practice, and more practice.

So, I would love to use my cube symbol as a timer,and have it fill up with color as I spend more time practicing.

The solution for that is Variable Color.

These separate pieces in the front facelook like a great place to add some variable colorfor our timer.

Let's separate out each of these piecesinto a different layer.

Notice the order that I'm arranging thesein the layer list.

The layers that I want to fill in first go on the bottom,and the layers I want to fill in last go on top.

Then, we'll select all of these layers and click on this button,which will enable Variable Color on all of them.

When all the paths in the symbol were in one layer,the cube paths created holes in the circle path,which looked great in Monochrome.

But now that I've moved the circle onto its own layer,the cube paths no longer create holes.

Instead, they create a solid cube on top of a solid circle.

So we can't see it very well.

Luckily, there's a new feature of unified annotationthat can help us here.

We can choose Eraseto make a layer create a hole in the layers behind it.

That's looking much better.

Now, let's add Variable Color again.

This time, I'll just select all of the pieces of the front faceand choose Split into New Layersfrom the contextual menu.

So that is unified annotation in a nutshell.

It's a fast and powerful way to annotate your custom symbols.

You create one layer structurethat applies across all rendering modes.

You can add Variable Color to individual layersin your symbol.

The z-order of the layers determines the orderthat they will fill in as the passed-in percentage increases,and the thresholds used for each layer are spaced evenlybetween zero and 100 percent.

When you're exporting a symbol from the SF Symbols appto import into Xcode, make sure that you export a 4.0 templateto control Monochrome rendering and use Variable Color.

If you already have custom symbolsthat you annotated last year, they will be automaticallyupdated to use unified annotation.

Your Hierarchical and Multicolor annotations will be brought inwith no extra work required from you.

And, if you need to support earlier platforms,the previous 3.0 and 2.0 formats are still available for use.

Before we wrap up, there's one more thing I want to do.

I've had a lot of fun learning about how to solve puzzle cubes,but the best part so far is that my daughtersaw me solving them and wanted to learn too.

So naturally, I also want her to be able to use my appto help her practice.

Now, she's starting kindergarten this fall,so we're going to start her off a little slower.

But this is where symbols with Variable Color truly shine.

We could design our timer UI like this.

Text and numbers are descriptive and helpful,but they could be intimidating for someone like herwho's still learning or is unable to read the text.

But seeing a puzzle cube that looks just like the oneshe's holding, and seeing it fill upwith color as time passes, is friendly and intuitive.

I don't even need to change my timer code;all I need to do is change the name of the symbol I'm usingand keep passing in the same percentage values I usedfor my bigger cube symbol,and SF Symbols takes care of the rest.

And that's the power of symbols.

They allow us to convey ideas in a waythat transcends language and text.

They give us a way to make our apps more inclusive.

And Variable Color in both system-provided symbolsand your custom symbols gives us even more expressive powerfor concepts like progress, signal strength, and time.

All of that from three drawingsand one unified annotation.

That's pretty amazing.

And, I might add, it's way easierthan solving a puzzle cube.
