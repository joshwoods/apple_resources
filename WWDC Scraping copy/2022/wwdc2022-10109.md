All About Notarization

Search this video…♪ Mellow instrumental hip-hop music ♪♪Hello, my name is Johnathan.macOS developers submit software to the notary servicein order to help protect their customersfrom malicious software.Last year we introduced a faster and simpler wayto submit apps for notarization with the notarytool CLIor command-line interface.This year we are excited to continue championing performanceand flexibility with some major improvementsfor your interactions with the notary service.In this session, we'll be talking about three main topics.First, we'll go through important deadlinesfor the migration from using altool for notarizationto using notarytool.Next, we'll discuss improvements to the Xcode integrationwith the upcoming Xcode 14,bringing the submission speed of notarytool to Xcode.And finally, we'll talk about a flexible new wayto interact with the notary service,a REST API, letting you expand the places you can upload,check the status of, and review submissions.Last year we introduced notarytool,a replacement for altool for notarization.Later in this talk, I'll be discussing Xcodemoving to our updated backend with Xcode 14.With migration paths in place for notarizationvia altool and Xcode 13,we're announcing the sunset date for notarizationwith these older methods to be fall of 2023.For help moving from altool to notarytool,please refer to last year’s presentation"Faster and simpler notarization for Mac apps."To highlight some specifics, the notarytool CLIwill continue to work past the fall 2023 deadline,including the one bundled in Xcode 13.As always, however, we do encourage youto update to receive the latest improvements and fixes.Uploads to the notary service using the Xcode 13 UIwill stop working after that deadline.Stay tuned to hear about some performance improvementsin Xcode 14, but largely you can expectyour workflow to remain unchanged.Finally, notarization with all forms of altoolwill stop working in fall 2023.Again, please refer to last year's WWDC presentationfor details on migrating to notarytool.Next, we'll touch on changes to notarization in Xcode 14.We've migrated the notarization supportbuilt into Xcode to use the same reliable backendas the notarytool CLI we introduced last year.Because of this, we're happy to bring the sameroughly 4x performance increase we announced last yearfor notarytool to Xcode 14.The best part is that, besides updating,you don't need to change your project settings or workflowsto receive this performance boost.For the final topic of this presentation,we're excited to announce a new service,a REST API for notary.This new service allows you to interact more flexiblywith the notary service in even more places.To go over some important concepts,this new API is intended to allowfor a more flexible interface to the notary service.As a JSON-based web service,integration should be fairly simple in most languages.This API allows you to upload submissionsfrom any place with an internet connection,including continuous integration servers --places where you might not be running macOS today.Additionally, other interactions with the notary serviceare also supported in this API,such as retrieving your submission historyor past submission details.Our goal with introducing the REST APIis to support submitting software for notarizationfrom more platforms and to allow for easier interactionswith notary in automated systems.This complements the current methods of submission,Xcode and notarytool, where those can't be run today,such as a Linux-based continuous integration.For example, imagine you want your deployment pipelineto submit your application to notaryprior to distribution.With this new API and some basic scripts,you can easily automate the process.Before I dive in,one important topic is authentication.You can authenticate with the API using JSON Web Tokens,or JWTs, just like other App Store Connect APIs.For more details on authenticationor the code I'm about to show,please visit the REST API documentation linked below.In these snippets, I'll assume you have a valid JWTpassed into the functions as the token variable.Let's walk through an example of submitting filesto notary in Python.This same basic flow is applicablein other programming languages.There are two major steps for uploading files to notary.The first step is to inform notarythat you wish to upload a file.Included in this is some basic information about the filelike name and SHA-256.The response contains information necessaryto upload the file and an ID to track your submissionthrough our pipeline.The second step actually uploads the file for notarizationvia Amazon S3.You'll need to grab your favorite S3 SDK.For this example,I'm going to be using the boto3 library.Here we use the temporary credentialsreturned in the previous callto authenticate and create a client.We then use the client to upload the file to the bucketand object specified in the first step's response.Once uploaded, the submission will proceedthough the notarization pipeline.This process should complete in under 15 minutesfor most submissions.After upload, you should confirm the notary servicehas successfully processed your submissionprior to distribution.There are, broadly speaking, two approaches to this.The first, and the simplest,is checking the result through the same API.The other option is via the webhook supportintroduced with notarytool.First, let's look at the API approach.Checking the status of a submission to notaryis pretty straightforward,You can make a request with the submission IDreceived during the upload processPart of the response is the current statusof the submission, which will remain "In Progress"until notary is finished processing it.The status will then transition to the final stateof your submission, such as Accepted or Invalid.Once the submission is complete,you can then use the APIto retrieve the notarization log for this upload.Please refer to the Notary REST API documentationfor more details on these endpoints.Next, we'll talk about the second approachto getting your status: a webhook.In the webhook workflow, the process is largely the same,but this time you'll provide a webhook URLin the initial request to upload.Details on the format can be found in the documentationfor the notary REST API.As before, this will trigger the notary serviceto analyze your submission.As the automated analysis concludes, tickets are created,and the final status is saved.Once complete, the notary service will call outto the webhook URL provided.The contents of this call include the submission ID,the team ID, and a signature to verify it came from us.On receiving that notification, you can choose what to do next.For example, you might notify the original submitteror begin an automated distribution pipeline.Compared to waiting with notarytool,this allows you to decouple the system that uploads the filefrom the system that automates actions after notarization.We're excited to see this new REST API open the doorsto more integrations with continuous integration systemsand other tools to build software for macOS.To wrap up, as one more reminder,the deadline to migrate to using Xcode 14, notarytool,or the REST API directly is fall of 2023.Finally, if you haven't yet been able to use notarytoolin your deployment pipelines,this is your chance to jumpstart your automationby trying the notary REST API today.You can find a link to the documentation below.Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the rest of WWDC22♪
