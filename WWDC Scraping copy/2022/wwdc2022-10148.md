focuson the fundamentals of using Apple Music API.In this session, I’ll provide an overview of MusicKit client frameworksand how they integrate with the Apple Music API web service.I'll explain how to get access as a developer and specific detailsabout using Apple Music API, including:Requesting content and resources,using limits and pagination to work with large resource collections,and how to find content in the catalog with the search endpoint.Finally, I'll provide a look at some personalized features availablefor Apple Music subscribers and how to provide access to them in your apps.I'll start with a brief introduction to MusicKit and Apple Music API.MusicKit was first announced at WWDC in 2017.Since then, we have made improvements that make integratingwith Apple Music easier and continueto add support for additional functionality.MusicKit is a combination of client frameworksand the Apple Music API.Used together, they make it possible to addApple Music functionality to your apps.You can discover and fetch content from Apple Music,including artists, albums, playlists, and more,with functionality to search the catalog and browse popularity charts.With the user’s consent, MusicKit and Apple Music API let youauthenticate subscribers to play available contentand provide access to personalized features,including their music library, recommendations,and recently played history.MusicKit client frameworks provide the APIs neededto authenticate subscribersand start and control playback on a device.Client frameworks are available for apps on Apple platforms,web applications using JavaScript,and Android applications using the available SDK.MusicKit on Apple platforms has everything you needto integrate Apple Music into your apps.Subscribers can authenticate or sign up within your appto start and control playback and access other personalized features.Available APIs accelerate calls to discover and access contentfrom Apple Music with native support for resources and pagination.Many of the topics covered later about accessing and making requeststo Apple Music API directly are handled by MusicKiton Apple platforms automatically.Developers writing apps for Apple platforms are encouragedto watch the session "Meet MusicKit for Swift"for an introduction to those APIsand the session "Explore more content with MusicKit"for more functionality.MusicKit on the Web makes it easy to bring Apple Musicto your applications using JavaScript.You can discover Apple Music content,let subscribers sign in to access personalized featuresand play content directly on your website.Full access to Apple Music API gives you the powerto create unique music experiences.MusicKit provides a collection of built-in web components,including a full-featured media player.These components make it easy to get startedand have the flexibility to customize for your experience.MusicKit for Android lets you integrate Apple Musicinto your Android applications.Support for authenticating Apple Music subscribers,controlling content playback,and full access to Apple Music API allows you to build a rich music experience.Apple Music API is the common JSON web service that provides accessto discovery features and Apple Music catalog content.Authenticated subscribers can access personalized features,including their Music Library, Recommendations,and Recently Played history.Next, I'll explain how to get access.To make requests to Apple Music API, you will need a Developer Token.For applications on Apple platforms,you can take advantage of automatic token managementby enabling the MusicKit service for your app.This service can be found in the App ID sectionof the Apple Developer portal shown here.For applications on other platforms,you can obtain a Developer Token by enrolling as a MusicKit developeron the Apple Developer portal.From there, you can request and download a private key.You will need to generate a JSON Web Token and sign itwith your downloaded private key.A JSON Web Token is split in two parts.The first part is required headers,including the signing algorithm "alg," which must be ES256,and the key identifier "kid,"which is included as part of your private key download.The second part of the token is claims.Apple Music API has three required claims:issuer ID “iss,”which is your team ID that can be found in the memberships sectionof the Apple Developer portal,issued at time "iat,"which is represented by the number of seconds since the Epoch,and an expiration time "exp."This is in the same time format as the issued time.Tokens can be generated to expire a maximum of six monthsfrom when they were issued.For web applications, we encourage providing an origin claim,which will issue a token valid for your website only.A valid, signed token must be suppliedin the authorization header for all requests to Apple Music API.With the MusicKit service enabled for your applications on Apple platforms,this will be done automatically.MusicKit on the web must be configured with a token you generateto make requests to Apple Music API.More information about generating JSON Web Tokens can be foundin the Apple Music API documentation.Now I will show you how to request resources using Apple Music API.Resources model Apple Music content,such as artists, albums, songs, playlists and more.Each has its own corresponding type.Resources can be fetched from Apple Music API endpointsthrough discovery features like search or by using their identifiers.Here is an example request URL to fetch a playlist resourcefrom the API using its identifier.Apple Music API is hosted at api.music.apple.com.The path of the URL uses a RESTful patternand represents the location for a resource or feature.The first element in the location is the version of the API,which is currently version 1.New versions may become available when significant changes are introduced.Versions maintain backwards compatibility with existing calls,even as enhancements to resources and new features are made available.For requests within the Apple Music catalog,the next section in the locationrepresents the specific catalog to fetch from.Apple Music is a worldwide streaming service,and content can differ between regions, which we refer to as storefronts.For information about storefronts and content availability,watch the session titled "Cross reference content with the Apple Music API."In this example, I will fetch a playlist from the catalogin the United States storefront,denoted by the two-letter country code “us.”The final part of this location is the resource’s identity,represented by its type "playlists" followed by its identifier.Since Apple Music is available in many regions,support for localization is possibleusing the optional language tag query parameter "L."Here, I am specifying the language tag "en-US" for English.To fetch content localized in Spanish, I could specify the tag “es-MX.”To keep things simple,I will not specify a language tag in these examples,which results in the storefront’s default localization.The storefronts that Apple Music is available inand their supported localizationscan be found by accessing the storefronts reference endpoint.More detail can be found in the Apple Music API documentation.Here's a look at making a GET request for a playlist.This returns a resource collection responsewith a "data" array containing the playlist resource.Resource objects indicate the identity of the content with an ID value and type.The combination of ID and type represent the unique identity of a resource.The href value indicates the location in the API where the resource may be fetched.In this case, note the location is the same as the path we requested.The metadata values for the content are found in the resource's attributes map.Direct connections to other resources, such as this playlist curator and tracks,are found in the relationships map.Here is a closer look at the attributes map,which contains the metadata values for the playlist.I'll walk through an example of using some of these attributesin the widget on the right,which uses the playlist's name, curator name, and description attributes.playParams is a common attribute on many resource typesthat indicates when the content is available to stream for subscribers.This can be used to determine if play control should be enabled,as content without playParams is not available for playback.Artwork is another common attribute for many resource typesthat contains values for the maximum width and height for the image,alongside a url where the image can be loaded from.At Apple, developer feedback is very importantand helps us improve our APIs and services for everyone.This year, we're happy to announce the additionof one of our most requested features.Artist artwork is now available in Apple Music API,making plain silhouettes a thing of the past.All new and existing apps can add support for these imagesby looking for the artwork attribute added to artist resources.Artist artwork can be loaded the same way as artwork for other content types.Here is an abbreviated example of an artwork url for the playlistwe were looking at earlier.Artwork urls contain "w," width and "h," height tokens, highlighted in blue.To load artwork using this URL, replace these tokenswith the desired resolution for your display.Since playlist artwork is square, I will use the same resolutionfor both width and height.Here is an example of requesting a resolution of 400 by 400,at 300 by 300, and at 200 by 200.The images scale for display at each resolution,and the file sizes are reduced for smaller images.All resource types have a set of default attributesthat represent the common or basic metadata for that resource.Some resources have additional attributes that may be fetched,known as "extended attributes."These extended attributes can be requested by using the extend query parameter.For instance, tracks on Apple Music playlistsare either songs or music videos.If you'd like to know the types of tracks a playlist contains,you can request the trackTypes extended attribute.Extended attributes appear in the resource’s attributes mapalongside their default attributes.If a playlist's tracks are music videos rather than songs,perhaps you would customize the play button to inform the viewer.Taking a look now at the relationships map shows a coupleof direct connections from this playlist to other resources.Many resources have automatic relationshipsthat will be returned when requesting some content directly.The automatic relationships for a playlist are its curator and tracks.Relationships are named to indicate what the connection is,such as the curator for this playlist.They have an href location where the relationship may be fetched directlyand a data array for the related resource collection.For playlists, the curator relationship is automatically related,meaning only the identity of the related resources will be present.This allows for easily linking to this resource using its identity or href.Since a playlist already contains the curator's name as an attribute,there may be no need to include other metadatafor the related curator resource.The identity of the resource could be used to make the curator name a link,letting people navigate to the curator to discover additional content if they wish.If you want to show additional information for the curator with the playlist,such as its artwork, you will need to fetch the curator's metadata.Use the include parameter to specify the relationshipsyou want related resource metadata for.Some resource types have additional relationships not includedby default that can also be requested with this parameter.Note that including relationships can increase the size of responsesand negatively impact the speed of your app.Many useful values that may be desired from related resourcescan be found directly as attributes on the original resource.For the best performance, we recommend includingonly the relationships and metadata needed in the response.Detailed information for resource types and their available attributesand relationships can be found in the Apple Music API documentation.For more about extended attributes, relationships,and special relationships called views,watch the session “Explore the catalog with the Apple Music API.”Revisiting the relationships for the example playlist,the tracks for the playlist are automatically included,meaning the attribute metadata for the related track resourcesappear in the response.The attributes for the related tracks can be used to display a track listfor the playlist using their artwork and other metadatashown in the widget on the right.In the previous section, I showed an exampleof fetching a playlist resource from the catalog with its tracks.In this section, I'll explain how to handle relationshipswith a large number of resources.The related resources for a relationship appear in its data array.When the number of related resources is small,all of the resources will appear in a single response.Relationships with more related resources than appear in a single responsemust be fetched in multiple parts called pages.I'll use the tracks relationship for a large playlist as an example.Only the first 100 tracks of a playlist are included by default.If a playlist has more than 100 tracks,then the additional tracks must be fetched in subsequent pages.Here is an example response for a playlist with over 100 tracks.The href and resource collection data for the tracks relationship appearin the response as was seen earlier.Since this playlist has more tracks than were included in the response,a next location appears as a sibling to the data.The next location represents where the remaining resourcesin the collection can be fetched.Fetching the next location makes a direct relationship fetchand returns the relationship's resource collection datastarting from the provided offset.The default limit for the relationship will apply to each page.You may select your own page size by supplying a limit parameter.The page size limit can be between oneand the specific relationship's maximum page size,which can be found in the documentation.If the resource collection for the relationshipcontains additional resources past the ones returned in the page,a next location will continue to appear as a sibling to the data.When the resource collection is exhausted, a next location will not be present.Note that next locations do not reflect the selected page size for the request.You will need to supply a limit parameter on each request if you wishto use a different page size than the default.Always use the next location from the responseto page over resource collections.Trying to calculate your own offset can result in issueswith invalid locations or duplicate results.In the next section, I will show how to search fof contentin the Apple Music catalog using Apple Music API.Apple Music API provides functionality to find content in the catalogusing a search term.A search request resembles a catalog resource requestwith /search as the location and the search term as a parameter.You can specify which content types you're interested in with the types parameterand the maximum number of results to include for each type using a limit.When more results are found past the requested limit,pagination can be used to continue the search.Here's the response to a search for albums and songs with the term “pop."The search endpoint returns a response with a results object containing a groupfor each requested type with matching content.For this request, matches were found for albums and songs.The response also includes a meta object containing a recommended orderfor the result groups based on relevancy.This may be helpful if you're building a search experiencethat handles multiple content types at once.Each result group has and href where the results were fetched fromand a resource collection data array containing the matching resourcesof the relevant type for the search term.If more matches for a result group are available,the group will contain a next location where additional matches may be fetched.Requesting the next location returns more results for the selected typestarting from the offset.In the last section, I’ll discuss accessingpersonalized features in Apple Music API.Apple Music API and MusicKit provide accessto features personalized to a specific user.These features let you add support for subscribers to viewand search for content in their Apple Music library,including the ability to add content they enjoy and create new playlists.Personalized Recommendations can be surfacedbased on individual music tastes.And you can let people rediscover music they've been listening to recentlyto pick up where they left off or provide entirely new experiences.Personalized features are available for peoplewith an active subscription to Apple Music.To support these features, you must first authenticate the personwith your app using MusicKit and request permissionto access their music data.When permission is granted, a Music User Token will be available.This token is added to Apple Music API requests in the music-user-token headerand is used to authenticate access to personalized data.A Music User Token is specific to your app and the device the user authenticated on.This token must not be shared across devices,as permission is granted for a single device at a time.A token may become invalid based on changes to a person’s subscriptionor password, or if they revoke access to your app.It may also expire with time.Authentication can be refreshed by prompting them to sign back inand grant permission for your app.Note that this token is managed automatically by MusicKiton Apple platforms and MusicKit on the Web.Please see the documentation for the framework you're usingfor more details.In today's session, I showed how you can integrate Apple Musicinto your apps using MusicKit and Apple Music API,a quick look at the platforms with support for MusicKit client frameworks,and how to use Apple Music API to access and find content in the catalog,and some personalized features available for subscribers.For more on this year's updates to MusicKit on Apple platforms,check out the session "Explore more content with MusicKit.”Thank you for watching,and we hope you enjoy the rest of this year's WWDC.
