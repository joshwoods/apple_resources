So you're designing an app or featureand wondering whether AR makes sense for you.Here are a few things to consider.AR can help you deliver a true representation of things.To show what I mean,let's look at an example of something AR does really well,which is to present the real-world size of an object.Say you're trying to educate peopleabout how big a dinosaur is.You could just write it out,or show a picture,or you could unleash a virtual T. rex on the scene.In that case, there's no need to imaginehow big the dinosaur is.The AR experience gives the vieweran instant, visceral sense of scalein a way that's truly immersive.This example comes from the app Monster Park,a game that lets people explore and controlthe movement of animated three-dimensional dinosaurs.It's fitting that the entire apprevolves around this large-as-life AR experience,also emphasizing the creation of photos and videos for sharing.AR is at its most delightful when it affects and respondsto what's immediately around you,involving physical space in a meaningful way.Say you're trying to design an appthat helps with interior design, and you want to help peoplechoose a paint color for their walls.You could use swatches or stock photography,but those aren't very accurate.Even better, you could show someonehow their very own room would lookwith freshly painted walls.The Color Snap app does just that.It allows people to choose a paint colorand then tap a wall to preview the effect.Because it's AR, people can move aroundto see how the new color will affect their spacefrom different vantage points.Next, augmented reality allows you to create experiencesthat visualize virtual objects in 3D,which makes it easier to understand and evaluate them.With AR, you can build features that help people try on thingsin a way that's virtual yet realistic enoughfor someone to make a confident purchasing decision.For example, the Warby Parker applets people try on virtual glassesso they can place an order knowing exactlyhow their frames will fit.It's faster to switch between frame styles in ARthan it would be to swap glasses in real life.Grounding virtual objects in the sceneis also really important.The quality of lighting and shadows in your experiencescan have a huge impact on people's feelingthat things are really there,even when an object isn't very realistic.The IKEA Place app allows people to placea piece of virtual furniture in their homeand get a more accurate senseof what the updated room would look like.IKEA Place takes advantage of ARKit's built-in lightingfor realistic shadows that really settlethe virtual furniture into the room.Visualizing in 3D can refer to objects,but don't forget about using people's surroundingsas a canvas for your experiences.You can create new features with advanced visual effects,provide maps and 3D models that fit your brand,and even bring people's spaces into the game you're buildingwith iOS's new RoomPlan API.We've got a session on creating 3D room scansthat goes into detail about RoomPlanif you want to learn more.AR lets you streamline actionsby attaching digital capabilities to physical things,making your apps and features more efficient.You might have already experiencedhow using the real world as input can speed things upif you've ever scanned a code to order at a restaurant.You can use AR to build compact yet incredibly useful featuresthat save people time.In iOS's Measure App, centering the camera on a personautomatically displays her height in just the right spot.The experience feels lightweight because there's very little UI,the interaction is based on device movement,and the measurement information disappears after you've seen it.This AR experience would be too limited to offeras an app on its own, but it really complementsthe other capabilities of the Measure app.So, now you know you can use AR for your apps and featureswhen you want to deliver a true representation,involve physical space in a meaningful way,visualize in 3D, and streamline actionsby making use of what's in the environment.And as you can see, there are a lot of different waysto incorporate AR into the experiences you're creating,whether it's as the main focus of the appor with a lighter hand as a feature that reduces friction.So, you've decided AR is right for your purposesand now it's time to get started with design.When you're designing for AR,you'll need to consider some of the aspectsthat make it different than traditional 2D interfaces.AR is spatial.AR is movement-based.And AR is tied to the physical environment.You'll need to think about how to blend virtual elementsinto the scene, about ergonomics,and about working with a limited field of view.Now I'll go through tips you can keep in mindwhen designing AR experiences.People using your app might be in placesthat are difficult for AR,so what you can do to help is coach themthrough different ways to get to a better experience.The Mission to Mars app does a great jobof getting people set up for successwith a strong coaching sequence.Let's take a closer look at this example.As you're getting started,Mission to Mars highlights three different requirementsyou need in your environment to have a great session.First, there's a reminder that AR can be immersive,and it's wise to find a safe place to engage with it.This can be a particular concernfor experiences that involve wayfinding,where you'll need to take extra carenot to draw people's attention to the screenfor long periods of time.Next, the app suggests that AR performs beston surfaces with texture,rather than on glass or smooth white featureless planes.LiDAR can help overcomesome of these challenging environmental conditions,so you might be able to omit this suggestionfor some devices.And last, Mission to Mars advises peopleto find a bright space because AR works bestin environments that are properly lit.What's great about this coaching sequence is that it's quick,easy to navigate, and helps people understandhow to set up their environment for the best AR experience.The next tip is to take advantage of screen space.You'd be surprised how large a role it can playin AR experience design.So, what is screen space?Think of screen space as a 2D layerthat sits on top of the three-dimensional worldthat's captured by your camera view.It's best to place text and interactive elementslike buttons here in screen space,rather than in the 3D world of the camerato preserve legibility.Here's a great example from the Mission to Mars appthat illustrates how to handle text in screen space.High-contrast text and buttons sit in a 2D screen space layeron top of the 3D scene below.The text updates as the camera moves to help you understandhow it relates to the 3D objects in the scene.If you do need to lock your text to something in the world,try to keep it billboarded or parallel to the screenwhen possible.Focus on increasing contrast,bumping up type sizes and putting text on a backgroundso you can maintain accessibility.Design for constant movement.It's important that people understandhow and when to move their devices.Sometimes they'll need to move their bodies as wellin order to experience AR.Try to provide real-time feedbackwith visual effects and sound as people move,so that even if the action is taking place out of view,people can still connect with the experience.Use simple, glanceable instructions and animationsto coach people how to move.It helps to place instructions in screen spaceand to show them on an as-needed basis, rather than all up front.It's great to leverage the built-in coaching animations,but you can also create your own onboarding instructionsthat relate to your app,like this example from the app DoodleLensthat shows an iPhone panning back and forthin front of a doodle.Ergonomic considerations are really important for AR.It can be exhausting to hold your arm outfor long periods of time,and uncomfortable to reach for buttonsthat aren't positioned properly for one-handed use.Emphasize legibility at arm's length for the entire interface.Simplify interactions so that they can be completedwith minimal effort.Use oversized buttons with high-contrast iconsthat are easy to tap one-handed with a thumb.Here's a nice example at the bottom of the screenin DoodleLens.People are viewing AR experienceswith a limited field of viewoffered through a handheld device,so there's a good chance they might not be able to seethe full extent of something large.There's also a possibility that a virtual objectmight be located out of view.Allow people to adjust the scale of an object,in case they're not able to back up far enoughto see the whole thing.This example from AR Quick Lookuses a pinch gesture for direct manipulation.There's also a haptic so that you can feel itwhen you scale something past 100 percent.When something is out of view to the right or to the left,use sounds and haptics and provide simple indicatorsor text instructions in screen space.It can also be helpful to provide a mapor bird's-eye view showing someone's orientationand illustrating that the object is locatedin the opposite direction.In this example from the RoomPlan experience,the small 3D model drawing at the bottom of the viewhelps you preview your resultsand keep track of what has been scanned so far.It can be difficult for people peering through a screento understand the location of virtual objects in spaceunless they're behaving realistically.Depth cues that help people see how far away things arecan help with this.The size of objects, perspective effectslike diminishing towards the horizon,realistic shadows and lighting,the proper amount of detail in your textures,and overlapping objects create a feeling of depthand help people perceive spatial relationships.I want to highlight one depth cue that's tricky to work withbut can really help people understandwhere things are located relative to each other:overlapping, also known as occlusion.Here's an example of overlapping you can see in AR Quick Look.The virtual airplane seems like it's positionedbehind the wooden blocks on the deskbecause
