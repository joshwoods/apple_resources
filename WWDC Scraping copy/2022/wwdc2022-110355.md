But instead of creating paired tuples,it requires the bases to share the same element typeand merges the base AsyncSequencesinto one singular AsyncSequence of those elements.Merge works by taking the first element produced by anyof the sides when iterated.It keeps iterating until there are no more values that could be produced,specifically when all base AsyncSequences return nil from their iterator.If any of the bases produces an error, the other iterations are cancelled.This lets us take the AsyncSequences of messages and merge them.These combining algorithms work concurrently on when values are produced,but sometimes it is useful to actually interact with time itself.The Swift Async Algorithms package brings in a family of algorithmsto work with time by leveraging the new Clock API in Swift.Time itself can be a really complex subject,and new in Swift (5.7) are a set of APIsto make that safe and consistent:Clock, Instant, and Duration.The Clock protocol defines two primitives,a way to wake up after a given instantand a way to produce a concept of now.There are a few built in clocks.Two of the more common ones arethe ContinuousClock and the SuspendingClock.You can use the ContinuousClock to measure time just like a stopwatch,where time progresses no matter the state of the thing being measured.The SuspendingClock, on the other hand, does what its name implies;it suspends when the machine is put to sleep.We used the new clock API in our app to migrate from existing callback eventsto clock sleep function to handle dismissing alerts after a deadline.We were able to create the deadline by adding a duration valuethat indicated specifically the number of seconds we wanted to delay.Clock also has some handy methods to measure the elapsed durationof execution of work.Here we have those two common clocks I mentioned earlier,the SuspendingClock and ContinuousClock.Below are displays showingthe potential elapsed durationof work being measured.The key difference between these two clockscomes from its behavior when the machine is asleep.For long running work like these, the work can be paused,just as we did here,but when we resume the execution,the ContinuousClock has progressedwhile the machine was asleep,but the SuspendingClock did not.Commonly, this difference can be the key detailto make sure things like animations work as expectedby suspending the timing of the execution.If you need to interact with time in relation to the machine,like for animations, use the SuspendingClock.Measuring tasks in relation to the human in front of the deviceis better suited for the ContinuousClock.So if you need to delay by an absolute duration,something relative to humans, use the ContinuousClock.The Swift Async Algorithms package uses these new Clock, Instant,and Duration types to build generic algorithms for dealingwith many of the concepts of how events are processed with regards to time.In our messaging app, we found these really helpfulfor providing precise control over events.It let us rate limit interactions and efficiently buffer messages.Perhaps the most prominent area that we utilized timewas searching messages.We created a controller that manages a channel of results.The channel marshals search results from the search task back to our UI.The search task itself needed to have some specific characteristicswith regards to time.We wanted to make sure to rate limit searching sent messages on the server.The algorithm Debounce awaits a quiescence periodbefore it emits the next values when iterated.It means that events can come in fast, but we want to make sure to waitfor a quiet period before dealing with values.When user input from a search field is changed rapidly,we don't want the search controllerto fire off a search request for each change.Instead, we want to make sure to wait for a quiet periodwhen we're certain typing was likely to be done.By default, the Debounce algorithm will use the ContinuousClock.In this case, we can debounce the input such that it awaitsa specified duration while nothing has occurred.Clocks and durations are not just used for debouncing,but they're used for other algorithms too.One area that we found that was really usefulwas sending batches of messages to the server.In the Swift algorithms package,there's a set of algorithms to chunk values.The Swift Async Algorithms package offers those,but also adds a set of versionsthat interoperate with clocks and durations.The family of chunking algorithms allow for control over chunks by count,by time, or by content.If an error occurs in any of these, that error is rethrown,so our code is safe when it comes to failures.We used the "chunked(by:)" API to ensure that chunks of messagesare serialized and sent off by a certain elapsed duration.That way, our server gets efficient packets sent from the clients.We were able to use this API to build batches of messagesevery 500 milliseconds.That way, if someone's really excited and typing really fast,the requests sent to the server are grouped up.When working with collections and sequence,it's often useful and performant to lazily process elements.AsyncSequence works much like how the lazy algorithms workin the Swift standard library.But just like those lazy algorithms, there are often times where you needto move back into the world of collections.The Swift Async Algorithms package offers a set of initializersfor constructing collections using AsyncSequence.These let you build up dictionaries, sets, or arrayswith input AsyncSequences that are known to be finite.The collection initializers let us build in conversionsright into our initialization of messages and keep our data types as Array.This was really useful since we had numerous featuresthat really could use some updating to use Swift concurrency.And by keeping our existing data structures,we can migrate parts of our app incrementallyand where it makes sense.So far, we've just gone over just a handfulof the highlights of Swift Async Algorithms package.There are a whole lot morethan just what we've covered today.We have algorithms ranging from combining multiple AsyncSequences,rate limiting by time,breaking things into chunks,but those were just the highlights that we ended upusing extensively in our app.This package has a lot more than just those.It ranges from buffering,reducing, joining,to injecting values intermittently, and more.The Swift Async Algorithms package takes the set of algorithmsfor dealing with things over time and expands it to a wide rangeof advanced functionality that can help you in your apps.Try it out.We're really excited to discover what you build with these,and that excitement is shared.This package is being developed in the open with you.Thanks for watching, and enjoy the rest of the conference.♪ instrumental hip hop music ♪
