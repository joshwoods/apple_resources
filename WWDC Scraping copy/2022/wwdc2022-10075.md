Direct and reflect focus in SwiftUI

Search this video…♪ instrumental hip hop music ♪♪Welcome to "Use SwiftUI with AppKit."I'm Ian, an engineer working on Shortcuts.In macOS Monterey, Shortcuts came to macOS.Shortcuts uses a lot of SwiftUI on the Mac.SwiftUI helps customize the experience for the platform,while sharing common views with the appson iOS and watchOS.In this video, I'm going to showhow you can start adopting SwiftUI in your Mac app,by looking at some examples from Shortcuts.First, I'll show you an exampleof how to host SwiftUI views in your app,and then talk about how to pass databetween AppKit and SwiftUI.I'll also cover hosting SwiftUI viewsin the cells of a collection or table view,how to handle layout and sizing of SwiftUI viewswhen they are embedded in AppKit,how to make your SwiftUI views participatein the responder chain and be focusable,and, finally, how to host an AppKit view in SwiftUI.Alright, I'll start with how to host SwiftUI in AppKit.In Shortcuts,the main window contains an AppKit split view controllerand the sidebar on the left is written using SwiftUI.The sidebar view is implemented as a SwiftUI List,and the list shows sections with rows for all of the placesyou can navigate to in the app.The view keeps track of which item is selected,through the selected item binding.The possible items that can be selectedare represented as cases in the SidebarItem type.In this case, since there's a split view controller already.To host this sidebar view,we use a class from SwiftUI called NSHostingController.The SwiftUI sidebar view is passed inas the root view of that hosting controller.Since a hosting controller can be usedlike any other view controller,here, we configure it as a splitViewItemand add that to the splitViewController.Now the sidebar is hosted in the split view,but for it to work when the selection changes,the right side of the split view needs to show a different page.Currently, the selected item stateonly exists within SwiftUI.What we need to do is move that to a place that can be sharedbetween the split view and the sidebar.A good way to do this is to create a model objectthat can be stored outside of SwiftUI and contain the statethat needs to be shared.I'll call this object the SelectionModel.Now, the sidebar can still read and write the statein the SelectionModel.In code, the SelectionModel is a class that conformsto ObservableObject.Being an observable object lets SwiftUI reload the viewwhen the state stored in the model changes.It stores which sidebar item is currently selected.This property is published so that the SwiftUI sidebar viewcan update when the selected item changes.Whenever someone changes the selection in the sidebar,the model can show a new page in the detail view.Now that I've covered how to host SwiftUI in AppKit,let's move on to collection and table cells.When bringing Shortcuts from other platforms to macOS,there was already an iconic SwiftUI viewbuilt to display a shortcut in a collection view cellor a Home Screen widget.On macOS, these same views are displayed in the cellsof an NSCollectionView.In a collection or table view with lots of items,each cell view is recycled as you scroll,showing different content over time.To make sure the cell reuse is performant,you need to avoid adding and removing subviewsfrom the cells as the user scrolls.When displaying a SwiftUI view in each cell,use a single hosting view and update itwith a different root view when the cell's contentneeds to change.Here's all you need to build a collection view cellto host SwiftUI.In the example here,I'm building the cell that displays a shortcut view.Each cell contains an NSHostingView to host SwiftUI.Since cells are createdbefore they are configured with any content,this will start off as nil,and will be set the first timea shortcut is ready to be displayed.The displayShortcut method is called by the data sourcewhen configuring the cell to display a shortcut.This method creates a SwiftUI ShortcutView.Then, if there's already a hostingView,the rootView of that hostingView is set to the new view.Otherwise, if it's the first time,a newHostingView is created and addedas a subview of the cell.Here's the lifecycle of the cell that's hosting SwiftUI.First, the cell is initialized and it starts with no subviews,since there is not a shortcut to display yet.The first time displayShortcut is called,the hostingView is created with the shortcutView to display.This creates a SwiftUI view hierarchy,containing a VStack, an image, a spacer, and two text views.If this cell is then scrolled off screen,it will be potentially dequeued by the systemand need to show a different shortcut.When this happens, a new ShortcutView is createdand given to the HostingView.Since the HostingView was already displayinga different shortcut view,it will reuse the overall structure of the view,including the VStack and the spacer,and only update the image, text, and background that changed.Alright, next, let's talk about layout and sizing.Hosting controllers and hosting viewshave intrinsic sizesbased on the SwiftUI view's ideal width and height.SwiftUI automatically creates and updatesAuto Layout constraints, which the AppKit layout systemuses to size the view appropriately.Views are also flexible, meaning they supporta variety of sizes, between a minimum and a maximum.SwiftUI creates constraints for these as well.When embedding SwiftUI hosting views in your hierarchy,you should apply your own Auto Layout constraintsto the superview or to other adjacent views.Using the frame modifier or other SwiftUI layoutwill result in an update to the constraints that are created,such as overriding the width to be a fixed size.Since windows can be resized by the user,they have a minimum and a maximum size.When HostingViews are setas the top-level contentView of a window,SwiftUI will automatically update that window's minimumand maximum size based on the content being displayed.And this lets windows be resizableeither vertically, horizontally, or both,depending on the content.SwiftUI views, placed in hosting controllers,also are sized based on the content when presented modally.For example, you can easily place SwiftUI viewsinto an AppKit popover,by presenting a hosting controllerusing the popover presentation API on NSViewController,as shown here.You can also present SwiftUI views as sheets,using the presentAsSheet method.And finally, for a modal window,you can use the presentAsModalWindow methodto present a window that blocks interaction until closed.The window is sized to fit the content.In macOS Ventura, there are new APIson NSHostingView and NSHostingControllerthat allow you to customize the constraintsthat are automatically added.By default, hosting controllers and viewscreate constraints for the minimum size,intrinsic size, and maximum size.You may want to disable some of these for performance reasonsif you want the view to always be flexibly sized,or the constraints are already addedto surrounding views in AppKit.For hosting controllers,to let the ideal size of the viewdetermine the preferred content size,you can enable the preferredContentSize option.When you start adding SwiftUI views to your app,it's important that they take part in the responder chainand focus system just like other views in your app.In Shortcuts, our editor is implementedas a SwiftUI View.But the editor needs to handle menu bar commandsdefined in the main menu, which is implemented in AppKit.These commands include cut, copy, paste, and others.We implemented a few of our own custom menu items as well,for moving actions up and down.In AppKit, your view hierarchy makes up a chain of viewscalled "the responder chain."The focused responder is called the first responder.When a menu item is selected,the selector for that item is sent to the first responder.But if the first responderdoesn't respond to that selector,then the selector is sent to each next responder,until something handles the selector,or it reaches the app.The equivalent to the first responder in SwiftUIis the focused view.Focusable SwiftUI views can respond to keyboard inputand handle selectors sent to the responder chain.Some views like text fields are already focusable,but you can use the focusable modifierto make other views focusable too.SwiftUI has a few modifiers to handle common commands,such as copy, cut, and paste.These pass values in and out of the pasteboard,and it's an easy way to let people transfer datain and out of your app.The shortcuts editor uses the onMoveCommandand onExit command modifiers to handle the arrow keysand escape keys.The onCommand modifier can be used to handleany of the common selectors from AppKitor your own custom selectors defined in your app.Here, we handle the selectAll command from AppKitand the moveActionUp and moveActionDown commandsdefined in the Shortcuts app.When testing focus and keyboard navigability in your app,make sure to open Keyboard System Settingsand test with Full Keyboard Navigationturned both on and off,since many controls are only focusable when that's enabled.There's a lot more you can doto make your app work great with the keyboard.For example, there are APIs such as FocusStateand the focused modifierthat let you programmatically change which view is focused.To learn more about focus and the keyboard,you should go watchthe "Direct and reflect focus in SwiftUI" video.Finally, let's talk about hosting AppKit views in SwiftUI.There are some instanceswhere Shortcuts is hosting AppKit viewsinside of a SwiftUI layout,and you may need to host AppKit views, too,as you adopt SwiftUI in your app.One example is inside of the SwiftUI shortcuts editor,where there's an embedded AppleScript editor view,which is an AppKit controlshared with a few other system apps on macOS.SwiftUI provides two representable protocolsthat allow AppKit views and view controllersto be embedded within a SwiftUI view hierarchy.Like SwiftUI views,representables are descriptions for how to create and updateAppKit views.Since many classes in AppKit have delegates, observers,or rely on KVO or notifications to be observed,the protocols also include an optional coordinator objectthat you can implement to accompany your viewor view controller.Here's the lifecycle of the hosted objectand its coordinator.We start with the hosted view being initialized.This happens when the view is about to be displayedfor the first time.The first thing SwiftUI does during initializationis make the coordinator.This is optional, but you can define your own typeand return it from makeCoordinatorif you need it for delegation or state management.A single instance of the coordinatorwill stay around for the lifetime of the view.Second, either the makeNSViewor makeNSViewController method is called.This is where you describe to SwiftUIhow to create a new instance of your view.The context contains the coordinator that was just made,if any, so here's a good place to assign the coordinatoras the view's delegate or other type of observer.Once the view has been created,the update view method will be calledwhenever the SwiftUI state or environment changes.Here, it's your responsibility to update any propertiesor state stored in the AppKit viewto keep it in sync with the surrounding SwiftUI stateand environment.The update method can be called often,so the changes you make to the viewshould be as minimal as possible.You should check for what has changedand only reload the affected part of the viewwhen changes are made.When SwiftUI is done displaying the hosted view,it will be dismantled.The hosted view and coordinator will both be deallocated.Before these are deallocated, the representable protocolsgive you an optional method to implement,where you can clean up state if needed.Alright, now that you know the lifecycleand are familiar with the representable protocols,I'm going to show you how Shortcuts hoststhe custom script editor view in the app.The script editor is an NSView called ScriptEditorView.The code that's written in the editor can be accessedand modified through the sourceCode property,and the view can be disabledto prevent changes from being made.The script editor also has a delegate,which is notified any time someone modifiesthe source code.When hosting an AppKit view,first think about where the view will be placed in SwiftUI,and what data needs to be passed in and out.In Shortcuts, this view is placed into a container viewnext to the compile button.The compile button's handler needs to access the source codethat's entered into the view.The source code is stored in SwiftUIusing the State property wrapper.The representable will need to both readand write to this state.To build the representable,start by creating a type that conforms to NSViewRepresentable,since it will host an NSView.Add properties for each thing that needs to be configurablefrom SwiftUI.For the source code a binding is used,which will read and write the state stored in SwiftUI.The first method you need to implement is makeNSView.Here is where you describehow to create a new instance of the view,and where you should do any one-time setup that's required.Here, the delegate is set to the coordinator.I'll talk about the coordinator more in a bit.Next, implement updateNSView.This will be called when either the sourceCode changes,or when the SwiftUI environment changes.Since the script editor does a bunch of workwhen the sourceCode property is set,we compare the value already in the view,and only set the property if it changesto avoid unnecessary work.The context passed to updateNSViewcontains the SwiftUI environment.The isEnabled environment keyis passed to the isEditable property on the script editor,so editing is disabledif the rest of the SwiftUI view hierarchy is.Whenever someone modifies the source code in the view,the source code binding needs to capture the new value.To do this, we'll build a coordinatorthat conforms to the ScriptEditorViewDelegate.The coordinator will store the representable value,which contains the source code binding that it needs to update.And in the sourceCodeDidChange method,the binding is set to the new string valuefrom the view.Finally, we need to tell the SwiftUI representablehow to make and update the coordinator.First, you need to implement the makeCoordinator methodto create a new coordinator.Coordinators have the same lifetime as the hosted view,and like hosted views,properties you add to the coordinatorneed to remain up to date as the representable changes.Since updateNSView is calledwhen the values stored in the representable change,here, the representable property on the coordinator is updated.Now that you know how to add AppKit into SwiftUI,and also add SwiftUI into AppKit,you should start integrating SwiftUI into your app.A great place to start is in your sidebar,or table and collection view cells.Make sure your views are sizing themselves correctlyand handling common commands and focus.Thanks for your time,and I can't wait to see what you build♪

♪ instrumental hip hop music ♪♪Welcome to "Use SwiftUI with AppKit."I'm Ian, an engineer working on Shortcuts.

In macOS Monterey, Shortcuts came to macOS.

Shortcuts uses a lot of SwiftUI on the Mac.

SwiftUI helps customize the experience for the platform,while sharing common views with the appson iOS and watchOS.

In this video, I'm going to showhow you can start adopting SwiftUI in your Mac app,by looking at some examples from Shortcuts.

First, I'll show you an exampleof how to host SwiftUI views in your app,and then talk about how to pass databetween AppKit and SwiftUI.

I'll also cover hosting SwiftUI viewsin the cells of a collection or table view,how to handle layout and sizing of SwiftUI viewswhen they are embedded in AppKit,how to make your SwiftUI views participatein the responder chain and be focusable,and, finally, how to host an AppKit view in SwiftUI.

Alright, I'll start with how to host SwiftUI in AppKit.

In Shortcuts,the main window contains an AppKit split view controllerand the sidebar on the left is written using SwiftUI.

The sidebar view is implemented as a SwiftUI List,and the list shows sections with rows for all of the placesyou can navigate to in the app.

The view keeps track of which item is selected,through the selected item binding.

The possible items that can be selectedare represented as cases in the SidebarItem type.

In this case, since there's a split view controller already.

To host this sidebar view,we use a class from SwiftUI called NSHostingController.

The SwiftUI sidebar view is passed inas the root view of that hosting controller.

Since a hosting controller can be usedlike any other view controller,here, we configure it as a splitViewItemand add that to the splitViewController.

Now the sidebar is hosted in the split view,but for it to work when the selection changes,the right side of the split view needs to show a different page.

Currently, the selected item stateonly exists within SwiftUI.

What we need to do is move that to a place that can be sharedbetween the split view and the sidebar.

A good way to do this is to create a model objectthat can be stored outside of SwiftUI and contain the statethat needs to be shared.

I'll call this object the SelectionModel.

Now, the sidebar can still read and write the statein the SelectionModel.

In code, the SelectionModel is a class that conformsto ObservableObject.

Being an observable object lets SwiftUI reload the viewwhen the state stored in the model changes.

It stores which sidebar item is currently selected.

This property is published so that the SwiftUI sidebar viewcan update when the selected item changes.

Whenever someone changes the selection in the sidebar,the model can show a new page in the detail view.

Now that I've covered how to host SwiftUI in AppKit,let's move on to collection and table cells.

When bringing Shortcuts from other platforms to macOS,there was already an iconic SwiftUI viewbuilt to display a shortcut in a collection view cellor a Home Screen widget.

On macOS, these same views are displayed in the cellsof an NSCollectionView.

In a collection or table view with lots of items,each cell view is recycled as you scroll,showing different content over time.

To make sure the cell reuse is performant,you need to avoid adding and removing subviewsfrom the cells as the user scrolls.

When displaying a SwiftUI view in each cell,use a single hosting view and update itwith a different root view when the cell's contentneeds to change.

Here's all you need to build a collection view cellto host SwiftUI.

In the example here,I'm building the cell that displays a shortcut view.

Each cell contains an NSHostingView to host SwiftUI.

Since cells are createdbefore they are configured with any content,this will start off as nil,and will be set the first timea shortcut is ready to be displayed.

The displayShortcut method is called by the data sourcewhen configuring the cell to display a shortcut.

This method creates a SwiftUI ShortcutView.

Then, if there's already a hostingView,the rootView of that hostingView is set to the new view.

Otherwise, if it's the first time,a newHostingView is created and addedas a subview of the cell.

Here's the lifecycle of the cell that's hosting SwiftUI.

First, the cell is initialized and it starts with no subviews,since there is not a shortcut to display yet.

The first time displayShortcut is called,the hostingView is created with the shortcutView to display.

This creates a SwiftUI view hierarchy,containing a VStack, an image, a spacer, and two text views.

If this cell is then scrolled off screen,it will be potentially dequeued by the systemand need to show a different shortcut.

When this happens, a new ShortcutView is createdand given to the HostingView.

Since the HostingView was already displayinga different shortcut view,it will reuse the overall structure of the view,including the VStack and the spacer,and only update the image, text, and background that changed.

Alright, next, let's talk about layout and sizing.

Hosting controllers and hosting viewshave intrinsic sizesbased on the SwiftUI view's ideal width and height.

SwiftUI automatically creates and updatesAuto Layout constraints, which the AppKit layout systemuses to size the view appropriately.

Views are also flexible, meaning they supporta variety of sizes, between a minimum and a maximum.

SwiftUI creates constraints for these as well.

When embedding SwiftUI hosting views in your hierarchy,you should apply your own Auto Layout constraintsto the superview or to other adjacent views.

Using the frame modifier or other SwiftUI layoutwill result in an update to the constraints that are created,such as overriding the width to be a fixed size.

Since windows can be resized by the user,they have a minimum and a maximum size.

When HostingViews are setas the top-level contentView of a window,SwiftUI will automatically update that window's minimumand maximum size based on the content being displayed.

And this lets windows be resizableeither vertically, horizontally, or both,depending on the content.

SwiftUI views, placed in hosting controllers,also are sized based on the content when presented modally.

For example, you can easily place SwiftUI viewsinto an AppKit popover,by presenting a hosting controllerusing the popover presentation API on NSViewController,as shown here.

You can also present SwiftUI views as sheets,using the presentAsSheet method.

And finally, for a modal window,you can use the presentAsModalWindow methodto present a window that blocks interaction until closed.

The window is sized to fit the content.

In macOS Ventura, there are new APIson NSHostingView and NSHostingControllerthat allow you to customize the constraintsthat are automatically added.

By default, hosting controllers and viewscreate constraints for the minimum size,intrinsic size, and maximum size.

You may want to disable some of these for performance reasonsif you want the view to always be flexibly sized,or the constraints are already addedto surrounding views in AppKit.

For hosting controllers,to let the ideal size of the viewdetermine the preferred content size,you can enable the preferredContentSize option.

When you start adding SwiftUI views to your app,it's important that they take part in the responder chainand focus system just like other views in your app.

In Shortcuts, our editor is implementedas a SwiftUI View.

But the editor needs to handle menu bar commandsdefined in the main menu, which is implemented in AppKit.

These commands include cut, copy, paste, and others.

We implemented a few of our own custom menu items as well,for moving actions up and down.

In AppKit, your view hierarchy makes up a chain of viewscalled "the responder chain."The focused responder is called the first responder.

When a menu item is selected,the selector for that item is sent to the first responder.

But if the first responderdoesn't respond to that selector,then the selector is sent to each next responder,until something handles the selector,or it reaches the app.

The equivalent to the first responder in SwiftUIis the focused view.

Focusable SwiftUI views can respond to keyboard inputand handle selectors sent to the responder chain.

Some views like text fields are already focusable,but you can use the focusable modifierto make other views focusable too.

SwiftUI has a few modifiers to handle common commands,such as copy, cut, and paste.

These pass values in and out of the pasteboard,and it's an easy way to let people transfer datain and out of your app.

The shortcuts editor uses the onMoveCommandand onExit command modifiers to handle the arrow keysand escape keys.

The onCommand modifier can be used to handleany of the common selectors from AppKitor your own custom selectors defined in your app.

Here, we handle the selectAll command from AppKitand the moveActionUp and moveActionDown commandsdefined in the Shortcuts app.

When testing focus and keyboard navigability in your app,make sure to open Keyboard System Settingsand test with Full Keyboard Navigationturned both on and off,since many controls are only focusable when that's enabled.

There's a lot more you can doto make your app work great with the keyboard.

For example, there are APIs such as FocusStateand the focused modifierthat let you programmatically change which view is focused.

To learn more about focus and the keyboard,you should go watchthe "Direct and reflect focus in SwiftUI" video.

Finally, let's talk about hosting AppKit views in SwiftUI.

There are some instanceswhere Shortcuts is hosting AppKit viewsinside of a SwiftUI layout,and you may need to host AppKit views, too,as you adopt SwiftUI in your app.

One example is inside of the SwiftUI shortcuts editor,where there's an embedded AppleScript editor view,which is an AppKit controlshared with a few other system apps on macOS.

SwiftUI provides two representable protocolsthat allow AppKit views and view controllersto be embedded within a SwiftUI view hierarchy.

Like SwiftUI views,representables are descriptions for how to create and updateAppKit views.

Since many classes in AppKit have delegates, observers,or rely on KVO or notifications to be observed,the protocols also include an optional coordinator objectthat you can implement to accompany your viewor view controller.

Here's the lifecycle of the hosted objectand its coordinator.

We start with the hosted view being initialized.

This happens when the view is about to be displayedfor the first time.

The first thing SwiftUI does during initializationis make the coordinator.

This is optional, but you can define your own typeand return it from makeCoordinatorif you need it for delegation or state management.

A single instance of the coordinatorwill stay around for the lifetime of the view.

Second, either the makeNSViewor makeNSViewController method is called.

This is where you describe to SwiftUIhow to create a new instance of your view.

The context contains the coordinator that was just made,if any, so here's a good place to assign the coordinatoras the view's delegate or other type of observer.

Once the view has been created,the update view method will be calledwhenever the SwiftUI state or environment changes.

Here, it's your responsibility to update any propertiesor state stored in the AppKit viewto keep it in sync with the surrounding SwiftUI stateand environment.

The update method can be called often,so the changes you make to the viewshould be as minimal as possible.

You should check for what has changedand only reload the affected part of the viewwhen changes are made.

When SwiftUI is done displaying the hosted view,it will be dismantled.

The hosted view and coordinator will both be deallocated.

Before these are deallocated, the representable protocolsgive you an optional method to implement,where you can clean up state if needed.

Alright, now that you know the lifecycleand are familiar with the representable protocols,I'm going to show you how Shortcuts hoststhe custom script editor view in the app.

The script editor is an NSView called ScriptEditorView.

The code that's written in the editor can be accessedand modified through the sourceCode property,and the view can be disabledto prevent changes from being made.

The script editor also has a delegate,which is notified any time someone modifiesthe source code.

When hosting an AppKit view,first think about where the view will be placed in SwiftUI,and what data needs to be passed in and out.

In Shortcuts, this view is placed into a container viewnext to the compile button.

The compile button's handler needs to access the source codethat's entered into the view.

The source code is stored in SwiftUIusing the State property wrapper.

The representable will need to both readand write to this state.

To build the representable,start by creating a type that conforms to NSViewRepresentable,since it will host an NSView.

Add properties for each thing that needs to be configurablefrom SwiftUI.

For the source code a binding is used,which will read and write the state stored in SwiftUI.

The first method you need to implement is makeNSView.

Here is where you describehow to create a new instance of the view,and where you should do any one-time setup that's required.

Here, the delegate is set to the coordinator.

I'll talk about the coordinator more in a bit.

Next, implement updateNSView.

This will be called when either the sourceCode changes,or when the SwiftUI environment changes.

Since the script editor does a bunch of workwhen the sourceCode property is set,we compare the value already in the view,and only set the property if it changesto avoid unnecessary work.

The context passed to updateNSViewcontains the SwiftUI environment.

The isEnabled environment keyis passed to the isEditable property on the script editor,so editing is disabledif the rest of the SwiftUI view hierarchy is.

Whenever someone modifies the source code in the view,the source code binding needs to capture the new value.

To do this, we'll build a coordinatorthat conforms to the ScriptEditorViewDelegate.

The coordinator will store the representable value,which contains the source code binding that it needs to update.

And in the sourceCodeDidChange method,the binding is set to the new string valuefrom the view.

Finally, we need to tell the SwiftUI representablehow to make and update the coordinator.

First, you need to implement the makeCoordinator methodto create a new coordinator.

Coordinators have the same lifetime as the hosted view,and like hosted views,properties you add to the coordinatorneed to remain up to date as the representable changes.

Since updateNSView is calledwhen the values stored in the representable change,here, the representable property on the coordinator is updated.

Now that you know how to add AppKit into SwiftUI,and also add SwiftUI into AppKit,you should start integrating SwiftUI into your app.

A great place to start is in your sidebar,or table and collection view cells.

Make sure your views are sizing themselves correctlyand handling common commands and focus.
